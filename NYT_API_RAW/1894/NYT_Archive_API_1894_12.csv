"-- Frederick Warde's New Play. -- In ""Runnymede,"" the new play written for Frederick Warde, the author, William Greer Harrison treats Robin Hood's band not as outlaws, but as loyal subjects of Richard Coeur de Lion, in opposition to John of Anjou. The story is based on the attempts of John to destroy Robin and to gain possession of Marian Lea, Robin's affianced toride.
