Its main drift is to urge the policy of terminating what little there is left of the controversy concerning Slavery in the Territories, and of rallying around the Administration all who are devoted to the Union and the Constitution, and especially to aid those who are struggling in the Border States against the attempt to drag them into the new Confederacy. In this way Mr. RAYMOND thinks the Border States may be retained in the Union, which is the first step towards a reorganization of the Confederacy and the restoration of our old relations. After that has been accomplished, he thinks that Louisiana would speedily be revolutionized, -- that the Union-men would secure control of her affairs, and repeal the ordinance of secession: -- that Mississippi would soon follow this example, and that thus one after another the people of the Gulf States, under the pressure of heavy taxation, the lack of postal facilities, a poor and unprofitable commerce, the increasing discontent of all classes and the general lack of incentives and stimulants to public action, would reverse the policy now adopted and resume their allegiance to the Federal Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLICY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POLICY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/20b812f3-ddce-5d72-a2b2-5415ff75ff09,327,nyt://article/20b812f3-ddce-5d72-a2b2-5415ff75ff09

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/01/archives/position-and-policy-of-the-republican-party-remarks-of-mr-hj.html,,"Mr. RAYMOND was introduced to the meeting by SIMEON DRAPER, Esq., President of the Club, in some very complimentary remarks and, after the applause which greeted his appearance had subsided, he went on to say, that his object in coming to the meeting was not to deliver an ""address,"" as he had been advertised to do, but merely to join with Republicans in rejoicing over the victory they had achieved, -- the most signal and important, in his judgment, which the political annals of the country had ever witnessed. It has been achieved, moreover, said Mr. R., after a comparatively brief struggle -- since the Republican Party, as a distinct national organization, was only five years old on WASHINGTON'S last birthday. Its first National Convention was held on the 22d of February, 1856, at Pittsburgh, and then for the first time the party put forth its programme of purposes and principles. The Address then issued vindicated at length the necessity which political emergencies had created for the formation of a new party, and set forth very clearly the specific reform which it proposed to effect in the administration of the National Government. The necessity for the new party grew out of the fact, which was open to the observation of all, that ""the Government of the United States,"" to use the words of that Address, ""had ceased to be administered in accordance with the Constitution, or for the preservation and prosperity of the American Union; -- but that its powers were systematically wielded for the promotion and extension of the interest of Slavery, in direct hostility to the letter and spirit of the Constitution, in flagrant disregard of other great interests of the country, and in open contempt of the public sentiment of the American people and of the Christian world."" That Convention further proclaimed its belief that unless the policy which then controlled the Government of the United States could be arrested by the interposition of the People, ""the hold of the Union upon their loyalty and affection would be relaxed, the domestic tranquillity would be disturbed, and all constitutional securities for the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity would be destroyed."" This was the great fact which made the organization of the Republican Party necessary. The Slaveholding interest had obtained complete control of the Government; not by its own power, but by its alliances with other political parties. It controlled their policy, and thus ruled the country. No man could be appointed to office unless he believed that Slavery was right. No national policy or any subject could be adopted if it threatened in the least to interfere with the permanent interest of Slavery. A ban of proscription rested upon every man, North or South, who was not ready to prostrate himself at the shrine of this new divinity. And the aim of the Republican Party was to ""determine whether Slavery should continue to be the paramount and controlling influence in the Federal Administration, or whether other rights and other interests shall resume the degree of consideration to which they are entitled."" That battle has been fought, -- and has ended in victory, -- a victory which challenges the attention of the world, -- a victory whose importance no words can exaggerate. The Slave Power, as a controlling element in our national politics, has been dethroned. We have delivered our Government from the tyrannical ascendancy of this foul usurper, and if we use our victory wisely, its verdict can never be reversed, -- the Slave Power can never regain that supremacy in our national councils from which it has been expelled. [Applause.] This is a victory worthy of exultation. It is worth all it has cost, and all it is likely to cost, whatever that maybe. [Loud applause.] We have at last a government resting upon that broad, democratic, constitutional basis, the will of the people, -- free to consult all the interests of the people, -- and to use all the powers which the people give it to promote justice, enlarge the foundations of liberty, and secure the prosperity of ourselves and our posterity for all time to come.

"Edward Butler, Felix Brennan, William Brennan, Patrick Cassiday, James McCahey, and James Ward, were yesterday apprehended by Detectives Farley and Eustace, charged with having committed a series of extensive robberies on board the steamships of the New-York and Philadelphia and Liverpool line of steamers. These men were engaged as stevedores at the Company's Pier, No. 44 North River, to load and unload freight. During the past year frequent complatin has been made by Liverpool consignees, that packages shipped to them were broken open and portions of their contents abstracted. Recently a case of watch movements, valued at $1,250, shipped by the steamship Vigo, was so despoiled, and on information being received here of that fact, the above Detectives were engaged to ferret out the perpetrators. Their investigations led them to suspect the persons whose names are mentioned above, and they were accordingly taken into custody. On searching the apartments occupied by them a large amount of jewelry, cutlery, dry-goods, &c, was found, all of which was doubtless taken from the steamers of that line. The watch movements were subsequently traced to a jeweler in Houston-street, who had bought them of the stevedores without a guilty knowledge. On being confronted with the prisoners the jeweler identified Butler as the one of whom he bought the property, while the others were recognized as his companions at the time the purchase was made. The stevedores being thus cornered, confessed their guilt, and acknowledged that the property thus stolen by them during the year past would amount to several thousand dollars. Their plan was to transform themselves into ""baggage smashers,"" and break open the cases of freight while stowing them away in the hold of the vessels, secreting their plunder about their persons.

Mrs. ABRAHAM BININGER, the First Directress presided. Prayer was offered by Rev. JOH COTTON SMITH, who was followed by Rev. Mr. HERRICK and other ministers in the reading of Scripture, and addresses. The Secretary's report was then read, and was most interesting, It contained some discouraging features, especially in the withdrawal of the First Directress to the Nursery; also, in the resignation of several members of the Board of Physicians, who had been for a long time, attendant upon the sick. Notwithstanding these discouragements, however, the children were healthier than ever they were known to be since the opening of the Institution. Contagious disease has been almost excluded. One hundred and twenty-five women and 337 children have been admitted during the past year. 43 women have been furnished with situations as nurses. The present number of inmates is: Children 126, nurses 20, employes 18, total 173. The report proceeds to state that ""it is perhaps little known to the public that, in addition to the infants that are sheltered from harsh usage and neglect, the number of growing children is seldom less than 40. These children are subjected to the kindest and most judicious training; not only are their bodies cared for, healthful nourishment, cleanliness and warm clothing provided for them, but they are under the constant supervision of resident teachers.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/02/archives/the-west-and-south.html,,"We have just at this time two social and political pictures presented for our contemplation, each of which may be studied with profit by every reflecting mind. One is in the South, the other in the Far West. As we penetrate into the former, the prospect becomes more dark and threatening, until at length the eye becomes weary with the gloom and confusion. The other becomes brighter as the eye traces beyond the foreground, and glimpses are got of a happy and industrious people, strong in their love of the Union, and everywhere laying the foundations of future wealth and greatness. That of the South presents us, just at this time, with a number of delirious men, perfectly conscious, not of yielding to a confessed weakness in their political system, but of wilfully misusing power, and committing a great wrong, simply because they had resolved to do it. Pride and fear, the two most dangerous offsprings of Slavery, find these men struggling with a despotism they will not ameliorate, and the downfall of which they blindly attempt to hasten, though it bring poverty and distress upon the whole people. There is nothing which so distinctly marks the boundaries between Freedom and Slavery as the peace, prosperity and intelligence seen on one side, and the poverty and confusion on the other. The line is as distinctly drawn as between Virtue and Vice. Freedom is progressive, Slavery retrogressive. The one represents those fearful inequalities of rank which take from the masses their rights, and give the wealth of the country to a few; which doom multitudes of our race, without fault of theirs, to hopeless, merciless suffering; sets their highest rights at defiance, denies their most sacred relations, lacerates their affections, and consigns them to a degradation on a level with the animal.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The West and South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The West and South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-03-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aea9a077-716c-5033-8824-ed2866163f55,1479,nyt://article/aea9a077-716c-5033-8824-ed2866163f55

But in their very nature, railroads in city streets are essentially monopolies, the only means of establishing a partial rivalry being the authorization of lines in parallel thoroughfares ; a measure not always expedient, tending as it frequently does to augment the very evil from which we would fain escape. Hence the extreme caution with which concessions of the sort, unguarded by every conceivable guarantee of the public interest, should be made; or, if made, the absolute charity which every popular demand for protection against encroaching corporations should receive at the hands of the Legislature.

The great event to which so many have been looking forward with anxiety which has excited the hopes and fears of the country to an extent unparalleled in its comparatively brief history will take place to-day. ABRAHAM LINCOLN is to be inaugurated as President of the United States. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/04/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The great event to which so many have been looking forward with anxiety -- which has excited the hopes and fears of the country to an extent unparalleled in its comparatively brief history -- will take place to-day. ABRAHAM LINCOLN is to be inaugurated as President of the United States. The occasion has drawn to the Federal Capital a greater crowd, probably, than has ever been assembled there on any similar occasion. The hotels, our correspondent informs us, are filled to overflowing, and thousands, last evening, were seeking private accommodations. Whether the ceremonies will be marred by any untoward event, is, of course, a matter of conjecture, though grave fears are expressed on the subject. Mr. LINCOLN himself, however, it is understood, entertains no apprehensions, but believes that the measures which have been taken to preserve the decorum of the occasion will be amply sufficient. On Saturday evening the last great struggle over the Cabinet appointments took place. The conflicting powers were gathered at the rooms of the President elect, and he listened to the arguments urged by each in turn. The result was a resolution on his part to retain those gentlemen already fixed upon, and whose names have already appeared in the TIMES -- though possibly the distribution of positions may be slightly varied. The greatest contention seems to have been in reference to Ex-Governor CHASE, of Ohio, and the most strenuous opposition to his confirmation by the Senate is anticipated. On Saturday night, also, Mr. LINCOLN concluded his Inaugural Address, and submitted it to the inspection of Mr. SEWARD -- who, it is understood, found very few amendments to suggest. The character of the document is stated to be very positive and matter-of-fact, and treats the subject of the national difficulties very much as has been anticipated by the friends of the new Administration.

The house on Monday, when ""Un Bailo"" was played for the last time, was very fine; on Wednesday, when Miss KELLOGG made her debut, it was from fair to middling; on Friday, when ""Don Giovanni"" was done, it was positively bad. This is the record in New-York. In Brooklyn, two performances -- one on Tuesday, (""I Puritani,"") the other on Saturday, (""Don Giovanni,"") have been given. The house, on both occasions, was but partly filled. A brilliant matinee, on Saturday, at the Fourteenth-street establishment, fortunately brought the week to a profitable end. On the whole, however, it has been the least satisfactory of the season, both in a pecuniary and artistic point of view. The performance of ""Don Giovanni"" was not what it ought to have been; even the admirers of Miss HINKLEY were unable to appreciate it, for the character of Zerlina is certainly beyond that lady's powers.To Miss KELLOGG then, we are indebted for the only real feature of the week. Critics seem to be divided about this lady's merits; but that she made a great success is not disputed. The future alone will determine whether she is destined to occupy a prominent place before our public. We confess that we see no reason why she should not. To-night VERDI's new opera will resume its place on the bills, and a large and fashionable audience may be expected. It is unquestionably a favorite with the operatic portion of our public.

"ESCAPE OF AN ALLEGED FUGITIVE SLAVE. -- As the steamship Yorktown was about sailing from her pier, No. 13, North River, for Virginia, on Saturday afternoon, a carriage drove on to the wharf, containing an alleged fugitive slave named JOHN POLHEMUS, in custody of two Deputy United States Marshals. On alighting from the carriage, the negro appeared disinclined to embark on board the steamer, and his unwillingness assumed a more determined form when the Marshals resorted to force.

Responsive to the cries, a large crowd soon collected on the wharf, among whom was a policeman named ARMSTRONG, who interfered in behalf of the negro, and asked the Marshals to produce their authority for the proceeding in which they were engaged. They had left the papers behind them, and while one of them was gone after the documents, the negro escaped from the custody of the other Marshal and ran away.

The ceremonies were similar in detail to those which have taken place at former inaugurations, and were carried out with precision and promptness. The arrangements for the suppression of any unwelcome demonstrations were most perfect, thanks to the foresight of Gen. SCOTT and the efficiency of the police -- and from first to last no token of disrespect to the new President was exhibited. The scene at the East Portico of the Capitol, when the Inaugural Address was delivered, was grand and impressive. When Mr. LINCOLN made his appearance before the assembled thousands, he was greeted with a burst of applause which must have gladdened his heart, and as he proceeded with his Address, he was frequently interrupted with marked demonstrations of approbation. Every reader of the TIMES will, of course, peruse this important document for himself. Its effect in Washington, our correspondent informs us, was extremely good. At the conclusion of its delivery, the venerable Chief Justice TANEY administered the oath of office to the new President, and the ceremonies at the Capital concluded. Subsequently he was conducted to the White House by Mr. BUCHANAN, who there took leave of him. The Diplomatic Corps were then introduced, and after them the public, who flowed in in a great stream for a time, congratulating the new President and themselves on the auspicious termination of the day's proceedings And the Inauguration was complete.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-03-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e5da645-7eb4-5795-a4f1-9107daed681d,1478,nyt://article/4e5da645-7eb4-5795-a4f1-9107daed681d

Men of every political complexion, who love the Union, and give credit to the honest purpose of the new Chief Magistrate to sustain it, were not less ready to express their gratification that the day had come when the fact that we have a Government should be known and felt. The morning papers were in great demand, and those whose Washington dispatches were known to be most reliable and full were especially sought after. The intimations found therein of the probable tone of the Message and of the preparations for the inaugural ceremonies, were the subject of frequent comment; but there were few wagers lost and won upon the probabilities of the position which the President would assume. There seemed to be very little difference of opinion among the many as to the view that Mr. LINCOLN would express of his obligation to execute the laws; for the express stipulation of his oath of office, it was well known, is that he shall do just this. It seemed to be the prevailing opinion that ""Old ABE"" was a square-toed man, and would neither shrink from indicating clearly what he believed to be the path of his duty, nor from following it without deviation to the end. Still there was great curiosity among all classes to see the message itself, and read word for word the protocol of the President's address.

Coming from such a venerable person, Dr. OSGOOD thought it was worthy of preservation in the archives of the Society. An amphora, brought from Alexandria by Capt. SIMPSON, was also presented, as likewise was a curious pitcher that was said to have belonged to WASHINGTON, made in England during the first year of his administration, and which was ornamented with an admirable likeness of the Great Father of his Country. Several of these pitchers were made at that time, but that presented to the Society last night is believed to be the only perfect specimen in existence.

"Mr. William Houseman, of Staten Island, appeared in the Mayor's Office, yesterday, and complained that he had been swindled by some Peter Funk, at No. 100 Broadway. He stated that he came up to the City for the purpose of purchasing iron, and passing up Broadway was induced to enter the mock auction shop by the very low prices at which watches were being sold. Nevertheless he did not bid readily, and one of the Funks, fearing they might lose him, pretended to be anxious to purchase -- represented to Mr. Houseman that he was $8 short of the purchase money, and that if he would oblige him with that amount he would return it and pay for the use of it as soon as he obtained the watch.

"The publishing season, of 1861 may be said to be fairly inaugurated by the appearance of Mr. MOTLEY's History of the United Netherlands, from Messrs. HARPERS' Press. Few books of the same solid character have attracted so much attention since Lord MACAULAY's writings, and both here and in England the public demand outran the expectations of the publishers. Mr. MURRAY's first edition of 2,500 copies was all taken up preliminary to the appearance of the work, and Messrs. HARPERS find that two -- almost simultaneous -- issues of 3,500 copies each are barely sufficient for present need. The copyright paid Mr. MOTLEY in this country is said to be the highest yet known in the annals of the book trade. American purchasers have a decided advantage over the English as regards price -- the two volumes selling here for four dollars, which command in London seven dollars and a half, or L1 10s. sterling. Though the cost and style of manufacture may have something to do with this difference, it is mainly owing to the various habits of book buying which prevail in the two countries; here every one who takes an interest in the book buys his copy, and would not be content with a borrowed one; there mingle the artificial system by which books are forced up to an irrational price. No man of moderate income thinks of making such a purchase, but depends on Mr. MUDIE's gigantic circulating library for the gratification of his taste.

Mr. GOUGH is one of the most popular and attractive speakers whom our citizens ever have an opportunity of hearing, -- and the excellent object to be aided by this lecture will unquestionably augment still further the number of his hearers on this occasion. The Library, we are glad to know, is in a very flourishing condition, and is fully vindicating, by its already extended and increasing usefulness, the efforts which led to its establishment.

Indeed, so far as Fort sumpter is concerned, it may have been decided already. One dispatch states that there is a strong probability that an evacuation will soon take place, while the general character of all our intelligence relative to the subject leads us to the conclusion that some definite action may be expected immediately. The question has no doubt been anxiously discussed, and the opinions of prominent military men have been sought, with a view or arriving at a proper determination. Gen. SCOTT is understood to hold the opinion that reinforcements could not now be thrown into Sumpter without an immense loss of life, and that the military and naval force at the immediate command of the Government would not be sufficient to accomplish that object. Under these circumstances, and in view of the fact that an attempt to reinforce that or any other garrison would have the effect of concentrating the sentiment of the South against the Government, it is the general impression in Washington that all the troops will be withdrawn, with the exception of a Corporal and two men, who will be left in charge, with the American flag flying; still leaving the South Carolinians the task of ""capturing"" the fort, which they will then probably have force sufficient to do.

Less a dramatist than a manafacturer of comedies, vaudevilles and opera librettos, SCRIBE produced, in the fifty years of his professional life, more material for the theatrical amusement of France, and all the rest of the world, than any ten others in his line of business; for with him it was a mere business -- its operation mechanical, and its object money. More than four hundred plays are ascribed to his pen, and for the concoction of these he had a veritable factory, where he employed the services of such journeymen and apprentices as in France are elegantly denominated collaborateurs; indeed, this collaborating system was inaugurated by SCRIBE, and ALEXANDRE DUMAS owes him a monument. Among the clever workmen in this great playmaker's shop were such handy fellows as CASSIMIR DELAVIGNE, MELLESVILLE, BRAZIER, CARMOUCHE, DUPIN, VARNER and BAYARD. Each had his specialty -- this for the idea, that for the plot, another for the dialogue, still another for the verses -- so that a vaudeville, such as should set all Paris in a roar, in passing through the pens of these gentlemen, went through almost as many processes as a pin. Then there was the incalculable SCRIBE, full of expertness and industry, overseeing all, directing all, adding here a quaint character, there a bewildering situation, in another place a sparkling epigram -- all point and surprise; and the end that crowned the work was the honesty (for which M.

With the assistance of the police the names were extinguished, but not until considerable progress had been made in the destruction of the stairs. Damage to the amount of $10 was the result; insured for $2,000 in the Pacific Insurance Company. This building, being five stories in height, towers 20 feet above the adjoining houses, so that escape by the roof would have been almost impossible for the numerous women and children in the house. The stairway was nearly destroyed, so that, had the fire got good headway, a fearful loss of life must necessarily have ensued.

The ridiculous and malicious report, that Mr. KENNEDY had previously confided to this tipsy subordinate his design to get up the appearance of a plot to assassinate Mr. LINCOLN, in order have the merit of discovering and abating the danger as a claim on the President for the office of United States Marshal, is thus effectually set at rest.

Without being able to point to any positive blemish in her rendering, or even to indicate a decided weakness in it, we were all the while unpleasantly conscious of a lack of means to picture with sufficient histrionic strength the second phase of Margaret's character. This proves simply that the selection of the part was injudicious, and to this belief we are further inclined by the many really exquisite episodes which were its illuminating points, and which demonstrated amply that Miss COOMBES possesses sufficient ability to insure success in a different line of character.

Four months ago it was in the power of the Government at Washington to have armed and kept every fortification it possessed in the Southern States. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/12/archives/the-question-of-fort-sumpter.html,,"Four months ago it was in the power of the Government at Washington to have armed and kept every fortification it possessed in the Southern States. There was unmistakable warning that the possession of all of them would be the subject of early controversy. In regard to those in the harbor of Charleston, the danger was by the highest, and it might almost be said, the only military authorities in the country, regarded as so imminent, as to invoke an earnest presentation of the subject to the President, and a recommendation that not a moment should be lost in providing for the protection of Forts Moultrie and Sumpter. How that recommendation was received is a matter of shameful history. So far from strengthening those important points, every energy of the Administration was devoted to arming those who proposed to capture them. Artillery of the heaviest calibre; guns of the most recent and improved invention; munitions sufficient for the reduction of a Bergen-op-Zoom, were placed within reach of the insurgents, whose designs, we now have conclusive reason to believe, were as well known to the Federal Executive as they were among the conspirators themselves. And for fear the proper amount of skill should be lacking to direct the use of the implements of warfare thus deposited in the hands of an unskilled mob, a sufficient number of practised and veteran officers were permitted to resign from the regular service, to furnish the rebels with a competent military direction. It was, of course, assumed that with such ample preparation on the one hand, and such entire inertia on the other, that the forts would be seized without resistance, and as if by surprise; and the administration of Mr. BUCHANAN, while really abetting the designs of the captors, would be able to discharge itself of any very formidable responsibility for the loss. An accident only defeated this plan. Major ANDERSON, with some three score men, instead of remaining where in the Administration programme, he might have been readily reduced, and captured, threw himself into Fort Sumpter, and defied his assailants. His example was followed at Pensacola and at other Florida forts. This interruption of the plot utterly disconcerted the Government, up to that moment absolutely controlled by SLIDELL, WIGFALL, and DAVIS. It was left the choice of publicly declaring its complicity with treason, or of disguising its criminality by pretending to reinforce the gallant fellows whose loyalty and courage had proved so embarrassing. Had this course been adopted with promptitude, it was possible to have saved Fort Sumpter. But weeks were allowed to pass without action, during which the rebels were permitted to obstruct the harbor, enfilade all its approaches with powerful batteries, remove the lights and buoys essential to the safe entrance of relieving-vessels, and to surround Sumpter with forts, armaments and batteries exceeding in number and in guns the defences of the garrison. It was only when these difficulties had been raised, that the Star of the West attempted, with an ostentatious announcement of the intention, to bear reinforcements to Major ANDERSON. Its failure was a foregone conclusion; indeed, no one previously counted upon its success; unless upon the assumption that the rebels would, at the critical moment, decline to fire the shot which should inaugurate civil war, and that thus the vessel might safely reach the fort. The event showed the futility of such calculations; and with the knowledge that every hour was reducing the number of men in the garrison through the expiration of terms of enlistment; that the provisions were rapidly failing; that fuel was almost exhausted, and that lights were even not to be had, no further effort was made by Mr. BUCHANAN or his advisers to succor the beleaguered post. There seems to have been a nice calculation that the resources of the defence would last until the 4th of March, and the late President's retirement from office; and beyond that epoch, none of those reckless men cared to pursue the consequences of their own default.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Question of Fort Sumpter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Question of Fort Sumpter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7587f1e-6bb7-5f58-b4b7-3641855f1ab8,1123,nyt://article/c7587f1e-6bb7-5f58-b4b7-3641855f1ab8

An alarm soon brought a large number of firemen to the place, and operations with the object of saving the building and its valuable stock were soon in progress. So rapidly, however, did the flames spread, that the firemen were unable to do more than prevent the total destruction of the adjoining buildings, while the warehouse in which the fire broke out, together with its valuable contents, was entirely consumed. The fire originated on the second floor, in the warerooms of H. E. HART, cap manufacturer, whose loss is estimated at $15,000. The first floor and basement were occupied by MASTERTON & REIMER, grocers, whose loss is supposed to be about $30,000. The remaining floors of the building were not tenanted. The structure was four stories in height, and was valued at $20,000. The flames communicated to the adjoining building, No. 54, the first floor and basement of which is occupied by M. J. KING, whose loss is about $5,000, mainly by water; covered by an insurance of $40,000 in the City Companies. REX & GOTTGETREW, manufacturers of children's hats, occupied the second floor, and their stock was also slightly injured by water. The cap warehouse of LEUGSTACK & RAHNER, was on the 3d floor. They suffered likewise by water, to slight a degree. The stock of CARHAM & BROTHER, in the building No. 58, was also injured slightly by wetting. The entire loss is estimated at about $75.000, and the losers are probably insured to the full amount of the damage, but the lateness of the hour at which the fire occurred made it impossible to obtain a list of the insurances.

The necessity will grow out of more than ordinary causes. The last Con ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/13/archives/the-southern-revenues-necessity-of-an-extra-session-of-congress.html,,"It will be no matter of surprise if, among the earliest acts of the new Administration, there shall be a demand for an extra session of Congress. The necessity will grow out of more than ordinary causes. The last Congress left no appropriation bill unpassed, and made through its tariff and loan bill provision which it deemed adequate for the current expenses of Government. All was accomplished that was exacted by the assumption of a perfectly normal and equable movement of public affairs; and if the ship of State were really afloat upon Summer seas it would need nothing additional to speed or supply it. But peace was the assumption at the foundation of all this legislation, whereas the exigencies which the new Administration is called to meet are anything but normal or pacific. One half of the seaboard of the Union is in the hands of an insurgent Government, which repudiates our laws, and will oppose their execution with the utmost force of armed resistance. Nor is this negative attitude the only difficulty. Yielding to the necessity of the case, the new Confederaey having been obliged to postpone its free-trade experiment, has adopted as its basis of revenue the Tariff of 1857, and at all its ports goods and manufactures of nearly every description will find admission under that scale of duties, and the revenue will go to enrich the treasury of secession. In any ordinary circumstances such loss of revenue might be submitted to, because the cost of collecting it would pretty fairly exhaust the gross product. But the new and injudicious tariff fastened upon us by the Thirty-sixth Congress makes the affair a very much more serious one; for its largely augmented rates afford an irresistible invitation to importers to introduce their merchandise at Southern rather than at Northern ports, where they may either be sold, or carried overland to the Northern consumers. The effect of this perfectly feasible and legal proceeding would be to build up the rebel States of the Union at the expense of the loyal; to cripple the foreign trade of the Northern cities; and leave the Treasury at Washington in a far less satisfactory condition than if the late tariff had been undisturbed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Southern Revenues Necessity of an Extra Session of Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Southern Revenues Necessity of an Extra Session of Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30eba288-f163-5cb5-8de3-4eb16537a0a8,714,nyt://article/30eba288-f163-5cb5-8de3-4eb16537a0a8

He urged upon the Jury the duty strict diligence on their part in disposing of cases, so that those who are clearly innocent may be speedily set at liberty, and those against whom bills shall be found, may be presented for immediate trial, and the expense of their support be transferred from the City to the State, where it properly belongs. We apprehend that the position of prisoners confined upon the mere charge of crime, is by no means generally appreciated. The legal presumption that every man is innocent until proved guilty, is corroborated by daily experience in the criminal counts, where upon trial a very large proportion of all the persons placed at the bar are found innocent by a jury and discharged; not, however, in some instances, until they have been confined weeks and even months. On Monday last an illustration of this state of things occurred in the case of an old German cripple, who had been in confinement for six months, without having been brought to the attention of the Grand Jury, until Judge MCCUNN, learning the facts of the case, had it sent to that Inquest, where the charge against the prisoner was dismissed, and he was consequently discharged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Punishment before Trial', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Punishment before Trial', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4223e3de-2c88-5d0e-b854-dfdd603333c1,517,nyt://article/4223e3de-2c88-5d0e-b854-dfdd603333c1

It is almost impossible to deny, in perusing this concise, but comprehensive summary of facts and law, that the speaker makes out apparently the clearest of cases in establishing that there had been two violations of the rights of the people of Canada during the trial in question and before its termination. The Court if Queen's Bench had acted apparently in this case on the supposition that they were adjudicating on the terms of a genital treaty, which would have been quite in he line of their duty. Under these circumstances application to the Court should have been made to the law officers of the Crown; but instead of this ""involuntary"" action in fulfilment of official duty the affair had been voluntary, the writ of habeas corpus having been granted in his opinion most improperly -- to a foreigner in no way connected with the authorities of Canada or England. Again, the English Court had based its decision on the treaty, but the best authority in Canada questioned any power to make such a treaty -- having a Government and legislation of their own.

"The Directors of the Great Ship Company had compiled a report that was to be presented to the shareholders at a public meeting to be held at the London Tavern on the 28th ult. They congratulate the shareholders that the trial trip to New-York was made at a loss of only L344 odd. As explained in their previous report it was their intention to have dispatched the ship on a second voyage to New-York on the 17th October last, but after considering the requirements of the Board of Trade for one voyage only, and the very imperfect state of the decks laid down by Mr. J. SCOTT RUSSELL under his contract, the directors, with the advise and concurrence of some of the largest proprietors, whom they invited to confer with them on the subject, abandoned that intention. They then reduced the staff and all other expenses as much as possible, and proceeded with the alterations and repairs. The bearing of the screw shaft was far the most serious task. By very skillful arrangements the necessity of removing the shaft from the ship was overcome, and the work has made such progress as to leave no reasonable doubt of its satisfactory completion, together with the feed pumps to the paddle-boilers recommended by the Board of Trade, in the ensuing month. The main deck bas been sheathed with 1 3/4 inch boards over a layer of tarred patent felt, thus forming a double deck. The directors believe that by these means the deck (hitherto a constant source of injury and annoyance) will be water-tight, and the inconveniences thoroughly removed. The saloon and cargo decks have been caulked, and many other minor but important works are in progress. The question of future employment for the ship has received the most serious consideration of the directors. The want of public confidence in the ship has hitherto baffled the directors in their endeavors to obtain sufficient passengers and freight to remunerate the proprietors. They hope that the voyage to America has, in a great degree, removed the impediment. The passengers unanimously expressed their appreciation of the ease and comfort they enjoyed, and the total absence of seasickness, even to the most sensitive. Her excellence as a sea boat has been proved, and notwithstanding the inevitable disadvantages of an experimental voyage, the Directors can now place full reliance on her steady speed. They believe that another successful voyage to America will establish the desired confidence, and that she might then be profitably employed in any trade where her great capacity and power can be developed. It is clear that by a computation of her speed now established, she would accomplish a voyage to India or Australia within forty days, upon a ration of consumption of coals far below that of other steamships. The directors have, therefore, resolved upon dispatching the ship to America early in April next, and they hope that the receipts from all sources will at least equal the expenditure, as experience has proved that the working expenses of this ship may be reduced to the ordinary charges of merchant steamers, which reduction your directors are determined to effect.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/13/archives/the-great-eastern.html,,"The Directors of the Great Ship Company had compiled a report that was to be presented to the shareholders at a public meeting to be held at the London Tavern on the 28th ult.

"In the House of Commons on the 22d February, Mr. HALIBURTON, before putting to the Under-Secretary for the Colonies the question of which he had given notice on this subject, wissed to refer briefly to ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/13/archives/the-anderson-case-and-the-orangemen-sam-slick-on-colonial-affairs.html,,"In the House of Commons on the 22d February, Mr. HALIBURTON, before putting to the Under-Secretary for the Colonies the question of which he had given notice on this subject, wissed to refer briefly to what had appeared respecting the slave ANDERSON. He had been an inhabitant of Missouri and had escaped from Slavery. He took the life of a white man, also an inhabitant of that State, who was endeavoring to capture him while he was trying to escape from his master. After that event ANDERSON succeeded is effecting his escape and got into Canada. The relatives of the man who was killed, having traced him out, demanded him under a law of the province -- not under a treaty, as had been stated in this country -- but under a law of the province containing many provisions of a treaty. A certain treaty that had been agreed upon between this country and the United States was adopted by the province and passed into a law, to give it the only validity which it could have. Under that law the question had been brought before the Supreme Judges. It had been inquired into and adjudicated on by that Court. He now wished that he might not be misunderstood, for in a case of this kind, which had created so much feeling in this country, he might be misrepresented. He therefore distinctly stated that it was not his intention to offer any opinion on the act of the man ANDERSON, as to whether it amounted to murder, or manslaughter, or justified homicide; as to whether he was rightly captured in Canada, or as to whether the judgment of the Court there was right or wrong. On all these questions he had no observation to make. His object was neither to vindicate the rights of the State of Missouri nor to vindicate the rights of the prisoner ANDERSON, but to state that there had been two violations of the rights of the people of Canada during the trial of this case and before its final termination. An application was made to the Court of Queen's Bench in this country for a writ of habeas corpus to bring ANDERSON out of the jail in Canada and before the Court in order to have his case inquired into. There had been some very singular circumstances attending this case in the Queen's Bench. Here, again, he wished to explain that it was very far from his intention to make any remark whatever disrespectful to the Judges of that Court. Their learning, their very great ability, and the wisdom and impartiality with which they decided everything that came before them, not only entitled them to, but commanded for them, the respect of every one. The country ought to be proud of such a Court, and he should be wanting in self-respect if he made any remark derogatory to its Judges; but at the same time they were not infallible. Appeals from decisions of the Queen's Bench had at various periods of our history been brought before the House of Lords; and in some cases those decisions had been reversed. In the present case he could only suppose that the Court acted on the supposition that they were adjudicating on the terms of a general treaty, which was within their cognizance and jurisdiction. But, if such was the fact, one would have imagined that some reference would have been made to the law officers of the Crown, and that the application to the Court would have been made under their authority. Instead of that the affair was a voluntary one. A man with an unpronounceable name, who he (Mr. HALIBURTON) believed was a Polish refugee, and in no way connected with the authorities of Canada or those of this country, made a voluntary affidavit. The writ of habeas corpus was granted, and addressed to the jailers who had possession of the prisoner, and to the Governor of Canada, a civil officer with military powers. A writ of habeas corpus might with as much propriety be addressed to the Governor of Newgate and the Duke of Cambridge. He spoke the sentiments of some of the ablest lawyers in this country when he said that the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench had created great surprise here, and he knew that it had caused the greatest consternation in the colony. In these observations he made no reference to the case of ANDERSON. They would apply equally to any other case. The people of Canada complained that their rights had been violated. The Court of Queen's Bench, no doubt, founded its jurisdiction on the treaty; but the best authorities in Canada called in question the power of any authority in this country to do so -- they called in question the treaty-making power. The Colony had a Government and a Legislature of its own, and was competent to perform all the acts that were necessary to the government of its people. There was provision made for appeals from the decisions of its courts of law. If a man was dissatisfied with the decision of any of the ordinary courts, he had a right of appeal to a higher tribunal, and from that again he could appeal to the Privy Council. That was the only mode in which the judgments of the Canadian Courts could be reversed, and a very proper mode it was. However able and learned the Canadian judges might be, they were themselves ready to admit that they had neither the experience nor the erudition of the judges of England. To send a writ to Canada to take a man out of the country, and bring him ever here to be adjudicated upon, was to invade the constitutional rights of the people of Canada. The people of the Colony, and especially of Montreal, rejoiced to think that they had got rid of the responsibility of this case, and were nearly illuminating their houses; but still they wished that the thing should be done legally, and not at the expense of their rights. The ordinary course of appeal had been passed over; a writ of habeas corpus had been sent over, and an officer sent with it to receive the man. It was rather a humiliating proceeding to see an officer of one of the superior courts of this country sent on such an errand, considering the answer he was sure to receive. The answer would be that in Canada they did not recognize the authority of such a Court. He certainly wished that they would deliver the man up under protest, as such a case is not likely to occur again. No one pretended to say that there was any intentional violation of the rights of Canada in what had been done. He supposed the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench had some idea that there was such a place as Canada, just as he had that there were such places as Guernsey. Jersey, Alderney and Sark. [A. laugh.] He took it for granted there was such a place as Sark, as it was to be found in the map, but he had never seen it, and never saw a man who had. [A. laugh.] The Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench seemed to have some such idea of Canada. With regard to the orders sent by the Duke of Newcastle to Canada, he would like to know first of all what authority he had to send orders at all. The Colonial-office seldom interfered in the colony at the right time, and when it did it usually did so in a wrong manner. [A. laugh.] He hoped the correspondence would be laid on the table, that the people of Canada, and of the other colonies, too, might be able to see what these orders of the Duke of Newcastle were, and whether they were justified by the Constitution of Canada. As the nominee of the Colonial-office, the Governor of Canada was often in communication with the Colonial Secretary; and there might be many occasions on which it was necessary for the latter to communicate advice to the Governor, and to recommend that he should take such and such a course. But orders were public documents, and as such ought to be made known. The country was not to be governed by orders that were not to be seen. The Government of a constitutional colony was to be carried on by the Governor, by and with the advice of his Council. If, therefore, any order went out which directed him to pursue a certain course without the advice of his Council it would be a contravention of the constitutional rights of the people. The Duke of Newcastle had been recently in Canada, and had seen there the noble reception given to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales; he had seen the enthusiasm and heartfelt demonstrations of the people -- not demonstrations got up, as in a neighboring country, by means of spies and police, but hearty, honest outbursts of loyalty and affection; he might have seen what the character of those colonists was -- that they were Englishmen in feeling and principle, and not a people likely to put up with what they considered a slight or an insult. He took it for granted, therefore, that the Duke of Newcastle would be cautious how be addressed them, and that the orders contained nothing that was unconstitutional. But if the production of these orders was refused, he would take it for granted that they were like certain letters which he wrote to the Mayors of some of the town in Canada. It might be said that this was only bad manners, but bad manners implied bad conduct. There were not people to put up with nonsense, although they would do anything they were asked in civil language. The difficulty arose merely from their having been badly managed. He would, however, say no more on this subject, as it would probably at no distant day be brought before Parliament. He would confine himself at present to asking the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies for information as to the extradition of the American slave ANDERSON, now in custody in Canada; and if he would lay upon the table copies of all correspondence that had passed in relation thereto between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor in Canada, and for all orders issued thereupon.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anderson Case and the Orangemen Sam Slick on Colonial Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anderson Case and the Orangemen Sam Slick on Colonial Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c0abf12d-8390-5de2-ad42-c464846bf563,2466,nyt://article/c0abf12d-8390-5de2-ad42-c464846bf563

"WINTER GARDEN. -- We cannot honestly compliment Miss JANE COOMBS on the merit or novelty of her repertoire. It may perhaps be a serviceable one for the Provinces, but here, where freshness is most in demand, it is anything but attractive. Last evening BULWER'S very young-manish play of the ""Lady of Lyons"" was produced, and considering the badness of the weather and the staleness of the piece, attracted a better house than could reasonably have been expected. It is rather too late in the day to speak of its merits as a literary work, but we may say that a purely dramatic revelation of character is avoided in the role of the heroine, whose character is wrought upon and utterly changed by the mimic events which are made to transpire. For this reason, the piece is always popular with young lady actresses, who, seeing the path clearly mapped out before them, generally tread it with success. Miss COOMBS is, in many respects, the best Pauline we have recently had on the stage. Her personal appearance, so youthful and prepossessing, suggests all the confiding love and ambition of the earlier portions of the work, and the passionate bursts which a warm and poetic temperament lend naturally to an indignant woman seem to come properly from a loveliness that has been so grievously outraged. These expositions of womanhood were clearly and ably rendered by Miss COOMBS, but with occasional strainings after points, which, whilst they pained the listener, added nothing whatever to the effect. If the lady would trust to her natural powers, and to the sensitive instincts of a fine nature, rather than to the dreary tradition of an imperfect and old-fashioned histrionic education, she would leave but little to be desired. As it was, and notwithstanding occasional mannerisms, which could only have been gathered from the worst of teachers, her success was pronounced and merited. Miss COOMBS has, in fact, much to unlearn, but in view of her rare natural talent, it must be a matter of interest to the critic to observe how quickly she can perform that most difficult of all feminine tasks.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/14/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- We cannot honestly compliment Miss JANE COOMBS on the merit or novelty of her repertoire.

Her personal appearance, so youthful and prepossessing, suggests all the confiding love and ambition of the earlier portions of the work, and the passionate bursts which a warm and poetic temperament lend naturally to an indignant woman seem to come properly from a loveliness that has been so grievously outraged. These expositions of womanhood were clearly and ably rendered by Miss COOMBS, but with occasional strainings after points, which, whilst they pained the listener, added nothing whatever to the effect. If the lady would trust to her natural powers, and to the sensitive instincts of a fine nature, rather than to the dreary tradition of an imperfect and old-fashioned histrionic education, she would leave but little to be desired. As it was, and notwithstanding occasional mannerisms, which could only have been gathered from the worst of teachers, her success was pronounced and merited. Miss COOMBS has, in fact, much to unlearn, but in view of her rare natural talent, it must be a matter of interest to the critic to observe how quickly she can perform that most difficult of all feminine tasks.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/410e4b89-637e-5cdf-8a48-c4922ff6be0a,444,nyt://article/410e4b89-637e-5cdf-8a48-c4922ff6be0a

Attracted thither by the magnetism of the mountains and the lust of gold, as well as by that inscrutable impulse which, from the earliest dawn of time, has ceaselessly impelled the historic races on their journey toward the setting sun, during the last two years a converging host of pioneers have turned their impetuous march along the great valleys that skirt the Platte, the Smoky Hill and the Arkansas; and the silent plains have resounded to the tramp of myriads of venture-some pilgrims. Men on mules, pilgrims afoot, with their packs on their backs, families in ox wagons, passengers by the overland express, and the endless procession of white-sailed ""prairie schooners,"" have given a picturesque animation to the unpeopled solitudes where heretofore the bison has held eternal sway. Now, as the result, we behold the sublime apparition of a free and orderly community superseding as by magic the savage reign of the Ute, the Cheyenne and the Arrapahoe. The bustling town and the waving wheat-field, the church, the theatre and the gallows, the newspaper and post-office, the shout of the gold-digger and the hymn of the Christian household, have opened new scenes and awakened new echoes amid the solemn canons of the Sierra Madre.

The missing man called upon his agent, but the remittance at that time had not arrived, and he left, since which time he has not been heard from. About ten days since, the body of an unknown man was found by some rag-pickers in the Morris Canal, about two miles from Jersey City, upon which an inquest was held by Coroner GAFFNEY. The body was examined by Dr. QUIDOR. No marks of violence were discovered, and it having been in the water some length of time, the jury came to the conclusion that death was caused by drowning. A few days since Mr. VALENTINE PAPST, an associate of SCHLOSSER, caused the body of the drowned man to be disinterred, and was very positive that it was the body of SCHLOSSER. At the time of leaving home he was known to have on his person over $100 and a galvanized silver watch of German manufacture. SCHLOSSER was a single man, a native of Darmstadt, Germany, where he had considerable property. For some time he had been the owner of an extensive milk route at Newark.

The article seemed to be a burden. He changed it awkwardly from one to another, and finally, despairing of finding for it any other easy position, deposited it upon the platform beside him. Senators and judges crowded in and to make room for them he removed nearer the front of the stage, carrying his tile with him. Again it was dandied uneasily, and as Senator Baker approached to introduce him to the audience he made a motion as if to replace the tile on the stage under the seat, when Douglas, who had been looking on quietly, and apparently with some apprehensions of a catastrophe to the hat, said, 'Permit me, Sir,' and gallantly took the vexatious article and held it during the entire reading of the Inaugural.

An alarm brought the firemen to the place with their usual alacrity, but their efforts to stay the ravages of the flames were of no avail until the whole interior of the building was destroyed. The first floor and basement of the house was occupied by M.A. DECKER as a bar-room and restaurant, whose loss of stock amounts to about $7,000, upon which he had no insurance. Mr. E. GILDERSLEEVE owned the furniture and bar fixtures, and his loss, estimated at $1,000, is covered by insurance in the Commonwealth Insurance Company. The upper floors of the building were used as lodge-rooms by various Masonic Societies, the loss of each of which varies from $500 to $1,000, and neither of them had their property insured excepting the Holland Lodge, and even this suffered to a greater, extent than the amount for which it had policies -- its loss being estimated at $6,000, and its insurances amounting only to $4,000. The building, owned by Mr. A.L. Cox, was injured to the extent of about $7,000; insured for $6,000 in the Niagara, and $5,000 in the Germania Insurance Companies. Mr. THORP had leased the premises for a term of years, and considers that he is out of pocket $16,000 by the disaster. The fire is believed to have originated from a grate on the second floor, where a fire had been kept several days for the purpose of drying a newly elected partition wall in one of the lodge-rooms. Following are the names of the lodges who occupied the premises: Crescent, Holland, Continental, Arcana, Concord, Benevolent, Pacific and Washington, and the Metropolitan, Jerusalem and Coeur de Leon Chapters.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ccdcd01-d29d-5043-bf76-b01f56406e32,708,nyt://article/1ccdcd01-d29d-5043-bf76-b01f56406e32

It represents the embouchure of the Canale Grande, with the Church Santa Maria della Salute, of course, to the left, and the long row of palaces on either hand, fading in dim distance. The fore-centre is occupied by a gondola, such as gondolas were before an edict of the Consiglio sentenced them to be clad in black, in order to repress the excessive luxury which the nobility displayed in ornamenting these boats. A lady is seated in it, beneath a rich crimson canopy -- through which the light falling produces a peculiarly rich glow -- while a cavalier near her, and the gondolier dozing unreproved behind, complete the incident. The picture, however, embraces many other noticeable points. The remarkable variety of aerial effects introduced is equaled by those given in the play of the water, in the waves, and especially in the reflections from ""castle, tower and town."" The rich, fresh green under the gondolas is peculiarly and strikingly balanced by the liberal light of the crimson canopy, and the exquisite purple reflection to the left, with other harmonious hues introduced in the middle distance, appropriately prepare the eye for the dreamy dimness of the city.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3017c2f2-0671-5777-988d-5c8d6435f4c8,1541,nyt://article/3017c2f2-0671-5777-988d-5c8d6435f4c8

This gentleman interpreted the piano part, and with a finish of execution and elegance of phrasing which we hardly hope to hear surpassed. The tempi of the various movements were as usual modernized, and advantageously, as we think; a couple of well-devised cadenzas, calculated in an innocent way to show off the capabilities of the pianist, were also engrafted on the original work. Mr. HOFFMAN'S performance was all that could be desired. Later in the evening he played two solos, one an unimportant nocturne by TEDESCO; the other a grand Polonaise by LURECK, a composer and performer of rising fame. The last named is literally crowded with ideas, and for that reason is somewhat incoherent; but it indicates a vigorous mind, and as a concert piece strikes us most favorably.

Accordingly, about one year ago, the project of crecting a new church was started, and met with such favor that in April last the work was formally commenced, and yesterday the new building, complete in every requisite quality, was dedicated. The exercises were commenced at 10 1/2 o'clock A.M., when Rev. D.W. CAHILL, D.D., delivered a dedication sermon, and Bishop LOUGHLIN performed the act of dedication, assisted by Rev. Fathers O'Neil, Celebrant; Cassidy, Deacon; Keegan, Sub-Deacon; O'Birne, Kelly, Fagan, McKenna, and McGuire.

LATHAM, of the slave-back Cora, from the custody of the United States DeputyMarshal, was yesterday the theme of general conversation. The only official information yet made public upon the subject, came out yesterday forenoon in the proceedings of the United States Circuit Court. Upon the opening of the Court, United States District-Attorney ROOSEVELT asked the Court to grant a verbal order that the Marshal should come before the Court and make a statement, as one of its officers, of the particulars of the escape of Capt. LATHAM, who had been committed upon a Bench warrant issued out of this Court. In a few moments the Crier brought in the Marshal, who made the following statement: He said that, before leaving for Washington, he gave express orders that none of the prisoners should be taken out of jail on any pretext whatever; and that Capt. LATHAM, particularly, should not be taken out, unless by an order of the District-Attorney, which he knew from experience would not be granted. On his return, Saturday morning, he was informed of the escape of LATHAM from the custody of JOHN CULLIGAN, one of his Deputies. He immediately telegraphed to his Deputy, Mr. THOMPSON, who was then in Washington, directing him to offer a reward of $200 for his arrest, as he suspected the fugitive would go South. The Marshal dismissed CULLIGAN from his office. In excuse for his conduct, CULLIGAN told him (RYNDERS) that ""some persons"" applied to him saying that LATHAM needed shirts and clothing, and promised him $25 for his trouble if he would get an order to take LATHAM to BROOKS' store in Broadway. CULLIGAN applied to Mr. LOTT, the Clerk in the Marshal's Office, to write an order on Mr. MCLEOD, Keeper of Eldridge-street Jail, to take him out. LOTT wrote the order, and with it CULLIGAN went to the jail, and, on presenting it to MOLSOD, Capt. LATHAM was permitted to go with him. All this was entirely contrary to the Marshal's orders. CULLIGAN then took the Captain to the store corner of Grand-street and Broadway, and upon his arrival ""some persons,"" before referred to, told Capt. L. that he might select a suit of clothes for himself, and while he was doing so, at a moment when the attention of the Deputy was diverted, he escaped from the store to a carriage, in which he was driven off.

The defendant is an Alderman, and represent the Tenth Ward of Brooklyn in the Common Council Chamber. As such officer, as authorized by the City Charter, he entered into contract with one JAMES MUSTAGH, May, 7, 1860, to clean the streets of the Tenth Ward for one year, remove a 1 garbage, ashes, &c., once each week and oftener, if required, at the rate of $3,000 per annum, to be paid as follows: $300 on the 15th of June, 1860; $250 on the 7th of August, and the like sum on the 7th of each succeeding month, until the 7th of May, 1861. Before a contractor can draw the payments, the Alderman of a ward is required to certify in each case that the work for the previous month has been properly done, and the indictment alleges that the defendant, on the 7th of November, 1860, did ""unlawfully, falsely and corruptly,"" certify that the work of the contractor was properly done for the previous month, when, in fact, the indictment alleges the contractor had wholly failed performing his duty, and the defendant knew it. The Corporation Counselor appeared for the accused, and proven to quash the indictment, on the ground that it did not allege that the streets or any particular part of the Ward needed cleaning, and that the mere omission to clean the streets every week, did not practically, amount to a negligence of duty on the part of the contractor, if the streets were really clean, and there were no ashes, &c., to be removed; that the departure from the mere letter of the contract was not material, and further, the ticket itself was [???] as it conferred no authority on the Comptroller to pay the bid. The motion was denied, and the case was proceeded with, and will probably occupy the attention of the Court for several days.

HORACE GREELEY delivered an address before this Club, at its regular weekly meeting in Cooper Institute last evening. After a song from Mr. ANDERSON, Mr. GREELEY was introduced, and prefaced his speech with some sarcastic remarks about the crisis through which the country was passing at the present time, and the number of times the Union had been ""saved"" during the last twenty years. The sole cause of this last crisis, so far as he could discover, was the fact that the Republicans had elected a President whom the South did not like. And they had a very good reason for not liking him, which was that they did not know him. The South claimed that, although the election was constitutional in form, it was, nevertheless, against the spirit of that instrument. And why? Simply because a Northern man had been elected by Northern votes. Now, for his part, he tried to have a Southern man nominated at Chicago; [laughter;] but admitting, for argument's sake, that the election of a Northern President by Northern votes was contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, it was clear that the South were solely responsible for the event. It was only by their acts at the Charleston Convention, in breaking up the Democratic party, that the success of the Republican party became possible; and the very men who were most active in the secession movement were the men who persisted in breaking up that party. The truth was, secession was a foregone conclusion with the men who initiated and carried on the movement, and had nothing to do with the ""sectionalism"" of the Republican party. Mr. GREELY then proceeded to argue that concession, by the Republicans, was useless; that no concession short of an acknowledgment that slavery is a blessing, and that we would do all we could to help them extend it, would be at all satisfactory, or have the effect of disarming the Secessionists. The question at the present time, then, was Union or no Union. Now, for one, he believed there were things of more importance than Union. Truth was higher than the Union; so was justice. The only Union worth preserving was that which submitted to a constitutional administration of the Government and the enforcement of the laws. As for compromise, it was not to be thought of on the platform of the Secessionists. Every man engaged in that movement deserved to be hung He might, perhaps, consent to so far compromise as to hang half of them. [Laughter and applause.] Three fourths of the press of this City were in favor of reconstruction, but how was the thing to be brought about? Were we to reinstate General TWIGGS as a general in the United States Army? Were honorable officers to be compelled to serve under such a man as that? There was no middle ground between obedience to the laws and rebelion against the laws. Mr. LINCOLN, as President of the United States, was entitled to obedience from Texas as well as from Vermont. Any compromise with treason would be a quasi admission of its justice, and would utterly debauch and demoralize the Government. The Government would then be a mere rope of sand, the United States only a series of dissolving views, the Union but a rainbow, visible one moment and vanished the next. Those who talked of compromise and reconstitution, were the most dangerous, because the most sneaking of traitors. How the presentstate of affairs was to end he could not tell; it might terminate in strife, perhaps in bloodshed, but their duty as Republicans was clear. Their course heretofore had been legal, constitutional and just; they had nothing to atone for, no apologies to offer, no compromises to make, and as in the past, so in the future, they should go on doing sign, acting justly, and having the consequences to God.

The Judge suggested that CULLIGAN should be arrested and brought to trial. Marshal RYNDERS agreed that an investigation should be made, and was willing to make the complaint on which to issue the warrant, if a simple declaration that he (CULLIGAN) had wrongfully permitted the prisoner to escape were sufficient, but not knowing more than anybody else on the subject, he could not swear that he had been corruptly influenced, and he would not do so to please anyone. Judge SHIPMAN said he was sorry there was no one to make the complaint, and the investigation here closed. Afterwards Capt. RYNDERS signed the proper complaint, and a warrant was issued by Commissioner BETTS, which the Marshal placed in the hands of Mr. DOWDEGAN, with directions to serve it at once. Mr. CULLIGAN, it is said, has expressed his willingness to have the whole matter thoroughly investigated. He will now have an opportunity. Marshal RYNDERS informally stated to Judge ROSEVELT and others, who were present in the Court-room, that he learned at BROOKS store that a short time before LATHAM arrived at his' place on Friday afternoon, a rather aged man, with gray hair and whiskers, who appeared to be a Spaniard, came into his place and began to look about as if to make some purchases. On being spoken to, he made an evasive reply. When LATHAM and CALLIGAN came in this person recognized LATHAM and showed that he was in some way connected with him. While LATHAM and his friend was looking at some shirts and hose, one of the party told CULLIGAN he might select a pair of pants for himself, by way of rewarding him for the trouble he had been at. CULLIGAN then selected a pair which suited him, and stepped behind the curtain to try them on. While he was in that place LATHAM and his friend stepped out of the door, entered a carriage, which was evidently waiting for them, and drove off. Without his pantaloons, the officer was in no state of preparation to follow the prisoner.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'More about the Flight of the Slave Captain.; THE MATTER TO BE INVESTIGATED HOW THE ESCAPE WAS MANAGED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'More about the Flight of the Slave Captain.; THE MATTER TO BE INVESTIGATED HOW THE ESCAPE WAS MANAGED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a9369fd3-2307-541f-bddf-acd276baf8fc,399,nyt://article/a9369fd3-2307-541f-bddf-acd276baf8fc

The wanton act was witnessed by several persons, who gathered about the discomfited confectioner, and pretty soon a Second Ward policeman came up to learn what had happened. He was informed, but meantime the ruffian who had occasioned the mischief had taken refuge in the Chester House, No. 38 Ann-street. The policeman told the Frenchman that he had no power to arrest the offender, as he did not see the offence committed, and advised him to go to the Tombs Police Court and get a warrant. While this parley was in progress four other policemen, reached the place, and almost at the same moment the fireman came from his hiding-place, having exchanged his fireman's uniform for citizen's clothes. His disguise, however, was not sufficient to prevent his being recognized by the crowd, who pointed him out to the police and demanded his arrest. Two or three of the officers attempted to make the man a prisoner, but he ran down a flight of cellar steps, and having gained the bottom, placed his firsts a la Heenan, and dared the police to approach him. Although by this time six or seven policemen had come up, not one of them was brave enough to attempt the apprehension of the drunken man, until a Sergeant came and insisted that it should be done. It was then finally accomplished, after the ruffian had defied the police for at least fifteen minutes.

The old man was induced to go to this office with BASCHE, and there bargained for a passage ticket in the steamer which was to sail on the following day. He had with him a draft for $1,200 on a New-York bank, which BASCHE got possession of to get it cashed, and out of which he was to receive the passage money. The old man then went to a German boarding-house in Mercer-street, near Greene, with his baggage. BASCHE deposited the draft in his own name at the Mechanics' and Traders' Bank in Jersey City, and on Monday he drew the money, since which time he has been missing. The old man has not been seen or heard of since Saturday morning last, and his baggage still remains at the boarding-house.

In giving it to the public in its entirety, the publishers rather forestall the interest of its continuation in their Magazine, and yet we thank them for the work. A serial story has ever been our special detestation. We have a horror of anything published in parts. ""To be continued,"" at the close of a magazine article, always has the effect upon us of ""keep out,"" on a room door -- we'd not cross the threshold however inviting the interior might be. It is impossible to keep one's curiosity and interest on the stretch for a month. The manner, too, in which these serial gentlemen of times trifle with the feelings of the public is worthy of grave censure. We have known a heroine, after falling over a steep cliff, to be left hanging by her hoops from the inevitable providential tree until four weeks had rolled their weary round. Now, we submit that there is no reason why the reader should be left in suspense for that time, though the lady was. Again, when an officer is on the track of the inevitable villain, and has nearly reached him, it conflicts with our notions of right and wrong to know that the hands of Justice and the officer, are to be arrested for a month. In that interim a thousand things may happen. The author may die, or the reader may. In either event we should be debarred from learning the offender's fate, and the previous time spent in industriously following at his heels would be irretrievably lost. There is only one incomplete work, as an addendum to which the announcement of a continuation finds a welcome and an appropriate place.

"Whether it be wiser in the Legislature to occupy twelve hours a day in deliberations, or to create that dubious contrivance, a ""Grinding Committee,"" is a question which distracts Albany correspondents.

Heretofore an unlimited number of ""influentials"" received invitations for themselves and all their friends to enjoy a private view, and the consequence was, that the private view was all in one's eye, and unless he had the very best of company hanging on his arm, the enjoyment to be derived from the aforesaid privates by any viewer whomsoever, would be exceedingly and very limited. This year females were excluded -- potables and Havanas being admitted in their stead -- and the natural result was, that a great many queerly customed individuals, of the sterner sex, congregated in the hall, examined the pictures some, but indulged in the goodies more.

"The following is Capt. WHEELER's statement of the stranding of the bark Harvest Queen, and the loss of six men of her crew, as given on the books at the Merchants' Exchange: ""Bark Harvest Queen, Capt. WHEELER, reported ashore at Scituate yesterday, made Thatcher's Island light at 10 1/2 o'clock Monday night; it bore north and by east half east distant five miles, and steered southwest half west for Boston light. At 11 1/2 P.M. shut in with a heavy northeast snow storm. At 2 A.M. Tuesday, made a large light right ahead, which I took for Boston Light. Hauled to, to get the light to bear west northwest; soon after found the water was shoaling, with hard rocky bottom. Lost sight of the light, took in all sail, and let go both anchors in four fathoms of water. At daylight found the bark had drifted close to the breakers, and was still driving; found it impossible to keep from going ashore, and prepared to leave with the boats. At 7 A.M. launched the boats, sent the mate, JAMES PIKE, the second mate, JAMES SMITH, seamen, Wm. Saunders, Joseph Young, Carl Schmitt and George Boyd, away in the large surf-boat, with orders not to let go their anchor till I joined them with the small boat. At 7 1/2 A.M. I determined to leave the vessel with the small boat, containing myself, steward JACOB Fritch, seamen Edward Gibbons, P.S. Wisner, Thomas Morton, James Farrell, G.R. McIlwain. On passing the mate's boat, I signalized her to follow me to the beach. They appeared to be undecided what to do, but at length followed. I landed with my crew in safety, and have no further recollection. The mate's boat capsized in the surf, and those in her perished. I do not understand how some of the men were not saved, as they were supplied with life buoys and cork fenders in the boat. On inquiry on shore, I found that the light that I had seen was a large fire on the beach, built by watchmen.

Here also he has an episode on the Darwin question. Announcements had led us to expect something like a systematic examination of that now famous hypothesis: there is really, however, nothing of the kind, the author confining himself to general declarations, as thus: ""The arguments presented by DARWIN in favor of a universal derivation from one primary form have not made the slightest impression on my mind."" If we understand the following passage, it seems simply to shut out forever from all scientific investigation the whole question of the origin of species: ""We must look to the original Power that imparted life to the first being for the origin of all other beings, however mysterious and inaccessible the modes by which all this diversity has been produced may remain for us.""

It is enough to say that were Fort Sumpter in the condition of Forts Pickens, Taylor and Jefferson, abundantly manned, armed and provisioned, we have every reason for believing it would be held to the last extremity against every assailant; and while all would profoundly deplore the waste of life which assault or siege might occasion, they would have to bear the sanguinary responsibility who should begin the conflict.

The treasury, you observe, has been now for some time disgustingly empty; and that serene and generous Uncle under whose favor the Floridians have heretofore waxed fat, has lately had quite enough ado attending to himself. So the supreme authorities have succeeded in negotiating the sale of half a million of acres of their national domain to a company of New-Orleans speculators, at two cents an acre -- said land being situated upon and in the vicinity of Caloosahatchie.

Such a bit of finance, at the present exigency of her national history, exhibits a shrewdness worthy of YULEE himself; for the likelihood is that one cent an acre, even if made payable in Pelican bills, will be quite as much as the choicest tid-bits of peninsular soil will command in a year or two from now, if it persists in being or remaining an independent national tail to South Carolina. If the young nation, however, will offer the whole of her dry land for sale in one parcel, and will agree to make an auto-du-fe of all her fire-eaters, she might be able to negotiate its sale at present high prices.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/23/archives/now-and-then.html,,"-- In the course of some remarks in this paper, yesterday, in regard to an extra session of Congress, we embraced among the causes likely to embarrass the action of the body, the fact that the representation, because several of the States have yet to elect members to the Thirty-seventh Congress, would be far from perfect. Such, however, is not the case. When, in 1841, the newly inaugurated administration of Gen. HARRISON found itself so surrounded with financial difficulties, arising from the expiring tariff of 1832, as to require the aid of a special session, the proclamation appeared on the 17th of March, convoking the meeting for May 31. With the exception of Mississippi, all the States which had not yet chosen representatives, held special elections, so that when Congress assembled, the usual numbers, bating those from the State named, were in attendance. In those days there was no telegraph to expedite the Presidential summons; hence the prolonged interval between the call and the meeting. Now there would be no difficulty in completing the elections and organizing the House within a fortnight; and if, as events appear to intimate, a special meeting shall be required, it may be had in time for even the most sudden emergency.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOW AND THEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOW AND THEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aafabca4-9356-54e7-87c6-68e86f8bf885,207,nyt://article/aafabca4-9356-54e7-87c6-68e86f8bf885

"A CHILD STOLEN BY A BEGGAR WOMAN, AND RESTORED AFTER A MONTH'S ABSENCE. -- On the 17th inst., two brothers named IRA and CHARLES CHAPMAN, while walking in the woods near the village of Sing Sing, Westchester County, encountered a party of seven men and two women gathered around a camp fire, and apparently leading a Gipsey life. One of the women had with her a little girl, about two years of age, who was crying bitterly, and whose forlorn andneglected condition excited the commiseration of the young men to such an extent that they asked the woman to place her under their protection, where she would receive better care than could possibly fall to her lot under the circumstances which then surrounded her. The woman willingly complied, and the young men took the child to Mr. T. MANEY, Overseer of the Poor at Sing Sing, by whom she was kindly provided for. On Friday last, Mr. MANEY observed an advertisement in one of the City papers, descriptive of a lost child belonging to Mr. GREENAN, a respectable man living in James-street, and believing it to refer to the little walf in his custody, he telegraphed Mr. G. to come up and look at her. On Saturday Mr. GREENAN and Detective WILSON went to Sing Sing, where the heart of the former was made glad at discovering that the child was his 'own little daughter, who had been stolen from him on the 20th of last mouth, although in the interval the hardships she had suffered had changed her so sadly that he at first scarcely recognized her. In their efforts to find the child, its parents learned that she had been abducted by an Irishwoman, named ANN MCCLUSKY, formerly keeper of a brothel in Water-street, who, having been turned out of her wretched home, had taken to street-begging for a livelihood, and used the little girl to excite the sympathy of the charitable.

The fire broke out among the scenery on the stage, and was discovered by the watchman of the premises. The firemen responded to the alarm with their accustomed alacrity, but the combustible character of the material made it impossible to check the progress of the flames, and it was not very long before the building with its contents, was destroyed. The hall was situated in the rear of the premises No. 663 Broadway, and was entered through a long passage-way. It was a three-story building, having a front of 40 feet, and a depth of 125, and was more familiarly known as Mozart Hall, the head-quarters of the Anti-Tammany Democracy. The property formed a part of the estate of the late Rev. Mr. WILEY, and, including the buildings on Broadway, was insured for $15,000. The loss is estimated at $6,000, and the insurances are distributed as follows: $4,000 each in the Knickerbocker and American, $2,000 each in the Niagara and Lorillard, and $3,000 in the American, of Philadelphia. The proprietors of Canterbury Hall, estimate their loss at $10,000, upon which are insurances for $8,000, as follows: Stuysevant, $3,000; Hartford, $2,000; Liverpool and London, $3,000. By the falling of the walls the rear part of the buildings Nos. 190, 192 and 194 Mercer-street were slightly damaged. They also belong to the Wiley estate. The rear part of the Stuyvesant Institute was injured to the extent of $300 by the same means: insured in the Relief Insurance Company for $5,000.

"The week which precedes Easter is seldom a very nourishing one in theatrical matters, being usually devoted by managers to the preparation of forthcoming novelties.

"Maj. YELVERTON looks every inch a roue, neither ugly or handsome, but with a face, the aspect of which is, simply unpleasant, dubious, disagreeable. His head is bald on the back of the crown alone. He wears a moustache and flowing whiskers of reddish fair hue. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/26/archives/the-yelverton-case-pen-and-ink-portraits-of-the-parties.html,,"Maj. YELVERTON looks every inch a roue, neither ugly or handsome, but with a face, the aspect of which is, simply unpleasant, dubious, disagreeable. His head is bald on the back of the crown alone. He wears a moustache and flowing whiskers of reddish fair hue. He seemed very nervous and agitated, like a man who found himself ""in for"" the worst that could befall him, but resolved to go through it at all hazards. His manner of answering the questions was very remarkable. He generally paused a good while, as if weighing every possible bearing or effect of his answer, and shaping it accordingly, like a chess-player calculating before he made his move. His mode of pronounciation was that so often given in Punch as the language of ""swell."" The indignation in court while he was giving his evidence was really indescribable; but it was when he cooly detailed his directions to Mrs. YELVERTON about ""getting rid of"" the infant that it reached its height. Indeed, so much was it apprehended that, without waiting to catch him outside, the indignant auditors would set upon him in the court itself, that after declaring the adjournment the Chief Justice remained on the bench until he saw the court cleared of the crowd that had stayed behind in very menacing bearing towards YELVERTON. An immense concourse awaited him outside, openly avowing an intention of making him acquainted with the Liffey, running close by. In consequence of this, numerous ingenious devices were resorted to in order to get him away safely. It is said, and I believe with truth, that the War Office has intimated its intention, as soon as ever the present trial is over, to arraign Major YELVERSON before a Court-martial for ""conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman."" It is said that his own evidence, to the effect that he frequented as a visitor the house of a superior officer (Gen. STRAUBENZEE) in pursuance of the design of seducing the friend and guest of that officer, will be laid as one of the exact offences in the indictment. Mrs. YELVERTON is probably in her 25th year. She is under the middle height and of fair complexion. She was pale, very pale, evidently impressed, if not agitated, by the circumstances of the occasion, time, and place. Subsequently, when slightly flushed with the excitement, or possibly with the heat of the Court, her face assumed the semblance of what it doubtless was in days passed by, when it wore the charms that attracted the despoiler's gaze. Beautiful the was then indeed! Not that her features, when examined one by one, would be pronounced regular or beautiful. There was a matronly, a grave, thoughtful, sorrowful expression over all, that I am utterly unable to describe; and this it was that first struck and impressed the beholder. Grief -- grief that may not be measured, had left its traces there. There was a sadness in the first tones of her voice, and she threw a quick glance all around, in a half troubled, apprehensive, inquiring anxiety, as if she wanted to be sure that she was indeed amidst the friendly hearts fame had always told her were ever to be found in Ireland by the children of sorrow and misfortune. Hope spoke to the troubled soul that had so long lain in anguish, and thenceforth she seemed to acquire a strength none would have looked for in such a fragile frame. The countenance is oval, with a delicately pointed chin; the general expression of the face is most decidedly that of great firmness, calm, resolute, persevering, dignified power -- confidence in repose. It is the eye that lights up and makes beautiful the whole countenance, which, in fact, is one of those which has its beauty and attraction, more in expression, the seat of which can never be accurately fixed, than in mere symmetry and regularity of the individual features themselves. Her glance penetrates, while it charms as with a spell. She has a profusion of rich glossy auburn hair, which was worn a la Eugenie. Her hand, the smallness of which has been necessarily alluded to in the evidence, is, indeed, one which your fair readers would admire. Mme. YELVERTON was attired, on the first day, in a light-colored fashionable bonnet, and wore a black moire antique dress. On the following day the news had reached her of the death of Mr. BELLAMY, her brother-in-law, and, accordingly, she appeared subsequently in mourning. So far for her personal appearance; but how shall I describe what constitutes the greatest charm about her? The perfection of graceful motion in the simplest movement, and the voice -- such a voice! -- clear, soft, liquid, and musical. BREWSTER was a child in her hands. In the very first sentence exchanged between them their relative positions were fixed, and the ascendancy was hers. At the very start she completely took up her position, without effort or attempt, but somehow simply, because it was her rightful position; one which exacted the most respectful and deferential demeanor from even her antagonist.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Yelverton Case.; PEN AND INK PORTRAITS OF THE PARTIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Yelverton Case.; PEN AND INK PORTRAITS OF THE PARTIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Dublin Morning News', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0c5800a5-3a2b-5d4f-a483-aba9563e6098,850,nyt://article/0c5800a5-3a2b-5d4f-a483-aba9563e6098

"The telegraph announces the death of Hon. GEORGE W. SCRANTON, the Representative in Congress of the Twelfth District of Pennsylvania. Mr. SCRANTON died on Sunday last at his residence in the city to which he had given existence and a name. His disease was pulmonary consumption. A native of Connecticut, Mr. SCRANTON settled many years ago in Warren County, N.J., where he married, and where, nineteen years ago, his attention was called to the unexplored mineral wealth of the Lackawanna Valley, in Luzerne County, Penn. To the development of this region he devoted his entire energies, and having secured the confidence and aid of prominent New-York capitalists, he succeeded in converting a region wholly wild and unpeopled into one of the busiest and most prosperous sections of the country. The site of the present city of Scranton, with its thousands of inhabitants and swarming streets, was, in 1840, a mere wilderness; and the change which has brought a thronging population thither, and made costly lines of railroad tributary to it, are confessedly due to the skill and ability of the deceased. Mr. SCRANTON was, in 1858, elected to represent the Luzerne District in the Thirty-sixth Congress, and rechosen last Fall to fill a seat in the Thirty-seventh. So great indeed was the personal popularity commanded by his frank generosity and extreme kindness of nature that no token of respect or honor he might consent to accept would have been denied to him by a devoted constituency.

It combines all the latest improvements for strength, durability, safety and adaptability to the purpose for which it is intended. It is located in Twenty-seventh-street, between Second and Third avenues, and extends through to Twenty-eighth-street. The main building measures 55 feet front and 130 feet deep, on the two first floors, and 55 feet front and 100 feet deep, on the two upper floors, and has front wings measuring 25 feet by 26 feet, and rear wings 41 feet by 25 feet. The whole edifice is contracted of brick, with brown-stone facings on Twenty-seventh-street. The rafters are of iron, and the floors of arched brick-work similar to that of the TIMES building, thus rendering the structure fire-proof. There are thirty-four class-rooms in all, affording accommodations for teaching 1,000 pupils in the grammar-school and 1,500 in the primaries. Each class-room is provided with a wardrobe for the use of the scholars of that room, under the immediate eye of the teacher -- thus avoiding much of the loss of wearing apparel complained of at present. There are no less than 14,000 feet of play-ground, of which 5,000 feet is under cover, comprising arrangements for calisthenics. The exits from all the rooms are of ample proportions -- no less than five for the primary department floors, and three for the school-rooms of the older classes. All the stairways used by the children are built of stone. The ventilation and heating are upon the latest approved plans, being calculated to afford the utmost amount of heat and pure air requisite at all seasons.

Is it pure zeal for the maintenance and development of their favorite domestic institution, or is the consummation of a natural antagonism of interests, especially in matters of commerce? Is the question of Slavery subordinate to that of Free Trade, or is Free Trade the bribe offered to foreign nations in consideration of their pocketing their scruples about Slavery? We have had the Message of a President, and we have now the address of an Anti-President, yet we are little wiser than before, familiar as we have become during the past year with the manifestoes of outgoing and incoming monarchs, and the utterances of statesmen in every conceivable predicament, we have never read a public document so difficult to analyze and interpret as this. It begins with lofty tribute to the wisdom and patriotism of Southern planters, and a recognition of the provisional character of the existing Government; then comes an allegation that the Union has been ""perverted from the purposes for which it was ordained,"" and a solemn appeal to Heaven that ""He who knows the hearts of men will judge of the sincerity with which we intended to preserve the Government of our fathers in its spirit;"" next, it repudiates the ""abuse of language,"" by which the term ""revolution"" has been applied to the act of the South. The allusions to commercial policy which follow seem primarily addressed to European States, but before long, we do not exactly know how, we find ourselves again in the midst of American politics, and discover that Mr. DAVIS is not only preaching non-intervention, based on a ""just perception of mutual interests,"" to his Northern rival, but is actually indulging the hope -- not that Southern fanaticism will be cooled, but that, enlightened by experience, ""the States from which we have recently parted may seek to unite their fortunes with ours under the Government we have instituted."" Not that Mr. DAVIS cares much whether they do or not. On the contrary, he confidently appeals to the issue of arms, and significantly alludes to ""the well-known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of an enemy."" He doubts whether there is so ""much of homogeneity"" between the interests of the two Confederations that ""the welfare of every portion would be the aim of the whole."" He fearlessly relies on the innate force of a ""movement sanctioned by its justice and sustained by a virtuous people,"" and does not hesitate to assume that Divine Providence is on the side of Slavery, which, probably from motives of delicacy, he never mentions by name, but which must certainly be indicated by one or all of the sounding phrases, ""honor, right, liberty and equality,"" since we are told that it is these principles which inspire ""a purpose of high resolve"" in the heroic Southerners.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Topics Abroad.; THE NEW TARIFF AND THE INAUGURAL OF PRESIDENT DAVIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Topics Abroad.; THE NEW TARIFF AND THE INAUGURAL OF PRESIDENT DAVIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, March 8', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'March', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f15b492b-315d-5822-b8a5-f90a7ff4c936,1574,nyt://article/f15b492b-315d-5822-b8a5-f90a7ff4c936

It appears from the complaint of the plaintff that the defendant advertised certain property for sale, at public auction, the proceeds of which were to be applied to the Sinking Fund of this City. On the 27th of December, 1852, the said property was sold pursuant to the advertisement, at which sale the plaintiff became the purchaser of twelve of the said lots, for which he took a warranty deed with full covenants. The price paid by the plaintiff was the sum of $9,000, of this $2,250 were paid in cash, and a mortgage given back to the defendants for the balance, on which plaintiff alleges that he has regularly paid the interest. The plaintiff then states that he then entered into possession of the premises conveyed, but that on the 5th of February, 1856, defendants entered upon the premises and evicted him therefrom, insisting, as alleged, that they entered upon the possession of the said property by virtue of an Act of the Legislature relative to public parks in this City. The plaintiff further alleges that at the time defendants sold said property to him they were endeavoring to have the said Act passed by the Legislature, and that such Act was passed at the special instance of the defendants. The plaintiff further alleges that adequate satisfaction has been denied him by the defendants, and asks, the equity powers of this Court to cancel the deed and the mortgage, and that he be fully compensated for all charges that he has been put to since he came into possession. The defendants deny all the material allegations in the complaint, aver that it became necessary, under and by virtue of said act, to appropriate said property, that adequate compensation has been awarded by Commissioners appointed pursuant to said act, and that the plaintiff has refused to accept the same.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Transfer of Corporation Lots Alleged Wrongful Eviction.; COMMON PLEAS TRIAL TERM.

An informal ballot for a candidate for Mayor was then had, with the following result: Henry A. Kent, 13; Frederick Scholes, 13; Thomas H. Rodman, 9; Wm.A. Coit, 8; George Hall, 7; Stephen Crowell, 3; Smith J. Eastman, 3; E.A. Lambert, I. On the first formal ballot the vote stood: Kent, 25; Hall, 19; Coit, 9. Twenty nine votes being necessary for a choice, the second formal ballot was taken, and resulted as follows: Kent, 29; Hall, 19; Coit, 9; whereupon the nomination of Mr. KENT was made unanimous. The officers of the meeting were appointed a Committee to notify Mr. KENT of his nomination; and the Convention, after giving three hearty cheers for the nominee, adjourned to meet again upon the call of the Chairman. Mr. KENT was once a member of the Common Council for two years, and for one year was President of that body. He resides at Bay Ridge. The Committee last night proceeded to his residence to fulfill the duties assigned them, when they ascertained from Mr. KENT that he would positively decline to accept the nomination -- purely, however, from business considerations. The Committee have accordingly called the Convention to meet again to-night at 8 o'clock, at the same place, to make another nomination.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/957ec5d9-f9b1-5e28-af14-5a2d5d04f89e,494,nyt://article/957ec5d9-f9b1-5e28-af14-5a2d5d04f89e

The peculiar features of the matter served to attract a throng about the premises, who gazed at the Bank and peered into the basement which the robbers had occupied in hopes of catching a glimpse of the mouth of the subterranean passage. To avoid annoyance from the crowd, the officers of the Bank, early in the day, called for a force of police sufficient to keep them in check. Capt. JAMESON complied by sending a squad of men, who were inexorable in their determination of allowing none to go and look at the excavation. The police feel confident that the bold thieves engaged in this burglary will finally fall into their hands, and the detectives are sanguine of their ability to obtain evidence sufficient to bring the guilty to justice. Capt. JAMESON and Detective KEEFE have arrested an Englishman named JOHN SHEFFIELD, who has the reputation of being an expert burglar, on suspicion of being implicated in the matter. The prisoner is said to have been a confederate and companion of DICK COLLARD, DANIEL BARTLETT and JOSEPH MEYERS, against whom the record is very bad. COLLARD and the other men were arrested by Detective KEEFE a few weeks ago, having been found together under suspicious circumstances in the vicinity of the very bank where the present burglary was perpetrated. Upon COLLARD at that time an assortment of skeleton keys was found, with wax for taking impressions of locks, and Justice KELLY deemed the fact evidence of a character to warrant his detention, and he is now in confinement at the City Prison. With regard to SHEFFIELD, there is no positive evidence against him, but his manner and insinuations are such that the officers entertain a strong belief in his complicity with the rogues for whom they are in search. He is held, pending further developments. Mr. JOHN ALCOCK, the fortunate manufacturer of rag carpets, to whom the burglars paid $1 000 cash for the goodwill and fixtures of the basement, presented himself at the Third Ward Station house during the day, but as no suspicion attaches to him in the case, he was not placed under arrest, He left his address with Capt. JAMESON in case this testimony should be required.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f04c6bb9-301f-55ed-b575-c214a96c3a32,1179,nyt://article/f04c6bb9-301f-55ed-b575-c214a96c3a32

This matter is one affecting the safety of human life, not alone by making provision for the proper construction of buildings, but also by insisting that suitable means of escape should be attached to tenement-houses of this City in case of fire. Some of the provisions of the bill appear to be distasteful to landlords as well as to a considerable portion of the Fire Department, and it is understood that a strong lobby influence is at work to defeat the whole matter. The landlords look upon the twenty-fifth section of the bill with especial disfavor, because it requires fire-proof stairs, balconies, iron bridges, and other means of escape on all isolated houses, containing more than six families; while the firemen find an objectionable feature in the demand that the Inspectors of Buildings must be practical mechanics. They do not think it a fair thing either that the appointment of these officials should be taken out of the hands of the Chief Engineer and his Assistants, where it at present rests, and are in favor of requiring no other qualification for the position than the fact that its incumbent must be an exempt fireman.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TENEMENT-HOUSES AND THE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TENEMENT-HOUSES AND THE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5dd6cf04-68ae-50b1-8516-ddca89348178,307,nyt://article/5dd6cf04-68ae-50b1-8516-ddca89348178

"The publication of the aggregate returns of the census of 1860 enables us to present in the form of a compact and striking diagram the relative growth of each State in the Union from the year 1790 until the present time. It is upon precisely the same plan as the diagram by which some few years ago we illustrated the results of the census of 1850. We are indebted now, as we were then, to Prof. GILLESPIE, of Union College, for this idea. The character of the diagram is seen at a glance. In the left hand column the States are arranged in the order of their actual rank in 1790, -- Virginia being first, Massachusetts second, Tennesse sixteenth, &c., in order of population. I the right-hand column they are arranged in the order of their respective ranks in 1860, -- New-York first, Tennessee ninth, Michigan sixteenth, &c. The intervening space is divided into parts, each representing ten years. The heavily shaded lines extending across these columns trace, by their zigzag course, the ups and downs of the several States, in their relative rank at intervals of ten years each, during the seventy years that have elapsed. Thus Virginia, which stood first in 1790, held that rank for two periods until 1810, when she began to decline, and became second in 1820, third in 1830, and fourth in 1840, which position she continued to hold until 1850, when she again began to decline, and is now the fifth. New-York, beginning fifth, became third in ten years, second in ten more, first in ten more, and has held that proud position ever since. The decline of some of the States has been as rapid and marked as the advance of others. Thus, New-Hampshire, standing tenth in 1790, fell to the eleventh in 1800, to the fifteenth, in 1810, and held that position ten years, when she again fell to the eighteenth in 1830, to the twenty-second in 1840, and held that place until 1850, when she entered upon a very rapid relative decline, and in 1860 was the twenty-seventh. Ohio, on the other hand, which entered upon the course in 1800 as the seventeenth., rose to be thirteenth in 1810, to be fifth in 1820, fourth in 1830, and third in 1840 -- the position which she holds at present. Others of the States have been marked by curious alterations. Thus, Mississippi, beginning nineteenth in 1800, held that place ten years; in 1820 she had fallen to the twenty-first, and in 1830 to the twenly-sccond, when she began to rise, and, in 1840 stood seventeenth, fifteenth in 1850, and fourteenth in 1860. Arkansas is the only State which held the same relative rank in 1850 as she had at the beginning, and her position has been changed every ten years since her existence, and is now twenty-fifth, which is one degree higher than she started, and is the same which she held in 1840.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/28/archives/ups-and-downs-of-the-states.html,,"The publication of the aggregate returns of the census of 1860 enables us to present in the form of a compact and striking diagram the relative growth of each State in the Union from the year 1790 until the present time.

"NIBLO'S GARDEN. -- Next to Mr. FORREST'S unprecedented engagement, the most auspicious event of the season is the return home of Nixon's Royal Circus, which took place last evening, and was witnessed by an audience packed to the steaming point. The troupe has lately been in Havana, and in that gay capital has enjoyed a success which was not, we hope, quite so bad a failure as ordinary successes are apt to be there. The HANLONS were greatly admired; ZOYARA created a sensation, and a Spanish Clown revenged himself on his species by making jokes, which, it may readily be believed, were no better than they should be.

She is propelled by three oscillating engines of 800 nominal and 3,500 actual horse-power, with cylinders 80 inches in diameter; has 8 boilers, with 20,000 square feet of heating surface, and 40 furnaces, fitted up with BEARDSMORE'S and GALLOWAY'S patent superheaters. The ship is built in water-tight compartments. She makes up a total of 650 berths, 567 of which are for passengers, and the whole of the saloonand cabin accommodation is of the most superior character. The trial to-day took place under verydisadvantageous circumstances, the wind blowing heavily from the northwest, the force being calculated at from 6 to 8.

"The Madrid journals of the 5th contain reports of what took place in the Congress on the preceding day with respect to the incident mentioned by telegraph -- the interpellation on the subject of a speech of Lord PALMERSTON attacking the conduct of Spain with regard to the Slave trade, and the reply which the Duke de Tetuan (O'DONNELL) gave to it. It was M. GONZALEZ BRAVO who drew attention to the language of Lord PALMERSTON, and who demanded explanations from the Government respecting it; and, in doing so, be described that language as ""sovereignly offensive"" to Spain. The Duke de Tetuan, in answer, said: ""I rise to give ample explanations to show the injustice of the accusations which have been brought not only against the Spanish Government -- which is a very grave fact -- but against the Spanish nation -- a circumstance which augments the gravity of the language used in the English Chamber."" The Minister then proceeded to say that in 1835 Spain had entered into a treaty to put down the Slave trade, and he maintained that she had faithfully executed it, in proof of which he dwelt on the fact that the value of a slave in Cuba is now three or four fold what it was then. He affirmed that the different Captains-General of Cuba, and especially Gens. DE LA CONCHA and SERRANO, had always exerted themselves actively to prevent the introduction of slaves into the island. He stated that the English Cabinet itself had on more than one occasion borne testimony to the efforts made by the Spanish Government to put down the Slave-trade; and he contended that if certain Spaniards had engaged in that illegal traffic neither the Government nor the nation was responsible. He next went on to say that probably the language used by Lord PALMERSTON had fallen from him to the heat of debate, and would not be repeated in a calmer moment; and he then made the declaration, briefly mentioned by telegraph, which is as follows: ""The Government declares that it has received no official communication couched in the terms used in the House of Commons, nor in anything like them, and it hopes that none will be sent. But if such an one should be forwarded the Spanish Government will not receive it or, at least, will not give any answer whatever to it."" This drew forth loud applause, and the Minister, after hinting that perhaps the language ascribed to Lord PALMERSTON might not have been correctly translated, repeated the declaration. M. GONZALES BRAVO thanked the President of the Council for what he said, and the latter declared that, though in Spain party dissensions might exist, yet that when the honor or the independence of the Spanish nation was attacked, all Spaniards would rise as one man to defend it.

The London Times has never been recognized by our Goverment as an independent sovereignty; but there is no Minister at Washington whose intelligent friendship is now half so important to our Government, as that of the Envoy from that journal. He has come here on a special mission, on behalf of the people of Great Britain. His duties are precisely those which the Envoys of every great Power profess to perform, -- namely, to keep his principals advised of all transactions in which their interests are involved, and to establish such relations, and inaugurate such a policy, as their permanent welfare may seem to require. But unlike them he performs his task in the face of the world. His dispatches are not filed away in dusty pigeon holes, and kept sacred from sight or knowledge of men, until they have lost all their importance, and may be published without danger of producing any effect. It is his mission to spread, day by day, before the world, the fullest reports of whatever he may see and hear, with such inferences and comments as his judgment and experience may prompt. He represents the people, and not the placemen of England: and he transacts the business of his mission directly with them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Minister.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Minister.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d819dce-976b-513f-814c-fe74446c845a,517,nyt://article/0d819dce-976b-513f-814c-fe74446c845a

SANDERS, being refused a Federal clearance at Mobile for Havana, was compelled to proceed without one, the Captain making the usual ""protest"" before the Spanish Consul. On his arrival here with a cargo from Havana, the vessel was charged $250 foreign tonnage duties, and was then seized for forfeiture as a foreign vessel sailing without a proper register. These facts having been laid before the Secretary of the Treasury, through the United States District Attorney here, Mr. CHASE has remitted the forfeiture of the vessel on the payment of all cost, charges and expenses. The cargo of the vessel will also be released, without doubt, but some delay in the papers reaching Washington probably accounts for the non-receipt of that order also by the same mail. As this case forms a precedent for action in others of the same character, it is thought that all seizures of vessels for like causes will hereafter be discontinued. A sharp look-out, however, will be kept on all vessels arriving from seceded ports for foreign goods which have not paid the duties. While the costs and expenses in these cases are somewhat onerous to the parties concerned, and must operate against their hereafter seeking these ports for freight, they would have been much greater had the ""monitions"" and other steps for the forfeiture of the vessels been made out.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SECESSION AND COMMERCE.; THE SCHOONER RESTLESS RELEASED.

San Domingo is the first point to which she has directed her attention, and we now receive the astounding announcement that a virtual annexation has already taken place. During some time past, it appears, a system of colonization has been quietly going on, large bodies of emigrants being introduced upon the island, with the view of promoting disaffection towards the existing Government, and otherwise furthering the interests of Spain. On the 16th inst. the Spanish flag was hoisted, much to the astonishment of the blacks and native population, who appear to have been taken entirely by surprise; and on the 23d, immediately on the receipt of the news at Havana, the Spanish frigate Blanca sailed to the assistance of the colonists, fully armed and equipped, and with a large number of troops on board. She was to be followed as soon as possible by two screw steam-frigates, with an army of 5,000 men, when the ""protectorate,"" as the Spaniards are pleased to term it, would be fully established.

The young man was first arrested three weeks ago, by officer LUZ, of Elmira, who came to this City for the purpose. LEE, on that occasion, put his prisoner under lock and key in a hotel in Robinson-street, and went himself to look at the interesting things about the City. During his absence his captive escaped by jumping from the window of the room in which he was confined, and remained at large several days. Finally having been recaptured, he was handcuffed and departed in LEE'S custody for Elmira, via the New-York and Erie Railroad. Before reaching Port Jervis Mr. LEE was taken sick, and leaving his prisoner in the rear car of the train, he went forward to take a nap in the baggage car. When he awoke, to his utter astonishment he discovered that POTTER had again given him the slip, though without intending to do so, as the car in which he was riding was switched off at Port Jervis and detached from the train. Before a telegram could notify the authorities at Port Jervis to arrest the young man, he had taken his departure, carrying with him, it is alleged, a carpet bag containing his late custodian's property, with which he came back to this City. POTTER, however, denies that he committed the last mentioned theft.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/03/30/archives/the-great-question.html,,"The predicament in which both the Government and the commerce of the country are placed, through the non-enforcement of our revenue laws, is now thoroughly understood the world over. It is as if we should enact that a certain number of our ports should be exempted from their operation. Importations would naturally tend toward these, although they might be greatly inferior in their accommodations or means for distribution. Twenty-five, or thirty, or fifty per cent, saved of their cost would amply compensate for a great many disadvantages. The enactment of such injustice by any Government, would afford good cause for its deposition. Is it much different to consent to its enactment by a rebelling State or port, whereby they may secure to themselves a crowning advantage at the cost of those remaining loyal? The result in both cases is the same, showing either alternative on the part of Government to be equally indefensible. Can Government for an instant rest under the imputation of counseling or permitting legislation that raises rebel provinces to power upon the ruins of those that remain faithful, and that secures to the favorable consideration of the civilized world a revolt, whose sole motive was the perpetuation of Slavery?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f24f4b44-5216-5c1a-9fee-89e26a3b185c,1029,nyt://article/f24f4b44-5216-5c1a-9fee-89e26a3b185c

In that somewhat storied street, commonly known as Mercer, a stately building devoted to books rears its head, and flings a ray of respectability through the whole length of the ruinous rue.
