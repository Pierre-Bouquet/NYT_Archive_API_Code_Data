The progress of secession has already had the effect to confirm beyond cavil the commercial supremacy of New-York. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/02/archives/the-internal-trade-of-newyork.html,,"The progress of secession has already had the effect to confirm beyond cavil the commercial supremacy of New-York. The City had previously monopolized the domestic export trade in breadstuffs and provisions, and in doing so had achieved the most remarkable success of this kind ever recorded. All her immense commerce is the creation of a well devised system of public works, controlled and directed by an enlightened and liberal policy. Thirty-six years ago, it cost $100 the ton to transport a ton of merchandise over either of the three routes between New-York and Lake Erie. Over the Erie Canal the cost per ton the past year, between the same points, averaged only $3. The effect of such reduction in transportation charges, was to enlarge in an equal degree the area of the trade of this great work. With a cost of $10 per ton this area would be described by a line drawn only a few miles from the shores of the Great Lakes. Every cent below this rate pushed this boundary in every direction further inland. The reduction of a dollar in transportation charges between Buffalo and New-York has the effect to increase the radius of this boundary 50 miles. Assuming the previous length of such radius to have been 200 miles, the extent of territories made tributary to the canal, and to the trade of the City, would equal 35,000 square miles. The reduction of another dollar per ton on cost of transportation would annex another area, equal to 45,000 square miles. This has been the method of the aggressions of New-York on the trade of the interior. By a constant reduction in the cost of transportation, she has steadily removed further and further from herself the line of debatable ground between herself and her rivals, till in the northwest she may be said to have driven every competitor from the field. The produce of upper Minnesota, after a circuit of more than 2,000 miles, helps to swell the vast volume which is now flowing into her harbor. But for our public works, the produce of this distant region, soon to become one of the most valuable auxiliaries to our trade, would have had no commercial value whatever.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Internal Trade of New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Internal Trade of New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49f3fc10-03e1-5d98-97a6-21f1b35e6e17,1248,nyt://article/49f3fc10-03e1-5d98-97a6-21f1b35e6e17

Jones and Richard Donovan, sailors, entered the drinking-place No. 203 South-street, and finding there another sailor named Stephen Goodwin, commenced to banter him, evidently with the object of causing a fight. Goodwin sought to avoid his tormentors by leaving the place, and was passing down Pier No. 35, East River, directly opposite the saloon, to go on board the ship Charles Hill, where he was employed, when the four men overtook him and beat him in a brutal manner. Having become tired of pounding the poor wretch with their fists and feet, the ruffians produced knives and stabbed him three times, -- once in the breast and twice in the side, -- causing wounds which there is no hope he can survive. The assailants fled as soon as they had satisfied their malice, and with considerable difficulty Goodwin dragged himself to his vessel, where he made his misfortune known. One of his shipmates went ashore to inform the police of the matter, and meeting Roundsman Rode and Officer Blair, of the Fourth Ward, he started them in pursuit of the assailants, whom, in a very short time, they found and arrested. As quickly as possible the injured man was removed to the New-York Hospital, where he received medical attention, but yesterday afternoon his condition was so unfavorable that Coroner SCHIRMER was summoned to take his ante mortem deposition. The prisoners having been placed before him he unhesitatingly pointed out Robinson as the man who had stabbed him, and Jackson as an accomplice in the assault. The Jury having heard the wounded man's story brought in a verdict against the accused, who were examined by the Coroner in the prescribed manner. Both men, however; denied the truth of the charge, and stated that they had never seen their victim before. The Coroner committed them to await the result of the injuries they had caused, and the two other seamen, Jones and Donovan, were held as witnesses.

"The Democratic State Convention, called to throw its weight into the seale in favor of the Union, was gathered to its constituency yesterday. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/02/archives/the-democrats-at-albany.html,,"The Democratic State Convention, called to throw its weight into the seale in favor of the Union, was gathered to its constituency yesterday. The fruit of its labors survives in the nomination of a conciliatory Commission, in its indorsement of Mr. CRITTENDEN's plan of compromise, and its protest against ""coercion"" -- that is, against the enforcement of the laws, the collection of the Federal revenues, and the recovery of Federal property. As affecting the great national question in a beneficial way, we must confess our doubts whether the restoration of order and unity is in the least likely to be promoted by such imperfect and contradictory suggestions. Nothing is more obvious than that if the Constitution lacks vigor to defend and perpetuate itself, and secure obedience to proper laws, it is not with the trouble of patching and tinkering with perishable compromises; and we may as well suffer the Union which rests upon so unstable a foundation to perish at once, as to totter to a tardy fall through another half century. And there are other no less palpable objections to this coupling of fidelity to the Constitution with impunity to treason. At the present moment six States of the Union are in arms, threatening the Federal Government, and demanding concessions so enormous and impossible, as to astound with their unspeakable arrogance. Opposed to these, is the great body of the American people, resolute to fight over again, if necessary, the battles which gave birth to our political system, and rendered its blessings possible; and by a firm vindication of the supremacy of law, to discourage any repetition of such seditious experiments. To the latter class these Democratic resolutions address themselves. They propose to have the defenders of the Constitution lay down their arms, in the presence of their armed adversaries; and accept such conditions as the ultra Southern party may prescribe, the victors to the conquered. For if there is no reason to believe that Mr. CRITTENDEN'S plan is acceptable to these reckless men, even when the alternative of civil war lies behind it, there is evidently the best reason to think that an assurance of peace in any event would put any such moderate basis wholly out of the question; and make reconciliation impracticable. If any doubt existed upon this point, the anxiety of Senator MASON, on Thursday, to ascertain Mr. SEWARD's view of coercion as the alternative of compromise, may set it at rest; especially if connected with WIGFALL'S subsequent declaration that no imaginable terms can now win back the seceded States. Without an absolute certainty of compulsion in the background, all schemes of conciliation are in fact futile.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Democrats at Albany.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Democrats at Albany.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/639b7c82-7b6f-5ce1-b17e-6b6c716a45f7,1263,nyt://article/639b7c82-7b6f-5ce1-b17e-6b6c716a45f7

We have of late had frequent occasion to notice a growing improvement in the style in which standard authors are presented by our book manufacturers to the public. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/02/archives/new-publications-critical-historical-and-miscellaneous-essays-by.html,,"We have of late had frequent occasion to notice a growing improvement in the style in which standard authors are presented by our book manufacturers to the public. The recent editions of BURTON'S Anatomy of Melancholy, of D'ISRAELI'S works, of CHARLES LAMB, of MONTAIGNE and some others, leave nothing to desire on the score of print or paper. They are unsurpassed by any of the issues of the foreign Press. The difference between these and their American predecessors is in the matter of taste as well as actual quality. The material and workmanship are better; but there is abundance of good material and good workmanship, which is sadly wanting in effect for lack of nicety in the preparation. A little wider margin, a little more finish in the binding and lettering, a slightly different tint of paper, make all the difference between a simply manufactured article and a book which is a book. It is like the cut of a coat, -- the cloth may be the same, the buttons may be the same in two garments and both may fit, while in the one case you look like a gentleman, in the other like anybody else. The majority of books are turned out, like so many blocks, by machine-work, with no suggestion of human art or handicraft about them. They have the appearance of being simply stamped or cut, so vilely mechanical are they, like the wooden books seen sometimes in public libraries or showcases. But the true book, worthy to put on the shelf of a private bookcase, and look a man in the face, in the sacred retirement of his library, should wear a different aspect. It should bear unmistakable indications of the skill of the binder, and the fidelity of the paper-maker and printer; its lettering should be clear and neat, its covers firm; -- in fine, if there is worthy authorship inside of it, it should wear the air of a gentleman, not of a plebeian.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; CRITICAL, HISTORICAL, AND MISCELLANEOUS ESSAYS, By Lord MACAULARY; with aMemoir and Index.

It will be seen by reference to our Washington dispatches that the Floridians consider themselves already in a state of actual war with the United States. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/02/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"It will be seen by reference to our Washington dispatches that the Floridians consider themselves already in a state of actual war with the United States. Lieut. JAMES E. JONETT, attached to the steamer Crusader, has reported himself to the Navy Department under peculiar circumstances. He had occasion, while temporarily employed on the Wyandotte, to go ashore at Pensacola, when he was immediately seized by the State troops as a prisoner of war, but was subsequently released on parol of honor, with the understanding that he was not to bear arms against the State of Florida. He was then furnished with a passport, with which he left the State and proceeded to New-Orleans, where he was again threatened with arrest; consequently he took the shortest route to Washington, where he awaits the commands of the Secretary of the Navy. This outrage of the Secessionists, however does not compare in magnitude with one contemplated at New-Orleans, but which was happily frustrated by the caution of those most immediately interested in its defeat. The Crusader itself, it seems, was to be siezed by the city authorities, while the officers were being entertained in a friendly way on shore. The bait did not take, and the Crusader still remains in the service of the Government. There was a general expectation in Washington, last evening, that exciting intelligence would soon be received from Charleston, but what this expectation was based on does not clearly appear. It probably grew out of the knowledge of the fact that Col. HAYNE has received his dispatches from Gov. PICKENS, relative to the proposed surrender of Fort Sumter, in connection with the fact that preparations are constantly going on in Charleston for an attack on that fortification. The Diplomatic Corps, it appears, are generally of opinion that a collision cannot now be avoided, and they have forwarded dispatches to their respective Governments to that effect.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f5dca4db-c790-55a1-a4b3-8d18b04d3c18,1490,nyt://article/f5dca4db-c790-55a1-a4b3-8d18b04d3c18

"Yankee land, represented by Boston-town, is so conveniently at hand that it is continually benefited by the generosity of Gotham. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/04/archives/art-gossip.html,,"Yankee land, represented by Boston-town, is so conveniently at hand that it is continually benefited by the generosity of Gotham. To that snow-covered region have recently been consigned the unclad forms of DUBUFE'S Adam and Eve, and the sweet rendering of the bare-footed Cinderella by VAN LERIUS. The solid men are welcome to all they can extract from the lifeless figures of our unwise progenitors, but we beg them to close their eyes to the beauties of Cinderella, and send her back again. There is one consolation, the picture is not very large, and that is enough to damn it in the eyes of the habitues of the Atheneum. In the GOUPIL Gallery the statue of the Lotus-eater, by Miss STEBBINS, attracts great attention. It represents a good-looking youth, who, with listless air and a sort of a devil-me-care expression, leans cross-legged against the stump of a tree, around which grows the lotus. On his head, placed with evident care is a garland of the treacherous plant, in his hand lies unclasped, a sprig of the same, which serves to call the attention of the beholder to the fact that the figure is undraped, while trailing upon the ground are various vines, on all of which are clusters of the oft-sung lotus. The anatomical execution of the work is exact, and it would be difficult to suggest any improvement in that department. One's idea of a Lotus eater, however, does not allow us to agree with the artist, in the desirability of so muscular a leg, more befitting a youthful Hercules, than one whose energies are sapped; whose muscles are relaxed; whose fire is gone; whose life is spiritless, and whose very existence is but a dream. The face is very beautiful; and to our mind, fully conveys the idea of a drowsy, half-conscious, self-satisfied, listless content, such as doubtless those gentry who indulged in the seductive berry were wont to experience. The stomach would not seem to indicate data from which such a bodily state could be deduced -- no hearty meal reposes therein, and were it not for the expression given by the other portions of the body, one would not conceive that L.E. had partaken of his dinner. The limbs are exquisitely modeled, and the feet are gems such as are not often found amongst those who subsist on heartier food. Miss STABBINS has succeeded, there is no doubt on that point, and we are pleased to learn that duplicates of this figure have already been ordered by several of her fellow-countrymen and admirers. At this same gallery the French and Flemish pictures, which have been so rare a treat to New-Yorkers during the Winter, will be sold at public auction on the evenings of Wednesday and Thursday next. There are few pictures in the collection, that are not very good, the majority of them being productions of the most distinguished living artists. Inducements have been offered to the agents to have the sale deferred, but for reasons of imperative necessity it will be held as advertised.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c9b063d-2eb9-5477-8790-291970bc8002,2028,nyt://article/1c9b063d-2eb9-5477-8790-291970bc8002

For the Free Confederacy a less encouraging prospect was anticipated. A narrow belt of territory, straggling irregularly from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in a rigorous climate, where agriculture is difficult, and the arts pursued with indifferent energy; a disjointed empire as defective for commercial intercourse or military purposes as the Kingdom of Prussia; there is nothing for the Northern States, according to this sagacious authority, but a protracted struggle with unkindly Nature, varied by contests with unfriendly nations, who will pour in at once upon their defenceless coasts and frontiers.

The acquisition of the country around the mouth of the Mississippi River was held by all parties sixty years ago to be absolutely essential to its free navigation, and to the public peace; and so deep-seated was this conviction, that President JEFFERSON, though imbued with a passionate admiration of and attachment to the French nation, hesitated not a moment to declare that it must be acquired at the hazard of a war with that great Power, at the highest period of its military glory, under BONAPARTE. JEFFERSON, who was the head and founder of the school of politicians which holds to a strict construction of the Constitution, freely admitted that no power existed in the Government to purchase Territories, or to admit States to be carved out of Territories lying beyond the limits of the Union, as defined in the Constitution itself. But recognizing the higher law of necessity, in the exigency before him, he hesitated not to take measures for the acquisition of Louisiana, in violation of the fundamental law, and trusted to the magnanimity of his country for his justification, and for the subsequent grant of power to make the treaty of purchase.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reasons for the Acquisition of Louisiana by Jefferson good for Retainingit by Lincoln.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reasons for the Acquisition of Louisiana by Jefferson good for Retainingit by Lincoln.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/762c8457-7537-5fb9-a2fa-7d291de83a13,1767,nyt://article/762c8457-7537-5fb9-a2fa-7d291de83a13

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/04/archives/effects-of-secession-in-florida.html,,"A gentleman who arrived recently from Florida, has called at the TIMES Office, and furnished us with some interesting items of news. He corroborates the accounts that we have from time to time published in regard to public opinion at the South. Secession in Florida was not effected by the vote of the people -- on the contrary, every effort was made to prevent an honest vote being taken. The Legislature, which directed that a Convention should be chosen, only allowed five days to intervene between the notice and the election. The consequence was that the country people, who were opposed to secession, had no opportunity to vote, and the people of the towns had it all their own way. No one in Florida entertains a doubt that a majority of property holders are Union and conservative, -- for a proposition made in the Convention to allow only property-holders to vote, was not entertained for a moment. The Secessionists of Florida are those who have everything to gain and nothing to lose -- and, for the present, they rule supreme. As an instance of the spirit that prevails, it is related that a Floridian, within the last month, entered the store of a Northern man and stabbed him four times, without any provocation whatever. Rushing out into the street, with the dripping weapon in his hand, he shouted, ""This is the blood of a G -- d d -- n Yankee; let us serve them all so!"" For this brutal murder the perpetrator was elected to the Florida Convention. Our informant, though himself as owner of negroes, and an advocate of the institution of Slavery, was twice fired at for wearing a Union cockade. A man in Florida who openly protesses loyalty to the Union, is called an Abolitionist, and is lucky if he escapes being lynched.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""EFFECT'S OF SECESSION IN FLORIDA."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""EFFECT'S OF SECESSION IN FLORIDA."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/953b05ca-470e-57b3-93f4-5d330efd0408,504,nyt://article/953b05ca-470e-57b3-93f4-5d330efd0408

It appeared from the statements of the witnesses that deceased was of very intemperate habits, and having indulged herself to excess on the night of the 30th of December, she became turbulent and cross, venting her anger upon a woman named JULIA MURPHY, living in the opposite apartment to that occupied by herself. For a time Mrs. MURPHY paid no attention to the abuse, but finally losing her temper in consequence of deceased having thrown a heavy stone jug several times against the door, she snatched a bowl from the table and threw it, striking the drunken woman on the forehead and knocking her down. The neighbors called in a physician who removed several small fragments of the bowl from the forehead of deceased, but she subsequently became delirious, and having lingered in much suffering until Friday, her death resulted. A post mortem examination of the body was made by Dr. WOOSTER BEACH, jr., who found that death had occurred from an abscess in the brain, produced, in his opinion, by the injuries received, and the case having been given to the jury, a verdict against Mrs. MURPHY was rendered. The accused, who has been in custody previous to the inquest, was then examined. She stated that she was 38 years of age and a native of Ireland, adding that the charge of having thrown a bowl at deceased was untrue -- she had not hit her with anything.

Clark vs. Thomas A. Davies. -- This cause was referred, in January, 1855, to Albert Matthews, to hear and determine the several issues therein; and now comes before this branch of the Court, upon an appeal from the findings of the Referee, the appeal having been taken by the defendant. The facts, as they appear from the pleadings and the findings of the referee are substantially as follows: Some time during the year 1843, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a partnership arrangement, by which they were to carry on the business of contracting for and erecting buildings in this City. By that agreement, the plaintiff, who was a practical builder, was to contribute his skill and knowledge as such, and the defendant, who is a practical architect, was also to contribute his skill and knowledge as such, and the two were to share equally in the profits of their enterprise. At this time it appears that the sum of $1,000 was contributed between them, but previous to the month of February, 1844, the defendant having become possessed of $12,000, it was further agreed between the parties that that sum should make up a part of their working capital. They then varied their former agreement so far as the same was to be applicable to the undertakings hereinafter mentioned. To-wit: that the said parties should on joint account, and as partners procure from the Ministers, Elders and Deacons of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of this City, leases of lots of land known as and by the Nos. 49 and 51 John-street and 3 Dutch-street in this City, for the purpose of erecting buildings thereon. In May 1844 they obtained a lease of said lots of the Dutch Church Corporation and commenced building thereon. These buildings, it is averred, rented for more than sufficient to pay for the ground rent and all other incidental expenses. The plaintiff sets out that under this agreement his share of the net profits up to February, 1843, is the sum of $2,541 69. In May, 1846, the defendant, it is alleged, made an agreement in writing with the plaintiff, in consideration of his services in erecting the buildings on this leasehold property to pay one-fourth of the sums of money that the said defendant should receive from the rents of said buildings during the term of ten years from May 1, 1844, after the deduction of expenses. The Referee found the facts substantially as above set forth; and further found and decided, that between the plaintiff and defendant, in respect to the leasehold property, there existed no partnership; that the written agreement of 1846 merged and extinguished all other agreements between the parties; and that said written agreement was a valid subsisting agreement between the parties.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Law of Partnership.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/05/archives/police-reports-a-very-unprofitable-transaction-brokers-conspiring.html,,"A few days since Mr. Dominico Chisachi, recently proprietor of a hat, cap and fur-store, at No, 146 Bowery, lodged a complaint before Justice OSBORNE against Geo. W. Markham, a broker, at No. 8 Pine-street; Dorrance Davis, engaged in a similar business at No. 19 Nassau-street, and another person, known as John M. Hodges, charging them with having conspired to defraud him of $1,600. It is alleged in the affidavit of the complainant that about the 10th of last month he advertised his store, including good-will and fixtures,) for sale. The defendant, Markham, had an interview with him and represented that he had been commissioned to purchase the property for a gentleman, named John M. Hodges, residing at No. 29 Fifth-avenue. With reference to payment, Markham stated that his principal was willing to buy for the sum asked, ($1,600,) but that instead of paying cash, he would give his promissory note, payable in three months, with collateral security in two bonds on the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, Illinois, valued at $800 each. Mr. Chisachi not appearing to be satisfied with the proposed terms, was referred by Markham to Davis, the other defendant, for information concerning Hodges and the Railroad Company. Calling upon Davis, he was told that what Markham had said with reference to the value of the bonds was perfectly true, and the latter added that they had been issued upon the security of 100,000 acres of land, valued, according to location, from $4 to $50 per acre, recently granted the Railroad Company by the State of Illinois. Davis also indorsed the representations which had been made about Hodges' wealth, whose note, he said, was negotiable, and would be taken anywhere without collateral security. Believing these statements Mr. Chisachi accepted the note and bonds, made his business over to Markham, and felt contented. He did not, however, remain many days in this happy condition, for he learned that as soon as Markham took possession of the store he sold the goods at auction and closed the place. His suspicions being thus awakened, Chisachi went to the bank where Hodges' note was made payable and was informed that no account was kept there in that gentleman's name. Next calling at the reputed residence of Mr. Hodges, in Fifth-avenue, his growing belief that he had been victimized received confirmation from the fact that no such person as the man he sought lived at the house in question. He subsequently ascertained that the Mount Vernon Railroad Company only existed in the imaginations of the accused, and therefore no invoked the law to redress his wrongs. Markham and Davis were yesterday apprehended by Sergeant Cropsey, of the First District Court, and to-day they will be examined on the charge.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""POLICE REPORTS.; A VERY UNPROFITABLE TRANSACTION BROKERS' CONSPIRING TO DEFRAUD."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""POLICE REPORTS.; A VERY UNPROFITABLE TRANSACTION BROKERS' CONSPIRING TO DEFRAUD."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/433cb992-f226-5292-b0c8-760be6f4fc68,456,nyt://article/433cb992-f226-5292-b0c8-760be6f4fc68

He appeals to the Legislature not to forget the long years which have been necessary to bring the Government to its present position, urges its members to take no step hastily, but to show their confidence in the judgment of the people by referring to them the action of the Convention. Texas has gone through one revolution with her people united, and they can be united again, if occasion requires, but they must remember that they will, themselves, have to raise the millions necessary for defending the frontiers of the State, if they declare in favor of secession, and that provision must be made at once for the thousands whom short crops have brought so near starvation.

HOUSTON urges the necessity of maintaining inviolate the credit of the State, says that he has hopes for the Union still, and warns the legislators that between Constitutional remedies and anarchy and civil war, he can see no middle ground.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dca5cd7-7c71-5304-a9f6-5f1de1ac0a56,3826,nyt://article/4dca5cd7-7c71-5304-a9f6-5f1de1ac0a56

It has in it no ad captandum points -- no special professions of purity -- no strongly worded promises that justice, and only justice, shall be administered from the Bench during his term of administration. Very probably Mr. HOFFMAN may think his previous character a sufficient guarantee that his judicial duties will be faithfully discharged; -- while in addition to this, it may perhaps be noteworthy that the Recordership is an office established by the Constitution and therefore not within the power of the State Legislature either to abolish or modify. This, therefore, may make him less eager for the immediate and sudden capture of public esteem -- his experience very likely teaching him that all violent passions are apt to be transitory, and that early professions of a too highly colored description are often fated to be painfully contrasted in the future with actions not in the least able to stand the test of comparison.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Recorder Hoffman's Charge."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Recorder Hoffman's Charge."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/94dcbca7-bc67-54c4-b453-3edeca05846e,1460,nyt://article/94dcbca7-bc67-54c4-b453-3edeca05846e

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. Before we utterly condemn the public of New-York for neglecting the musical opportunity now afforded them by the Artists' Association at the Fourteenth-street establishment, it may be well to inquire if the entertainments there provided are altogether what they should be. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/05/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Before we utterly condemn the public of New-York for neglecting the musical opportunity now afforded them by the Artists' Association at the Fourteenth-street establishment, it may be well to inquire if the entertainments there provided are altogether what they should be. We have had occasion recently to speak in not very favorable terms of two last performances, the ""Trovatore"" and ""Lucrezia Borgia."" These efforts, although in a beaten track, were decidedly below the average. They were gotten up with absolute disregard to the great requisite of opera -- a perfect ensemble -- and depended, for what little applause they received, on the accidental popularity of the principal female singer. With new artists like Miss HINKLEY and Mdlle. ELENA, it may be rapid business policy thus to depend on the kindness of an audience, but the liberality of throwing every thing on the weak shoulders of a debutante is a matter that may well be questioned. VERDI's ""Trovatore"" was given without proper rehearsal; DONIZETTI's ""Lucrezia Borgia,"" whether with rehearsal or without, was simply slaughtered. To the list we must now add ROSSINI's ""Barbiere di Siviglia,"" played last night scandalously by every member of the Artists' Association except Miss HINKLEY. We cannot speak of the performance in a critical way, because in every musical respect it was utterly beneath notice; a merely idiotic exhibition of vocalistic vagary. Miss HINKLEY was the only member of the troupe who tried to do justice to the composer's meaning. And when we say this, we mean no disrespect to the lady's ability, (which, happily, was manifest notwithstanding her wooden surroundings,) but on the contrary a compliment to her will and endeavor to do what was right and proper. For the rest, it was simply a contest between buffoons; a struggle for the ascendency in all that was absurd. The ""Barbiere,"" we are aware, is an opera which admits of comic expansion, but when men like BRIGNOLI, SUSINI and COLLETTI, indifferent to the composer's, music, try to be colloquially funny, what have we to dread? The first gentleman gave us an occasional bellow; the second an idiotic gabble of words; the third a growl. If even these things had been done with decent or ordinary, dramatic skillfulness, there would be less to object to; but blurted out as they were last night they seemed like the cheap resorts of mediocrity. Signor FERRI -- a true artist under ordinary influences -- endeavored, and occasionally with success, to struggle against the stream of general indifference to propriety, but in the concerted pieces was carried away by the current and became an obstruction like the rest. With this partial conciliation to a male artist of the caste we may dismiss the remainder with the remark that on any second rate European stage they would have been hissed from the presence of the public. Can we wonder at New-York indifference with these three illustrations of inefficiency before us?",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cda2c1da-1221-5df5-8bd8-9555fee2511f,1002,nyt://article/cda2c1da-1221-5df5-8bd8-9555fee2511f

"On Thursday afternoon, James Avery, a colored man of confiding temperament, residing at No. 288 Church-street, became acquainted with a young person named J.H. Berkett, also a descendant of Ham, whom he met at a Dutch grocery in Leonard-street.

"Stephen Goodwin, a sailor on the ship Charles Hill, lying at the foot of Catharine-slip, East River, died at the New-York Hospital on Monday morning from knife wounds received on Friday morning last in an affray with two seamen named William Robinson and John Jackson, whom he encountered in Duryea's drinking-place, corner of Catharine and South streets. Coroner SHIRMER held an inquest in the case yesterday morning and the particulars of the affray as developed by the testimony are as follows: About 12 1/2 o'clock on Thursday night four seamen named Donovan, Robinson, Jackson and Jones went to the saloon where deceased was sitting and called for drinks; while the men were standing at the bar, deceased approached them, making the remark to Donovan, that he had been on board the Charles Hill that morning for the purpose of shipping as a sailor; Donnovan told him that he was mistaken, but said, ""Never mind, take a drink with us;"" deceased assented, and then Robinson stepped toward him, saying, wish an oath, ""So, you're mate of a ship, and treat sailors like dogs, do you?"" following the interrogation with a blow; deceased stepped toward the door to avoid further trouble, but Robinson and the others followed him to the sidewalk, where he was beaten and stabbed, as he alleged in his ante-mortem deposition, by Robinson and Jackson, while Donovan and Jones witnessed the assault; the men all went into the porter house again after a minute's absence, and deceased made known to the bar keeper that he had been, stabbed in the breast; he went out again immediately, however, and making his way to his vessel, informed a shipmate of what had occurred, who won't after the Police and caused the apprehension of the assailants. Upon this testimony the jury brought in a verdict charging Robinson with having given the fatal wound and implicating Jackson as an accessory in the assault. The accused are both men about 24 years of age, and natives of Ireland. Each denied in emphatic terms the truth of the charge, adding that they had never seen deceased before.

Beside giving the name of the vessel in which the goods had come, describing the packages, and forging the consignees' names, to obtain possession of the property, it was necessary to imitate no less than seven different signatures of Custom-house officers, and also to counterfeit the oblong stamp of the delivery clerk, all of which was accomplished in so perfect a way that the order was accepted and duly honored. The Police were informed of the fraud, and Detectives MACDOUGAL and BENNETT have since, been searching for the forger.

The Roanoke, the same class frigate as the Wabash, is undergoing repairs in the Dry Dock. The force at work upon her is not very large, as a portion of the mechanics were drawn off and set to work upon the Wabash. The Roanoke, however, can be got ready for sea at very short notice. The repairs on the brig Perry have been completed, and she is now being fitted up. The steamers Corwin and Bibb and the frigate Savannah complete the list of vessels now at this Yard ready for service, or which can be got ready for service within a reasonable time.

The complaint avers that, in 1846, Lemuel Arnold and Caroline, his wife, filed a bill in the Court of Chancery, against the executors of William W. Gilbert to set aside the will of said Gilbert and to protect certain rights which Caroline Arnold had in his property. That to raise money to prosecute said Lemuel Arnold executed his bond in the sum of $5,000, conditioned to pay to a payee the name of whom was left blank in said instrument, the said sum of money, as soon as the estate should be distributed among the heirs-at-law. Lemuel Arnold and wife then joined in an instrument executed, the same conveying to the blank payee of the said bond, all her right, title and interest in the estate of said Gilbert. The said conveyance was also executed by Jane Gilbert, mother of Caroline, and Charlotte Brayton, trustees of Caroline, under an ante-nuptial agreement between the said Caroline and the said Lemuel, the said ante-nuptial agreement having been made Oct. 3, 1837. This bond and conveyance as aforesaid remained in the hands of the defendants until June, 1847, when, as alleged, Lemuel Arnold obtained the necessary loan from the plaintiff and surrendered to plaintiff the bond and conveyance, with the name of the payee left blank. Arnold carried on his suit against the estate of Gilbert until about May, 1853, when, it is alleged, the difficulty was mutually compromised between the parties, and Caroline Arnold received in her own right a large estate under said compromise. The bond given as aforesaid fell due some time in May, 1853, and not having been paid in accordance with its condition, this suit was brought to recover upon the same.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Is a Bond which is made Payable to a Blank Payee, Valid?; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.

Hurrying to the indicated place, the guardians of the public peace found a ring prepared, and a battle raging fierce and fast between two rising stars in the sporting sky, known as Pat Manning and Jimmy Clark. At the sudden irruption of the officers the spectators -- of whom there were fifty or more -- stood not upon the order of there going, but went without delay, and their disappearance was accomplished so quickly that none of the participants in the affair, save the principals, could be captured. The prisoners, wearing the scant costume of the ring, panting from overexertion, and with faces bruised and bloody, were led away to the cells, whence yesterday morning they were taken before Justice CONNOLLY, at the Jefferson Market Court. Having heard the case, the magistrate fixed the ball of each at $560, to keep the peace; and William Beard, representing himself to be owner of a drinking-saloon at No. 288 First-avenue, offered to go surety for the prisoners. Doubts having been expressed as to the credibility of his story, Beard became angry, and abusive, making it necessary for the very forbearing magistrate to commit him for contempt of Court. A messenger was afterwards sent to inquire if the man really owned the property, and returned with the report that it did not belong to him.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLICE REPORTS.; Total Eclipse of the Sporting Star.

At the fool of the stairs, on the floor below, there was another pool of blood, and appearances indicated that the injured man had lain down in that place. Assistance having been procured, BROCKMAN was removed to the Sixth Ward Station-house, where he received medical attention; but all efforts to restore his consciousness having failed, he was sent to the Hospital on Blackwell's Island. While at the Station-house, a dark-lantern was found in his pocket, and this fact gave rise to the supposition that, having been engaged in the commission of a burglary, he had fallen down stairs and received his injuries. This theory of the matter is not, however, sustained by the man's antecedents. He was formerly employed in the factory, had always borne the reputation of an honest man, and his friends state that the dark-lantern was placed in his pocket the night previous for the purpose of preventing some children playing with it. The door of the premises was locked, as usual, when the porter arrived on Wednesday morning, and no false keys or burglars' implements of any sort were found in the building.

As is usual in such cases, the Commissioners compelled her to make a complaint against her betrayer, for whom a warrant of arrest was issued by one of the Police Justices at Jefferson Market Court. While the woman awaited the appearance of the accused she was seen at Court by Officer Fischer, a policeman of the Twentieth Ward, who entered into conversation with her, and having learned the circumstances of her case, advised her to forego the prosecution and leave the matter to him, saying that a settlement might be effected, which would result to her pecuniary advantage. She accordingly quietly left the Court, and when the accused was brought in it became necessary to discharge him on account of the absence of the prosecutrix. A few days later Fischer called upon the seducer and frightened him into the payment of $45, under the representation that for that amount the woman had agreed to relinquish any and all claims upon him -- five dollars of the sum being given to a man in Eighth-avenue, who personated a lawyer and drew up the written release. The policeman afterwards called upon the woman whom he accompanied to the office of the Board of Charities and Correction, and by swearing that she had been six years in the country, under an assumed name procured for her a permit to Bellevue Hospital. Before seeing her safely in the Institution he told her that he had only been able to obtain seventeen dollars from her betrayer, one dollar of which sum he demanded as a recompense for his trouble, and $12 in addition as the entrance fee to the Hospital. The affair having thus been arranged, Fischer was congratulating himself upon the success of his rascality, when he was summoned a few days since before the Board of Police Commissioners, and to his surprise, tried upon a complaint for unofficer-like conduct, growing out of the transaction, which resulted on Wednesday in his dismissal from the force. His roguery was divulged in this way. The Commissioners of Emigration having suddenly last sight of the woman, feared that she had been foully dealt with, and, of course, sent to her seducer for an explanation; he told how he had settled the matter. Next the wards of Bellevue Hospital were searched, and the woman having seen found there, made a statement of Fischer's dealings with her.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLICE REPORTS.; THE VAGARIES OF A POLICEMAN.

There is not the slightest necessity for a hasty decision of the point by the Patent Office, for the present patent does not expire until October next, and every consideration of justice and fair dealing requires that so important a step should not be taken without a much more full investigation than this application has yet received. The effect of renewing the patent will be to compel every farmer to pay something over fifty dollars for every reaping machine he may use, -- not for the cost of its construction, but simply as tribute to Mr. MCCORMICK for the privilege of having one made. The only possible justification for such an act in any case, lies in the fact that the inventor has not been sufficiently rewarded for the time, labor and ingenuity bestowed upon his invention.

The evidence was reviewed at length, and the argument closed with a most able and eloquent appeal to the jury to vindicate the law of the land. His Honor Judge OGDEN then delivered his charge to the jury. It was impartial and just, and seemed to meet the approval of both sides. The evidence was graphically reviewed and the law explained on all doubtful points. In the charge the Judge took occasion to allude to the reporters who have attended the trial, expressing his satisfaction at the correctness of their reports, and also for their refraining from expressing any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.

"MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A SUPPOSED SLAVER. -- About a week ago, a fine clipper bark of 800 tons, called the Griffin, Capt. DAVIS, quietly left her moorings in New-York, and slipped over to Elizabethport. She was in full ballast, and was ready for sea, but had no cargo of any sort on board. It happened, however, that she left six thousand dollars worth of shipping liens in New-York. She had been recently coppered, refitted throughout, and provisioned for a long voyage, and had left the jurisdiction of the Sheriff and Marshal of New-York without discharging her liabilities. As she had no ostensible honest reason for going to Elizabethport, the creditors concluded that they were to be ""done"" in some manner out of the amount of their claims, and accordingly libeled the Griffin. She was seized on Monday by Mr. WM. H. JELLIFFE, an attorney for the New-York claimants, and put into the custody of the United States Marshal and the Sheriff. On Tuesday night, however, Capt. DAVIS gave the Sheriff's officers and Marshal's tip-slaves the slip, and went to sea without his papers.

It might be toward the Po; for there were confident assertions in a half-dozen usually well-informed quarters that a treaty has been arranged between Russia, Prussia and Austria, for the preservation to the latter of Venice.

"Rev. NICHOLAS MURRAY, D.D., died, at Elizabeth, New-Jersey, on Monday evening last. He was born in Ireland, in December, 1802, and, as his parents were Roman Catholics, he was brought up in that religion. When but sixteen years of age he came to this country, and became connected with the establishment of HARPER & BROTHERS, in this City. His active mind did not find itself satisfied with the doctrines of the Church in which he was educated, and soon after his arrival here, he abjured Roman Catholicism, and embraced the Protestant faith. At once he determined to devote himself to the Ministry, and, having completed his preparatory studies, he entered Williams College, where he graduated, in 1826. After having finished his theological course at the Princeton Seminary, he was settled over the Presbyterian Church, in Wilkesbarre, Pa., where he remained until July, 1834, when he was called to the Church in Elizabeth, N.J., of which he was Pastor at the time of his death. The title of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by the College of which he was an alumnus, in 1842. Prominent as Dr. MURRAY has been in the denomination to which he was attached, he has gained a still wider celebrity through the medium of his controversial writings. The letters which he wrote some years since to Archbishop HUGHES under the signature ""Kirwan"" were very extensively circulated in this country and did not serve to increase the reputation of the distinguished prelate to whom they were addressed, inasmuch as he found himself decidedly overmatched. So popular were those letters on account of the ability which marked them, and the genial and genuine Irish humor by which they were pervaded, that they were translated into several foreign languages and scattered through Europe. Another volume on a kindred subject, entitled Romanism at Home, was the result of a visit made to Europe in 1851. Last summer Dr. MURRAY again crossed the Atlantic, partly professionally, but chiefly for his health, and during his absence, contributed a series of interesting letters to the New-York Observer, -- the same paper which first published the Kirwan letters. So much did he seem benefited by this trip that long years of usefulness were anticipated for him. The announcement of his death will fall with startling suddenness upon his wide circle of friends and upon the still larger number of those to whom he was so well known by reputation.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/08/archives/obituary.html,,"Rev.

Under date of January 29, Judge MAGRATH replies in a long and rather obscure communication, stating that the difficulties anticipated must occur, if they occur at all, with vessels of three classes -- those owned by foreign powers, or those owned by States in the Union, and by the States out of the Union. With regard to the first class no difficulty can be foreseen, as the principles of public law, as recognized at Washington on this point, are plain. All treaties with the United States recognize the law under those treaties as binding upon all the States, and such treaties continue binding on the States which still maintain the Confederation known as the United States. Judge MAGRATH then proceeds to discuss the status of South Carolina. She has resumed her independence, he says, and only those States which maintain the existence of the United States as a despotism deny this fact. If a State, he says, has not a right to secede from the United States, then would the consequences have followed, that being free before the adoption of the Constitution, it lost its freedom by becoming a party to a compact to secure, among other things, a more perfect freedom.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN COLLECTOR COLCOCK AND JUDGE MAGRATH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN COLLECTOR COLCOCK AND JUDGE MAGRATH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d95de517-26cd-5840-a125-f1d462cea371,938,nyt://article/d95de517-26cd-5840-a125-f1d462cea371

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/09/archives/foreign-gossip.html,,"THE KING OF THE SKATERS. -- LOUIS NAPOLEON seems to be as much at home upon skates as he is on horseback. He, with the Empress and prominent members of their suites, is in the habit of indulging frequently in that amusement, and on a recent occasion went to a large pond opposite Suresnes for that purpose. As soon as the Emperor and the Court arrived, the sport commenced in very business-like style. The Empress got into a sledge, and M. HARTOGS, a German gentleman, whose proficiency as a skater attracted the Imperial notice two years ago, and who is now called at Court the Emperor's Aid-de-Camp de glace, had the honor of pushing Her Majesty on the ice. He look her along at railroad speed, and was out of sight of shore in less than a minute. The Emperor then put on his skates, and conducted the sledge of a lady whose name I could not learn. Afterwards Her Majesty ventured to skate, but only with the assistance of two gentlemen. She is not at her ease upon the ice, and, considering that she comes from sunny Spain, this is not to be wondered at. The Emperor is a very good skater. He does not attempt any tours de force, but he is perfectly master of his movements. His wont is to go along rather slowly, and he stops frequently to contemplate the animated scene around him. Not the least etiquette is observed on the ice. No clear space is kept about the Emperor or Empress. They go about just like anybody else, and to-day, unlike last evening, everybody, without exception, was allowed to skate at the same time with them. The Emperor had nothing whatever but his own adroitness to prevent him from being knocked over by the first tyro in the sport whose skates might run away with him. It was an interesting sight to see the master of so many legions, the mighty potentate upon whose mysterious breath the fate of so many nations hangs, slipping about unpretentiously on the ice, no squire or even servant following him, and apparently as much on an equality with the people about him as a carter is with a plowman on an English farm-yard pond. Once a young man, who saw the Emperor skating slowly along the middle of the lake, steered almost indiscreetly close to him and gave him the go by, with the evident intention of getting credit with the spectators for being the best skater. The Emperor then, without any apparent effort, increased his speed, gracefully distanced his opponent by a few yards, and, contented with his victory, resumed the steady pace which he seems to affect.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c34834f-35c2-5a11-8f27-62e6919a984d,1845,nyt://article/4c34834f-35c2-5a11-8f27-62e6919a984d

"The most important literary announcement of the present year is undoubtedly the fact that the fifth volume of Lord MACAULAY'S History of England is preparing for publication, under the editorship of his sister, Lady TREVELYAN. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/09/archives/literary-intelligence.html,,"-- The most important literary announcement of the present year is undoubtedly the fact that the fifth volume of Lord MACAULAY's History of England is preparing for publication, under the editorship of his sister, Lady TREVELYAN. It will contain the continuation of that work as far us the manuscript was left revised by him. The narrative is in immediate connection with the fourth volume, and, with two exceptions, is complete and consecutive, ending with the death of WILLIAM III. A full index to the entire work will be given in this volume. In confining the publication to the portion which received the author's last revision his literary executors practice a wise and considerate reticence -- too often entirely lost sight of. MACAULAY'S finished works are enough to secure his place in literature, and no good purpose is served by exposing the fragmentery rough drafts and sketches of the consummate artist. His treasures now, in the English Library Edition, will fill twelve volumes, octavo, (""History,"" 5 vols.; ""Critical Essays,"" 3 vols.; ""Miscellanies,"" 2 vols.; ""Parliamentary Speeches,"" 1 vol.; ""Poems and Ballads,"" 1 vol.,) a bulk not inconsiderable for one who was not a professed writer, and more certain to be kept in reremembrance than if their voluminousness was doubled.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58186d1c-8fff-570a-8541-b9a74d9c9d41,2008,nyt://article/58186d1c-8fff-570a-8541-b9a74d9c9d41

As 4,000,000 people in that country derive their support from the manufacture of this article, the question of supply, by which they are to be employed, is an all-absorbing one.

Comparatively few, therefore, enjoyed some of the best skating that has been afforded there this season. The many made a monstrous mistake. You might as well object that a fire is too hot for burning, or that snow is too slippery for sleighing, or that bells are too merry for jingling, or a State too seditious for seceding, as to urge that weather like that of yesterday is too frigid for a frolic on the ice. A nipping and an eager air gives zest to exercise on runners, as spices give snap to vapid viands; and skating, like beef, is made much more a la mode when some pungent relish is added. Who would prefer a sweltering August day, if nature permitted the anomaly, for a ride over the whitened, frozen, cracklink ground, to a season in which buffaloes and boon companions huddled around you are a comfort, and the body is braced and full of electricity, and the lungs are clear, and laughter and the bells bells ring out cheerily on the rushing wintry blast? And why should one rather skate when the weather is Spring-like and when one is not so buoyantly inclined to the exertion, and when but little effort warms one too completely, than when the gale is biting and savage, and tries to tie up your veins and curdle your blood, and throws down his icy gauntlet, and dares you to the combat -- you and all your caloric -- and shouts in your ear, and breathes defiance in your face, rouses all your spirit for the conflict, and only yields after you've overtaken him with earnest strides, and, panting, trample him beneath your sandal of steel?

SPRAGUE, of the Thirteenth Regiment, N.Y.S.M., gave their annual ball in the Academy of Music, Thursday night. The ball was one of the most successful affairs of the kind ever given in this city. Among the military gentlemen present were Major-Gen. DURYEA and Staff, Brigadier-Gen. CROOKE and Staff, Col. DURYEA, formerly of the Seventh Regiment, and officers representing the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Fifty-fifth and Seventy-first Regiments of New-York, and also the different Regiments in Kings County. The band of the Seventh Regiment, containing seventy piece, furnished music for the occasion. The great feature was a drill by Capt. SPRAGUE'S command. This commenced at about 11 1/2 o'clock, when the floor was cleared and thirty members of the corps were marched in by Capt SPRAGUE. The Company was formed in two ranks and exercised in the manual of arms, according to SCOTT'S heavy Infantry tactic -- first by the word of command, next by tap of the drum, and finally the ""silent drill."" The Company was then formed in three ranks and went through with the same manoeuvers, adding thereto the stacking and unstacking of muskets. The company retired, and dancing was resumed. Subsequently the floor was again cleared and the Company returned, dressed in the Zouave uniform, and went through with a part of HARDEE'S Light Infantry tactics.

Beyond multiplying the features of Presidential candidates and furnishing the country with an idea of how seceding Senators and Secretaries -- a collection by the way that would make a very valuable addition to the ""Rogues Gallery"" -- look, the latter gentlemen have done little during the present season. This stagnation is more severely felt since Winter is the harvest-time of engravers and artists generally. It is in anticipation of the long evenings that people seek those surroundings which shall make home pleasant; they look around for something to break the pale monotony of the walls and relieve the polished baldness of the centre-table. Notwithstanding the general dulness, however, the enterprising house of ROE LOCKWOOD & SON have got a work under way which bids fair to rival anything of the kind ever before undertaken in this country. We allude to their series of Audulon's Birds of America, the initial plates of which are before us. The feathered Americans are drawn with a fidelity only equaled by the faithfulness of color with which their plumage is rendered. The work is expensive, and must necessarily have a somewhat contracted circulation, but it is very certain to attract the attention of ornithologists, and if its merit does not reach the heart and pockets of many of our merchant [???], it will be simply because they are rocked into an apathy to Art in the cradle of the Crisis.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/47fdfa31-ef76-599c-846e-40e711cccafc,926,nyt://article/47fdfa31-ef76-599c-846e-40e711cccafc

"At a few minutes before 3 o'clock on Friday morning, Feb. 8, Dr. JOHN W. FRANCIS expired. For nine weeks he had been stretched on a bed of suffering. This unprecedented lapse of his usual professional activity and social enjoyment had in no small degree weaned him from that strong interest in life which was a peculiar trait of his character; and great physical pain had subdued the vivacity, while it failed to impair the clearness of his mind. Accordingly, there were times when he contemplated death with calmness as a desirable release; and on more than one occasion, he expressed his entire resignation to the will of God; at other times he rallied and indulged hopes of recovery -- hopes which his physicians, family and friends earnestly shared. The case was a peculiar one -- a prolonged nervous disturbance that interfered with sleep, and seriously lessened the assimilative process of the constitution, and a crisis resulted from poverty of blood. An ominous carbuncle on the back, gradually impaired the vital force; the process of healing commenced and progressed favorably -- but too late. The original trouble was complicated with another serious drain upon the patient's strength, and frequent attacks of exhaustion and collapse at length ended fatally. Dr. FRANCIS died in the full possession of his faculties, and without pain. He spoke words of affection and of faith, and expired surrounded by those most dear to him; and so perfectly conscious that his last hour had arrived, that he announced it distinctly and emphatically but a few moments before his departure. He has never been the same man since the loss of his eldest son, an event which occurred six years ago, and deprived him of the seasonable respite he proposed to himself, in resigning some of his professional cares to the inheritor of his talents and his tastes.

The bidding was very spirited, and prices most extravagant, considering the state of finances generally, were obtained. But few pictures were withdrawn, and the vast majority sold at rates most satisfactory to the original proprietors, and doubtless gratifying to the bumps of approbativeness located on the craniums of the artists. SNUYDER's ""Tour of Distia"" brought the minimum rate $18; and MULLER's ""Letter-writer of Venice"" drew the moderate sum of $575. Other pictures had been disposed of at fancy prices at private sale, which were of greater value than these. One landscape, a small work of ROUSSEAU's, sold for $700, and others by eminent artists, brought from $500 to $800. On the whole, we think GOUPIL & Co. ought be satisfied with the result of their Third Annual Exhibition and Sale -- and we resume they are.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ART GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/619d3a53-34d4-5f03-9f01-e4895203786b,1335,nyt://article/619d3a53-34d4-5f03-9f01-e4895203786b

The action was tried in December, 1860, before Mr. Justice WOODRUFF and a jury, and the plaintiff was awarded damages to the amount of $1,101 94. An appeal is now taken to this term of the Court, and a new trial asked, on the ground that the verdict was rendered against the weight of evidence. The following are a few of the facts of the case, as they were elicited upon the trial. The plaintiff being placed upon the stand as a witness in her own behalf, testified that she went into the house of defendant as a hired help, for general housework; that the defendant lived in Greenwich-avenue, between Twelfth- and Thirteenth streets, in this City; that when the plaintiff first came to the house of the defendant, defendant told her he would like her, and that he would like to marry a German woman, and asked the plaintiff if she would marry him; plaintiff testifies that at first she told him nothing, believing him to be only in fun; plaintiff then told him after his constant importunities that he ought not to fool her, that she was a poor woman and he a wealthy man; to which he answered that was no matter, that he did not go in for richness and poorness, and then told her that he would rather have a poor woman who could work than a rich woman who had a great deal of property, telling her that he did not wish to be bossed by any woman. She further testified that she thought a great deal of the man and saw that he liked her. It appears that they mutually promised to marry each other. Sometime after this the defendant was taken sick. Plaintiff then testifies that shortly after this she felt that she was in a delicate condition, and told him about it, to which he replied that he did not believe it. Upon assuring him that such was the case, he told her that if such was the case he would give her his nephew for a husband, and set him up in business.

"The circumstances attending the suicide of Mr. Otis T. Peters, a native of Connecticut, 52 years of age, at Mrs. Schoonmaker's boarding-house, No. 26 Fourth-avenue, on Sunday morning last, were made the subject of inquiry, yesterday, by Coroner JACKMAN. It appeared from the testimony of Officer Little, of the Fifteenth Ward, who resides in the house where the occurrence happened, that on Sunday morning, when he went home to breakfast, about 6 1/2 o'clock, Mrs. Schoonmaker called him to the bedroom of the deceased, whom he found with a razor in his hand. Witness called for assistance, and two of the gentlemen boarding in the house came up. After much trouble, they succeeded in taking the razor from deceased, but in a short time he procured another razor, and the fact having come to Mrs. Schoonmaker's knowledge, she again called upon witness to go to him. Witness and some of the other boarders watched deceased for over an hour, and told him if he attempted to cut his throat they would knock him down. Regardless of the threat, however, he raised his right arm to draw the razor across his throat, but was prevented by witness, who struck him with a club, disabling his right arm. In an instant he changed the instrument to his left hand, and drew it across his throat, inflicting a wound from which he did not survive more than a couple of minutes. This testimony was corroborated by other witnesses, and the case having been submitted to the jury, a verdict of suicide while temporarily deranged was rendered.

We state this at the outset, because for the last twenty years, during which period VERDI has written twenty-one important works, and supplied the Italian stage of two worlds with almost all its new music, it has been customary to say after the production of a novelty, that Signor VERDI has not added to his reputation by the same, and because moreover it is stated that that truly illustrious and remarkable composer has expressed an intention of not resuming the pen. He has abandoned the lyre for the sabre, and at this moment is probably in the ranks of GARIBALDI. The last works of great composers are usually their best, and although exception may be taken to certain numbers in the ""Masquerade Ball,"" we are disposed to regard it as a success, even if it should -- as we trust may not be the case -- close the career of one of the most remarkable musical geniuses the world has ever seen.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Academy of Music.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Academy of Music.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Music', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-02-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6099e00-468e-52b7-9dfc-79febe9bc81c,3145,nyt://article/f6099e00-468e-52b7-9dfc-79febe9bc81c

"Messrs. Heule Brothers, jewelers, having an office at No. 26 Maiden lane, corner of Nassau-street, on the third story of the premises, very nearly lost about $40,000 worth of property on Monday night through the operations of a couple of adroit burglars, whose arrest was effected just at the point when their plans for possessing the plunder approached fruition. The circumstances of the case are as follows: Shortly before 11 o'clock on Monday night a private watchman named Cavannah noticed that the window shades in Messrs. Heule Brothers' office were not lowered as usual, and deeming the fact strange, he called Officers Troy and McDonough, of the Second Precinct, and told them of it. A key to the outer door of the building was procured, and on going up stairs the door of the jewelers' office was found to be firmly barred on the inside. This fact confirmed the officers suspicions that burglars were within, and Cavannah went to inform the proprietor of the place, leaving Troy to guard the office door, and McDonough to act as sentinel at the street door. The Policemen had scarcely taken their stations when the burglars, becoming alarmed, and having no other means of exit, removed the barricades, and made a rush for the street. Troy managed to secure one of them, who gave the name of Charles Crooks; and Officer McDonough having heard the scuffle up stairs, at first held the street door firmly closed, but presently he opened it and arrested the other burglar named George Turner, who was making a desperate effort to get out. The prisoners, both of whom are respectable in appearance and unknown to the Police, were conducted to the Station house and searched. On Crooks were found a gold watch and chain, over a hundred dollars in gold coin, and a loaded Colt's revolver. His companion carried various skeleton keys, one of which unscrewed at the top, thus admitting the attachment of any kind of ward, a key fitting the street door, and two of Adams' five-barrel revolvers. On the floor of Messrs. Henle Brothers' office the policemen found an assortment of burglars' tools, consisting of an iron drill with two bits, one for iron and the other for wood; a double master-key, a bit-handle shaped like an auger-handle, a screwdriver and nippe to extract screws, a jimmy and two packages of powder, a coil of fuse, a blow-pipe to blow the powder into the safe, a file, and a ""jimmy,"" which was bent. The prisoners were yesterday taken before Justice KELLY, at the Tombs, and examined upon the charge. They are both Englishmen, unmarried, and each is about 23 years of age. They stated that they had entered the office about 6 o'clock in the evening, by the aid of a skeleton key, and commenced operations upon the safe containing the diamonds, which is of Herring's make, about 4 feet square. The safe stood in a closet, upon a platform, a foot and a halt in height, and to work at it conveniently it was necessary to remove it away from the wall. This awkward job was accomplished by the burglars, who made an inclined plane of some pasteboards which they found in the room above the office, and when interrupted they were engaged in removing the screws from the back part of the safe. There is no doubt that the prisoners, from their perfect equipment in burglars' tools, and their ingenious manner of working, are experienced rogues, probably recently arrived from England. Justice KELLY committed each of them for trial, in default of $2,000 each.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/13/archives/police-reports-a-fortunate-discovery-of-burglars-forty-thousand.html,,"Messrs.

Emil Heineman vs. Benjamin Waterbury.

The action was brought by the plaintiff as indorsee against the defendant as maker of a promissory note for $1,864 19, dated March 20, 1857, to the order of and indorsed by Acker & Harris. The defendant by his answer sets up that, the note was given to Acker & Harris as an accommodation note, and that no consideration was received by them for it. Same time after the making of the note, the firm of Acker & Harris failed, making a general assignment for the benefit or creditors. In the meantime Acker & Harris, it appears, had indorsed and transferred the note in question to the plaintiff. The defence, therefore, in substance, is that the plaintiff, in common with other preferred creditors of Acker & Harris, nothing claims against them for a large amount, had made such an agreement with their voluntary assignee, under the said assignment, as discharged the defendant from the payment of the note, he claiming that although he was the maker and prima facie the party primarily liable for its payment, it was in fact an accommodation note lent by him to Acker & Harris, and he therefore stood in the relative position of a surety for them, and that the plaintiff knew this when he received the note.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Liability on Accommodation Paper.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.

The Judge proceeded to charge the jury at some length. After detailing the proceedings of the Government to enforce the collection of the bond, and the staying of those proceedings by order of the Court, which also required the present complainants to give security in the sum of $200,000 to pay any sum which they might finally be called upon for, he said: It was necessary, in order to bring the legal questions before the Court, that these parties, who, in the ordinary course of an action upon the bond, would have been defendants, should be converted into complainants, and bring an action against the United States to restrain them from using this high prerogative power of collecting the bond by warrant. That was done by one in the form of a bill in Chancery, and in the bill the parties set forth that this bond, which was signed by them, was not executed as a completed instrument, but that they had made an agreement with Fowler to become his sureties together with Mr. Charlick, and had never agreed to become such alone, but only on the condition that the other party should execute it with them, and that they never knew or had any reason to suppose that the bond taken by the Government had not been executed according to the condition of that agreement. They also alleged that Fowler had previously been in the receipt of large moneys as Postmaster by the appointment of the President, and that this bond was really a continuation of the preceding bond; that Fowler had failed before the giving of this new bond to account for the moneys received by him, and had become a defaulter to the knowledge of the Post-office Department, while they themselves never knew but that he had performed his duties strictly. They therefore alleged first, that they were not bound in the bond, and would not have been in an action at law upon it; and second, that the Government and its officers had been themselves delinquent in allowing Fowler to become a defaulter, and that they had had no notice of that fact so that they could have indemnified themselves for the liability which they assumed.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE FOWLER DEFALCATION.; Judge Betts' Charge in the Law and Conover Case.

He read his opinion first. He began with the jurisdiction of the Court in the case. The attorney for the United States had argued that the Court had no jurisdiction, because the claim was made to a mine, which does not come under the head of real estate; whereas, the act of 1851, providing for the settlement of private lands in California, gave authority to the Courts to confirm only fee-simple titles, Judge MCALLISTER held these doctrines to be unsound. Mines are real estate by the Mexican, English and American law; and the act of 1851 does not refer to fee simple titles alone, but to all land titles. There were few fee-simple titles in California, most of the grants being accompanied by conditions and limitations, (the Fremont grant, for instance, being limited by a prohibition of alienation.) The Court, therefore, has jurisdiction over mining titles, under the act of 1851.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OPINION OF JUDGE McALLISTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OPINION OF JUDGE McALLISTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9753fb11-9478-51f4-854b-7c202b8c7fc0,955,nyt://article/9753fb11-9478-51f4-854b-7c202b8c7fc0

Her sole object has been to protect her rights, interests and honor, without disturbing (if possible) her peaceful relations with the Federal Government. This, he felt assured, would continue to be the policy of the State, unless the Federal authorities should, by some hostile act or demonstration, make it necessary to adopt a different course for her protection, and the protection of the other States that have seceded, or may secede.

She told him that he could not go up until the service was over. He appeared annoyed, but went out and walked about in front of the Cathedral until mass was concluded. The bell-ringer having then presented himself, the stranger proceeded to ascend with great rapidity the staircase leading to the lower, the bell-ringer accompanying him. On the way he stopped at more than one opening, and appeared to measure with his eye the distance to the ground. On reaching the top, a height of nearly 200 feet, he requested the bell-ringer to leave him alone, saying that he was an artist, and wanted to sketch the views, but the other answered that he had positive orders not to let persons remain by themselves in the tower. The ringer then began describing to him the principal buildings in the city, the summits of which were seen; but the visitor impatiently silenced him, and throwing off his hat and coat took a spring to throw himself over the parapet. The latter however, being of considerable height, he only got astride it. 'Good heavens!' cried the bell-ringer, 'What are you doing!' and catching hold of his arm and leg, tried to pull him down: but the man exclaimed, 'Let me alone?' and by a violent effort freed himself from the ringer's grasp, and threw himself forward, striking as he descended against two or three projections of the building. He was of course killed on the spot, his legs and arms being broken in several places, his breast being smashed in, and his jaw being also broken with such force that some of the teeth were cast out. On the deceased was found a passport in the name Wertheim, native of Austria, but naturalized as a Frenchman, and describing him as examiner of candidates for admission to the Polytechnic School: the passport was vised for Spain, Switzerland, Hamburg, and the Sardinian States. In his pockets besides were 1,300 francs in notes, and some visiting cards bearing the same name, with the address 25, rue Monsieur le Prince, at Paris.

In November last he was married to a fair Irish damsel, named Eliza White, and went to housekeeping with her in this City.

She, there ore, made a complaint for bigamy against the uxorious seaman, who was arrested by Officer Van Arsdale, of the Third District Police Court. At the time of his apprehension, the accused, who has been mate of a vessel, was conducting a correspondence with another confiding maid, who expected soon to marry him. The prisoner acknowledged his villainy, but excused himself on the ground that he was in his cups when his last matrimonial ""splice"" was made -- in fact, that he had been ""roped"" into it.

"A new piece, in five acts, called ""Central Park, or the House with two Doors,"" was produced here last evening, with very marked success. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/15/archives/wallack-theatre.html,,"A new piece, in five acts, called ""Central Park, or the House with two Doors,"" was produced here last evening, with very marked success. It is, as its name implies, of purely local origin, and one of those pleasant embroideries which Paris supplies to ad its town topics, but which, here, are almost unknown. Our authors are too apt to ""make an effort,"" and in doing so, frequently overlook the interests -- often dramatic -- which lay absolutely before them. Mr. LESTER WALLACK, who is, we understand, the author of the present work, has seized on the one topic which for the last two months has more than any other occupied the attention of the amusement-going public. The Central Park, we have heard it asserted, injures the theatres, because people go there in the evening, when the moon shines, and the keen air invites to open-air recreation. There is unquestionably some truth in this assertion. People do go to Central Park, and for this very reason the discreet dramatist finds the occasion to utter his say on the subject. Thus Mr. L.WALLACK, who, on ordinary occasions. Is an eclectician, culling from the French and the English stage a sprig of the laurels which he so worthily wears, becomes for the moment a contemporanian, and discourses of the things of newspaper freshness. And in doing this successfully he has adopted a purely domestic vein, and gives us for his plot a matrimonial complication about a portrait, which falls accidentally into the hands of a jealous hero, and, exciting that individual's suspicious, leads to a series of blunders, having no harm in them, and possessing the merit of being perfectly understood by the audience from beginning to end, -- leading gradually to a series of extremely ingenious situations, and terminating, as all domestic quarrels should terminate, with reconciliation. We shall not attempt to follow more closely the plot of the piece. It does not indeed admit of analysis, being, as the French would say, the suggestion of circumstances, and therefore superior to the rules of ordinary criticism. As such we regard it, simply adding that the construction, although occasionally more obscure than is necessary, is frequently admirable. The little intrigues for ""finding out something,"" with which the piece abounds, are excellently conducted, and without anticipating the last act, lead to it pleasantly, and make one glad when the marital cloud has disappeared. The dialogue possesses the great merits of being both unconventional and unlabored; the responses are quick and natural, without being blurred by vain yearnings after brilliancy and wit. Jealousy, in its trivial form, is all that the author has tried to portray, and he has done it with situations rather than talk. Herein consists the merit of the piece, which is neither wordy nor long, but contains many aspects of life, as we have it here presented, in an agreeable and thoroughly amusing shape. The last scene on the ""Big Pond,"" in Central Park, is very ingeniously contrived, not only as a pictorial representation, but as a denouement.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Wallack' Theatre."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Wallack' Theatre."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31b6fa27-cd70-5799-8e44-58d79896d5df,577,nyt://article/31b6fa27-cd70-5799-8e44-58d79896d5df

"The Richmond Whig claims that in the election for delegates to the State Convention an issue was joined between the Legislature and the Senators and Congressmen. The Congressional manifesto could be regarded in no other light, than as an appeal from the Legislature to the people themselves.

Execution on this judgment, says the Whig, may be delayed for a time, but it is inevitable. At as early a day as the Constitution and laws will allow, retribution, swift and sure, will overtake the faithless dynasty which now abuses the confidence of Virginia.

For several weeks past, ever since, indeed, the era of disunion, which currently dates with the November election, the majority of the Virginia delegation at Washington have been pledging their State to follow the lead of South Carolina. For Virginia, these imperative gentlemen have urged the same excessive claims as had previously and vainly been put forth by the Gulf States, and have alarmed the country with assertions that the Old Dominion was sure to prefer an alliance with a new to one with the old Republic. To these menaces was added a declared preparation for the seizure of the National Capital, -- so open, in fact, as to challenge the attention of the Administration in time to prompt those defensive measures, without which there is reason to believe the scenes of Wednesday in the Capitol would not have been acted in peace. In debate and conversation have these persons used none but the most ultra language upon the pending issue; language borrowed from the vocabulary of RHETT, YANCEY and SLIDELL; and had the views of their constituents answered to their own, there is every ground to believe that Virginia, in her recent election would have voted herself out of the Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT VIRGINIA MEANS BY UNION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT VIRGINIA MEANS BY UNION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59e97481-ec05-5ec6-bec0-1d044909d2ca,652,nyt://article/59e97481-ec05-5ec6-bec0-1d044909d2ca

The labial performances with the wind-instruments were exceedingly well executed, and when they were over the manual exercises of the suing band commenced, with human cords and muscles stretched on parallel bars and spring boards, with dumb-bell accompaniments, and with aerial flights, and rising and falling on ladders, and in ground and lofty tumbling. Most notable among those who took part in them, were Mr. BRADY himself, WHO, among other wonders, grasping a ring suspended from the ceiling, with his left hand only, six times lifted himself till his shoulder was parallel with it; and Messrs.

Behind the dancing floor, constructed over the backs of the parquette seats, on an elevated plat form, was a statue of the Goddess of Liberty, with armorial surroundings, pyramids of cannon shot, howitzers of small calibre, muskets, the bearskin caps and knapsacks of the Guard, and the symbolical Tiger, and over all, in a blaze of gas jets, shone forth the words, ""The Light Guard -- 1827."" The house was [???] but tastefully decorated with flags, of all nations, and uncounted Canary-bird cages were hung around the huge apartment, and their many occupants responder cheerily to the music of DODWORTH's two monster bands. At 9 1/8 o'clock the dancing began; but when it ended, we are unable to say. When we went to press, the revelry was at its height. The throne was, in popular phraseology, immense. Those who honor no other public ball with their presence, make it a point to go to that of this favorite command. Most of the officers and a great many of the men of the First Division, were there in full uniform, and their brilliant costumes and the floating wonders of the ladies' toilettes were notably noteworthy.

She left, among other things, her personal property, beyond what was sufficient to pay her debts, to her daughter Lucy Ann, wife of the plaintiff. She devised her house, No. 694 Houston-street, to her two sons for life. She died intestate as to her house No. 14 Charles-street, which was subsequently sold under foreclosure, leaving a surplus of about $900, the third of which belonged to Charles T. Harrison. The house in Houston-street was worth from $8,000 to $10,000, and was subject to a mortgage of $5,000. The defendant collected the rents and paid interest and made repairs, &c., from the death of Mrs. Harrison until March, 1852 upon authority derived from the executor and the brother of Charles T. Harrison, who was in Europe. At that time Charles returned and sold his interest in the estate to defendant for upwards of $1,000.

Mr. LINCOLN, in his speech, alluded to the National crisis as a factitious one -- such a one as could be gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by designing politicians -- and advised everybody to keep cool, and everything would be settled satisfactorily. The most important part of the speech, however, was relative to the Tariff question, which more immediately interests the people of Pennsylvania than almost any other. He reiterated the declarations of the Chicago Platform upon the subject, and declared that the policy of his Administration would be in accordance with those declarations.

On the reservoir, over seven hundred men have been employed throughout the season, mostly engaged in blasting and working the road which is to form a drive around this immense artificial lake. On the Fourth-avenue, the contractors, Messrs. HARKLEY, knowing the importance of the work, and warned by the bursting, a few weeks since, of the large pipes in the Fifth-avenue, have kept gangs of men steadily at work through the entire Winter and will undoubtedly complete the laying of the pipes within the period specified in their contract. The trenches in the Park which are to form the resting-place of the new mains are nearly completed. At the Central Park a double line of these huge pipes, four feet in diameter, is on the ground, reaching from the present receiving reservoir to the Fourth-avenue, while on the avenue the ditching, blasting and laying of pipes has been prosecuted without delay, except such as has arisen from the state of the weather. With these two important connections completed, and the seven feet pipes laid across the High Bridge, the citizens of New-York need be under nor apprehensions as to a lack in the supply of the indispensable Croton. At the High Bridge, the work of laying the seven-foot pipes have progressed silently but rapidly, the whole distance from either gaze-house being already down with the exception of about one hundred feet. This work has been under the special direction and supervision of J.S. GREEN, Esq., the engineer in change, which is a sufficient guarantee that everything is faith-fully and thoroughly done.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4159eaaa-65f6-57fb-aba0-76fabffef6e4,763,nyt://article/4159eaaa-65f6-57fb-aba0-76fabffef6e4

The most striking trait of these arrangements is the frigid disregard with which the more northern tier of Slave States have been treated. Their action has not been waited for; their opinions have not been consulted; a form of government has been adopted without reference to them; the offices under it have been filled exclusively from the Cotton States. The President and Vice-President have been taken from Mississippi and Georgia; none of the gentlemen said to be selected for seats in the Cabinet are from beyond the limits of the actual Confederacy; the foreign Envoys are chosen by the same rule; and what legislation has been adopted has not been of a character to conciliate the good will of the doubtful sovereignties. It is obvious, therefore, that if the latter secede at once from their Northern associations, they can only assume towards the Southern Government an attitude of dependence; presenting to the world the spectacle of eight powerful States submitting to the rule of seven others, weaker in resources and population, and addicted to schemes of external aggrandizement and internal economy, fatal to the interests of the Confederation, and yet beyond the control of a conservative counterpoise.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/19/archives/general-political-intelligence-significant-texas-and-newyork-why.html,,"Mr. L.W. SPRATT addresses a four-column letter, through the Charleston Mercury, to Hon. JOHN PERKINS, Delegate to the Montgomery Convention from Louisiana. His subject is, of course, the action of the (Southern Congress, in inserting a clause in the Constitution of the C.S.A., prohibiting the Slave-trade. He boldly asserts that ""the South is now in the formation of a Slave Republic."" Many may not be willing to admit this, but it is a fact, nevertheless, for the contest which has led to the secession of the Gulf States was between the Free and Slave systems of labor. For the result Mr. SPRATT returns his heartiest thanks to the Radical Republicans and Abolitionists who have labored so zealously to alienate the sections, and declares that if he had possessed the power he would not have changed their feelings or their opinions. Even now, Mr. SPRATT acknowledges that the contest is not definitively ended. It must go on in the more northern of the States now Slave, and may end in concentrating this class of labor in the States on the Gulf. The new Confederacy, he argues, should recognize this fact; it should declare itself distinctively a Slave Republic; then the States which intended to remain Slave States would seek for admission into it, and none other would come. Thus would the Government inaugurate a career which would be more brilliant than that of any organization which has preceded it. Otherwise the irrepressible conflict will be inaugurated in the new Republic itself. As for the moral sentiment of the world, Mr. SPRATT boldly takes the ground that if deference to it is going to cause the prohibition of the Slave-trade, Slavery itself should be at once abolished, for the condemnation of the one is as strong as that of the other. In conclusion, Mr. SPRATT declares that ""if the clause, in question be carried into the Permanent Government, the whole movement is defeated. It will abolitionize the Border Slave States -- it will brand our institutions. Slavery cannot share a Government with Democracy -- it cannot hear a brand upon it; thence another revolution. It may be painful, but we must make it.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.; SIGNIFICANT. TEXAS AND NEW-YORK. WHY TEXAS SECEDED.

"J. Brice Smith, Appellant, vs. Wells, Fargo & Co.'s Express Company. -- This action was originally brought in the Marine Court of this City, for the purpose of recovering the dividend upon a certain certificate of stock which the plaintiff had in his possession. The plaintiff claims that he was entitled to ten shares in the stock of the said Joint Stock Company; and that on or about the 2d day of August, 1860, the defendants declared a dividend of five per cent, upon their capital stock. That when he demanded his share of the dividend so declared, he was refused payment. on the ground that be was not the owner of the stock.

Simmons, and a power of attorney for the shares, with a blank for the name of the transferee and attorney. This certificate the plaintiff took to the office of defendant to make inquiry respecting it, and was there told that it was all right. He then went to Coleman and told him that it was all right, he would take the stock. It appears, however, from the evidence of J.H.

Ex-Gov. Wise is determined to distinguish himself in the Virginia Convention. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/21/archives/general-political-intelligence-an-exciting-scene-in-the-virginia.html,,"Ex-Gov. Wise is determined to distinguish himself in the Virginia Convention. On the 16th he had quite a spirited altercation with Mr. MOORE, of Rockbridge, a conservative delegate. In reply to some conciliatory remarks made by the latter, the doughty Governor declared that he would have his own way first or last, ""so help me God,"" and that way he defined to be to fight the real Disunionists, whom he did not think were the statesmen in the South who had been driven to do what some called wrong. The Republicans and Abolitionists are the real Disunionists, and they, exclaimed the Governor, are marching on the Capital. He implored Virginians not to wrangle among themselves, if they did cheap lands would lie open in the State for the Goths and Vandals of New-England to rush down and occupy. He had been accustomed to hear the sunrise gun at Fortress Monroe, when peace dwelt upon their shores and smiled within their homes. Now at every hour of the day he heard the booming thunder of practicing artillery -- practicing artillery for excellence to drink their blood. Before long, said he, they might expect to have a Black Republican garrison at Gosport to rob their hen-roosts and steal their peculiar institutions. In reaching this climax the Governor had so wrought himself up that his gestures assumed rather a personal direction, in the opinion of Mr. MOORE, so that gentleman requested him not to be quite so fierce, as he did not admire that style of gesture. This had the effect of modifying Gov. WISE'S enthusiasm, and he proceeded to explain his position with less emphasis. Mr. MOORE followed in a few conciliatory remarks, and, if the reports be not impartial, rather got the better of his fiery antagonist.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GENERAL POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.; AN EXCITING SCENE IN THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION.

And never was the beauty of the Stars and Stripes so fully recognized, and loyalty to the ""land of the free,"" which it floats over, so generally given a public expression as by those who composed the crowds that thronged the streets. Crowds? -- that is not the word. London, it has been said, is not a city, but a province covered with houses; our thoroughfares, yesterday, were not streets, but acres alive with people, and the people were achers too, before they were through with it. The procession did not move so early as there was reason to believe that it would. Still, nobody has a right to grumble this time, for in the published general order, no hour for its starting was designated. But it was known that the line was to be formed at 2 o'clock P.M. precisely, and they who sallied forth to see the display, did so at a much earlier hour than they might have done had they not hence inferred that soon after the hour named, the pageant would begin to pass; and so they waited and waited, -- men, and women and children, welded in masses on the sidewalks, standing in squads in the middle of the streets, blockading the entrance of every dwelling-house, rising in human terraces on the door-steps, displaying themselves in shop-windows, watching from the upper stories and house-tops.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON.; ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS.

This substitute provides that involuntary servitude shall not exist in the present territory North of 36° 30′ while it is in a territorial condition. South of the line, in the ""present"" territory, settlers with persons held to service shall not be prohibited by territorial or other laws from entering while in a territorial condition, and the status of persons held to service shall be cognizable in the Federal Courts under the rules of the common law. It will be perceived that this makes no provision for the admission of States, nor does it give to Slavery the benefit of a recognition by the laws of the State from which it emigrated, as did Mr. GUTHRIE'S proposition. It only allows slaveholders to go into the Territory south of the line while it is territory and look to the common law for both their rights and their remedy. This substitute was adopted by a vote of seventeen to five, two of the seven Slave States, Maryland and Kentucky voting with the North. The vote to-morrow will be on the passage of the substitute as adopted. This may be defeated by a proposition to call a general Convention of all the States.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/25/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The City was startled on Saturday by the intelligence, contained in an extra edition of the TIMES, that the President elect, instead of proceeding on his journey to Washington from Harrisburgh, in accordance with the published programme, on Saturday morning, had left the latter city secretly, on a special train, on Friday night, and returning to Philadelphia, had passed thence, unrecognized, through Baltimore, and was already in the Federal Capital. This step, it appears, was induced by the desire to avoid threatened trouble in Baltimore, and was taken at the earnest solicitation of his friends and leading Republicans in Washington, who had received authentic information that an organized demonstration would be made against him in Baltimore -- if, indeed, he were allowed to reach there alive; for it was also feared that an attempt would be made to throw the Presidential train from the track on the Northern Central Railroad. This information, it appears, was imparted to Mr. LINCOLN on Thursday night at Philadelphia, and he consented, after considerable hesitation, to the private arrangement which was subsequently carried into effect. He reached Washington early on Saturday morning, and proceeded quietly to his hotel, his arrival being known to but few. He soon afterwards, in company with Senator SEWARD, paid a visit to President BUCHANAN, and interchanged civilities with him and with other gentlemen of distinction. His presence in the city then became generally known, and he received many callers during the day, including the President and Cabinet, the members of the Peace Conference and others. Mrs. LINCOLN and the other members of the Presidential party left Harrisburgh at the appointed time, and reached Washington on Saturday evening. The Baltimoreans, some of whom professed great indignation at the course pursued by Mr. LINCOLN, expressed their disapprobation by insulting the party as they passed through.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a46b3118-1bf9-5cc9-93f3-e87b4623ba87,1433,nyt://article/a46b3118-1bf9-5cc9-93f3-e87b4623ba87

The interview with Lord PALMERSTON was a private one, but Lord JOHN RUSSELL, without binding himself, to any definite course of action, indicated his willingness to consider the matter favorably. Great efforts, said his lordship, had been made in this country, at considerable cost, with a view to the suppression of the Slave-trade, and they must always recollect that efforts had been made in other directions, under the sanction of the various Powers, to endeavor to keep it up. With regard to the appointment of a Consul, the cotton district of Abbeokuta was a very good province, and it was very gratifying to find that palm oil and various other productions had so considerably increased for some years past; and if the appointment of a Consul could promote the interests of its commerce, the Foreign Office would inquire into the particulars respecting it. They were obliged to look with a view to the public service, and the various reasons and regulations by which we are generally bound; but supposing there was no objection to that course be should certainly be most happy to fall in with their views. With regard to the King of Dahomey, he was sorry to say it was not the single obstacle. They found in several parts of Africa that efforts were mace to carry on Slavery. But that was only a part of the question, and with regard to the general question he should be most happy to assist them. Perhaps they would believe him when he said, if in any way he could make the smallest advance towards the extinction of the Slave-trade, he should be most happy to do so.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/26/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- Miss CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN, whose recent triumphs at this theatre are fresh in the public memory, made her reappearance last evening, and was welcomed, as herebefore, by a crowded house. As a concession to public clamor -- we will not suppose that it was a matter of art choice -- the part of Nancy Sykes, in the drama of ""Oliver Twist,"" was selected for the occasion. A certain class of critics have persistently claimed it as one of the lady's finest impersonations, and, rejecting all that intellect and elocution usually bring to the stage, perhaps it is. The unfortunate associate of the brutal and surly burglar, Bill Sykes, is realized in a way which cannot fail to horrify the spectator. It is a muscular exhibition of a woman's last purpose; of her final determination to do a single kindly act at any hazard. All that relates to the will and energy required for this, Miss CUSHMAN depicts with wonderful force. Her watchfulness and bravery are demonstrated in every glance and movement, but we look in vain for that thread of womanly tenderness, which gave birth to so many strong traits. Hence it seems to us that Miss CUSHMAN'S impersonation is less remarkable than Miss HERON'S; for in the latter lady's rendering, a large, although lost womanhood, was constantly confronting us and demanding a share of our sympathy. In obsolute vigor, Miss CUSHMAN'S Nancy deserves to rank with her Meg Merrilies, but only in this respect. We are surprised at the courage she displays, and at the end cannot account for her rapid dispatch by Bill, feeling in our hearts, that any man would have a pretty hard job to get rid of so powerful a will, and so strong an arm.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2f48272-4487-53ff-873f-0abb31fc07e2,744,nyt://article/d2f48272-4487-53ff-873f-0abb31fc07e2

Gentlemen from the Border States which have slaves for sale and need a market for them are beginning to get over their scare lest they should lose their market by refusing to go into the Southern Confederacy. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/02/26/archives/miscellaneous-washington-news-the-interstate-slavetrade-and.html,,"Gentlemen from the Border States -- which have slaves for sale and need a market for them -- are beginning to get over their scare lest they should lose their market by refusing to go into the Southern Confederacy. Certainly they have no reason to fear such a result, if they examine the question with a little sagacity. The Southern Confederate States have, in their Provisional Constitution, prohibited the African Slave-trade. Having thus cut themselves off from a foreign supply of labor, as a bid to the Slave-breeding States to come and unite their fortunes with theirs, the Southern Confederacy proceeded to reserve to itself the power of prohibiting, by statutory enactment only, the importation of slaves from the Border States. Now, as the members of the Confederacy claim slaves to be ""property,"" and as the rights of use and free transit of property of all kinds must be protected by law, it is difficult to see how they can ever prohibit Southern planters, who want slave labor, from coming to the Border States to buy and take the desired ""property"" home with them. If there is a demand for slave labor in the Gulf States, the ""Southern Congress"" must allow the necessary supply to reach them from the only source which they have left open for themselves. Virginia then may follow out her disposition to stand by the Union, confident that by so doing she does not shut herself out from South Carolina, Georgia or Alabama as a market for her surplus crop of negroes, and this very natural conviction is beginning to force itself upon the understandings of the Border State men here.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS WASHINGTON NEWS.; THE INTER-STATE SLAVE-TRADE AND SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.

"On Saturday night the furnished dwelling No. 50 West Twenty-second-street, recently occupied by Mrs. Ella Hall, was visited by burglars, who carried away a mantel clock, sawed off the water-pipes, and did other damage. The same night three lads, named Patrick Farrell, Michael Farrell and Patrick McDonnell, were observed by Officer O'Connor, of the Twenty-first Ward, with the time-piece in their possession, and believing they had stolen it, he arrested them. The fact of the burglary, however, was not made known until yesterday, when Mrs. Hall appeared before Justice Connolly, and made an affidavit against the prisoners.

"A great deal of sport was anticipated last Tuesday evening by men about town in attending a ""Macintosh ball,"" given by a class of persons addicted to a disgusting vice, of which the existence is probably unknown to nine-tenths of the community. The affair was to have taken place at a public hall in Thirty-third-street, near Sixth-avenue, and by 10 o'clock the company began to arrive. It consisted of sporting men, police detectives, abandoned females, and the degraded characters whom the sporting men, police detectives and abandoned females aforesaid had assembled to see. The detectives, however, were there on business, the others merely to gratify curiosity. Capt. Speight, of the 21st Ward, had been apprised of the affair several days before, and made arrangements to arrest the parties engaged in it. The fun was fast and furious about 12 o'clock, and yet carriages continually arrived with additional company. The feature of the occasion was the fact that the male dancers were appareled in female attire, and the latter donned the habiliments of their opposite sex. In the midst of the hilarity a whisper went round the room that the Police were coming to break up the ball. Instantly a rush was made to escape, and in the greatest confusion the company made their exit. The carriages were taken possession of, without ceremony, and driven rapidly away, many of the counterfeit women having gladly seated themselves on the box with the drivers. This movement was not premature, as the police came up in time to arrest nine of the offenders, whose trepidation had rendered them helpless. Seven of the prisoners proved to be men, although they were got up regardless of expense in female apparel, ringlets, rouge, and everything excepting jewelry, of which about $6,000 worth, principally in diamonds, was distributed upon the person of one of them. The police conducted the whole party to the Station-house, where by this time a large crowd had assembled to learn the cause of the excitement. The men gave the names of James Peters, John Jackson, Charles Warner, George Livingston, John Moulton and Julius Vogel. The women called themselves Catharine Anderson and Elizabeth Campbell. After spending the remainder of the night in the cells, all of them, still wearing their ball dresses, were taken yesterday morning to the Jefferson Market Police Court, where their appearance excited much merriment. Justice CONNOLLY exercised compassion, and instead of sending them to prison as vagrants, as was generally expected, merely required a surety from each of them in the sum of $500, to keep the peace for six months.

The attendance was limited. Ex-Mayor HALL, President of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, was called to the Chair, and Mr. ROLLIN, chosen Secretary. The Chairman explained the objects of the meeting. He stated that the funds of the Association were exhausted. The number of families assisted since October 1, 1860, is one thousand three hundred and forty. Of the number, five hundred and twenty-five were American. The average number weekly for the last six weeks was four hundred and ninety, of whom one hundred and ninety were American. The average expenditure for the six weeks was $600. The whole amount expended to date is $5,022. The amount collected is $3,724, making, with the amount of subscriptions estimated as collectable, $5,175. A surplus of $152 remains, but returns net yet made, it is thought, will exhaust the sum, Mr. HALL further stated that facts daily transpired, showing the prevalence of destitution and suffering, Mr. EAMES, Secretary of the Association, followed, and said the class of persons heading assistance were not seen in the streets They were those who were not accustomed to apply for charity. He cited numerous cases in support of his position. Mr. CHITTENDEN referred to the suffering among certain classes incident to political disturbances, and said the urgent claims of the people of Kansas should not be disregarded, but at the same time the poor at home should be cared for. Rev. Drs. FARLEY, BAYLIS, CUTTER and other gentlemen made remarks, and a resolution providing for an immediate collection was adopted. By another resolution the clergymen of the city were requested to raise collections in their churches to promote the objects of the meeting. The collectors of the Association for the several districts were also requested to canvass again for contributions. Subscriptions to the amount of $1,020 were then received, Mr. SPROTT, baker, corner of Jay and Concord streets, agreed to bake into bread a barrel of flour weekly, to be distributed by the Association, and also to bake, without charge, any flour that might be contributed for that purpose. Messrs. Thos. Messenger, A.W. Benson, A.C. Hull, S.B.

The measure will undoubtedly greatly assist in developing the resources of Arizona, and with the increased demand for Sonora produce, the farmers and traders of that country will share its advantages.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTATIONS INTO ARIZONA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IMPORTATIONS INTO ARIZONA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90ca77ab-034b-5485-b479-812f0a34e5ca,177,nyt://article/90ca77ab-034b-5485-b479-812f0a34e5ca
