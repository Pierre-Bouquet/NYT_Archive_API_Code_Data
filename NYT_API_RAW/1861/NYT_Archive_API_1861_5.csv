Of the loyalty of the engineers of locomotives and steamers it should be particularly certain. While it may be in the power of one loyal man to hopelessly disable an enemy's steamer, without running any unusual personal risk, or to utterly paralyze a locomotive at any moment, without a chance of de tection, prevention or remedy, and thus disconcert all plans of attack and retreat; or to sink a steam vessel or blow up its boilers; or to throw a troop train off an embankment, and still have a tolerable chance of personal safety -- while all this is more feasible in the hands of one or two wise and daring engineers, than the unprofessional public can credit or imagine, we do not counsel this method of offensive warfare, however richly the enemy may deserve any irregular manner of destruction. But we earnestly beg of the officers of regiments that they make sure of their defence against it. Already we hear of the weakening of a bridge in Ohio, a little too late, fortunately, to let the intended train through. But guarded bridges and a track police by no means insure safety. It is a very simple matter for an engine-driver to withdraw some part absolutely essential to locomotion, which cannot be replaced, pitch this vital part into a river while the train is running, and bring a reinforcing regiment, upon whose promptness a victory may depend, to an ignominious halt in the wilderness at midnight -- all without much fear of detection, and with ample chance for escape. Nothing is more easily done by a daring engineer, than to dispose of his fireman, by a pistol-shot or otherwise, arrange an infernal machine to pitch the train over an embankment. reach the rear car with the fatal line, alight without much risk, at a twenty-five mile speed, in a well-known soft spot, and send the doomed train reeling to death and destruction. A locomotive, in good order, may be deserted by the driver, after ten minutes' opportunity to tamper with it, under pretence of repairing or readjusting a part, and left in such a state that the first attempt to start it will be the violent and irreparable rupture of some of the machinery. A locomotive may be backed out of a yard where there are facilities, and half an hour's time for getting it in trim, attached to its train, and started again by its own power, without a drop of water or a coal of fire in its boiler, and with such adjustment that no steam can be generated in it. There are plenty of ways known to engineers to delay -- hopelessly delay -- trains upon which the issue of a battle may depend. We do not propose to publish them for the benefit of any one who can read a newspaper, but they are none the less absolute for all that, and any one whose business it is to guard against them can readily find them out.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Method of Warfare.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Method of Warfare.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0b7e05f5-c614-503f-ad76-3cb2c8f58400,939,nyt://article/0b7e05f5-c614-503f-ad76-3cb2c8f58400

He said he was opposed to all reconstruction, and for maintaining the Government as it is, with all its guarantees to all sections of the country. The conspirators at the South were trying the experiment of founding a Republican Government, with a nigger for a corner-stone. This Government was made for white men, and while the result of this struggle might incidentally operate to the weakening of Slavery, and ultimately to its extinction, in a manner which would be safe to both races, yet he objected to the idea, frequently advanced in the excitement of the present hour, that we should enter the contest with a view to exterminate Slavery at whatever cost and sacrifice to innocent persons. He had been frequently asked what the Western people were going to do with the Mississippi River. Now he would inform them that the free navigation of the Mississippi River was of far less consequence to the West than to the South. It was a matter of little importance to the West whether this river was open or not, but to the South it was a matter of life and death.

Virginia has placed herself in a position that calls for the immediate and very decided action of the Federal Government. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/01/archives/the-relations-of-virginia-to-the-union.html,,"Virginia has placed herself in a position that calls for the immediate and very decided action of the Federal Government. During the last week two officers of the United States Navy were arrested by the mob at Norfolk, carried to Richmond, kept in durance three days by Gov. LETCHER, and then dismissed by him with great politeness, and, no doubt, with assurances of his most distinguished consideration. Within the same period a high officer of the Army of the United States, Gen. HARNEY, was taken prisoner from a railroad car in Virginia and detained several days, till he was released, we are told, by the orders of Gen. LEE, of the Virginia army. In the same manner, Lieut. WATERS, of the United States Navy, while escorting a party of ladies from Norfolk to Washington, was arrested in Petersburgh, and carried before an examining magistrate, but discharged. He was again arrested in Richmond by a file of military under command of Capt. WISE. While in their custody, he was threatened with death by an infuriated mob, but on an appeal to Governor LETCHER, he received a permit that relieved him from further molestation during his journey. Now, if Virginia is at war with the United States, it may be very well for her to indulge in these practices, subject, of course, always to the law of retaliation, and to all the other laws of war. Conduct of this description, in times like the present, is, in fast, a declaration of war, and should be so recognized and so punished.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Relations of Virginia to the Union.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Relations of Virginia to the Union.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89fa8340-a110-5b9d-8c33-6e882efc5f20,1193,nyt://article/89fa8340-a110-5b9d-8c33-6e882efc5f20

In the hands of the officer the sword is often of no more value than a rattan in a conflict with the expert swordsman -- it would simply invite a speedy death. Nor in such sudden demands for troops is attention apt to be paid to the composition of a perfect army. To such an organization go various departments of service, each auxiliary to the other, and each rendering the other doubly effective. A force which includes no artillery, or omits sappers and miners, for rendering streams and roads passible, or throwing up entrenchments, or which possessed no cavalry for scouting or skirmishing parties, is entirely at the mercy of an enemy employing those indispensable aids. So with regard to a defective commissiariat or quartermaster's department.

The proportions of each arm, and the details of enrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of War; and I also direct that the regular army of the United States be increased by the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate increase of twenty-two thousand seven hundred and fifty officers and enlisted men, the details of which increase will also be made known through the Department of War. And I further direct the enlistment for not less than one nor more than three years of eight-teen thousand seamen in addition to the present force, for the naval service of the United States. The details of the enlistment and organization will be made known through the Department of the Navy. The call for volunteers hereby made, and the direction for the increase of the regular army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteers and for the regular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as assembled.

On only one day of last week five car-loads of white fugitives were reported as having arrived at a single, point in Pennsylvania; on the succeeding day a Presbyterian clergyman from Mississippi arrives with a hundred and fifty other refugees fleeing for life; on another, three hundred mechanics escape from Richmond, twice as many from Memphis and other towns in Tennessee, and so on; in fact, from almost every village of the far South come the reports of flights, or hangings, or floggings, or imprisonment or banishment of those who dare remain faithful to the Constitution, while of course of more than half the assassinations and persecutions that actually do occur, no report is over published and no account ever reaches the civilized world.

The action of her Legislature in passing to a third reading what is called a bill to provide for the public safety, proposes to place the destinies of the State in the keeping of a rank Secession Committee, and to remove every restriction and safeguard which has heretofore existed against a rash employment of military force. It now appears that while the Union element in the State has been deluded with the idea that no further apprehension need be felt that the State would occupy a position hostile to the Federal Government, the Legislature has been engaged in perfecting arrangements which, at any appointed time, may precipitate the State into the arms of JEFF. DAVIS. We are glad to learn, however, that this action on the part of the Legislature is not likely to meet with the favor they desire. The Union feeling has gained such headway in the State, and especially in Baltimore, that a tremendous pressure has been brought to bear against the measure, which happily did not become a law, as at first announced.

JAMES FRYE (afterward colonel in the ""old French wars,"") was present at the capture of Louisburg; in 1775, his son, JAMES FRYE, was colonel at the battle of Bunker Hill, and with him there was his son, FREDERICK FRYE (then 18 years old,) subsequently lieutenant in the revolutionary army, and in command at Governor's Island, New York, during 1812; and his son, DANIEL M. FRYE, father of the present Capt. FREDERICK FRYE, served as captain in that war. Capt. FREDERICK FRYE is a member of the Cincinnati, and carries the original badge and certificate of that order, received by Lieut. FRYE in 1784. He has also the original commissions issued to his (forefathers) ancestors above mentioned, bearing the autographs of SHIRLEY, HANCOCK, WARREN and WASHINGTON. He is a native of New York city, a graduate of old Columbia, and his numerous friends will be gratified to know that he is early in the field in which his fathers served so well.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SWORD PRESENTATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SWORD PRESENTATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/08fa8cce-fe72-5e5c-b244-2e703d7de4c7,233,nyt://article/08fa8cce-fe72-5e5c-b244-2e703d7de4c7

But while this has magnifiedthe plan of field operations, it has not intrinsically changed their nature. The same essential difference in the transport and fighting of cannon and small arms still obtains; as far as powder is concerned, its two distinct uses are in the heavy horse-propelled artillery and the mountain howitzer on the one hand, and the light infantry-carried rifle musket on the other. There is no standard intermediate arm to outreach the range of the hand arm, without impeding the operations of light infantry, -- a revolving rifled gun on wheels, terrible in rapidity, accuracy and execution, but light enough to be jerked by three or four men through swamps and over stone walls, without impeding the regular order of march and manoeuvre. A long rifled barrel, with an inch or a 3/4-inch bore, carrying a 3/4-pound to a pound projectile, and fed by a series of revolving chambers so that an incessant fire of a mile and a half to two miles range might be maintained -- an exaggerated revolving pistol, mounted on a modification of the light, but superlatively strong running gear of our best steam fire-engines, and capable of flying to new positions at a moment's notice -- a battery of such metal in skilled hands would indeed break up the plans of present field operation, and in many circumstances, well known to military men, create have among an enemy not within the range of the rifle-musket, and quite too quick in its movements to be cut up by the present artillery. A half a mile advantage in range would give it every advantage over infantry arms, and its lightness and celerity would enable it, many times, to pick off artillerists before their heavy metal could be trained and served.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Light Cannon vs. Rifles.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Light Cannon vs. Rifles.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96910bed-e135-530e-8370-e1062a96ccf7,1416,nyt://article/96910bed-e135-530e-8370-e1062a96ccf7

She upheld the right of secession, and while she professed to love the Union, deprecated all attempts to enforce obedience to Federal law as a violation of the rights of the States. The people of the loyal States were, however, rejoiced to find even so much of patriotism in a State where Slavery was a cherished institution, and they accepted it as a sign of possible adjustment without a resort to the arbitrament of the sword. Rebellion came surging up from the far South, and no steps were taken to arrest its progress, for fear of irritating the delicate nerves of Virginia and the Border States. The Administration of Mr. BUCHANAN was charmed into inertia by the attitude of Virginia. His Cabinet plundered the Government of its arms, and the Treasury of its funds, without rebuke.

Probably no body of rew recruits was ever brought together and advanced to such a high degree of military proficiency as this command has attained in so short a time before. Since they have been at Fort Schuyler, the men have been subjected to very rigid discipline, and anyone skilled in the science of war, who shall pay them a visit, will be surprised at the precision with which they execute some of the most intricate battalion movements -- manoeuvres which we have seen performed by militia regiments of long standing with far less accuracy. The corps, in fact, has a Colonel; and that is a matter of as much importance to soldiers as the now established truth that we have a Government is to the people at large. That the Advance Guard is Col. DURYEA's Regiment, is a sufficient guarantee that it will be a highly-trained and soldierly body of troops. Col. DURYEA has been a military man ever since he has been a man, and has risen gradually from the ranks through every gradation in the service to the position he now holds. The only fear his men have is that he will be too speedily promoted; but there is little probability that he could be induced to leave his Regiment, in whose progress he takes a great deal of pride.",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ZOUAVES AT FORT SCHUYLER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ZOUAVES AT FORT SCHUYLER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b51f2e87-3325-536f-9dc5-00cf53b60c23,611,nyt://article/b51f2e87-3325-536f-9dc5-00cf53b60c23

The Committee for the supply of the destitute resident population, reported the visitation, by the agents in their employ, of the First, Eleventh and Twenty-second Wards, and a distribution of 880 volumes among families in those Wards during the month of April. The principal business of the meeting related to the active operations conducted during the past month by the Committee on Military Posts and Naval Stations, in supplying the soldiers and sailors of the United States service, and the volunteer regiments with Testaments. Messrs. PIERSON, SMYTHE and GARDINES, agents of the Board, have been engaged in this important work, and have supplied the soldiers in the forts, the marines in the navy yard and on the vessels of war, and also twenty one of the volunteer regiments which have left tills City or are now stationed in it. The Testament used in this supply is a neat pocket volume, easily carried in the knapsack, and having an appropriate colored design pasted on the inside of the cover, exhibiting the stars and stripes, with the inscription below -- To the defenders of their country: Presented by the New-York Bible Society;"" and also with reference to appropriate texts. The details of the distribution were given at length by the Agents, and were of great interest, the officers of the several regiments having cheerfully cooperated with the Agents of the Board in carrying out the arrangements for the supply of every man in the ranks who was without a Testament and was willing to accept it. Contributions for this special work were announced, and the Board, by a unanimous vote, authorized its further prosecution, to as to include every regiment of troops and every vessel of war passing through the City or leaving the harbor.

The opportunity for an invaluable public improvement is not to be lost. For twenty years past the traveling public has protested indignantly against the ferry at Havre de Grace, and demanded the construction of a bridge. Travel has been delayed and rendered intolerably uncomfortable by the change of cars at that point; the mails have been kept back; and immorality and profanity largely encouraged by the gratuitous annoyance the public has been obliged to suffer. The Legislature of Maryland has persistently refused to authorize a bridge. If Government will add this to the other facilities it proposes to lend traffic between New-York and Washington, it will insure one blessing at least from the war. It will not have far to seek for a precedent. The Virginia railroads have been taken possession of by the Confederate Government as military routes. At Richmond the traveler will remember with disgust the omnibus connection between the termini of the Northern and Southern roads. In a spirit similar to that of Maryland, the Common Council of Richmond has always declined to permit a connection of the two depots by rail; and it is only now when the power has passed into despotic hands, that the nuisance is to be abated. The rails to unite the two roads are now being laid by the direction of the rebel Government.

A park of Artillery, from Annapolis, was also to join them, which would swell the force to about 3,000. Our dispatch from Baltimore announces the arrival of a portion of the troops at the Relay. It is not positively known what service this body of men is to be employed on, but it is conjectured at Washington that they are intended to cooperate with the Pennsylvania troops approaching Baltimore, under command of Gen. PATTERSON, to open and hold the route through that city. They will also act as a check to any movement of secession forces from Harper's Ferry, as they have possession of the road in that direction, as well as control of the telegraph line. The approach of these troops to the Relay House was very quiet, and they had possession of everything almost before the people there were aware of their presence.

"This Regiment is now being formed under the supervision of Col. RAMSEY, late of the regular army -- an officer who served with distinction in the army of the United States during the war with Mexico. His experience in organizing, drilling, and disciplining men, as well as fitting them for the field, is invaluable at this time. He had charge of the camp of instruction at Palo Alto, for the ten additional regiments which were incorporated in the army in 1846. These regiments afterwards distinguished themselves during the war, subsequent to the battles in the Valley of Mexico. Col. RAMSEY was ordered to Vera Cruz to organize another army, consisting of regulars and volunteers, of 5,000 men. He is now in the prime of life, and quit the service after the war, having often held the important commands of brigades and divisions of the army.

RAMSEY, late of the regular army -- an officer who served with distinction in the army of the United States during the war with Mexico. His experience in organizing, drilling, and disciplining men, as well as fitting them for the field, is invaluable at this time. He had charge of the camp of instruction at Palo Alto, for the ten additional regiments which were incorporated in the army in 1846. These regiments afterwards distinguished themselves during the war, subsequent to the battles in the Valley of Mexico. Col. RAMSEY was ordered to Vera Cruz to organize another army, consisting of regulars and volunteers, of 5,000 men.

"Prof. HAMILTON's lecture, at Bellevue Hospital, last Friday, was one of unusual interest. It would seem, from the Professor's remarks, almost impossible for a man to be killed by a bullet. After speaking on the different varieties of shot and shell need in modern warfare, and exhibiting them to his audience, Dr. HAMILTON observed that it was impossible to conceive of all the variety of accidents to which the soldier is liable from such a variety of instruments. The Army and Navy surgeons had related many extraordinary cases which had occurred in their experience. A slight resistance, in many cases, would destroy the line of direction of the missile. Should a ball strike a bone, for instance, in an oblique direction, the ball would not penetrate, nor in some cases even fracture the bone, but would glance off, and either go to some other part of the body or fall to the ground. Nor is such a hard substance as bone always necessary to turn off the missile. Mr. HENNING related a case where a man received a ball full upon the neck, beneath the chin, when, instead of preserving its original direction, meeting with some resistance it glanced off, and went completely round the neck, making its exit where it first entered. Another case was mentioned where a man received a ball upon the chest, which penetrated to the rib, when it glanced off and made half the circuit of the body, coming out behind. And still another, in which the abdomen was struck, the ball making its exit behind, as in the last case. In all these cases the patients had recovered. Still more remarkable, says Dr. HAMILTON, are those cases where the bullet has entered the chest, striking upon the pleura pulmonalis, (the covering of the lungs,) has turned from its line of direction, and gone entirely round the lung, lodging itself in the back. Prof. H. mentioned a case of the kind, where the man recovered without any serious result; and also one in which the skull was penetrated, but the brain uninjured, the missile meeting with the dura mater, (the covering of the brain,) and glancing off as in the other cases. Many cases of this kind were mentioned by the Doctor, the only explanation being, as far as he could see, in the fact that the force of the ball becomes spent when it reaches the body, and thus it is easily turned from the straight line, when it meets with any resisting substance, naturally going in that direction where there is the least resistance.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/07/archives/prof-hamiltons-lectures.html,,"Prof. HAMILTON's lecture, at Bellevue Hospital, last Friday, was one of unusual interest. It would seem, from the Professor's remarks, almost impossible for a man to be killed by a bullet. After speaking on the different varieties of shot and shell need in modern warfare, and exhibiting them to his audience, Dr. HAMILTON observed that it was impossible to conceive of all the variety of accidents to which the soldier is liable from such a variety of instruments. The Army and Navy surgeons had related many extraordinary cases which had occurred in their experience. A slight resistance, in many cases, would destroy the line of direction of the missile. Should a ball strike a bone, for instance, in an oblique direction, the ball would not penetrate, nor in some cases even fracture the bone, but would glance off, and either go to some other part of the body or fall to the ground. Nor is such a hard substance as bone always necessary to turn off the missile.

"In one of his recent speeches at Chicago, Senator DOUGLAS affirmed that the plan of the conspirators for the establishment of the Montgomery Government was matured more than a twelvemonth since, and that the election of President LINCOLN had nothing to do with it.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/08/archives/it-dont-work.html,,"The plan suggested by the Governor of Georgia for replenishing the Treasury of the C.S.A., does not seem to be very successful. It will be recollected that he suggests to Southern debtors to repudiate their debts owing by them to Northern merchants and banks, and to invest the amount in the loan of the new Confederation, to be paid back to them when peace shall be restored. The Georgia debtor is entirely satisfied with the suggestion, so far as repudiation is concerned. He is altogether pleased with that, but the other idea of investing in C.S.A. stock is not quite so clear to him. He naturally asks what he is to gain by that. He has no objection to being dishonest for a consideration, but he is not so patriotically knavish as to play the scoundrel for the good of the State. Besides, he shrewdly asks, if he is thus invited to repudiate for the good of the State, why may not the State repudiate for its own benefit? Then again he inquires whether, when the war shall be over, and forced loans and taxation shall leave anything in his hands to be reached by execution, his creditor may not compel him to pay whether he will or not? If this question shall be answered in the affirmative, then the inquiry suggests itself, whether it is not a good deal easier to invest money in Southern stocks than to realize anything from the investment? On the whole, while there is plenty of refusal to pay on the part of the Southern debtors, we do not hear of their making any very extensive investments in C.S.A. stocks -- wherefrom we infer that repudiation is more popular, than patriotism down South.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""It Don't Work."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""It Don't Work."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/39a2d109-084d-5c71-99c4-90a0efced6e1,289,nyt://article/39a2d109-084d-5c71-99c4-90a0efced6e1

LATHAM. -- Marshal MURRAY, yesterday, secured the arrest of JOHN COLLIGAN, the ex-Deputy Marshal under RYNDERS, for permitting Capt. LATHAM, of the slave bark Cora, who was committed to the Tombs for trial as a slaver, to escape. It will be recollected that the Captain escaped while COLLIGAN was ostensibly trying on a suit of clothes at the BROOKS BROTHERS, on his recommendation. It was suspected at the time that the escape of the Captain was not unexpected by COLLIGAN, and his voluntary absence from the City strengthened the suspicion, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. A few days since the Marshal was informed that COLLIGAN might possibly be found around the decks of the lower part of the City, and he determined to arrest him. On examination, it was found that an ex-Deputy had the warrant in his possession, and that any attempt to get that warrant would again cause the absence of COLLIGAN. The Marshal therefore had a duplicate warrant issued, which was placed in the hands of the Harbor Police, who yesterday morning found Mr. COLLIGAN, and he was rendered up to the Marshal and justice.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/08/archives/the-spirit-of-the-age.html,,"Whoever supposes that the conflict now waging in these States, is peculiar to this side of the Atlantic, or to this Continent, or that it was contingent upon, or the result of the late Presidential election, makes a very great mistake. A reference to the history of the last few decades will show that the universal drift all over the civilized world has been towards liberalism, towards the breaking up of despotisms and the advancement of human rights. The genius and spirit of the age, moving all over the face of the earth, points to the amelioration of the condition of the great masses, -- the millions who do the work and on whose shoulders rest the ultimate burthens of Government. England, the most enlightened and liberal of monarchies, has been and still is engaged in extending the privileges and promoting the interests of her working classes. She is now dealing with the great questions of universal suffrage, the reduction of her pension lists, the diffusion of education and the elevation of her masses. France, though under the dictation of a single will -- a dictation based upon the immense popularity of the man who wields it -- is still, in her theory of government and constitutional enactments, making long strides in a career of liberalism. Prussia, by the adoption of the habeas corpus, the trial by jury, and her system of free education -- all the results of a generation -- has moved a vast way forward. In Russia, the system of serfdom has fallen before the march of liberalism. Austria has been compelled to grant a Constitution, comparatively liberal in its guarantees, to her empire and her provinces. In Italy, the great world-movement has culminated in revolution and the regeneration of a people. All over Europe is sounding the note of preparation for new movements in favor of liberalism. Underlying and impelling forward this current of events, is the great fact of a constant struggle between popular rights and despotic sway, -- a struggle that has been going on for decades, kept alive and strengthened by the genius and spirit of the age in which we live. Even in Mexico, that unhappy country, given over almost to anarchy, plundered by demagogues and deluded by a bigoted and corrupt priesthood, we can trace the spirit of liberalism, striving for the emancipation of the millions, the enlightening and upbuilding of the masses who work.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Spirit of the Age.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Spirit of the Age.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/883ea7e5-9f7b-5014-88eb-39f67a650591,1108,nyt://article/883ea7e5-9f7b-5014-88eb-39f67a650591

He remained unconscious throughout the night, and his attending pysician pronounced his condition exceedingly critical.

On the platform, the young ladies of the Institution were arranged on elevated seats, dressed in white muslin, with bright sashes and other adornments, such as Union rosettes, and scarfs. With the exception of six or eights boys, who had to take part in the exercises, the male members of the Institution were placed in the rear gallery. Most of the officers and Directors of the Institution were present. Dr. PEET introduced Rev. Dr. STONE, who, after briefly welcoming the audience, opened the proceedings with prayer. Dr. PEET then stated that there were just 300 pupils in the Institution, very nearly all of whom where present. They were divided into 16 classes, each under a distinct teacher. Representatives of only two of those classes would be presented to the meeting. Two girls and two boys, of the latest class, those who entered the Institution in September last, being at that time ignorant that ideas could be conveyed by words and the class of highest attainment, consisting of those who had been eight and nine years under instruction. The former class were first exhibited, and went through their exercises on the slate in the most creditable manner. Two young ladies and two youths of the highest class were then introduced, and manifested a proficiently that astonished and delighted the spectators. Illustration of the manual language, the sign language and the blachial alphabet for conversing at a distance were given, and some very amusing numetic interludes convulsed all the beholders. But the feature of the occasion was, as usual at these Anniversaries, the competition of impromtu themes on the slates by pupils of the higher grade, and the most noticeable of these were those in which the present condition of the country was made the theme of comment. The Deaf and Dumb read the newspars daily, and are, as they proved themselves yesterday, highly patriotic. Washington, Harper's Ferry, Baltimore, Gen. SCOTT, Major ANDERSON, Fort Sumter, are topics of as immediate and exciting interest to them as to those who listened to the reading (by Dr. PEET) of their compositions with eagerness. Miss MARY L. GOODRICH, of Brooklyn, a remarkably beautiful young lady, manipulated a poem, in the Sikh language, with considerable effect; while Miss FANNY L. FREEMAN, of Allahabad. Northern India, whose parents were killed by the Sepoys in the last Indian war, fairly ""took down the house"" by her admirable rendering of the poem ""When Freedom from her mountain heights."" The proceedings terminated with the Lord's Prayer, in the Sikh language, by Miss FANNY WALTER, and a benediction by Rev. Dr. ADAMS.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a0bfd08-09f3-50ef-834c-275e45d62fde,475,nyt://article/3a0bfd08-09f3-50ef-834c-275e45d62fde

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/10/archives/voice-of-the-london-press-from-the-london-saturday-review-from-the.html,,"The attack on Fort Sumter may be explained by the strong interest of the seceding States in provoking a collision. Although the officer in command seems to have sustained the honor of his flag, the result of the struggle could not have been doubtful. The Government of Washington must have foreseen the occurrence, and it bas throughout preserved the secret of its intentions with unusual firmness. The telegraphs and the newspaper correspondents have become so far aware of the change as to diversify their positive statements with occasional confessions of ignorance. A small force has been dispatched southward, but it has for some time been understood that the Cabinet had abandoned all intention of relieving Major ANDERSON in Fort Sumter. The remaining alternatives were the occupation of the posts on the Islands of the Southern coast, and the more formidable enterprise of reinforcing Gen. HOUSTON in Texas. In the absence of information, it may be safely assumed that Mr. Lincoln had never any intention of commencing hostilities, though it might be prudent to take up positions which might be serviceable in the event of a collision, while they would have a tendency to exercise a favorable influence on negotiation, Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS has probably a defensive force greatly superior to any army of which the Northern States could dispose for purposes of invasion. On the other hand, he cannot hope to command the sea, and he must be well aware that Foreign Powers will not be hasty to quarrel, on the subject of blockade, with the United States.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VOICE OF THE LONDON PRESS.; From the London Saturday Review.

PATTERSON's force en route for Washington is estimated at 15,000, but it will probably be a week before they reach that city, if indeed that is their destination. But as things stand now, we do not see how it would be possible, within three or four days, to marshal more than 25,000 men for the defence of the Capital.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs at Head-Quarters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs at Head-Quarters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8b23522-6792-5c25-a28d-095061012b4a,668,nyt://article/d8b23522-6792-5c25-a28d-095061012b4a

What direction this movement will take, it is of course impossible to say -- whether towards Norfolk, Richmond, or Harper's Ferry. Our Washington correspondent states that there are now in Washington and in the immediate vicinity some 30,000 troops, and more are daily arriving, both by railroad and by. transport. The regulars and volunteers which passed through Baltimore on Thursday afternoon, reached the Capital that night; and Gen. PATTERSON'S command, 15,000 strong, can be made available in a very short period. The movements of the secession forces in Virginia seem to be somewhat uncertain They evidently anticipate that the Government intends to take possession of Alexandria, and accordingly, to be out of harm's way, those who were stationed there yesterday commenced a retrograde movement to Culpepper. It is most likely, however, that instead of Alexandria, Harper's Ferry will be the point to which the Government will first direct its attention, as the rebel forces there have commenced a system of depredations upon the trade passing over the Baltimore Road which it will be necessary to put an end to immediately.

The plaintiff claims title in right of his wife, who was a daughter and one of the heirs of George Youle, who died seized of the said tract of land in 1828. After the death of Youle, the plaintiffs and one William F. Van Amringe, in May, 1834, filed a bill in chancery for the partition of the premises in question, and a decree for the sale thereof was made in May, 1835. The description of the land as contained in the bill and decree, are the same as that contained in the deed to Youle. The decree directed a sale of all the premises. The Master in Chancery, to whom it was referred, sold the premises in lots and exhibited at the sale a map of the property to be sold at the sale, parcel No. 8, as designated on said map, was purchased by Henry A. Slepper, who afterwards sold the same plot to the defendant. The question arose upon the trial, and is one of the principal questions now before the court, whether the Masters' deed, describing the lot as lot No. 8, which, it is alleged, included one-half the post road, actually carried with it the title to one-half the post-road. The read, it appears, has long since been closed, and in order to insure title to the strip of road bordering on his premises, the defendant obtained a deed of release from the Mayor and Commonalty of this city, which was excluded. It appears that no proof was offered by the plaintiffs, nor was any given, when the eastern post-road was opened, or how long it had been used as a read, or when or how long it was closed, or ceased to be a road. The point taken by counsel for defendant and appellant on this argument is, that the deed from the corporation was improperly excluded, as,",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reversionary Title to the Fee of a Public Highway Where Does it Rest?

"In the confusion of these times, there is no such utter fallacy as the idea, which seems to have taken possession of Kentucky and Missouri, of the neutrality of States. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/12/archives/neutrality.html,,"In the confusion of these times, there is no such utter fallacy as the idea, which seems to have taken possession of Kentucky and Missouri, of the neutrality of States. There is no such thing, there can be no such thing, as the neutrality of a State in the struggle now going on in this country. There can be no such thing in theory, no such thing as a practical fact. The great issue of the times involves the existence of the Constitution which comprehends all the States -- of the Union, which includes all the States. The duties and obligations, as between the people and the General Government, are the same in all the States alike, binding on the people of all the States. When Virginia attempts to subvert the Constitution or overturn the Union, she strikes at the rights of Kentucky and Missouri precisely the same as at those of New-York; and it is as much the duty of those States to aid in putting down the rebellion of Virginia, as it is of New-York. This theory of neutrality involves the idea of two rightfully existing powers struggling against each other, with which Kentucky and Missouri have nothing to do. Consider the fallacy of this. The General Government extends over all the territory of the country, embracing all the States, and while acting within its constitional sphere, paramount to all the States. Allegiance is due to it from every citizen, and it is his duty to defend and uphold it in its unity always. Kentucky and Missouri are as much a part of this Government as are New-York and Pennsylvania. A portion of the territory embraced in the States rebels. Its population determines to dissolve all connection with the rest of the Union and zet up as an independent nation. The duty of Government in regard to such rebellion no man will question. It may not have the power to overcome it, but its clear duty is to try. But who shall grapple with this rebellion? If New York says she will not, then New-York consents to dissolution, and practically sides with rebellion, -- throws her moral power on the side of treason, while she refuses to employ her physical energies for its overthrow. What would be thus true of New-York is true of Kentucky and Missouri. If all the loyal States held to this fallacy of neutrality, secession would have nothing to do but to define its boundaries, take possession of all the Government property within them and organize its government. Treason would accomplish its aims, subvert the Constitution and dissolve the Union without the expenditure of a dollar or the mustering of a regiment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Neutrality.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Neutrality.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/043b0058-aff3-5b4f-a01a-6afafd1d5fbf,862,nyt://article/043b0058-aff3-5b4f-a01a-6afafd1d5fbf

As to drill, of late years a change of opinion and practice has taken place similar to that which we have already noticed with regard to uniform. Military rigidity, which had become a by-word, is yielding to the attacks of a school which seeks to unite flexibility with precision. It is found that constant constraint does not increase, but on the contrary, seriously impairs the soldier's efficiency. There is a limit to every man's power of endurance; he has only a certain supply of nervous energy to draw upon. This can be exhausted as much by fret and worry and quiet suffering as by rapid movement and by wounds. Try to hold out your arm at full length for five minutes, or to avoid the need for muscular exertion -- stand with your arms hanging down immovable for fifteen minutes, and you will ""realize"" this truth. Even in the latter case you will find, unless you have been accustomed to the position, that you will suffer irritating discomfort, if not pain, in both arms and hands.

"Among our intelligence by the Great Eastern, we give an article from the London Times upon the affairs of this country. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/12/archives/english-views-of-the-war.html,,"Among our intelligence by the Great Eastern, we give an article from the London Times upon the affairs of this country. It differs in no essential respect from the previous commentaries of the same journal upon American questions, which appear to be an insoluble puzzle for the Thunderer, and to abate much of the dogmatism it is apt to bring to all its editorial discussions. In the present case the reader will be at no loss to discern the entire failure to appreciate the motives which have at last put the united North in action, or the energy which must inevitably result from the impulse. The Times compares the military strength of the Contending sections by the assumption that skill and experience are on the side of the South, allied with sufficient means and men; while the North lacks the skill, and has no mentionable advantage in the other particulars. We, who know better, are aware that Northern troops had a larger share of instruction in the military school of the Mexican war than those of the South; while here we have also European volunteers, practiced and thoroughly disciplined at home in martial exercises, and numerous enough to hold their own alone against the largest force procurable at the rebel States. We also know better the value of the credit displayed in the subscription to the Southern loan. Not one-half of the amount, after all means of compulsion had been exhausted, was secured; and that which the pressure of terror actually extorted was paid, not in gold or silver, but in over-issues of bank paper, unsupported by a specie basis. Such pecuniary resources are of small worth in a controversy such as the South has provoked; and in fact they could not keep an army of 20,000 men a-foot for a campaign of three months. Adding to this element of weakness the facts, that in the insurgent States food is almost exhausted, the commissariate of their army destitute, and that three millions of implacable and watchful enemies are at their firesides and shadowing their very threshholds, and we may appreciate how wide of the mark are the assumptions of the Times as to the likelihood of a long and doubtful struggle. All we require, indeed, is that the strength the people are prepared to exert shall be instantly and effectively employed. The prospect of a tedious war exists only in the chance that it may not be thus used and directed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'English Views of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'English Views of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/420513bf-5cdd-5b26-8b01-cc26f3b86f24,411,nyt://article/420513bf-5cdd-5b26-8b01-cc26f3b86f24

"In his present number Mr. DUNBAR has brought to a close the first series of his dissertations upon the condition of Mexico, and its relation to the United States. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/12/archives/new-publications-the-mexican-papers-number-five-containing-the.html,,"In his present number Mr. DUNBAR has brought to a close the first series of his dissertations upon the condition of Mexico, and its relation to the United States. Of the value of these contributions to our knowledge of a subject so ill understood, stood, we have had occasion to speak in terms of hearty appreciation as the successive issues have appeared, reserving, however, our assent from many of the positions assumed by the writer, and in some instances dissenting entirely from the results of his reasoning. To the industry, curious research, and ingenuity which have produced this closing number, we can hardly accord an excess of praise. The future of the Mexican people, as connected with Slavery, and to be affected by the expansive tendencies of the new Southern Pro-Slavery Confederation, is the immediate topic, which the writer illustrates by an elaborate history of the rise, culmination, and decline of the system of involuntary labor among modern nations. The African Slave-trade is traced, back to its origin among the Portuguese, shortly after the discovery of the western coast of Africa; the introduction of African Slavery into the Spanish West Indies to replace the expiring race of aborigines; its extension to Mexico, the Spanish Main, and the Atlantic Coast of South America; its arrival in the English colony of Virginia and its subsequent adoption by the other English settlements, as they were gradually organized, are recorded with careful accuracy, and constitute so much of the history as embraces the rise of commercial Slavery. The culminating period Mr. DUNBAR discovers to have been reached about 1790, when France and England moved simultaneously toward the project of universal emancipation; the former taking one of these long and rapid revolutionary strides by which the reformers of that day were apt to leave veteran and effete institutions behind; the latter, persuaded by philanthropy in the first instance, but afterwards impelled by a commercial necessity, resulting from the policy of France. Mr. DUNBAR's history of the Abolition movement, through the period of decadence, is no less curious and instructive than the previous chapter, bringing together, as it does, a , mass of information previously inaccessible without a laborious exploration of libraries. His inquiries have led him to the belief that in 1790 there were 3,000,000 of Negro and 7,000 of Indian slaves in the Western Hemisphere; the entire free civilized population being at that time 6,000,000. In other words, that nearly two-thirds of the population were in bondage. In 1860, Mr. DUNBAR estimates the free civilized population at 65,000,000, while the slaves are calculated at 7,179,778; in other words, the servile population has declined so as to be no more than one tenth of the entire, population. This numerical evidence of the decay of Slavery, Mr. DUNBAR, strengthens by demonstrating the steady contraction of the limits occupied by the slave labor during the same period of seventy years; and by showing how nearly the Slave-trade, with its reinforcements of negroes, has ceased to exist. The conclusion is inevitable. And while there has been a general conviction, founded upon less minute investigation than Mr. DUNBAR's, that Slavery is hastening to extinction at an always accelerated pace, the proof has never unsil now been absolutely circumstantial. Of the labor which has furnished this useful data, we cannot be too sensible.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; THE MEXICAN PAPERS.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/12/archives/amusements.html,,"With the exception of the Winter Garden, where Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. JEFFERSON keep large audiences in a constant state of jubilation, the theatres have not been especially cheerful during the past week. The usual business of the season has been brought to an abrupt end. People find more amusement in an ""extra"" than in the most popular place of amusement, and at that modest recreation, even at war prices, is more economical than a seat in the parquet, people have taken to it with unusual kindliness. A drama, peculiarly suited to the times -- ""Jessie Brown"" -- was revived at Wallack's Theatre on Monday, but failed to awaken the old favor. It was played through the week, and withdrawn on Saturday. The caste was an acceptable one. All the principal members of Mr. WALLACK's old company were included in it, with the exception of Mr. BLAKS, who has retired from the establishment. His part was filled by Mr. PEARSON, a very useful actor. The heroine was impersonated by Miss MORANT; Nenah Sahib by Mr. NORTON. We have no hesitation in saving that we prefer Miss AGNES ROBERTSON and Mr. DION BOURCICAULT, the original representatives of the same parts. Still, in the absence of these artists, it is but just to say that their substitutes were quite good, and had no previous impression existed, would, perhaps, have created a stronger effect. Mr. LESTER and Mrs. HOEY sustained their old parts, and made them as interesting as ever. In the last act they are both especially good. And how admirable is that last act, with its innumerable touches of earnest human nature and pathos. HOURCICAULT, as a dramatist, was always artistic; his proclivities were to the generous side of a man's character; his aversion the delineation of its opposite. That peculiar kind of drama which boasts of its first and second villains never received a single contribution from his pen. The Phantom and Nena Sahib are the only characters of a sombre kind he has delineated, and they appear only as dark spots on pictures otherwise blight. When the cotemporary drama receives a fair share of justice, the last act of ""Jessie Brown"" will certainly be remembered as one of We best contributions that his been made to it. Mr. WALLACK will open his new establishment, at the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth-street, during the early part of the Fall. The old theatre has been leased for a popular Music Hall, and is therefore cut of the theatrical market.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/86ae77ea-7db9-5bc1-b982-963b74b67bcc,672,nyt://article/86ae77ea-7db9-5bc1-b982-963b74b67bcc

Indignation at the attack on Fort Sumter seems to be the prevailing feeling throughout the Northern States. Mankind will always be more moved by the sound of actual warfare than by the violation of rights or the abandonment of compacts. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/12/archives/the-american-struggle-the-parties-to-the-contest.html,,"Indignation at the attack on Fort Sumter seems to be the prevailing feeling throughout the Northern States. Mankind will always be more moved by the sound of actual warfare than by the violation of rights or the abandonment of compacts. The Southern States may have torn the Constitution of the Union to pieces, but the patience of the North was not worn out until shot and shell had been poured into a Federal fortress, and a Federal officer had been led a prisoner through the rebellious City of Charleston. Now, however, there can be no doubt of the excitement all through the North. How long it may last, and whether it will survive a calm examination of the coming campaign, are other questions. For the present, there is an earnest desire in the Northern States to avenge the capture of Fort Sumter. The President's appeal has been responded to in every quarter. The feeling in New York City was so strong at the departure of the last steamer that the Herald, which has been throughout these troubles practically a Southern print, was forced to turn completely round and applaud the policy of the Government. The New England States and those of the West were also said to be zealous in the cause of the Union. Troops were being mustered in the leading towns and made ready to march for the defence of Washington, if not for the invasion of the Southern States. This outburst of loyalty may be attributed not a little to the restless character of the people. Year after year the military ardor of the Americans has been expended on militia field-days, on processions. Fourth of July demonstrations, and other proceedings equally showy and harmless. But something more has been demanded by the hot blood of the American youth. They leaped into the war with Mexico as if it were a relief from an intolerable tedium. It has required considerable judgment and forbearance to prevent a collision with Great Britain on several senseless disputes. Now, however, there is employment for every unquiet spirit. The Southerners have within a few hours come to be looked upon as enemies, against whom a crusade is meritorious. Even in New-York, which has been called with some justice a Southern city, where the productions of the South are dealt in more than in the southern cities themselves, where the Slavetracers are said to congregate, and where theparty of Mr. LINCOLN was small and weak a few months back, all traditions, all interests, all political feeling are now forgotten, and the whole community demands that justice should be done on the traitors of the South.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The American Struggle The Parties to the Contest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The American Struggle The Parties to the Contest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, May 1', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'May', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c720cb72-dc2b-5da7-91bc-feaae5f0e272,1571,nyt://article/c720cb72-dc2b-5da7-91bc-feaae5f0e272

BUTLER, who was at Annapolis, was immediately apprised of the movement, and sent to Col. JONES, who is in command at the Relay, a force of seven hundred men, beside the New-York Twentieth Regiment, which recently arrived there, as a reinforcement. Subsequently an additional reinforcement of sixteen hundred men and a body of cavalry and artillery was sent by Gen. MANSFIELD, to be ready to sustan Col. JONES at a moment's warning. Messengers who reached Washington late last night from Annapolis, by special train, stated that an attack was expected to take place upon Col JONES' position either last night or today.

It was not enough that they should be traitors individually, but as a Church they must prostitute even their religion and their organization to the wicked purpose of dissolving the Union. We remember when the South made a great outcry because a number of New-England clergymen petitioned Congress for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law. It was a grave offence in the eyes of the South for them to leave their pulpits and their preaching to meddle in politics, even so far as to petition Congress for the repeal of what they regarded as an unjust and iniquitous law. They were denounced as false to their high calling, degrading the religion of the cross to the level of party politics, and making the pulpit the handmaiden of the grog-shop and the primary forum in the propagandism of party creeds. But this was in New-England, and that made all the difference in the world in the estimation of ""our Southern brethren.""

Gen. SCOTT had resigned, and that the City of New-York was about to secede from the Union, and had offered to send a force of 40,000 men to join the army of the Confederate States. This news occasioned great rejoicing, and gun-firing was kept up in honor of it all night. The Northern merchants in Apilachicola were much distressed. Each had been called upon, and asked, in a menacing manner, ""Are you, or are you not, willing to fight for the Confederate States?"" Believing it necessary to save their lives, they had all answered that if necessary they would fight. On a similar question being asked our informant, by some persons who were strangers to him, he answered that he could not raise his hands against the Stars and Stripes. A crowd of rowdies immediately afterwards collected about him, and calling him an Abolitionist, a Northern spy, &c, threatened to take his life, but no one laid hands on him. A Colonel of militia called on him and asked him to volunteer, saying, at the same time, ""I am ordered to bring a certain number of men from here.

Almost all your lordships have, no doubt, read the accounts which arrived this morning from America, and must have learned with pain, as well as some astonishment, that a civil war had broken out between the Secessionists in that country and the other States of the Union. Fortunately, up to the date of those accounts, hardly any blood had been shed, and too much praise cannot, I think, be bestowed upon the commander of the fleet engaged in the transaction to which I refer for abstaining from entering on a useless contest. It is impossible, however, that a struggle such as that which seems now impending in America -- a struggle so unnatural, and calculated, I may add, to prove so fatal to the parties concerned in it -- should not produce a reverberation throughout the rest of the world. I may further observe that no country on this side of the Atlantic is, perhaps, more likely to suffer from the civil war which threatens the United States than our own; for, altogether apart from those feelings of regret with which we must witness the breaking out of strife between persons belonging to the same family as ourselves, and kindred to us in language as well as in blood, our political and material interests are deeply involved in this unhappy schism. That being so, I cannot but believe that Her Majesty's Ministers, feeling upon this question with all Her Majesty's subjects, have already done their utmost, by officious means, to bring about some arrangement by which so dreadful a calamity as that of which I am speaking, may be averted. I therefore wish to ask my noble friend what steps the Government have taken with that object; whether they have made any attempt to prevent the quarrel between the different States of the American Union from coming to a bloody issue; what hopes they entertain of succeeding in so laudable an endeavor, and whether they have invited, or are in correspondence with, any other European Government, with the view of obtaining their assistance in seeking to put a stop at the outset to a civil war, of which, if once fairly commenced, it will be impossible to foresee the end.

He had, therefore, signed conditional certificates for Mr. Hackley, certifying the amount of work done, but in no case had he stated in such certificates that the streets had been thoroughly cleaned. In granting Mr. Hackley this leniency, he says he exercised a discretion which he thought to be for the best interests of the City, being assured by the contractor that, as soon as the preliminary obstacles were removed, he was determined to clean the streets according to the strict terms of his contracts and in a manner that should be perfectly satisfactory to the citizens of New-York.

"Whatever may have been the case in former times, war springs now less from the caprice of rulers than from the madness of the people. For three months President LINCOLN has threatened war, and now he has declared it. Yet, neither when he was haranguing on his journey from the Far West, nor now that he is apparently about to direct the Militia of the Northern States against the Seceders, does he, as far as we can see, act from the impulses of his own disposition. He has been and is the organ of the Republican Party. He is bound by his official position, and by the pledges through which he attained it, to declare war against seceding slaveowners. So he has called on the States which still own his authority to send their contingents to the Federal Government. But it is plain that this is little more than a formality. The President, by his own authority, could not bring five thousand men into the field. Congress could not, without the help of the State Legislatures, levy troops enough to recover Fort Sumter, or to save Fort Pickens. The Proclamation of President LINCOLN is an appeal to the feelings of the people, which the Chief Magistrate throws out, and wants to see how it is received. We hear of loans, of great activity in the Federal arsenals, of the muster of Federal troops, of the arrival and departure of Federal ships of war and transports; but it is pretty plain, after all, that the war must be carried on, not by the Federal organization, but by popular enthusiasm. The Proclamation demand for 75,000 men, the threat to reoccupy the forts situated on Southern territory are only, as it were, the ""platform"" on which the Unionists take their stand. The President indorses the opinions of the Northerners, and that is all he can do. If they wish to enforce them they must fight the battle themselves. New-York, and Pennsylvania, and Ohio have each their nominal contingent in the force which has just been demanded; but it remains with them whether they will supply the number required, or half of it, or none at all, or whether, on the contrary, they will rush to arms, and march on a crusade against the enemies of the Stars and Stripes. For the result of the Presidential appeal we must wait a few days. As yet we have but a confused notion of this great call to arms. Whether the President be bent on fighting it out, or merely performs his duty and fulfills his pledge by giving the Union an opportunity of defence, -- whether he operates against the forts or not, -- it is plain that any war which ensues must be carried on by the zeal of the two sections, without much assistaac from the central power of Washington. Like a great feudatory of the olden times rather than a modern ruler, President LINCOLN calls his retainers together for a raid on those who have thrown off his authority. He can do nothing without them; he can do little to help them. He can only open the war, pretty much as our own gracious SOVEREIGN would open an exhibition. He goes through a moral review at Tilbury Fort. Without an army, without constitutional authority to levy one till Congress sits in July, with a big indefensible village for a capital, with one of the two States which inclose Washington hostile, and the other at least dubious, with a large force of Virginia desperadoes ready for an attack on the city, the President has nothing to do but throw himself on the country -- that is, the section of the remaining Union which is attacked to the principles on which he was elected.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/14/archives/the-impolicy-of-coercionwhy-england-is-interested.html,,"Whatever may have been the case in former times, war springs now less from the caprice of rulers than from the madness of the people.

Like a great feudatory of the olden times rather than a modern ruler, President LINCOLN calls his retainers together for a raid on those who have thrown off his authority. He can do nothing without them; he can do little to help them. He can only open the war, pretty much as our own gracious SOVEREIGN would open an exhibition. He goes through a moral review at Tilbury Fort. Without an army, without constitutional authority to levy one till Congress sits in July, with a big indefensible village for a capital, with one of the two States which inclose Washington hostile, and the other at least dubious, with a large force of Virginia desperadoes ready for an attack on the city, the President has nothing to do but throw himself on the country -- that is, the section of the remaining Union which is attacked to the principles on which he was elected.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE IMPOLICY OF COERCION-WHY ENGLAND IS INTERESTED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE IMPOLICY OF COERCION-WHY ENGLAND IS INTERESTED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, April 30', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'April', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb32fd6a-2a14-5411-ab97-fd361499681c,2698,nyt://article/bb32fd6a-2a14-5411-ab97-fd361499681c

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/14/archives/invasion-not-the-presidents-policy.html,,"But the mail arrived yesterday, besides the additional details of the most humane, if not the most satisfactory bombardment on record, brings us the proclamation of President LINCOLN, issued immediately on the receipt of the news that Fort Sumter had fallen, placing the seven seceding. Status beyond the pale of the Union, and calling for a contingent from the non-revolting States of 75,000 men, to ""suppress combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed,"" and convening both Houses of Parliament for the 4th of July next. This proclamation was, it is stated, to have been followed by requisitions to be addressed to the Governors of the various States which still acknowledge the authority of the Federal Government. Pennsylvania and New-York will be asked for quotas of 13,000 men each, Massachusetts for 2,000, Maryland for 3,000, and ""the other States in proportion."" In estimating the effect of the President's proclamation, formidable as such a step may at first sight appear, we must not be led by reason of the attendant circumstances to regard this step as a direct declaration of war, and a hopeless committal of the Federal Government to hostilities with the South. The American President, when he heard that a collision had occurred between the Southerners and the forces of the Union, could not possibly have remained quiescent. Some action became indispensable if he and his colleagues were not prepared to resign their authority, and the trust it involves, to other hands; and a more harmless mode of proceeding than that of calling for a contingent from the States still within the Union could not have been devised. If we take this apparently energetic levy of 75,000 men in connection with the conduct of Major ANDERSON, and of the officer of the flotilla that witnessed the bombardment of Fort Sumter without firing a shot -- conduct which must, beyond question, have been prompted, or, at all events, acquiesced in by the Cabinet at Washington -- we shall be disposed to regard the proclamation and bombardment as about equally warlike. There is no doubt, however, that affairs are in a most critical position, and that a want of judgment now may precipitate a civil war. The passions of the South are roused, and it will require great management to prevent them breaking out into acts of violence, and bringing with them the Border States, who have been content, so far, to adopt an attitude of neutrality. It is difficult to see how, with any contingent he may raise, President LINCOLN can assume the aggressive, and carry the war into the Secessionists,' country, in order to suppress that combination which he says is no longer within the reach of ""judicial proceedings, or the powers vested in the marshals by law."" The North will find the necessary contingent, notwithstanding the rejection of the enrolment on the part of Kentucky; but Mr. LINCOLN, we may rest assured, does not contemplate marching an army into the Southern States, even if such a movement were practicable, which every one acquainted with the States knows it is not. The fleet of the Union is, it is true, in the hands of the Federal Government, but the approaches to Charleston, Mobile, and New-Orleans are too well defended to render an attack on any of those places a wise measure. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that the Southern interest has for the past eight years borne almost undisputed sway at Washington. During that period, we may be quite sure, every vacancy in the fleet has been filled up with officers whose sentiments are well understood. Who is to say, therefore, that the fleet would, if called upon, act against the Southerners? And the finding of officers to supersede those in command would, we may be sure, be no easy matter. Looking, therefore, at the state of affairs in America closely, and calmly considering, on the one hand, the reluctance of the Federal Government to engage in hostilities, and the great difficulty in the way of rendering any armed movement against the South effective by sea or by land; and on the other, the whole character of the movement amongst the Southerners, whose objects are really to be gained by negotiation, not by violence, we cannot come to the conclusion that either party has drawn the sword with the determinatin to throw away the scabbard. The contingent about to be raised will probably be employed in rendering Washington perfectly secure against attack, and when that security has been accomplished, we shall probably find that the Federal Government will pause before another step is taken in the direction of repression by force of arms.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""INVASION NOT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""INVASION NOT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Shipping Gazette, April 29', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'April', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d390bfaf-0d27-5e20-b2bc-5ece2f3b0f36,1806,nyt://article/d390bfaf-0d27-5e20-b2bc-5ece2f3b0f36

This is the natural sentiment of a barbarous toward a highly civilized people. The South see the vast industries of the North, and believe the latter to be completely emasculated by their pacific pursuits, forgetting that their vast acquisitions are so many additional inducements for fighting in their defence, whenever their safety is imperiled. The South entertain towards the North the same sentiments that the Mexicans did toward the United States, and the Chinese toward England and France, previous to the lessons these barbarians have lately received. But all history tells that the higher the civilization of a people, the greater their military prowess. Knowledge is power. Roman intelligence conquered all the barbarous races that came in its way, despite the desperate courage and physical energy which characterized them. English civilization has carried its resistless march over a large portion of the globe; and in the same way and by a necessary law, is the civilization of the North to supplant, by its superior vigor and life, the semi barbarous civilization of the South. Northern civilization has a hundred steamships engaged in the transmission of troops and in blockading Southern ports. This fact is conclusive of the whole contest, for the mixed civilization of the South cannot, unaided, put afloat a single one of these terrible engines of war.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Historical View of the Military Qualities of the North and South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Historical View of the Military Qualities of the North and South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f213cafc-bd1d-5280-940f-a134f3464dee,856,nyt://article/f213cafc-bd1d-5280-940f-a134f3464dee

Judging by his declaration to the Virginia ... ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/15/archives/effect-of-stopping-supplies.html,,"President LINCOLN is now free to act, and it may be worth our while to examine the means by which he proposes to coerce the seceded States back into the Union. Judging by his declaration to the Virginia Commissioners, and his proclamation of war against the South, we are led to conclude that coercion will in no sense be invasion. The President designs merely to occupy and possess the property which belongs to the Federal Government, and few will dispute his right so to do, even though such occupation should entail civil war. This avowal gives us the clue to Mr. LINCOLN's policy, when taken in connection with the fact that every Southern port is to be blockaded, and the mails stopped to seceded States. It is not proposed to enter the States composing the Southern Confederation, but merely to regain the property which belongs, and always has belonged to the Federal Government. This is precisely what the South most desires to avoid, for of Mr. LINCOLN can retake and hold the Balize forts at the mouth of the Mississippi and the defences of Pensacola, Savannah, and Charleston, Southern independence will become impossible and the seceders be compelled to return to their allegiance. There is no community in the civilized world more dependent upon other nations than this newly-formed Republic; for the very necessaries of life are brought from the Free States, and every manufactured article is also imported. Cotton is the life-blood of the Confederation and of the citizens themselves, for cotton furnishes the wherewithal to carry on the Government and the means to supply the wants of the planners and their slaves. Unless the fibre be exported, and goods and provisions received in exchange, the whole community must starve; and Mr. Lincoln designs to put the seceders into this position, so as to compel submission. Whether he has the power to effect his purpose we need scarcely stop to examine, but he can, at all events, keep up such a state of alarm upon the Southern coast as will vitally affect commerce if it do not annihilate it. The Government of Montgomery evidently fears this result, but, as the Southern Confederation does not possess a navy, it is difficult to tell how that result can be obvisted.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EFFECT OF STOPPING SUPPLIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EFFECT OF STOPPING SUPPLIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a38b90cd-a7a8-5956-9de3-b8b211e397c7,379,nyt://article/a38b90cd-a7a8-5956-9de3-b8b211e397c7

WILHELMINA BLIGH, a German girl, employed as nurse in the family of Mr. GREEN, was filling a fluid lamp, when it exploded, scattering the flames over her person, and burning her so severely, that she cannot possibly survive. The lamp was blown into fragments. Her clothes were burnt completely from her body, and a child, which was in her arms at the time, was also severely burned, but not fatally. When found, she was lying at the foot of a narrow staircase, in a smouldering heap; the doorway against which she lay, was ignited, but prompt assistance extinguished the flames. The house was dark, and as some difficulty was experienced in procuring a light, her clothes were completely burned from her body before any material assistance could be rendered. Dr. GARDNER, who was fortunately near at the time, rendered professional aid and alleviated the sufferings as far as was possible with the scanty materials at hand. She was conveyed as soon as possible to the Hospital. The alarm of fire was given, and engines were promptly on the spot, but their services were not required.

This will, of course, include the Fourteenth Regiment of Brooklyn, and several others which have for some time been kept in tantalizing suspense. Another good service which the delegation did yesterday was to visit the quarters of the various New-York Regiments quartered at and near Washington, and ascertain their wants, which, will promptly be attended to.

The States, we were assured, could not dispense with the right to issue letters of-marque to private adventurers, authorizing them to ""burn, sink, and destroy"" -- and plunder -- the shipping of any Power with which they might be at war, seeing that otherwise, not having, and not choosing to maintain, a powerful navy, they would be incapable of injuring their enemy at sea. The other available use of a navy -- that of protecting their commerce -- privateers could not supply. They are simply destructive, and can neither convoy a fleet of merchantmen nor guard the entrance to a port. And for this purely destructive purpose -- and avowedly for this purpose -- the States would retain the right.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FALSE POSITION OF THIS GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIVATEERING QUESTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FALSE POSITION OF THIS GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIVATEERING QUESTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Globe, May 3', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'May', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11f895c1-2844-590e-bfa9-1369e7a42c34,647,nyt://article/11f895c1-2844-590e-bfa9-1369e7a42c34

"Another act in the terrible drama of blood that opened so fearfully on Friday, was enacted last evening, and six more victims were added to the already sad list of dead. Two scenes of blood so close together, and so frightful in their results, have seldom before plunged a city into mourning. At about half-past five o'clock in the evening, a large body of the German Home Guards entered the city through Fifth-street, from the arsenal, where they had been enlisted during the day, and furnished with arms. Large crowds collected to witness their march, and they passed unmolested along until they reached Walnut, when they turned up that street and proceeded westward. Large crowds were collected on these corners, who hooted and hissed as the companies passed, and one man standing on the steps of the Church fired a revolver into the ranks. A soldier fell dead, when two more shots were fired from the windows of a house near by. At this time the head of the column, which reached as far as Seventh, suddenly turned and, leveling their rifles, fired down the street, and promiscuously among the spectators, who lined the pavement. Shooting as they did directly towards their own rear ranks, they killed some of their men as well as those composing the crowd. The shower of bullets was for a moment terrible, and the only wonder is that more lives were not lost. The misslies of lead entered the windows and perforated the doors of private residences, tearing the ceilings and throwing splimers in every direction. The house of Mr. MATHEWS was entered by three bullets, and Mr. MATHEWS' daughter was struck slightly by a spent ball. On the street, the scene presented as the soldiers moved off, was sad indeed. Six men lay dead at different points, and several were wounded and shrisking with pain upon the pavements. The dead carts, which have become familiar venicles since the scenes of the last two days, were soon engaged in removing the corpses from the ground. The wounded were carried to the Health Office. Four of the men killed were members of the regiment, and two were citizens. Last night the former had not been recognized. JERRY SWITZELAN, an engineer on the river, was passing by the door of Mr. H. GLOVER's residence, on Seventh-street, next to Walnut, when a pail struck him in the head, and scattered his brains over the door and walls. A pool of blood marked the spot where he fell, after his body had been removed. JEREMIAH GODFREY a hired man of Mr. COZZENS, County Surveyor, was working in the yard of Mr. COZZENS at the time of the occurrence. While, stopping over, in the act of fastening some flowers to a frame, three soldiers entered the gate, and approaching within the yard, fired three shots into his body. Fortunately, none of them were fatal, being all flesh wounds. The family witnessed the affair, and says that the man had not been out of the yard, and was unaware of the approach of his assailants until stricken down by their bullets. CHARLES H. WOODWARD, a clerk in POMEROY & BENTON's store, was shot in the shoulder, and will have to have his entire arm amputated. He was carried into the residence of Mr. MATHEWS and kindly cared for. JAMES F. WELSH, living at No. 189 Wash-street, between Fourteenth and Fifteenth streets, was shot through the foot. MICHAEL DAVY, residing between O'Fallen and Cass avenue and Sixth and Seventh, received a ball through the ankle, and amputation will be necessary. JOHN NELUS was wounded in the cheek. Several others were injured slightly. The houses on the right side of Walnut, from Fifth to Seventh, were considerably injured by bullets, and the inmates in several cares had very narrow escapes. At a late hour in the night the bodies of JOHN GABNIN, whose brother keeps a livery-stable on Market street. WILLIAM CODY, a book peddler, from New-Orleans, and JOHN DICK, a German soldier, were recognized among the dead.

Mr. EWART, representing the greatest em- ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/17/archives/validity-of-the-blockade.html,,"The question which was last night asked by Mr. JOSEPH EWART, on the subject of American privateers, cannot of course be dissociated from the proclama- tion which Mr. LINCOLN has recently issued, declaring a blockade of the Southern ports, and announcing that the Federal Government will treat as pirates all letters of marque which may be fitted out by the insurgent States. Mr. EWART, representing the greatest emporium of American trade which exists not only in this country, but in the world, is naturally enough anxious to ascertain the amount of protection which her Majesty's Ministers are prepared to afford to British commerce in the Gulf of Mexico. This interpelation was in every sense equaly timely and necessary. Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS, the President of the Southern Confederation, anticipating by a few days the action of the federal Government, has stated his intention of commissioning privateers. He has practically thrown down a challenge and instituted a policy which the North, to insure success, has only to imitate and enforce. But, considering that the great staple export of the South is cotton, upon every bale of which the new. Confederation has lately levied a war tax, the legality of this trade, whether carried on in foreign or American ships, becomes a matter of deep and serious consideration. The South possesses no commercial marine which could not be easily swept from the seas by the privateers of New-York and, Boston; but, if the privilege of issuing letters-of-marque were once conceded to the insurgent, the whole of the commerce between Europe and American would be placed in a position of imminent peril and danger. Under these circumstances Lord JOHN RUSSELL, in reply to Mr. EWART, simply stated that Her Majesty's Government felt very deeply that it was imperative on them to take all possible means to avoid any participation in this lamentable conflict, and that nothing but the imperative duty of protecting British interests could jointly them in interferfering, adding these emphatic words, ""We are now free, and for Goo's sake let us keep out of the quarrel."" We do not image that British shipowners, with the fear of risks and insurances before their eyes, will be rash enough to endeavor to carry on an illicit and lucrative trade by accepting the protection which either bellegerent may offer. There can be no doubt that the President, in strict interpretation of public law, has a right both to declare a blockade of the Southern ports and to treat Southern privateers, when captured, as pirates. With regard to the one, he has this condition to observe, namely, that the blockade be effectual, which has always been the American practice, as well as the rule within the recognized the lake treaty of Paris With regard to the employment of privateers, the American Government has always maintained a position of isolation. It has refused to surrender the privilege of granting letters-of-marque except the concession were accompanied by the assertion of the rule that in the of war all commence not contraband of war should enjoy equal immunity upon land and sea. This is not only a fallacious but an impossible doctrine, because we all know from history that property on land, whenever the exigencies of war require it, is as liable to confiscation and destruction as goods at sea. Mr. LINCOLN is acting in strict conformity with precedent in declaring that he will treat and punish all Southern privateers as pirates. In the Mexican War, when it was supposed that foreigners might be disposed to intervene in the contest on behalf of Mexico, Mr. POLK issued a proclamation declaring that he would deal with all such offendors as robbers and pirates. The present case is one infinitely stronger. The Federal Government is engaged in war with the Southern Insurgents, whose independent and separate existence, either dejure or de facto, has never yet been recognized by any Power in the world.In contemplation of public law they are simply rebels; and, as against them, the policy which Mr. Lincoln has announce is not only valid in itself, but is one which oreign nations are bound to admit and respect. Believing that the present movement can only be effectually repressed by a maritime war which, by depriving the South of its resources, would in all probability speedily reduce the new Confederation to national bankruptcy, we think that Mr. LINCOLN has acted wisely and in conformity with strict law in having availed himself of the means which, it must be admitted, he can exercise without offence or injury to any foreign Power. To preserve that policy of neutrality which Lord JOHN RUSSELL last night so forcibly expressed is the duty of this country. Interference can do no good either for commercial or political purposes. The civil war which unhappily rages in America must be left to work itself out, however disastrous its results may be to the commercial and manufacturing industry of this country.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VALIDITY OF THE BLOCKADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'VALIDITY OF THE BLOCKADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Post, (Ministerial,) May 3', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Ministerial', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}, {'firstname': 'May', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 3}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97e9112c-5888-5953-9bb8-5d69a2637f90,822,nyt://article/97e9112c-5888-5953-9bb8-5d69a2637f90

"Mr. OCHILTREE, of Texas, offered in the Montgomery Congress, the other day, a resolution in relation to the protection of the Indian tribes scattered over the territories, in which he speaks flippantly of the ""late United States."" ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/18/archives/the-late-united-states.html,,"Mr. OCHILTREE, of Texas, offered in the Montgomery Congress, the other day, a resolution in relation to the protection of the Indian tribes scattered over the territories, in which he speaks flippantly of the ""late United States."" According to the notions of these Texan gentlemen, their revolution is accomplished, the Union is destroyed, and the great Republic of the United States has already become a thing of the past -- taken its place in history among the things that have been. Under an imbecile Administration, when the President was conniving at treason, and consenting to disintegration; when his Cabinet was robbing the Treasury, and placing the armaments of the country at the disposal of conspirators who were plotting its overthrow; when Southern States were plundering armories, and Southern chivalry was stealing the contents of sub-treasuries and mints, it was not singular that an idea should prevail that the Federal Government was becoming a myth -- that its vitality was lost past hope of recuperation, and that dissolution was already among the accomplished facts of the age. With an army equipped from the spoils of Federal property, organized and drilled into efficiency by deserters from the Federal ranks, and ready to work for the destruction of the Union, while not a soldier was summoned, nor the voice of a Federal officer raised in remonstrance, or invoking aid in its defence, the Southern revolutionists might well suppose that there would be no opposition to their schemes, and that history had already recorded the edict of their triumph. But a new light has dawned upon the world, and these Southern gasconaders are blind that they do not see it. The twenty millions of the East, the North, and the West, embracing all of the Free States, and at least two of the Slave, have risen in their unity and their might, resolved that these United States shall not be reckoned among the things that have been. They have declared that this Republic of North America is more than ever before a living entity, full of organic strength and enduring vitality, and that it shall be handed down in all its fair proportions, to the generations who are to come after them. The imbecility and inertia of the past has given place to a living and resistless energy; the inertia of the late Administration, its cowardice, and its corruptions, has been succeeded by an almost superhuman activity, a patriotism that looks only to the salvation of the Union, and a coinage that is intimidated by no menaces of its overthrow. This rally of the North is confined to no locality, no section, no political organization, no class. The whole country is awake and speaks with one voice. All party bickerings, all political prejudices, all political associations, have been swept away, and the whole North moves in a solid phalanx, a mighty brotherhood, impelled only by the spirit of patriotism to the defence of the Constitution and the Union. All hope of aid from the North, so confidently cherished by the South, has vanished away. Loyalty has hushed the voice of dissension, and these twenty millions think and speak and act to-gether, on the momentous issue of the day. Their money, their energies, all their treasure, all their blood, are at the service of their country, and all their strength ready on the instant in its defence. These twenty-one loyal States, with their twenty millions of men, are more than the thirteen States, with their seven millions of men, who have declared for secession, even if Missouri and Kentucky shall join the great conspiracy. They are richer, stronger, more united, and fixed as destiny in the resolve that the Union shall not be destroyed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Late United States.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Late United States.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd4f1e42-6cb0-5b04-b637-564677bc777b,714,nyt://article/fd4f1e42-6cb0-5b04-b637-564677bc777b

"This officer has been for many years a resident of Quincy. His father was shot in the streets of that city by an old enemy. There had been the most bitter feud between the two for a long time, and the quarrel was finally settled at the West -- by an appeal to arms, and a bloody verdict. So that Col. PRENTISS comes of a race that always had fight in it. This is not his first experience in the martial front of battle. When the war with Mexico stirred up our young men to go in defence of the National flag, then, as now, there was a call for volunteers: and then, as now, Col. PRENTISS was foremost among those who signified their intention of responding to the call. He was only a lieutenant then in a company from Quincy. But when the regiment came to be organized, and the well-remembered JOHN J. HARDIN was elected colonel, he followed the usual custom of selecting his adjutant from his lieutenants, and PRENTISS was chosen. With HARDIN he went to Mexico; by HARDIN's side he fought in every battle until that gallant chieftain fell, and with his own hands he helped to dress his corpse for the last rites of humanity. Daring that entire campaign, he was the most intimate friend of that lamented officer, and the sash which he wears now at the head of his regiment is the one which HARDIN wore on that last fatal field. Not only has Col. PRENTISS acquired a character for intrepid bravery and military skill, but he is also an accomplished orator. By trade, he is a rope maker, and the knack of spinning yarns never deserts him. He came to Springfield at the head of his company, to assist in the funeral obsequies of Gov. BISSELL. Though not a professed politician. Col. PRENTISS is too well known, and too popular where known, not to be of some note. In 1860 he ran for Congress in the fifth district against MORRIS, but his party were too far in the minority to elect him. He is now very much talked of for Brigadier-General of the forces of this State.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/19/archives/col-bm-prentiss-springfield-correspondence-missouri-democrat.html,,"This officer has been for many years a resident of Quincy.

PRENTISS comes of a race that always had fight in it. This is not his first experience in the martial front of battle. When the war with Mexico stirred up our young men to go in defence of the National flag, then, as now, there was a call for volunteers: and then, as now, Col. PRENTISS was foremost among those who signified their intention of responding to the call. He was only a lieutenant then in a company from Quincy. But when the regiment came to be organized, and the well-remembered JOHN J. HARDIN was elected colonel, he followed the usual custom of selecting his adjutant from his lieutenants, and PRENTISS was chosen. With HARDIN he went to Mexico; by HARDIN's side he fought in every battle until that gallant chieftain fell, and with his own hands he helped to dress his corpse for the last rites of humanity. Daring that entire campaign, he was the most intimate friend of that lamented officer, and the sash which he wears now at the head of his regiment is the one which HARDIN wore on that last fatal field. Not only has Col. PRENTISS acquired a character for intrepid bravery and military skill, but he is also an accomplished orator. By trade, he is a rope maker, and the knack of spinning yarns never deserts him. He came to Springfield at the head of his company, to assist in the funeral obsequies of Gov. BISSELL. Though not a professed politician. Col. PRENTISS is too well known, and too popular where known, not to be of some note. In 1860 he ran for Congress in the fifth district against MORRIS, but his party were too far in the minority to elect him. He is now very much talked of for Brigadier-General of the forces of this State.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Col. B.M.

When that time shall come, they will hold a stern reckoning with the demagogues who have deluded and the leaders who have betrayed them. When the destruction of their material interests shall be made manifest through the agency of ocean blockades, and the obstruction of the channels of business landwards; when their cities shall be desolate, and their rivers a waste of waters; when their commerce shall be annibilated, and their trade destroyed; when their cry of sorrow for their killed in battle shall be heard in their dwellings, and the wounded and maimed of their armies shall return to their homes to languish and to die; when labor shall find no employment; when the poor shall cry for bread, and the wealthy shall be persecuted by the tax-gatherer; the inquiry will be made, whence their sufferings came, and why they should be visited wish this blight of death. No matter who shall triumph, or who suffer defeat in this unnatural struggle, the question will still be asked, What great evil was to be avoided, or what good achieved, that they should be thus required to tread the glowing plowshares with uncovered feet? Were they subjected to a tyranny that required these mighty sacrifices in defence of their rights or their manhood? Of all the governments in the world, there is none so free as that of these United States -- no constitutions so full of guarantees in favor of liberty -- no laws so just -- no institutions so liberal. In no other country on the face of the earth are human rights so effectually guarded, human freedom so perfectly protected. The principle of self government, in all its broad significance, underlies all our institutions, not in theory merely, but as a great practical fact. Every man's home every man's person, every man's property, every man's family, all his interests and all his rights, are sacredly guarded by all the guarantees which law can throw around them. Our officers are of our own choosing, selected at short periods and by our own suffrages. The laws are of our own enacting, and even our Constitution was of our own framing. We had no standing army to eat up our substance or overa we our action, for with thirty millions of people our whole military force was less than fifteen thousand. Of all the people in the world we are least burdened by taxation. There is no distinction of caste, no privileged classes, no aristocracy. Each individual is free to think, free to speak, tree to act -- all the employments of business, all the avenues to wealth, all the paths to preferment and honor are open to him; he is free to go everywhere without question and without espionage. The Courts are open to him for the adjustment of his rights and the protection of his person and his property. All the resources of wisdom, all the promptings of humanity, all the instincts of patriotism, were exhausted in framing our institutions, so as to secure to all men the broadest possible freedom compatible with human government and the necessities of civilization.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Reckoning of the Future.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Reckoning of the Future.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b4e59288-84ed-5140-bc7c-1ed87457b469,1775,nyt://article/b4e59288-84ed-5140-bc7c-1ed87457b469

He alludes to the threatening mob at Philadelphia, and the courteous and judicious action of the Mayor and his police in protecting him; also to the many dangerous innuendoes concocted by his enemies at Wilmington, threatening his person. He is particularly severe on the newspapers of Philadelphia for the indirect support they gave of mob violence. In conclusion, he says he knows his duties as a citizen of Delaware and of the United States, and is conscious of no violation of them. His term of office as Senator does not expire until March, 1863, but, when satisfied that civil war, to which he is opposed,cannot be averted, and finds that the public sentiment of Delaware prefers such a result to a peaceful separation, he will resign. It will require but a few days after the assembling of Congress, for him to determine whether the last hope of peace has fled, and he can then act.

There is now no longer any danger of a descent upon the Capital from that direction, and the rebel troops now there will probably do as little damage to the cause of the Union there as anywhere.

"The more thoroughly foreign governments comprehend the true state of affairs in this country, the greater will be the dilemma in which they will find themselves placed. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/20/archives/no-british-interference.html,,"The more thoroughly foreign governments comprehend the true state of affairs in this country, the greater will be the dilemma in which they will find themselves placed. We cannot expect their sympathy in a contest waged for the maintenance of purely Democratic or popular institutions, against an oligarchy copied, in spirit at least, somewhat after their own. Although we are resisting the aggressions of Slavery, and fighting in defence of the best features of the English constitution, we must not look for a word of encouragement or approbation from their Government. Its Minister for Foreign Affairs, when the subject was brought up in Parliament, only asked that England may not become involved in the contest, leaving it to be inferred that its merits are exactly balanced. This cold shoulder is well calculated to dampen the newly-awakened ardor of filial love to the venerable parent, which the visit of the Prince of Wales awakened in the hearts of our people. Had this sentiment been properly reciprocated, the most solid friendship might have been cemented between the two countries. But Englishmen could not penetrate the meaning of the great ovation to a Prince of the blood. They set it down to our love of excitement, our national impertinence, and in uneradicated love for monarchical institutions. England, like an aged, and not over-fond parent, happy to be rid of troublesome and restless children, sends so thought after the adventurers that for centuries have quit her shores, for colonization or mercantile adventure, but plods along in her beaten path indifferent to all that does not come within the round of daily observation and experience. Not so with the children and the descendants of those that have left her soil and her firesides. To them England stands as the type of everything cherished and endeared. From it they derive their language, literature, laws and nationality. They go to England to trace back the line of their descent, if possible, to remotest times, and visit with uncovered head, gushing heart and moistened eye the sacred spot which their ancestors consecrated with their presence, or which now holds and protects their bones. Such sentiments are the deepest and most lasting in human nature. All of us would make, if we could, a pilgrimage to the Mecca where our hearts are enshrined. This the presence of the Prince brought, in idea at least, to each one of us, and the yearnings of a lifetime for an instant had full fruition. England could not reach the sublimity of our passion nor respond with anything but churlish indifference and repulse.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'No British Interference.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'No British Interference.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6d2a03b1-f832-5d72-a317-4efdd58bf628,1155,nyt://article/6d2a03b1-f832-5d72-a317-4efdd58bf628

"We may not yet fully understand the position that may have been taken by the British Government in reference to our controversy with the rebel States, but enough has been received to create a feeling of disappointment and apprehension by the manner in which this is viewed, and the proposed action in reference to it. The whole object of the rebellion was to overthrow our Government, as a means of extending the area of African Slavery. In such a contest, the antecedents of England led us to suppose that her sympathies would be on the side, not only of humanity, but of order, and that she would do nothing to encourage one of the vilest conspiracies that have disgraced the annals of history. We know that in her intercourse with nations, she has no higher standard than the low one of apparent self-interest; but we supposed that even this would incline her to our side. We know that in all the struggles for freedom, she has, without exception, ranged herself on the side of despotism, and that not only by her diplomacy, but by her military arm, sought to crush the efforts of patriots to throw off the most galling oppressions; but we put such things down to her political system, which is of a piece, and in fullest sympathy with the despotisms of the old world. We know that her governing classes have always looked with unfriendly eyes upon this country, and that the present Premier had always steadily cherished an undisguised hostility toward us, but we did not think they would seize upon the first opportunity to display an hostility to us, in our efforts to maintain a Constitutional Government, and to put a limit to the further extension of human servitude. It seems we have been mistaken. England undoubtedly imagines this country to be irretrievably rent asunder, and does not hesitate to widen the breach, by extending aid and comfort to the weaker party in the struggle. The position she takes is that the rebel States are belligerents, and not in rebellion against the constituted authorities. Several sequences result, or may be claimed to result, from this premise. In the first place, privateering is allowed, and her own Courts opened for condemnation of prizes. In the second place, the existence of the rebel government, de facto, may be accepted; in the third, all Southern ports, not actually blockaded by a competent force, are to be opened to her vessels. The object of all this is apparent. It is to secure the customary supply of cotton, and to give to the contest a semblance of equality, and thereby aid indirectly, perhaps, in breaking up the Confederacy. The precedent brought forward by England to justify her recognition of privateering on the part of the South -- the right awarded to Greece in her contest with the Turks -- is certainly not flattering to our national vanity, nor does it seem to have much applicability to the present ease. In the first place, Greece was a conquered province, -- never a part of the Turkish empire by compact or consent. She was considered by all Europe as having abundant grounds for a revolt from cruelties and oppressions, which, in an advancing civilization, were no longer to be borne. This is a well-established fact in history. Still, her independence was not acknowled for years. Neither did England recognize her right to send out privateers till she had so far destroyed the Turkish fleet as to be master of the seas. She subsequently lost much of the superiority she had gained; but when her right as a belligerent was recognized, she was believed to have substantially achieved her independence. But England proposes to recognize the rights of the South as belligerents, even before a shot (except at Fort Sumter) has been fired, -- before she has put a vessel to sea, or made single demonstration upon land. The Government of the United States is not to be put upon a par with that of Turkey. The Southern States were a component part of it by their own consent and compact. They do not allege a single act of oppression or injustice, or that a single illegal or unusual step bas been taken, or that any cause of complaint exists, except that they cannot extend Slavery and rivet more firmly its chains. The precedent cited consequently has not the slightest parallelism to our own case, and its citation is the gravest insult that could be offered to us. The resort to such an authority shows how desperate is the case by which it is sought to be sustained. In the Greek war of independence, England, whatever her motives, took sides with Christianity and Civilization, against the most odious social, religious and political despotism which at that time disgraced the face of the earth. She now proposes to ally herself with the most repulsive social and political system existing at this day, against the most perfect realization of all that is grand and noble in her own Constitution.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/21/archives/a-word-to-englishmen.html,,"We may not yet fully understand the position that may have been taken by the British Government in reference to our controversy with the rebel States, but enough has been received to create a feeling of disappointment and apprehension by the manner in which this is viewed, and the proposed action in reference to it.

"The question as to the disposition of European powers to embark in the American war, only becomes important when we have found them in a position to indulge it. No one of them is at this moment in such position. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/21/archives/europe-in-bonds-not-to-interfere.html,,"The question as to the disposition of European powers to embark in the American war, only becomes important when we have found them in a position to indulge it. No one of them is at this moment in such position. A conflict such as has not been witnessed since the first years of the century, is impending over Europe, and is so universally expected to burst north at any moment, that public stocks stand permanently at the war level, and speculation confines itself to conjectures as to where the shock shall first be felt. Never were so many questions, involving so many Powers, awaiting at the same moment the arbitrament of battle. Northern Europe witnesses the gathering of Prussian armies on the Eider, prepared to adjudicate the question of the Duchies; while Denmark is straining every energy, by land and by sea, to oppose the Germans. The Czar of Russia is only momentarily restrained from realizing private arrangements with France in regard to Turkey, by the irrepressible uprising of Poland, to subdue which the best of his armies will be needed. The embers of revolt smoulder equally in Hungary, where the assassination of the popular TELEKI will doubtless fan the fire into flames of insurrection. While Austria has to watch this imminent source of danger, she is challenging, on the other side, a contest with Sardinia, upon the subject of Italian unity and the temporal authority of the Holy See. To all these issues, France is directly or indirectly a party, retaining, however, the invaluable choice of side and time, when the period comes for plunging into the great Continental melee. England, in the meantime, is in the angriest of tempers about the French occupation of Syria, and sends a fleet to watch the French army. Quite conscious that the Emperor, reversing the policy which produced he Crimean war, is pledged to a final settlement of the Eastern question by a partition of Turkey, which shall give him Egypt and a highway to India, the British Government can only follow with fretful impatience the development of the policy which is to supersede that to which, through sixty-five years, it has devoted all its military and diplomatic energies. What with its petulant remonstrances on the subject of Nice and Savoy; its arrogant correspondence about the Syrian business; and its openly declared suspicion that the Emperor is provoking a general war, merely for the purpose of expanding the boundaries of France, England is aware of the many grounds of reasonable hostility NAPOLEON III. possesses, and that a conflict may at any moment commence. Hence the haste in mustering and drilling volunteers; in building enormous defensive lines and fortifications; in vieing with France in the production of steel-plated frigates and steam gunboats; in recruiting, by the offer of war bounties, the army and navy. The two nations are, in fact, already engaged in an active war of resources, which a word of incautious language may convert into one of arms.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Europe in Bonds not to Interfere.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Europe in Bonds not to Interfere.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'War and Revolution', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/348c6a45-f02d-5207-bac2-ef3e8841cf6a,626,nyt://article/348c6a45-f02d-5207-bac2-ef3e8841cf6a

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/21/archives/staten-island-as-a-camp.html,,"Among several plans named unofficially as entering into the scheme of the campaign is the establishment of two great camps, for the concentration and education of troops. One of these is to be placed in the interior, convenient to the line of operations along the frontier. The other is assigned to a point on the seaboard, from which the forces when needed can readily be transported to any point on the Southern coast line, whither it is deemed proper to carry the war, either in the way of alarming, harrassing, and diverting the enemy, or of recovering possession of Federal property. The suggestion is one of great value and importance. The urgent pressure of danger having passed, there is no longer excuse for hurrying forward volunteers imperfectly equipped, provided and drilled; especially as with the large number of transports engaged by Government, and the variety of internal lines of communication, an army of 75,000 men can be transferred from the position of reserve to the seat of war within thirty-six hours. The probation of camp-life will also gauge the fitness of officers and privates for active service. Enthusiasm, courage, love of adventure, always act primarily in filling the ranks; but these, without personal health, strength, docility, and subsequent discipline, are not simply of no value, but are a deceptive and unmalleable raw material, which defeats the efforts of commanders and demoralizes the whole force. In these educational encampments, besides, the part which each subdivision of the force is to play in the operations of larger bodies, is learned as it cannot be otherwise; and ignorance of such matters is historically the source of half the reverses fresh troops experience on their earlier battle-fields. Such is an outline of the profit to be anticipated from the contemplated plan.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Staten Island as a Camp.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Staten Island as a Camp.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7dd1c762-dc91-5210-896b-fb98eeeaa8e0,501,nyt://article/7dd1c762-dc91-5210-896b-fb98eeeaa8e0

"The Macon (Ga.) Telegraph says: ""From a party in a position to know we learn that the military plans of President DAVIS are but very partially disclosed even to Congress itself. The President reposes perfect confidence in the capacity and qualifications of Gen. LEE. Men are proffered in abundance; of money there is enough for the present, and if the war should be protracted, which it is believed will be the case, favorable prospects are opening for the future.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/21/archives/a-great-fallacy.html,,"The idea that Republican Government is a failure, based upon the fact of a widespread and dangerous rebellion in this country, is one of the errors that seem just now to have taken possession of a portion of the European mind. Whatever the result of that rebellion may be, whether it shall be crushed by the power of the Government, or be carried forward to successful revolution, the folly of regarding it as an evidence of organic weakness of Republican institutions is not the less conspicuous. There is not an empire in the world that has not at some period of its existence been convulsed by rebellion, not a throne has been erected that has not been threatened by revolution. England has not escaped. Dynasty after dynasty has been expelled from her realm; and on the Continent of Europe the Bourbon family has been driven from all their inheritances. The kingdoms of the old world are but fragments of former empires, or the aggregations of principalities at some former time independent of each other, and of the power that now rules them.

Half-dollars, quarters, dimes and picayunes have disappeared in some mysterious manner, while, of course, twenty dollar gold pieces, eagles and half-eagles are plenty as blackberries.

But here arises a difficulty, which is altogether against the vender of these absolute necessaries of Charleston life. He can't make change; for silver coin is among the impossibilities of Charleston traffic. The purchaser can't afford to give gold-pieces for smashes and tods, even though both pockets are full. The vender can't take back his commodities, for they have gone down into cavernous depths from which there is no return. All this, it will be seen, is not so greatly to the disadvantage of the purchaser, and he is serene under the infliction. ""Here,"" says he, ""is the gold; give me my change.""

The seizure was made in pursuance of orders from Washington, and similar orders, it appears, had been given, and like seizures made, simultaneously, in all the Northern cities and towns. The precise object which the Government have in view in this proceeding has not transpired, and the Government officials in this City are entirely ignorant, or non-communicative upon the subject. It is supposed, however, that an examination of the telegrams will throw a flood of light upon the history of the Southern conspiracy, the length of time it has been actively at work, the material aid it has received from the North, and the names of many of those who have been implicated in it, -- including, as is believed, some who are now professing great zeal for the Union. The seizure was made very quietly,and it was the expressed wish of the Telegraph Company, with which the Marshal coincided, that it should not be made public; but the impossibility of this soon became apparent, for before the Marshal had left the office, telegrams came flying in Boston, Philadelphia and other places, announcing that similar seizures had been simultaneously made at those offices. The telegrams are under a guard of Deputy Marshals, awaiting further orders from Washington. It is expected that agents will be deputed by Government to examine them and report the contents of such as trace any significance in connection with the Southern conspiracy. A large force will be required for this purpose, the number of telegrams at the New-York office alone, being sufficient to keep a dozen clerks busy for the next three months.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HIGHLY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT.; SEIZURE OF TELEGRAMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HIGHLY IMPORTANT MOVEMENT.; SEIZURE OF TELEGRAMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/16bef5f0-0ab9-524f-b81b-8388bc82b571,315,nyt://article/16bef5f0-0ab9-524f-b81b-8388bc82b571

We repeat what we said then, that this is an unfriendly act, and if carried into practical effect, will be so regarded and treated by the Government of the United States. The British Government strains a point of international law, -- discards utterly the established principle, that none but an established nation, having a recognized national flag, and already received by formal action into the family of nations, can issue letters-of-marque against private property, -- and cites the absurdly inapplicable example of the Greek Revolution as a precedent to justify its giving the most effective aid it could possibly render to the Slave Oligarchy now in rebellion against the Government of the United States.

"We have kept no accurate count of the number of times the clerks of the several departments at Washington have been brought to book, and required to swear their fidelity to law and Constitution, but a figure something less than twenty will probably cover it. The process has just been repeated. Lieut.-Gen. SCOTT himself, of whose secret design to join the enemy there is as much reason to entertain fears, as that Mount Washington will go over to the Black Hills of Carolina, has repeated his solemn evidence of loyalty we hardly dare say how often. This is all very well, and in itself quite harmless. But of what use? All servants of the Federal Government inaugurate their official career by taking the oath of allegiance. The clerks who are now sworn and resworn, swore quite as terribly before they were ministerial to the treason of FLOYD, or under COBB arranged the details of rebellion. The declared purpose of the oath is to distinguish the treasonable from the loyal; but the oath when readministered only proves by the number of traitors it brings to light, how worthless its previous administration must have been. Besides, the one quality that more than any other characterizes the secession business, is its disregard of the most sacred compacts, obligations and oaths. The President of the Southern Confederacy, and nearly all of his advisers and aiders, passed from the service of the Union to their present work, with the oath of fidelity fresh on their lips. The rebel army is officered with men who had bound themselves by the same sanction; the whole machinery of rebel government is composed of officials similarly perjured. Nor is this accidental. The very germ of secession is the superiority of State over Federal authority; an ample power of absolution residing in the former to acquit its citizens of all allegiance to the latter. This principle is announced as the dictum of the rebel judiciary; so that the spy who chooses to take the monthly oath tendered him as a Federal servant, has legal warrant for believing he is fulfilling his duty as a subject of the Montgomery usurpation. A handful with tender consciences, refusing to accept this sort of casuistry, may resign, and may leave twice their number to communicate all the transactions of the Government they betray to the one they serve. The better plan is, evidently, to clear out the various bureaus thoroughly, leaving no one whatever found in them on the 4th of March. And then if their places be filled by competent men, regardless of party, we shall have some chance of business being conducted with the necessary secrecy. Under the present system, the Southern spy is probably communicating more knowledge of the plans of Government and the army to the leaders of Montgomery, than reaches the entire New-York press.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/23/archives/gratuitous-swearing.html,,"We have kept no accurate count of the number of times the clerks of the several departments at Washington have been brought to book, and required to swear their fidelity to law and Constitution, but a figure something less than twenty will probably cover it.

The very germ of secession is the superiority of State over Federal authority; an ample power of absolution residing in the former to acquit its citizens of all allegiance to the latter. This principle is announced as the dictum of the rebel judiciary; so that the spy who chooses to take the monthly oath tendered him as a Federal servant, has legal warrant for believing he is fulfilling his duty as a subject of the Montgomery usurpation. A handful with tender consciences, refusing to accept this sort of casuistry, may resign, and may leave twice their number to communicate all the transactions of the Government they betray to the one they serve. The better plan is, evidently, to clear out the various bureaus thoroughly, leaving no one whatever found in them on the 4th of March. And then if their places be filled by competent men, regardless of party, we shall have some chance of business being conducted with the necessary secrecy. Under the present system, the Southern spy is probably communicating more knowledge of the plans of Government and the army to the leaders of Montgomery, than reaches the entire New-York press.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GRATUITOUS SWEARING.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GRATUITOUS SWEARING.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5db6b283-f521-5482-b1e5-60b7dd5ada5b,475,nyt://article/5db6b283-f521-5482-b1e5-60b7dd5ada5b

A distinguished officer has favored our Military and Naval Reporter with a report of the new signal experiment, about which so much interest has been felt in the service. Now, when the desertion of elevated officers has partially put our Generals at the enemy's mercy, in regard to signalizing, this triumph of science will be additionally valuable. Major MYER, of the army, some months since announced the discovery by himself of a new system of military signals, which would, in a great measure, revolutionize the management of modern forces. The signals are made by means of a flag attached to a pole, from twelve to sixteen feet long. The different movements which the flag is made to go through represent numbers, which in their turn represent letters of the alphabet. The letters, of course, are combined into words that lead out the message. By the intervention of the numbers, none but the officer who directs the flag-man, and those who have been previously informed of the arrangement of the system, can understand the language of the flag, which flag is moved in three directions, to right, left, and front. This is done by soldiers who are especially drilled for the purpose, and who in the trial, managed the bunting with astonishing accuracy. For night signals, torches are substituted for flags; otherwise, the signals are similar to those made in the day time. All the implements necessary for the service, can be embraced in a small packet, can be transported from point to point by a a single man, and be put in readiness for use in fifteen minutes.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY AND NAVAL MOVEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY AND NAVAL MOVEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/69e75fc0-f01f-5f46-be1f-06bd2c7db9ab,727,nyt://article/69e75fc0-f01f-5f46-be1f-06bd2c7db9ab

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/23/archives/american-steel-cannon.html,,"The vital qualities necessary in cannonmetals are strength to resist the explosion of the charge, and hardness to endure the bounding of the projectile along the bore, and in case of the rifle bore, to resist the excessive wear of the projectile in the grooves. All the metals employed have their defects. Cast iron is quite tenacious, if a sufficient weight is employed, and tolerably hard, but its comparative elasticity (an important element of strength) is so small that its tenacity is invariably destroyed after a certain number of applications of the straining force. The difficulty of obtaining sound castings, by reason of the unequal shrinkage of the metal, is unfavorable -- so much so that the strongest ""high"" iron, by its superior contraction, does not, as a rule, make so strong a gun as a metal in itself weaker. The great weight of cast-iron, for a given strength, has confined its use generally to heavy cannon for siege and sea-coast purposes. Bronze -- a more tenacious compound -- is prepared for portable guns, and this, in turn, has its serious defects. Its density (an element of strength in cannon-metals) and tenacity are considerable, but its softness unfits it, for reasons already stated, for long service, particularly when rifled. And its cost is considerably greater than that of cast or wrought iron, or semi-steel -- that is, steel made directly from the pig iron. Wrought iron has a tensile strength double that of the best cast-iron, and is much more elastic, but somewhat softer. Authorities generally unite in stating that it was. when most in use, an provement on cast-iron, but the difficulty of producing large masses sound and homogeneous, has prevented its extensive introduction. The celebrated Armstrong gun, and other modern ""built-up"" cannon are, perhaps, more durable, and certainly stronger than any solid piece can be made, owing to the difficulty of forging or casting large masses of uniform strength, in the present state of the art; but it is generally conceded that the same expense devoted to a larger number of cheaper guns will be more effective in the long run.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Steel Cannon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Steel Cannon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79b07124-c0d6-5dec-a61c-42a85991f3b4,1115,nyt://article/79b07124-c0d6-5dec-a61c-42a85991f3b4

We have no right to complain of a want of sympathy, although a reciprocal feeling of good-will and mutual respect is a great bond of peace.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/23/archives/california-and-the-union.html,,"One of the most fantastic dreams indulged in by the Secessionists has been that California would undoubtedly unite her fortunes and her destiny with theirs -- that they had but to shake the tree, and the golden apple of the Pacific would drop into their hungry mouths. Thus, with the possession of New-Mexico, Arizona and the Indian Territory, all of which the Confederate ""Committee on Territories"" seem to regard as now under their jurisdiction, they flattered themselves that their domain would extend from ocean to ocean along its whole breadth, and their ""institution"" find ample scope and verge enough for expansion for centuries to come. The splendor of the prize, both in a geographical, political, commercial, and above all, in a monetary (COBB comprehends that) point of view, certainly rendered it worthy of a long and desperate effort to win it. Hence, failing to clutch the whole of California ten years ago, a persistent effort has been making ever since to secure the division of the State, and the establishment of Slavery in the Southern half. Being foiled in this also by the Californians, the disunion conspirators have latterly tried to make use of certain local broils of bygone feuds, of party affinities, and also of the disaffection engendered by the neglect of California interests by the General Government; and hoped that by suddenly precipitating the State into confusion, and proclaiming a Pacific Republic, either the whole of the State, or, at all events, the Southern half of it, would gently but surely glide into their hands. California, moreover, had been so long represented, both in the Senate and House, by politicians of the ultra Pro-Slavery school, who considered themselves as possessed of an absolute control of the State, that it was supposed the secession scheme had only to be boldly attempted to secure its success.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'California and the Union.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'California and the Union.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb494f53-ba0a-5506-9b18-2c326fdb6028,581,nyt://article/cb494f53-ba0a-5506-9b18-2c326fdb6028

The Government has discovered that its previous information respecting the rebel force in and near Harper's Ferry has been erroneous, and that, instead of an unarmed, disorganized and half-fed rabble, there is a well-appointed army of fifteen thousand men, amply provided. How many troops may be behind these men is not known, but the probability is they are the advance guard of a column which is supplied at Charlottesville, by two steady upward tides from the Atlantic coast on the one hand and the Southwest on the other. It is asserted in certain quarters, which claim to have the knowledge, that the threatened capture of Washington was a feint; Philadelphia being really the first, and New-York the second point of attack. The ardor of the rebels is represented to be kept at fever heat by glowing pictures of plunder and riot, where they shall be able to exchange their worthless shinplasters, in those cities, for Yankee gold; their scanty rations for revels in Fifth-avenue palaces, and to banquet upon the luxury of demonstrated power, and ample vengeance. Whatever grounds these stories may have, the authorities at Washington must have become impressed with the necessity of breaking up the strategic arrangements of the enemy, by cutting off this advanced division on the Potomac; and our correspondent intimates the probability of an immediate movement of our troops into Virginia so as to take the rebels in the rear, and stopping their south-ward communications and their supplies. Such evidence of activity, if safe and practicable,would have a two-fold beneficial effect It would remove a suspicion which discourages the popular heart, that some secret influence stays the advance of our army in Virginia; and it would satisfy European spectators of our serious purpose in commencing hostilities, of pushing them earnestly and unsparingly.

A few evenings since, Hon. H. WINTER DAVIS was nominated for reelection to Congress, his principal competitor being Hon. JOHN P. KENNEDY, who received 14 votes to Mr. DAVIS' 48. The Baltimore American at once threatened a bolt, and has ever since been urging Mr. DAVIS' friends to withdraw his name, affirming that there were a large number of voters who would not support him under any circumstances. On Monday evening, Mr. DAVIS addressed his constituents, accepting the nomination. He indignantly denied the imputations that this honor had been secured by packing the Convention, and defied the power of his enemies, private or public; he had accepted the nomination, and meant to stand by it, and he had been put forward, too, on the basis of ""unconditional"" adherence to the Union, and the understanding that he would stand in the way of no one of that stamp who might be preferred before him. Mr. DAVIS then defended his vote for Mr. PENNINGTON as Speaker of the House, repudiated the idea that he had ever encouraged rowdyism at the polls, and then vindicated at length his course in refusing to vote for the Crittenden Compromise, which he declared was only the Breckinridge Platform in disguise. It was an entirely impracticable scheme, and he preferred to it Mr. COSWIN's amendment, which granted all that the Southern States could ask or hope to get. Mr. DAVIS then applauded the firm stand made by Gov. HICKS, denounced the Legislature and its treasonable designs, and declared that there was no such thing as the right of secession. If a body of men had seized territory belonging to the United States, he was for punishing them summarily, whether they were Spaniards or Americans, and if the Confederates were still amenable to the laws and the Constitution, he was for enforcing those laws at every hazard. With the exception of calling out volunteers for three years, all Mr. LINCOLN's acts had been constitutional, and this he was ready to defend on the ground of necessity. The mission of the volunteers would be to defend the Union men in the disloyal States, and this must be done at every hazard.

"The departure, yesterday, of Col.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/24/archives/local-military-movements-departure-of-the-fifth-regiment-advance.html,,"The departure, yesterday, of Col. DURYEE's Fifth Regiment of Volunteers, was the occasion of a popular ovation which has not been excelled in general enthusiasm since the departure of the Seventh Regiment. The established reputation and wide-spread popularity of the old Colonel of the Seventh Regiment; the excellent materials which he has succeeded in bringing together in a brief space of time for his command; the rapid progress which they have made since they went into camp at Fort Schuyler, and the known character and ability of the associate officers of the Regiment, had attracted towards them unusual interest, and all which contributed to bring out the New-Yorkers in large force to witness their departure for the theatre of war. The Regiment having some unavoidable delay received their muskets, on Wednesday prepared to leave. Early in the morning the camp was astir with the work of preparation, and at noon the entire regiment, with camp equipage and baggage, were ready to march. The latter were sent directly on board of the Alabama, and the regiment came to the City on board of a steamer provided for purpose of landing at the foot of Fourteenth-street, East River. Broadway being occupied with the funeral cartege of Col. VESBURGH, some delay occurred in marching. The citizens thronged the entire length of Fourteenth-street, to witness the march, and Broadway has seldom been more compactly crowded than it was on this occasion. The style of uniform -- that of the French Zouave, with the full flowing pants of red flannel, and red cap, with a cape of white flannel, which partially concealed the face, strongly reminded the spectator of the Baski Bazourks who figured so conspicuously in the Turkish Army during the Crimean War. The personnel of this Regiment is certainly equal in every particular to the best troops which have yet been dispatched from this City.They are composed, in great part, of young men innuled to labor and hardship, many are experienced gymnasts, and not a few are stalwart in frame, standing six feet in height. Their march through Broadway was a continued ovation, the crowd which lined the side-walks, and filled the windows and balconies, cheering and waving to them as they passed. The familiar face and soldierly bearing of New-York's old favorite, Col. DURYEA, who has so promptly responded to the call of the country, seemed to inspire a furore of enthusiasm wherever he appeared; and it must be confessed that much of the applause seemed intended for this veteran and popular commander. At 5 1/2 o'clock P.M. the regiment entered the Park, and were drawn up in front of the City Hall, a space having been cleared for them by the admirable arrangements of the Police. The Regiment here went through with a few of the manual movements which elicited applause for their precision. Mayor WOOD, accompanied by Judge EDMONDS and several City officials, reviewed the regiment, expressing, at the close their high admiration of the men, and the excellent state of discipline in which they appealed.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; DEPARTURE OF THE FIFTH REGIMENT, ADVANCE GUARD REVIEW IN THE PARK ENTHUSIASM OF THE PEOPLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; DEPARTURE OF THE FIFTH REGIMENT, ADVANCE GUARD REVIEW IN THE PARK ENTHUSIASM OF THE PEOPLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d1a70f95-eb78-5af5-8bd2-f840ee6232c0,2843,nyt://article/d1a70f95-eb78-5af5-8bd2-f840ee6232c0

An article from the Manchester Guardian, of the latest date, is given in another column at length, because it is the most significant gauge of this change. The Guardian, we need hardly remind our readers, stands in the front rank of provincial journals; and, published in the heart of the cotton-consuming region, its sentiments may be accepted as truthful reflections of the opinions current among the demigods of the factories At the outset of our difficulties, and even as late as the 7th inst., the Guardian, as was to be expected, had no disposition to conceal its sympathy with the South, which found vent in denunciations of Mr. LINCOLN and his policy, and in heaping upon his shoulders the responsibility of inaugurating a needless and sanguinary contest. A glance at the article we reproduce today will show how entirely this hostile ground has been abandoned. The war has become one of high and inevitable necessity; and the entire world is bidden to cast in its sympathies on the side of the National Government. In the punishment and redaction to obedience of the rebels the only hope of permanent peace is recognized; and the uprising and arming of the loyalists is pronounced one of the grandest spectacles of history, and one that appeals to the highest admiration of mankind. This is a symptom, in connection with others, that England is coming to her senses. In her first excitement she was foolish enough to be alarmed at the rebel boast that the cotton crop was a resistless sword which could be wielded to the ruin of England. Calmness would have suggested that while it was so, the handle is held by the North, and its double edge may be equally fatal to the labor of American planting States, and British manufacturing counties.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Convalescence of the Cotton Spinners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Convalescence of the Cotton Spinners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd4c00d5-0c35-5194-ae0d-119f0ed54604,330,nyt://article/dd4c00d5-0c35-5194-ae0d-119f0ed54604

"The story of the Great Rebellion will always form one of the most interesting and instructive chapters in the history of this country, as we can trace most accurately its cause, and its successive stages of development under the various phases of State rights, nullification and secession. In the Northern States, the Confederated Government has, from its birth, steadily become more and more consolidated, effacing local distinctions, and blending the several States into a common nationality. The grand agency to such a result has been commerce, uniform protection, and an identity of material interests. The Erie Canal was constructed by the State of New-York with an exclusive eye to the promotion of the advantage of its people. It was nearly ten years before it became the channel of commerce of the people of other States. This work will deliver at one harbor, the present year, 2,000,000 tons of Western produce, to 400,000 tons from the State of New-York. It has consequently become five times as valuable to other States as to our own. The country could afford to pay $200,000,000 rather than this great artery should be closed. In the advantages it confers, it belongs as much to Michigan, Illinois, and Massachusetts as to New-York. If New-York were to secede, the fear of excessive charges upon it, of duties laid upon the commerce of all foreign States, would convulse the whole country. Every man in the North, consequently, is the earnest advocate of a Confederacy that shall embrace under one system of law and taxation every foot of the continent.

"PERILOUS FREAK OF A CRAZY MAN. -- About 9 yesterday morning a man was discovered climbing the flag-staff on the top of the shot-tower in Centre-street near Pearl.

He was, however, secured and taken to the Station-house. He refuses to give any reason for his conduct, says his name is LOUIS JUADINI, and that he lives at No. 122 Leonard-street, and is a Frenchman.

The Southern rebels stole enough for a limited and short-lived business, and only save themselves from insolvency by flooding the community with those financial ""shirts upon a pole,"" bank issues. without specie beneath them; and shinplasters, redeemable in bank issues. The bonds and treasury notes of the Montgomery Government are simply other forms of the same worthless paper medium. The nearest the holder of these symbols gets to that substantial thing, money, is the exchange of one irredeemable promise to pay for another. And so they bargain and buy, sell, hire and make war, with a currency as valuable as the wampum of the aborigines. Gov. JACKSON, of Missouri, is a traitor without pecuniary means. He is quite resolved to arm the State and hand it over to the rebels, who, since it would simply burden them with a vaster frontier to defend with inadequate forces, decline to take it unarmed; and arms and the other material of war exact money. The State is without money. If the Federal Treasury had funds in Missouri there would be no difficulty; but in the absence of an opportunity for theft, other expedients must be resorted to; and of these two have presented themselves to the mind of the Governor. One is, to induce the banks to assent to the diversion of the $500,000 pledged by them to meet the July interest on the State debt; another, to induce them to make advances upon the bonds authorized by the late Military bill, to which the Legislature, in the last hours of its stay at Jefferson City arose at midnight, that they might lend the form if not the validity of law. The whole fate of treason in Missouri is therefore dependent upon the banks. If they decline to meet the views of the Governor, there will be rebellion, no hanging for treason, no devastation of the State by marching armies; and the faith of the State will be preserved by the payment of the semi-annual interest.

"In accordance with the programme published in the TIMES yesterday morning, an advance of Federal troops was made into Virginia on Thursday night. The New-York Second, Seventh, Twelfth, Sixty-ninth, Seventy-first, and ELLSWORTH'S Zouaves, the New-Jersey and Michigan brigades, ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/25/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"In accordance with the programme published in the TIMES yesterday morning, an advance of Federal troops was made into Virginia on Thursday night. The New-York Second, Seventh, Twelfth, Sixty-ninth, Seventy-first, and ELLSWORTH'S Zouaves, the New-Jersey and Michigan brigades, and some of the Washington troops, constituted the force, which numbered about 13,000, besides those sent down the Potomac to act in conjunction with the troops at Fortress Monroe. This force has been disposed at various important points -- Alexandria, Arlington Heights and Fairfax Court-house -- the movement on the latter point being made for the purpose of taking possession of the junction of the Orange and Alexandria and Manassas Gap Railroads. The advance into Virginia was made from three points -- over the Long Bridge, at the mouth of the Potomac Aqueduct at Georgetown, and at Alexandria. The first troops which passed over the bridge, constituting the advance guard, were the Washington City National Rifles, and they were followed by other District volunteers, acting in a similar capacity, who drove in the Virginia pickets. Our troops had possession of all the points for which they were destined by 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and immediately commenced the necessary operations to insure their positions. The occupation of Alexandria was the most important movement accomplished, and this duty was gallantly performed in part, by the New-York Fire Zouaves, -- but not without a loss which must be deeply deplored. Their dashing young commander, Col. ELLSWORTH, was basely assassinated in the Marshall House, by the landlord, named JACKSON, while descending the stairs of the hotel with a secession flag in his hand, which he had taken from a flag-staff on the roof. Retribution for the base act was swift, however, as the murderer was immediately shot ard run through the body by a bayonet, by one of Col. ELLSWORTH's men. As the regiment entered the town, at the wharves of which they landed in steamboats, the rebel forces fired upon them without effect, and then fled. Almost simultaneously with the entry of the Zouaves into the city, the First Michigan Regiment arrived by the road from the Long Bridge, and took possession of the railroad depot, when they succeeded in surprising and capturing a troop of rebel cavalry, with their horses, arms and equipments.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b2828385-65a1-5c59-9ab8-be0203fff5f3,1441,nyt://article/b2828385-65a1-5c59-9ab8-be0203fff5f3

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/25/archives/frauds-in-the-commissariat.html,,"An imperfect investigation into the conduct of the Commissariat of the Pennsylvania troops has demonstrated the existence of excessive abuses and corruption, and excited a storm of popular indignation at Philadelphia. Suspicions that similar mismanagement prevails in the conduct of the corresponding department here, where the business is so transcendently important, and where millions of dollars have already been expended in the purchase of provisions, arms and equipments, and the chartering of transports, have obtained extended currency, and produced a very general desire for investigation. We are daily in receipt of communications tendering absolute proof of the guilt of various parties holding positions of trust in this connection, and imploring the NEW-YORK TIMES to constitute itself the immediate means of exposure and punishment. This task we must, for the present, at least, decline. While there is much reason to fear that discretion and unimpeachable integrity have not uniformly characterized the distribution of contracts, it must be remembered that disappointed bidders seldom fail to charge corruption upon the more successful; and circumstantial evidence of fraud -- always to be had -- is seldom conclusive. But even admitting the justice of the charge, the present is no time to investigate how wisely or honestly the money we have freely given is to be expended. The men through whose hands it is passing are well known, and when the war is ended, their accounts will be rigidly audited; doubtless, all the more rigidly for these strongly adverse popular impressions. When our reckoning with the Southern rebels has been completed, another reckoning with their Northern promoters, helpers and sympathizers is to be had, at which those who have taken, advantage of the people's generous patriotism, to enrich themselves at the public cost, and at the expense of the self-sacrificing volunteers, sent to the field ill-armed, half-equipped, and unfed, and without the comforts with which they might very easily be provided, will come in for very weighty punishment. If guilt there is, the impatient accuser may rest assured that the trial is only delayed to be more thorough, and the judgment more merciless.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Frauds in the Commissariat.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Frauds in the Commissariat.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc3d6fd4-53e6-5a80-bfa0-3adcf8bc2ae8,348,nyt://article/fc3d6fd4-53e6-5a80-bfa0-3adcf8bc2ae8

"Ex-President BUCHANAN has written a letter to the National Intelligencer, in which he speaks of ""the facility with which military gentlemen relieve themselves form their oaths and change their allegiance."" ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/26/archives/the-retributions-of-history.html,,"Ex-President BUCHANAN has written a letter to the National Intelligencer, in which he speaks of ""the facility with which military gentlemen relieve themselves form their oaths and change their allegiance."" In criticising with a just severity the conduct of those officers who not only resign their commissions, but enter the armies of secession to fight against their country, he says: ""When Major BEAUREGARD discharged the first gun against Fort Sumter, he lighted a flame which it will require a long time to extinguish."" When history shall have made up its record of the times in which we live, it will be found that wicked and dishonorable as the treason of BEAUREGARD and the other deserters of the flag of their country may have been, there was one man on whom rests a much heavier responsibility than on them, and that man was JAMES BUCHANAN. Placed at the head of a great nation by the suffrages of its people, sworn to preserve its integrity, to guard its honor, and protect it alike from foreign invasion and domestic treason; -- bound by all the obligations pertaining to solemn oaths, all the duties pertaining to official trust, all the instincts of patriotism, all the traditions of the past, the prosperity of the present and the hopes of the future to preserve intact the freest, most benign and perfect institutions ever framed by wisdom of man; with the power of perpetuating them in his hands, and perfectly within his control, he saw conspiracy ripening into treason; treason expanding into open and armed rebellion, and rebellion growing into revolution, without one word of remonstrance or one effort to check their demoralizing and destroying progress. He saw the Federal arms disposed of by his Cabinet Ministers so as to be within reach of the conspirators, and the Treasury of the Union spoiled for their benefit. He saw the Army ordered to distant frontiers and the Navy to foreign coasts, so that the strength of neither could be invoked in aid of the Government. He saw fort after fort taken possession of, and arsenal after arsenal plundered by the traitors. He saw rebellion levying armies and equipping them from the spoils of the Federal Government, commanded by officers educated to skill in war by Federal money, whose resignations he had voluntarily accepted, ready to march to the capture of the Capital and the overthrow of the Union, and yet took no step, did no act, summoned not one soldier to resist this monstrous crusade against the very existence of the Republic. Ten words from him would have dismissed his traitorous Cabinet and supplied their places with true men. A trifling forecast would have held possession of the forts, and saved the contents of the arsenals. A little show of courage would have overawed treason in its incipiency, and baffled the schemes of the conspirators. A degree of firmness, far short of Roman, would have preserved the peace of the nation. But there was a total and incomprehensible absence of all these on the part of President BUCHANAN, and the melancholy sequence is seen in the actual presence of a civil war, the progress and end of which humanity shudders to contemplate. Whether this disgraceful inertia was the result of a craven spirit -- a cowardice which happily does not belong to the American character, or a criminal sympathy with the purposes of the conspiracy, it is scarcely worth while to inquire. In one or the other of these categories Mr. BUCHANAN will at last find a resting-place, and the world will visit upon him a much larger share of the responsibility for the upheavals that may follow, than upon the treason of army officers who deserted the service, or the firing of the ""first gun at Fort Sumter."" Cowardice and treason, in a crisis like the present, are too near of kin in their consequences to allow of nice distinctions. Even imbecility is counted on the side of dishonor, and history covers all with the pall of infamy.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Retributions of History.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Retributions of History.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Buchanan, James', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06520956-5640-5df2-ad44-2389207b5481,831,nyt://article/06520956-5640-5df2-ad44-2389207b5481

Wealth is the result of commerce, and of the diversified industries of society. Great Britain exports, annually, to foreign countries, products to the value of $600,000,000. Their manufacture employs one-half her population. Were her customers to refuse to continue their ordinary purchases, her people would be threatened with annihilation. They have no means of support outside their usual avocations. Their soil cannot supply them with food. This they must obtain in exchange for their products, or starvation stares them in the face. Of these, the United States, for the past year took some $150,000,000. The total importations from that country and its colonies being nearly $200,000,000. If we should buy nothing from her the present year, we should deal her a blow tenfold more effective than we could inflict by the most vigorous military or naval demonstrations we could make.

Mrs. JOHN WOOD and Mr. JOSEPH JEFFERSON have done the rest, and been rewarded with houses over crowded with delighted faces. The only novelty on the programme has been a London farce, called ""Bowled Out,"" which was played on Thursday last with only moderate success. It comes from the Adelphi Theatre, and is as extravagant as pieces from that locality are apt to be.

It will be long before we meet with the right man to fill his place. As a comic artist, he is, we believe, the most finished and generally excellent one we have ever had Remembering, as any one may readily remember, the many characters he has sustained before a I New-York audience, it is, we believe, impossible to recall a single instance of bad taste, of grossness, of violent effort after applause, in all his varied impersonations. The esteem which he has hereby justly won has been by legitimate means, and by the purest efforts of a quick genius. Mr. JEFFERSON is the representative man of the American stage; the one who draws less on tradition than any other. As such he made his mark here -- where taste is exacting, and will surely make it in California, Australia and England, if he finds it worth his while to make the experiment. One thing is certain, and it my be recorded to his credit. He leaves an audience that does not wish to part with him. Of all the artists that have tried to win a degree of remembrance and consideration amid the deafening roll of the drum, he alone has succeeded. From the opening night of his engagement to the closing one, the houses have been all that a manager could desire, or the most popular favorite expect.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/33c086fd-aae3-562f-bdd1-7355a10edd7a,1432,nyt://article/33c086fd-aae3-562f-bdd1-7355a10edd7a

The announcement that the Union Defence Committee was to inspection regiments of New-York volunteers, brought out a very largo self-constituted committee of approval on the part of our citizens. Three o'clock was the hour at which the regiments were to form in line in Fourteenth street. Long before that hour, Fourteenth-street, from river to river, was lined with an enthusiastic concourse of citizens. And not Fourteenth-street only, but every avenue and street leading to it, also pound out its tidal tribute. As the crimson regimental current poured through the avenue-arteries leading to the heart, where it was to centre, cambric handkerchiefs from loaded balconies and clustering windows waved snowy God-speeds to the brave volunteers, and eyes, brighter than the unacabbarded swords and glistening bayonets below, showered down smiles of approval. And many a fervent prayer went up that those called upon to go forth in their country's defence might return, or, failing in this, find a proud death-bed on the field of fame. However apathetic a community may be, it is certain that the first notes of the bugle awake a spirit of chivalry which animates even the basest clay, though for long years it may lie dormant. Thus yesterday, men, the greater part of whose lives have been devoted to trade, and whose only aspirations seemed to tend to the accumulation of dollars and cents, cast aside for the moment all sentiments of the shop, and flung up their hats in loud huzzas for our improvised army. Wrinkled wrists, whose pulses might be supposed to be chilled by the frosts of age, thrust forth their hands to give a warm friendly clasp to the passing soldier. Fervent ""God bless you, boys, God bless you!"" ran along the long lines of citizens, as the various regiments passed in rapid review -- the picturesquely costumed Zouaves, the plumed Garibaldi Guards, and the plainly attired citizen soldiery who had not yet assumed the coats of many colors prescribed by fanciful Colonels, and the regulations of war. There was that in the manifestation of popular sentiment yesterday which fully justifies the lines of TENNYSON, wherein the idea is expressed that though the canker of peace may cut deeply into a nation's vitals, when its rights are threatened by either foreign foes or traitors, at home, the most sordid of shopkeepers is ready to jump.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GRAND MILITARY DEMONSTRATION.; INSPECTION OF TEN REGIMENTS OF NEWYORK VOLUNTEERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GRAND MILITARY DEMONSTRATION.; INSPECTION OF TEN REGIMENTS OF NEWYORK VOLUNTEERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/52b2e26d-e932-5299-b851-e796cc2cd875,782,nyt://article/52b2e26d-e932-5299-b851-e796cc2cd875

An alarm was given, however, in Washington, and a signal of three guns was fired, which immediately put all the troops in the District under arms, and a large body was thrown across the Potomac into Virginia, ready to take part in any duty which might be required. The rapidity and certainly with which these sudden movements were accomplished are represented to have been absolutely astonishing. Infantry, artillery and cavalry were in arms and across the Long Bridge, proceeding in the direction of the supposed danger, in the shortest possible time. It was soon ascertained that the alarm was a false one, and the greater portion of the troops returned again to Washington.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/05/26/archives/the-genius-of-the-american-people.html,,"Among the peculiarities of the American people, the facility with which they adapt themselves to changing circumstances of the times, is not the least conspicuous. They grapple with the practical facts of the present, dealing with them always as actualities, without reference to the past, and with scarcely a dread of the future. Their business is with to-day, and they apply themselves to it with an earnestness that astonishes the slow people of other countries. While they thus take care of to-day, they have an abiding faith in to-morrow, and though busy and contented, in the main, with the present, they are always looking for a good time coming. Eight months ago there was not a people on the face of the earth so prosperous as ours. Peace everywhere prevailed. Business moved along with unwonted facilities. The merchant increased his commercial ventures, and the tradesman enlarged his stock of wares. The manufacturer doubled his purchases of the raw material and added to the number of operatives in his factories. The mechanic increased the dimensions of his workshop, and the agriculturist planted additional acres. In all the departments of industry, increased activity prevailed, and energy, life, rapidity of interchange of traffic was the order of the day everywhere. Six months passed away, and a frightful war loomed upon the horizon. Commerce called home its ships. Trade contracted its operations. Manufacturers limited the number of their operatives, and through all the branches of industry a timely and sagacious caution manifested itself. The genius of the Americas people was furling sails for the storm that was approaching. The trumpet-call to arms sounded over the land, and was responded to by a promptness and enthusiasm never before witnessed in any country. In two months, eighty thousand armed men lined the frontiers, while regiment after regiment defiled along this streets on their way to the field of honor, and perhaps to death. Here again, was exhibited the genius of the American people adapting itself to the new exigency, forgetting the tranquility of the past in answer to the demands of the present.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Genius of the American People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Genius of the American People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb770cba-8256-56c8-b065-2e4038f49147,920,nyt://article/bb770cba-8256-56c8-b065-2e4038f49147

Mrs. McDONALD's story is one that has often been repeated. Her husband, WM. MCDONALD, for a long time worked in the Brooklyn Navy-yard, as a ship carpenter, where he bore the character of an industrious man and a good citizen. Two years ago he accepted of an offer of work in the Gosport Navy-yard, at Portsmouth, Virginia, and went there, accompanied by his wife and five children. He had steady employment, and succeeded in saving about $500, which he placed in the Savings Bank at Portsmouth, of which TAZWELL TAYLOR is President. A few weeks ago, and just before the burning of the Navy-yard, he, in a private conversation with his fellow workmen, expressed a strong attachment for the Union, and the next day he received a notice to leave the State with his family, forthwith. He left home for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements to leave, but did not return; and Mrs. MCDONALD supposes, that he was murdered by the Secessionists. She waited for his coming until she received notice to leave, and then went to the Savings Bank to draw the money there deposited to enable her to leave. To her surprise, the President of the institution, Mr. TAYLOR, told her that she could have no money, but gave her some worthless skinplasters on the Bank of Virginia. As this was the best she could do, she received the worthless stuff, and through the aid of friends was enabled to take passage on the above steamer, leaving, furniture and other property behind. She landed in Brooklyn penniless, and was kindly provided for temporarily by Coroner ALFRED E. HORTON, who will see that she does not suffer until benevolent citizens, who are better able, make some permanent provision for her support.

Afraid of venturing too suddenly upon the experiment of direct taxation, which would, for the first, bring home to the slave-owner an awkward practical result of property in man, they founded their expectations of carrying on the peaceful machinery of Government by the continuance of duties upon imports, and of prosecuting the war with loans, secured by a pledge of certain export duties upon cotton. By thus taxing at once the ebb and flow of trade, they confidently calculated on meeting both the ordinary and extraordinary expenses of their Government, and in time of paying off the principle of their borrowed money. But in retaining the tariff system, it was necessary to make some concessions to the innovators, who had placed Free-trade in the front rank of the blessings to be realized in their negro Utopia. A tariff was, therefore, declared to be a temporary resort, in the absence of other immediate means of raising revenue; but it was to be fixed on a scale so far below that of the Federal Government as to insure to Southern ports that command of direct foreign intercourse, which a scheme of perfect Free-trade would only render more absolute. A tariff which is to take effect on the 1st of August was therefore arranged at a rate averaging ten per cent. below that of the Northern Custom-house; and this tariff has been looked to as guaranteering a vast access of foreign commerce, and of course a large addition to the revenue.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Finances of the Rebels', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Finances of the Rebels', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01312921-aa28-595f-8dc2-92d6d003dfa8,814,nyt://article/01312921-aa28-595f-8dc2-92d6d003dfa8

A Welshman, named HENRY L.JONES, one of the mates of tha bark Genesee, of Brunswick, Maine, accompanied by a friend, went into the house No. 87, where he had formerly boarded, and after remaining a short time, JOHN SAMUELS, a boarder in the house, also a Welshman, came in somewhat intoxicated. He immediately commenced a conversation with, JONES, and was very insolent and threatening. Soon he picked up a pitcher of water, and threw it into JONE's face, and fled. JONES and his friend remained about half an hour, when SAMUELS returned, and procuring a sheath-knife, met JONES in the hall, and assaulted and stabbed him. The knife entered the abdomen on the right side, inflicting a terrible wound, from which the intestines immediately protruded. SAMUELS endeavored to escape, and in his flight dropped the knife, which was picked up by a Mr. HOGAN, who secured the assassin. He was handed over to Roundsman ROBB, and by him conveyed to the Station house in Oak-street. Mr. JONES was immediately attended by Dr. MCGINN, who sewed up the wound, and the patient was then removed to the City Hospital. The wound is dangerous, and considered, fatal.

ROWLAND, of the New York ship Joseph Fish, applied to the magistrates presiding at our Police Court for the purpose of asking permission to take the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty. It appeared from his statement that he is a native of Barnstaple, but he has been naturalized in America. He is about sailing from this port with a cargo of cost for Cuba, but it is apprehensiv, as the ship is an American, that he may be captured. As he felt desirous of sailing under British colors, he also wished to transfer his allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain. The magistrates informed him that he must have his ship duly chartered as a British one, in accordance with the provisions of the merchant Shipping Act, if he wished to secure the protection of the British flag. The captain thanked the magistrates, and left the acurt somewhat perplexed as to the best course that he could adopt to secure the speedy departure of his ship, which is laden with barrels of small coal.

These districts not only find in the Northern and Southern States the best markets for the products of their industry -- in common with the whole of the mining and manufacturing districts of England -- but they also derive from the Southern States much the greater portion of their supply of cotton and tobacco, and from the Northern States a large, if not the largest, portion of their supplies of grain, flour and provisions. In addition to there commercial relations, the ports of the Mersey and the Clyde are interested to a great extent in the shipping trade of the Atlantic, which is placed in considerable peril by the blockade of the Southern ports, and by the issuing of letters-of-marque, which will soon cover the ocean with privateers, who, at the best, are only one degree removed from pirates. Lancashire and the West of Scotland, containing between them a population of at least 4,000,000 inhabitants, are thus deeply affected, not only as producers, but as consumers and ship-owners, by the civil war which has broken out between the people of the Northern and the Southern States. It requires much greater sagacity than we possess, or, indeed, than is granted to man, to foresee all the evils that may be involved in this terrible conflict; yet even at this early state of the strife, and when so much is still wrapped in obscurity, it may he well to consider, and endeavor to estimate some of the evils which it may bring upon these populous districts. The experience of the American war of Independence, and of the second American war, in 1812-15, proved that a war with the United States was the greatest misfortune that could happen to those districts. During both those wars the ordinary course of industry was stopped, great multitudes of people were thrown oat of employment, and beggary and pauperism prevailed in every town and village of these districts. We are now about to witness, not a war with the American people, but a war amongst the American people, and it deeply interests us to known how far the effects of the latter will resemble those of the former.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lancashire and the American Civil War.; From the Liverpool Mercury.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Lancashire and the American Civil War.; From the Liverpool Mercury.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97412a1d-eae2-5709-a691-09969a495629,2024,nyt://article/97412a1d-eae2-5709-a691-09969a495629

Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS' Message, of the 29th ult., to the Montgomery Congress, states that the South will resist subjugation, to the direst extremity. It is the temper or the South to regard itself as unduly subjugated, when it is not unduly ascendant; it broke out from the Union because it could not have all its own way in it. But the very intemperance of that final outbreak -- preceded, as it had been, by so many other intemperances -- sufficiently showed, to our mind, that the South was not a fit component part of a Union which had become resolved not to endure a progressive series of encroachments of Southern -- that is, slaveholding -- dominion over free communities which had abolished Slavery in their own States, and were not willing to submit to its extension in new territories, where the local majorities proved adverse to its admission.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Views of London Journals.; THE CHANCES OF THE WAR.

The Secretary for Foreign Affairs, M. THOUVENEL, has, we are told, addressed a circular to the agents of his Government in the insurgent States, instructing them to preserve the strictest neutrality; in no case lending their countenance or support to one rather than to the other of the hostile factions. We submit that international discourtesy could take no more offensive form. The Government of France has official knowledge of only one power within the territorial bounds of the Union, and that is the Government of the United States. Its commercial agents hold their places by virtue of the exequatur granted by this Government; and the treaties of friendship and alliance existing between the two countries, and all the various commercial privileges and arrangements which the Consule are appointed to administer, are so many obligations to the fulfillment of every friendly service to the Federal Government. But strict neutrality is an assumption of the existence of two Powers instead of a single one within our national limits; and an admission that of those two Powers one has no more claims upon the alliance, sympathy and support of a foreign Government than the other. We are thus arraigned for trial at the bar of mankind as the equal of a perjured, rebellious and disloyal conspiracy; and we shall only know with which side go the good wishes of France when we shall know which side is victorious. This willful ignoring of the lofty claims of the American Government -- this indifferent choosing between Christ and Barabbas -- will not strengthen the regard we are accustomed to entertain for the people and the Government of France. It might even appear advisable to withdraw the exequatur of all the French Consuls in the seceding States, not with the purpose of damaging French commerce in their ports, for there is no commerce of any sort there to be injured, but simply as an assertion of proper national self-respect against foreign depreciation and insult.

Judged by the ordinary rules of human action, it is as incomprehensible as it is universal. The States repudiate their stocks, and the people select, as their leader and chief, the originator and leader of repudiation, thus making the trampling upon State obligations a principle of political action. Dishonesty on the part of the State is reflected in the taint of commercial honor. Merchants whose wares were purchased on credit, complaining of no lack of ability to pay, and with abundant means of meeting their notes, repudiate their obligations, witnessing in triumph the bankruptcy which they bring upon their creditors. Collecting agents, holding funds collected of their own people in trust for Northern creditors, apply them to their own uses, making the war, which themselves aided in originating, the apology for their violation of faith. Cabinet Ministers who, while in the service of the Government, plundered the National Treasury in aid of rebellion, who, while the nation was confiding in their honor, and their regard for official oaths, were concocting treason; and who, while enjoying the dignity and receiving the emoluments of official place, played the peculator, the conspirator, and the spy, are placed high in position, made Generals, have a place among Southern gentlemen, and are accepted in all respects as honorable men. Military and naval officers, who were educated by the Federal Government, who were clothed by it, fed by it, supported by it, given a high status in society by it, desert the flag they have sworn to support, and join in a grand conspiracy for its destruction. With all this infamy attached to them, Southern society pets, and ""Southern chivalry"" honors them. Foreign Ministers and Consuls prostitute their positions to the injury of the nation they represent, and play the traitor through the letters which gave them credence, and violate the instructions which they were sworn to respect. All these violations of duty, all these perversions of principle, all this abandonment of manhood, all this trampling upon everything which honorable men all over the civilized world hold sacred, is accepted by the Southern mind as evidences of patriotism, and no word of dissent is uttered by Southern society, and no lisp of censure finds a place in the Southern Press.

"The controversy between Chief Justice TANEY and Gen. CASWALLADER is in all respects unfortunate. A collision of civil and military authority is always to be, if possible, shunned; because the majesty of law must, in all cases, succumb to the necessities of war, and the respect which the magistracy must assert for itself in a period of peace, is impaired by the sight of a fruitless struggle for supremacy at a period when military law is in the ascendant. In the case of JOHN MERRIMAN, the interposition of Chief Justice TANEY can only be regarded as at once officious and improper. If the questions of right in the matter had to be tested, there were other legal authorities, whose intervention would have been quite as effectual as that of the Chief Justice, before whom, should the case give rise to litigation, it may eventually come for final adjudication. The issue, moreover, was one to which the State of Maryland was a party, and which therefore should have been raised by a magistrate of that State. In thus energetically interposing, Judge TANEY presents the ungracious spectacle of a judicial and a military authority of the United States at variance, the soldier eager to punish, and the jurist to exculpate a traitor.

The teachers and children carried numerous tiny National flags, and many wore Union rosettes and the ""Star Spangled Banner"" was sung with heartfelt spirit by all. After the parade, the Schools assembled in their respective churches, where there were suitable exercises, consisting of singing, reading of the Scriptures, and short addresses suitable to the occasion, nearly all of which were of a patriotic character.

Commercial nations cannot afford to have this contest continue; and they must soon discover there is no way of speedily ending it but by siding with our Government. Till we triumph, and order is restored, a first-class nation is a blank in commercial circles. Our gross foreign trade the past year equaled very nearly $800,000,000. This is no inconsiderable fraction of the international commerce of the world. To blot out from the system the United States, would hurl the others from their spheres. In less than a month's time all foreign nations will see that resistance to the power of our Government is hopeless; that the submission or subjection of the rebels is simply a question of time; and that the only way in which they can save themselves from excessive losses and embarrassment, is to aid us in putting an immediate end to the struggle, Every echo we get of news from this side must have a more friendly tone. We have already decided indications of such change. Even the London Times has adopted towards us the language characteristic of gentlemen, and no longer sees us glistening in paint, nor displaying the tomahawk and scalping-knife as symbols of our mode of warfare. A week ago it told us that our Confederacy was hopelessly dissolved; the latest arrival predicts an arduous struggle, and implicitly admits the overwhelming power of the Government, which a short time previously it thought probable would be chased from its Capital!",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Better Tone of Foreign Sentiment.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Better Tone of Foreign Sentiment.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6ae320eb-3420-5647-8bf7-983a15a4f5f2,646,nyt://article/6ae320eb-3420-5647-8bf7-983a15a4f5f2

"The experience of nearly a century of domestic quiet, the apparent absence of causes of internal disturbance, and the traditional foreign policy of our Government ""peace with all nations; entangling alliances with none"" had led our people to the belief that we were an exception to the rule which requires other nations to maintain a large standing army to act either as local police, or to resist foreign aggression.

We are suddenly awakened from this dream. At the very moment our faith was the strongest in the permanence of our happy condition, we were nursing in our very bosom a treason which, for a time, threatened to blot us out from the list of nations. We recovered from the stunning blow, and, with unexampled celerity, placed a hundred thousand men in the field, to be immediately followed by another hundred thousand. Our first task is to subdue; next to preserve order. This for a time must be an enforced one. The great element of discord still remains, and must be watched by a powerful force. Confidence is a sentiment of slow growth, and it takes an equally long time for a subdued party to forget its defeats and heartily fraternize with the conquerors. We shall gladly extend amnesty to all who lay down their arms; but we can never again allow ourselves to be surprised and nearly overthrown. If Slavery remains undisturbed, we must not forget that it has been the sole cause of the rebellion, and may breed further disturbance. Men brought up under its influence differ radically from those nurtured in freedom. This natural divergence must be counteracted, as far as necessary, by force. Should the slave be partially freed, we must remember that he is of different race from ourselves; that there will soon be 5,000,000 of them within our borders, rendering necessary, by way of precaution, a strong arm to meet our anomalous condition which unites the totally different races under one Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Need of a Permanent Standing Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Need of a Permanent Standing Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c48156a3-b7dd-580c-920e-4ed2c8509df0,665,nyt://article/c48156a3-b7dd-580c-920e-4ed2c8509df0

LEEDS & CO., in the Rotunda of the Merchants' Exchange. There was a very good attendance, and contrary to general expectation the prices realized were excellent, considering the stringency of the times. Towards the close there was a little flagging, but the sale most be regarded as a complete success, and can hardly fail to give satisfaction to the liberal artists who have so cheerfully contributed their labor and talent to the cause. Upwards of four thousand dollars will be added to the fund by this sale. The first blood was drawn by Wm. Hart's picture called ""Moonlight on the Grand Menau,"" which reached $100, and was knocked down amidst much applause. Inman's ""Black your Boots, Sir"" brought $45; Casilear's ""Swiss Mountains,"" $85; Gignoux's ""Niagara,"" after a brisk competition in ten-dollar bids, was sold for $160; Beard's ""Reflection"". only brought $60, and his caricature, ""Beef for the Southern Army,"" $37 50; ""Cumaeir Sibyl,"" by Louis Lang, $100, (there was only one bid for it;) ""Homeward through the Stream,"" by A.F. Bellows, $140; ""A Foxy Morning,"" by Eastman Johnson, $105; two landscapes, by Keneett, brought respectively $100 and $105; ""Paolina,"" by H.P. Gray, $80; ""Happy Summer-time,"" by G.A.

The drum for the moment supplies all our musical need, and managers who hate its imperative roll generally avoid a direct competition with it. Mr. MAX STRAKOSCH, who has just entered into the business of management, and already displays that admirable quality of success, called enterprise, determined, it seems, to fight the drum on its own grounds. He announced a concert which was excellent in quality. It attracted an overflowing audience, and he may now retire to the Provinces in triumph. This great and unexpected event came off last evening at Dodworth's Saloon. Miss CARLOTTA PATTI was the principal attraction. She is a charming vocalist; posseses great facility of execution, and a thoroughly delicious quality of voice for the concert room. It would be difficult to mention another artiste who could give so much general satisfaction. In addition to this trump card, Mr. MAX STRAKOSCH boasts of the services of Signor BRIGNOLE, the favorite tenor of New-York; Madame AMALIA STRAKOSCH, Signor ETTORE BARILI and Mr. GEORGE W. WARREN. With such first class artists, it is his intention to make a Provincial tour in the West and Canada.

GARRETT DAVIS was prevented from presenting to the Legislative Committee, appointed to investigate the statement that arms had been sent into the State for the use of the Union men. The Committee, it seems, knew the general purport of what Mr. DAVIS wished to tell them, and would not get together a quorum. The Journal states that he had no information of any arms or ammunition having been ""brought into the State without authority, of the laws thereof,"" as the inquiry suggested, or for any unlawful purpose whatever. While he considered that the Legislature had no light to institute such an inquiry as it proposed, he waived all these objections, and prepared his statement, with the intention of telling all that he knew. In his County, Bourbon, at appears that the Secessionists were very active. They sent an agent to New-Orleans who procured fifty stand of arms which were found to be to heavy for cavalry on their arrival at Paris, and which were consequently transferred to a foot company. The secession party had sent two other agents to JEFF, DAVIS to procure arms, who had returned without obtaining them. These facts were public and notorious, but no person ever objected to such efforts of the Secessionists of Bourbon to obtain arms for themselves, or to their perfect right to get them whenever and wherever they chose. There were two companies of the State Guard at Bourbon County; one of them, with its officers, were Secessionists, and had repudiated the Stars and Stripes, and for some week? had been drilling under the secession flag. Its Captain had posted up printed notices to the members to hold themselves in readiness for active-service; public recruiting was also going on in the neighboring counties for the Order of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and leaders of the party were openly declaring that when they got arms they would show whether Kentucky would secede or not -- that she would go out of the Union in sixty days, and that they would assist in hanging any man who would go to join the Army of the United States -- in chorus with the Louisville Courier, mark yon. They were warning good citizens, who were Union men, that they were ""spotted,"" and the time would so on come when they would have to leave the country. Some Union men had already been notified to leave, and, for fear of violence, had gone, and some had been threatened with hanging, Mr. DAVIS was informed that threats in all these forms had been made against himself.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTANT FROM KENTUCKY.; HOW THE UNION MEN WERE ARMED-- FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAND DISTRIBUTED BY HON.

SANDS, one of the founders of the Order. This monument enterprise has been the subject of active effort in the Order for the past two years, and has now reached a very successful consummation. Nearly $1,300 have been contributed by the Order of Sons of Temperance in the following States: New-York, New-Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maine, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Louisiana, Vermont, South Carolina, Missouri, Mississippi and California; also, by the British Provinces of New-Brunswick, the two Canadas. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward's Island and Newfoundland, and a small contribution all the way from England. This sum, through the liberality of Mr. HALL, the constructor of the monument, has produced a very large and really beautiful structure. It is of Italian marble, is of the obelisk style, 25 feet 3 inches in height, with a granite base of 5 feet 3 inches in breadth. The shaft itself is 17 feet in height. The only ornamental work on the monument, if we except the slab of California marble sent specially from Sands Division of Sacramento, are from raised triangles on the four sides of the shaft, and five feet from the shaft's base. Each triangle contains a raised star in its centre, and on the rim of each triangle is cut in raised letters, the motto of the Order -- ""Love, Purity, Fidelity,"" respectively in English, Latin, French and German, the German, ""Liebe, Lanterkeit, Treur,"" and beautifully executed in German text. The Committee of the Grand Division of Eastern New-York, through whom the Monument Fund was raised, and under whose direction the Monument was erected, are P.G.W.P. Wm. H. Armstrong of N.Y., and P.G.W.A. Alex. Campbell, of Brooklyn, and Wm. E. Macdonough, of New-York. A large concourse of the Divisions and members of the Order, with regalta and banners, was on the ground, and the special dedication service prepared for the occasion was duly performed. Prominent in the exercises were M.W.P. Dr. S.L. Condict and P.M.W.P. John W. Oliver, himself one of the sixteen founders of the Order, and P.G.W.P. Theo. L. Cuyler. Rev. J.B. Wakeley, Pastor of D.H. Sands, and who, seven years ago, preached his funeral sermon, also assisted. In the evening there was a public meeting in the Forsyth-street M.E. Church, of which Mr. Sands was a member when he died, and at which his funeral exercises took place. The M.W.P., Head of the Order in North America, presided. Addresses were delivered by Rev. J.B. Wakeley, A.C. Flanagan, John N. Steams, Mr. Cutter, of Poughkeepsie, and others, and excellent and appropriate singing by the Marshall Family and Mr. Macdonough's Glee Club.

"The Second Maine Regiment, Col. JAMISON, which has been temporarily quartered at Willett's Point, on the Sound, took their departure, yesterday afternoon. The promulgation of the order produced intense delight among the men, some of whom were getting almost homesick, on account of their delay. At yesterday noon, the camp equippage had been packed, and soon after the troops had dined, every, thing was in readiness to move.
