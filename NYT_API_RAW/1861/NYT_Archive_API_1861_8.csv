At 7 o'clock they crossed to this City, and at the Park were met by the Seventh Regiment, five hundred strong, who had paraded under the Colonel's orders to receive and escort them. It will be remembered that the Seventh Regiment followed the Eighth Massachusetts to Washington, overtaking them near Annapolis, where the steamer Boston, on which they were embarked, grounded. At Annapolis, the Seventh divided with them their rations; they labored together in repairing the bridges which had been destroyed, relaying the tracks on the railroad, and putting the engines in running order, the Eighth furnishing the ready mechanics for this important and timely service. The Seventh preceeded them in their arrival at the Capital one day, and they were both quartered in the Capital. From these circumstances, a feeling of friendship sprung up between them, which will be of lasting duration. A detachment of Col. COCHRAN's Chasseurs joined the escort, and made a very creditable appearance. At the Astor House refreshments were furnished to the officers, and Mr. BAKER provided a prompt and comfortable breakfast for the men in the Park Barracks. The regiment then re-formed, the Seventh taking the right of the line. Between Chambers and Leonard streets the escort drew up at present arms while the Eighth passed by, and, further on, the Eighth halted and the escort again passed in review, the guests saluting their old friends in military style.

"THE RETURNED TROOPS. -- The Thirteenth and Twenty-eighth Regiments were to be seen about the City yesterday, receiving the congratulations of their friends, and apparently enjoying themselves to their fullest extent. They are all in good health, but are considerably sun-burnt. There was no unusual excitement, nor any disturbance in the streets, notwithstanding the large number of soldiers present.

"The celebrated Sixth Regiment, of Massachusetts, whose passage through Baltimore toward the sent of Government on the memorable 19th of April was contested by the secession mob, killing and wounding several of their number, arrived here yesterday, from Annapolis and Baltimore en route for Massachusetts, their three months' term of enlistment having expired on the 20th of July. They have been stationed most of the time at the Relay House, where their duties have been very onerous in watching and holding in check the uneasy spirits of Maryland. Notwithstanding the heavy duties which have been required of them, the admirable location of their camp and the careful sanitary management of its officers, the regiment brings home nearly the entire number that originally made up the rolls. Five or six are on the sick list with the returning regiment, and two were left in Baltimore. They were detained in the cars at Baltimore from 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. on Tuesday, on account of the accident to the train between Baltimore and Havre de Grace. In Philadelphia the Citizens' Committee gave them a good dinner, and they arrived via the Amboy route at 4 o'clock P.M. A large deputation of citizens greeted them on arrival, and escorted them up Broadway to the Park, where the regiment were provided a comfortable meal at the Barracks. They then formed, and marched to the foot of Vestry-street, N.R., where they took the steamer Connecticut, via the Norwich and Worcester route to Boston.

They have been stationed most of the time at the Relay House, where their duties have been very onerous in watching and holding in check the uneasy spirits of Maryland. Notwithstanding the heavy duties which have been required of them, the admirable location of their camp and the careful sanitary management of its officers, the regiment brings home nearly the entire number that originally made up the rolls. Five or six are on the sick list with the returning regiment, and two were left in Baltimore. They were detained in the cars at Baltimore from 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. on Tuesday, on account of the accident to the train between Baltimore and Havre de Grace. In Philadelphia the Citizens' Committee gave them a good dinner, and they arrived via the Amboy route at 4 o'clock P.M. A large deputation of citizens greeted them on arrival, and escorted them up Broadway to the Park, where the regiment were provided a comfortable meal at the Barracks. They then formed, and marched to the foot of Vestry-street, N.R., where they took the steamer Connecticut, via the Norwich and Worcester route to Boston.

POPE giving them to understand that he would hold them strictly responsible for their protection, their property and even their lives paying the forfeit if the destruction of hindrance of these important thoroughfares should occur. The wisdom of this proceeding is apparent to every one. Gen. POPE also wisely says it is out of the question to fight those guerrilla parties of rebels with the regular soldiers. The Home Guards and Union men, who are largely in the majority in the country, must protect themselves against them. Whenever the rebels collect in numbers sufficient to justify operations against them by a large body of troops, an expedition will be promptly undertaken. It is the duty of Union men everywhere in the State to organize and fight the rebel scoundrels after their own fashion, and not be overawed in any instance by their blustering or their devilish atrocities.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MILITARY SITUATION IN MISSOURI.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MILITARY SITUATION IN MISSOURI.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the St. Louis Democrat', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc0a7d65-211d-5a9a-ab10-0d64990aa97f,1004,nyt://article/cc0a7d65-211d-5a9a-ab10-0d64990aa97f

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/04/archives/secession-an-impossible-right-the-unity-of-our-national-character-a.html,,"We have thus far traced the history of our National Union from the era of its first germination down to the time for the call for the Federal Convention of May, 1787. We have seen that during all the intervening years there never was a time when any one of the colonies, or States, if you please, was vested with any independence which did not accrue to it solely in virtue of its being a member of the Union, or which it could have enjoyed without the protection of the General Government. We have seen that the chief aim of the Confederation of 1781, was to perpetuate a Union formed and consolidated before the existence of any distinct State organizations or State Constitutions: and that that Confederation was ratified and confirmed by all of the Colonies or States, before our National Independence was actually achieved, or conceded by Great Britain. And we have thus shown how impossible it was that any one State, in severalty, could be regarded at that time, as possessing any element of sovereignty or independence outside, or independently, of the National capacity of the Union. Yet it must, nevertheless, be conceded, that the Confederation did associate with each State, in severalty, the idea of a sovereignty and independence not otherwise belonging to it, and utterly incompatible with the supreme authority of the General Government. Even so, it must also be conceded that a Convention is fully empowered to reconstruct, revise, alter or amend that Confederation as the original Conventions were to ratify it, was fully competent to revoke any grant or reservation of sovereignty to each State, so far as necessary, and to restore it (at least with the consent of the people of those States) to the General Government. At any rate the members of the Federal Convention so construed their powers, and the result, as we will show, was sanctioned by the people and States of the whole Union. Hence it will appear that whatever of sovereignty, or separate independence, each State may have claimed under the Articles of Confederation, the same was surrendered to the people, and by them vested in the General Government, by the consolidation of the Union under the provisions of the present Constitution.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SECESSION AN IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT.; The Unity of our National Character, and the Supremacy of our National Government a Covenant Running with the Land.

The luminous rays collected by a double reflector in the shape of a seashell, are transmitted to the stage through a sloping aperture, covered with a plate of dull glass, which subdues the glare of the gas. By this contrivance all danger of the actresses' dresses catching fire is obviated, and a source of hurtful emanations and disagreeable heat, as inconvenient to the spectators as it is to the actors, is removed. The air, being no longer disturbed by the vibrations caused by the heat, the propagation of the sonorous rays is much more regular, and even the light cast on the stage is stronger and better distributed.

The men were notified to assemble at 10 o'clock, but it was fully an hour later before the mustering officer, Maj. SHEPHARD, arrived. The scene in the armory was most picturesque. The men appeared in the most ununiform of uniforms. They had coats of red, white and blue, of gray, black and green; and of no particular color at all, besides some who had no coats at all. The same charming variety was visible in the pants, while the dishabille in the style of accoutrements kept pace with the rest. The floor looked like a deserted battle-field. There were fragments of knapsacks, cartridge-boxes, bayonets, bent muskets, and all the minute paraphernalia of war. In the midst of all this, eight hundred men were engaged in earnest conversation, producing a chaos from which it seemed almost impossible to extract military discipline. Gradually, however, stacks of muskets are overhauled, equipments are adjusted -- the shrill voice of Capt. THOMAS FRANCIS MEAGHER calls out ""shoulder arms,"" and his company files out in comparatively good order. Soon other companies are disentangled from the mass, and after much confusion at the stairs -- which are built on the tenement-house principle of the least possible accommodation, and the greatest imaginable danger in case of fire -- most of the companies were at length out, when a rush of outsiders took place to get in, and for a time a dead lock on the stairs occurred. The men with the muskets going down had the right of way, but the men coming up had the energy and the muscle, and fairly kept the armed men at bay while they passed under threats of ""charge bayonets.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL MILITARY MOVEMENTS.; MUSTERING OUT THE SIXTY-NINTH.

"On Friday afternoon, United States Marsha MURRAY arrested on board the steamship Northern Light, as she was coming into port, Mr. AUSTIN E.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/04/archives/distinguished-arrival-from-california-the-absconding-navy-agent-and.html,,"On Friday afternoon, United States Marsha MURRAY arrested on board the steamship Northern Light, as she was coming into port, Mr. AUSTIN E. SMITH, late Navy Agent of San Francisco, a rabid Secessionist, and brother of the notorious Extra BILLY SMITH, of Virginia. It seems that SMITH, on hearing that Old Virginia had seceded, made up his mind that the United States Government was entirely blotted out; and although he held a lucrative office under it -- the gift of BUCHANAN -- he threw up his commission in disgust, vamosed his office, and hurried off as speedily as possible to plant himself on the ""sacred soil."" There was only one thing that this distinguished Virginia office-holder regretted on vacating his office, and that was that he had not more Government money in his possession to take along with him. It will be recollected from our San Francisco correspondence that he boasted to his friends, on the eve of his departure, of his ardent desire to rob the United States Government of a good round sum, but as he only had $10,000 in his possession, he said he was ashamed to steal so small an amount, and should therefore leave it behind. One F.F.V. considers himself as good as another, and it is not to be wondered at that SMITH should hesitate to present himself, with the proceeds of a petty larceny of $10,000 in his pocket, before such a magnificent thief as JOHN R. FLOYD. It is not certain, however, that he did not take that amount, small as it is -- in fact he is charged with so doing by the Government -- but we forbear to repeat the charge, lest he should consider it libelous. SMITH has been expected here, for some time past, and the Marshal has been on the lookout for him. As the Northern Light was coming up the bay he boarded her, and finding SMITH among the passengers, took him into custody. When the steamer arrived at the dock, the prisoner was taken to the New-York Hotel, where he passed Friday night, under guard of two Deputy Marshals. Yesterday the Marshal telegraphed to Washington to know what disposition should be made of the prisoner, and received instructions from Secretary SEWARD to hand him over to the military authorities. He was therefore transferred from his hotel to Fort Lafayette, where he spent last night, and will probably spend many nights to come with his secession confreres from Baltimore. The Marshal retains possession of all his baggage, including letters and correspondence, which will doubtless throw more lustre on his already brilliant reputation.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISTINGUISHED ARRIVAL FROM CALIFORNIA.; THE ABSCONDING NAVY AGENT AND SECESSIONIST OF SAN FRANCISCO ARRIVES BY THE NORTHERN LIGHT, AND IS RECEIVED BY THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL HE IS HANDED OVER TO THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISTINGUISHED ARRIVAL FROM CALIFORNIA.; THE ABSCONDING NAVY AGENT AND SECESSIONIST OF SAN FRANCISCO ARRIVES BY THE NORTHERN LIGHT, AND IS RECEIVED BY THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL HE IS HANDED OVER TO THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5eb4c58-a535-52d1-934c-284ef492aef9,436,nyt://article/a5eb4c58-a535-52d1-934c-284ef492aef9

"There is good as well as evil about the repulse at Bull Run. If it was bad for the Army that fought there, bad for the country, bad for the prestige, which, as well as valor wins battles, it was a God-send for the croakers.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/04/archives/a-carnival-for-croakers.html,,"There is good as well as evil about the repulse at Bull Run. If it was bad for the Army that fought there, bad for the country, bad for the prestige, which, as well as valor wins battles, it was a God-send for the croakers. If it saddened patriotism, it made their hearts glad -- brought them into the foreground. It is wonderful the number of prophets, those who foretell events after they have happened, there are in the land; how many who can tell you exactly how any great calamity might have been avoided, and a great good achieved. It is wonderful too, how many great Generals we have whose existence has been revealed by the disaster at Bull Run; hoary veterans from the banker's desk, the merchant's counting-house, the lawyer's office, the editor's sanctum, and all the way down to the cobbler's stall, who, had they been consulted, could have reversed that calamity, and given us the fortifications, guns, the whole Army of rebels, and carried us safely through the intrenched camps at Manassas, on a triumphant march upon Richmond. ""Don't you see,"" says one as he seizes you by the button -- ""how easily the thing might have been done? The wind on the day of the battle was in the southwest, and all you had to do was to throw a blazing brand into the woods on that side of the enemy. The fire would have kindled and gone roaring and surging, crackling and swirling down upon him, smoking out his soldiers, firing off his cannon, exploding his magazines, driving him from his ambush and concealed batteries into the open fields, where our soldiers could have speared his disordered columns with their bayonets like so many suckers?"" ""Why did Gen. SCOTT"" -- says another -- ""permit MCDOWELL to march upon Bull Run at all until he had a hundred thousand men to hurl upon the enemy? Why didn't he wait till PATTERSON'S division had swept down from Harper's Ferry on the enemy's flank, and MCCLELLAN'S forces had crossed the mountains and attacked him in the rear? Don't you see the trap BEAUREGARD would have been in, with a hundred thousand men in front, twenty thousand on his flank, and a victorious enemy thundering in his rear? We should have had him safe enough then, Sir -- safe enough."" ""If MCDOWELL"" -- says a third -- ""had only moved cautiously, cutting away the woods and planting batteries as he went -- if he had dug riffle pits and thrown up intrenchments, made regular approaches, as was done at Mantua or Sebastapol, in less than six months he would have driven the rebels from the Gap. But he was too hasty; he was rash, Sir, and hence the repulse.""

"Of the character and policy of LOUIS NAPOLEON, CAVOUR was accustomed to speak with much freedom. No one had better opportunities than CAVOUR of sounding their depths.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/07/archives/count-cavonrs-estimate-of-the-character-and-intentions-of-napoleon.html,,"Of the character and policy of LOUIS NAPOLEON, CAVOUR was accustomed to speak with much freedom. No one had better opportunities than CAVOUR of sounding their depths. He was the only living man who had ventured to grapple with him face to face, and who had used him for his purpose. The estimate he had formed of his capacity was not a high one, but he fully admitted his fertility of resource, his physical and moral courage, and his knowledge of the people he governs. ""He has no definite policy,"" he remarked to an English friend. ""He has a number of political ideas floating in his mind, none of them matured. They would seem to be convictions, founded on instinct. He will not steadily pursue any single idea if a serious obstacle presents itself, but will give way, and take up another. This is the mot de el'nigme to his policy. It is by steadily keeping this in view that I have succeeded in thwarting his designs, or in inducing him to adopt a measure. The only principle -- of principle it can be called -- which connects together these various ideas, is the establishment of his dynasty, and the conviction that the best way to secure it is by feeding the national vanity of the French people. He found France, after the fall of the Orleanist and Republican Governments, holding but a second place amongst the great Powers; he has raised her to the very first. Look at his wars, look at his foreign policy; he has never gone one step beyond what was absolutely necessary to attain this one object. The principle ostentatiously put forward in the first instance has been forgotten or discarded as soon as his immediate end has been accomplished. It was so in the war with Russia; it has been so in the war with Austria. In the Crimea he was satisfied with the success of his army in the capture of Sebastopol, which took from the English troops the glory they had earned by their devotion and courage, and to which they would have added had the war continued. In the struggle with Austria he was astounded by the greatness of the victories of Magenta and Solferino. The military glory of France had been satiated, and he thought no more of the liberty of Italy, of the free and united nation which he was to have called into existence from the Alps to the Adriatic. It is this uncertain policy, guided by dynastic and selfish considerations, which makes him so dangerous to you, and which renders it necessary that you should ever be on your guard. Not that he is hostile to England, or that he has any definite design against her. On the contrary, he has much affection for your country. He is a man of generous impulses, and has strong feelings of gratitude towards those who have served and befriended him. At the bottom of his heart he is greatly attached to Italy. His earliest recollections are bound up with her. He is to this day a 'carbonaro' in his desire for Italian freedom and hatred of Austria. He has not forgotten the kindness and hospitality shown to him when an exile in England. He admires your institutions, and the character of the English people. But all this is as nothing when compared with the maintenance of his dynasty, the establishment of which he looks upon almost in the light of a religious obligation. If the moment came when he thought a sacrifice necessary to sustain it, however great that sacrifice might be, however painful or repugnant to his feelings, he would make it. No one has had better opportunities of knowing him than I have. He has talked to me with the greatest openness of his future plans. But he has invariably assured me at the same time, that his first object was to maintain peace and good understanding with England. I believe,"" he solemnly added, ""that from policy as well as from affection, such are his views; and that only in a moment of the utmost emergency, when he was convinced that his influence in France depended upon it, would he depart from them. But that moment may come, and you would be madmen if you were not prepared for it."" As regards the Peace of Villafranca, CAVOUR attributed it to no distinct policy, but rather to a variety of motives. ""There is no profound secret or mystery about it,"" he said; ""it was rather an impulse than the result of any well-considered design. Two splendid victories had added sufficiently to the glory of the French arms. The horrible scenes he had witnessed on the field of battle had made a deep impression upon him. He felt much disgust at the quarrels among his Generals, who were sacrificing the honor of their country to personal jealousies. Then there were the heat, the dust, and the labor, for he did not spare himself; indeed, he did everything. His exertions and the fatigue he went through were amazing. His health was beginning to give way. He had had enough of campaigning and its hardships, and was anxious to get back to Paris. To add to all this, he could not resist the temptation of dealing in person with a legitimate Emperor, as his uncle had done before him, of imposing, without consulting any one, the conditions of peace, and of earning at the same time, by his generosity and moderation, the gratitude, and perhaps eventual support, of a still powerful though vanquished enemy. These various motives and considerations together led him to abandon the great cause in which he had embarked, and to forget the proclamations, the promises, and the hopes of the day before."" CAVOUR was convinced that the difficulties of an attack upon the Quadrilateral had been exaggerated. He believed that the fortresses would have soon fallen. The result of subsequent inquiries made by the Austrian Government itself into the state of Mantua and Verona fully confirmed his opinion. After the fatal day of Solferino a panic had seized the Austrian army. The result of the battle was first known in Verona by a vast number of soldiers and camp followers blockading up the gates leading to the city. The greatest disorder prevailed even in the forts, which were without the necessary guns and ammunition, and in some of which the troops had been gained over. At the same time the inhabitants of the city were ready to rise. It is believed that LOUIS NAPOLEON was not unacquainted with these facts, and that he urged them upon the Emperor of Austria at Villafranca to obtain his acceptance of the conditions of peace.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Count Cavonr's Estimate of the Character and Intentions of Napoleon III."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Count Cavonr's Estimate of the Character and Intentions of Napoleon III."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Quarterly Review', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01c759f9-ef3e-5c41-b845-0ecbacce310f,1123,nyt://article/01c759f9-ef3e-5c41-b845-0ecbacce310f

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/07/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE MURDER IN WEST-STREET. -- Coroner JACKMAN yesterday investigated the circumstances attending the murder of WILLIAM LEE, a private in the First Regiment Scott Life Guard, who was shot on Monday morning, at a drinking-saloon, corner of Morris and West streets, by ALBERT UHL, the bar-keeper. There were several witnesses of the affray, and their testimony before the Coroner corresponded in all essential particulars. The evidence of MICHAEL VALLERY, a fireman on the steamer Harriet Lane, tells the whole story of the affair. He deposed that LEE was absent from his regiment on furlough, and was going back to his camp on the day of the occurrence. Having met several of his friends in West-street, of whom the witness was one, the party stood chatting on the corner, until finally the witness invited all to take a drink. They went into the saloon at the corner of Morris and West streets, and after having taken refreshments, the witness and bar-keeper had some words about the payment. Witness stated that he had no money, but would return in the evening and settle for the liquor. The barkeeper replied with an oath, that he would not be ""burned"" out of his property in that way. Witness then started for the door, and had got three or four feet from the bar, when the prisoner followed and hit him on the head with a club, which staggered him somewhat. As quickly as he recovered, he turned upon the barkeeper, but was restrained from striking him by a man named KELLY, The deceased then walked toward the bar and asked the prisoner why he struck the witness, at the same moment lifting a water-pitcher as if to throw it. The prisoner instantly produced his revolver and shy deceased, who fell to the floor insensible. He was removed to the Hospital. None of the party were threatening the prisoner at the time he fired at the deceased. Witness never had a disturbance at the place before, and did not know whether the prisoner knew him or not. Officer DAVIN, of the Twenty-seventh Precinct, testified that he arrested the prisoner, and Dr. HALL, of the Hospital, was examined as to the nature of the wound which caused the man's death. The jury declared that the deceased had died ""from a pistol-shot wound inflicted by the prisoner, ALBERT UHL,"" who was committed by the Coroner pending action of the Grand Jury. The prisoner is a native of Germany, 23 years of age. He admitted having fired the pistol, but said that it was done in self-defence.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29fea3d9-d0ca-5c4c-b2a0-801a2520f6ac,2219,nyt://article/29fea3d9-d0ca-5c4c-b2a0-801a2520f6ac

"""The secret sessions of Congress,"" says the Examiner, ""are occupied with the maturing of a plan of financial policy for the Government, which will be permanent during the war.

So far from it, we are happy to say, that a livelier and more ingenious puzzle now occupies the public attention of the secession States than for a long time has been before their astute statesmen. The question is this: Does the blockade in reality benefit or hurt the people of the South? If the colleges were not all closed, and the ""boys"" gone to the war, we should expect to hear every debating society in the eloquent region south of Mason and Dixon's line canvassing this question. It would quite put aside those other two perennial questions in polemics: Is there more happiness in the pursuit of an object, or in its possession? --Was England right in her treatment of BONAPARTE? The New-Orleans papers' vow that their citizens never lived so cheaply or so well as since the blockade was established at the mouth of the Mississippi. Flour has fallen to a lower price than has been known for years, because none can be shipped away. Meat is so cheap that the poorest can eat it three times a day. Sugar sells at minimum prices, and thus makes up for the slight advance that has taken place on coffee. And lastly and chiefly, the blockade has kept foreign vessels and yellow fever away, and men, instead of going off with ""Yellow Jack"" and the black vomit, are spared to die gloriously for their country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Light in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Light in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9b9161b-9f2d-5bf1-989c-144c4a9c6dc0,735,nyt://article/d9b9161b-9f2d-5bf1-989c-144c4a9c6dc0

Mr. ATTISON at once proceeded to the street, and called for the Police, when the burglar ran down Pearl to Prospect-street, in the direction of Fulton Ferry, hotly pursued by several citizens. At the corner of Prospect and Washington streets, the burglar was overtaken and seized by Officer DAVID MARTIN, of the Second Precinct. The officer had scarcely taken hold of him when the burglar stabbed him twice on the left side of the neck, severing the jugular vein, and causing death in less than 15 minutes. As the burglar made the second plunge with the knife, Officer MARTIN dealt him a blow on the head with his club, which knocked him senseless to the sidewalk, where he remained a few seconds, and then attempted to make his escape. Fortunately Officer BUCK, of the Second, and Officer HARROLD, of the First Precincts, heard the disturbance, and came up in time to capture the assassin. He was taken to the Station-house and locked up, but refused to give any account of himself, except that he was a native of Ohio, and that his name was JOHN WILLETTS, neither of which assertions are believed to be true. On his person was found 32 skeleton keys, a full set of burglar's tools, false whiskers and hair. The deceased leaves a widow and three children, who reside at No. 32 Stanton-street. When stabbed MARTIN was taken to the office of Dr. GILFILLAN, but he was beyond the reach of medical skill. Dr. BAUER, assisted by Drs. COOPER and WILLETTS, made a post mortem examination of the body yesterday afternoon, when they rendered a verdict ""that the deceased came to his death by hemorrhage from the left subclavian vein, near its junction with the common jugular vein, having been incised by a dirk-knife which was planned into the chest from above the left collar-bone.""

"Gen. LYON has signalized his campaign in Missouri by another brilliant feat of arms. BEN. MCCULLOCH has had an opportunity to measure strength with him, and has been decidedly worsted. Gen. LYON received information on Thursday last that the enemy was approaching St. Louis in three columns, numbering 20,000 men, and immediately started out to meet him, with five complete regiments of volunteers, two or three companies of regular infantry, and two or three companies of regular cavalry. He met MCCULLOCH the next day, at a place called Dug Springs, about 19 miles southwest of Springfield, when a fight took place between 4 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon. The principal feature of the battle was a charge of Gen. LYON's cavalry, numbering two hundred and seventy, against a body of rebel infantry, estimated at from two to four thousand. They came upon this force suddenly, and being in a position where it was inconvenient to retreat, cut their way through it with the loss of only five men, including the Lieutenant commanding. The enemy then made their appearance in large numbers, but was speedily dispersed by Gen. LYON with his artillery -- the infantry not being brought into action at all. The rebels then retreated southward, and subsequently took up another position on the Fayettsville road, at a place known as McCulloch's store. At last accounts, Gen. LYON had strongly intrenched himself in the vicinity of the enemy, who were expected to attack him soon.

"The Chamber of Commerce held a special meeting yesterday, for the purpose of welcoming home Hon. J.A. WRIGHT, late United States Minister to Prussia. There was a fair attendance of the members. Mr. PELATIAM PERRIT, the President, introduced Mr. WRIGHT in appropriate terms, when he arose and addressed the Chamber in a speech of some length, upon the state of our National affairs. He referred to the patriotic course pursued by the merchants in their prompt and munificent response to the wants of the Government in furnishing the means for carrying on the war, and also to their liberal subscriptions for the same purpose. He had arrived here after an absence of four years, to contemplate with sorrow, though not with despair, the condition of his beloved country. He rejoiced to see that the time for the exhibition of party feelings had gone by, and that the effort of every true citizen was put forth to sustain the Government in its hour of trial. He belonged to a school of politicians who acknowledged only the sovereignty of the General Government, and which did not divide their allegiance with any State; that stood up for the Constitution founded by WASHINGTON, JEFFERSON, and FRANKLIN. That Government had sheltered him at home, and protected him abroad, and to it he owed all allegiance. The first duty of the citizen was to defend his country. The German people, as a whole, were heartily in favor of the American Union, and were ready to assist by their lives in defending it. He received the warmest personal assurances from the King himself that he prayed for the perpetuity and prosperity of our whole Government, and he said, on the occasion of his taking final leave of him, ""God grant you may succeed in sustaining. the integrity of the old Union."" [Applause.] If they desired the support of European Governments, they must depend upon themselves. He referred to the vacillating course of the public Press of Europe, and particularly to the tone of the London Times. That paper had declared that the South was a unit, and that the North was divided. The Press had been subsidized in the interests of the South, and foreign gold was being employed here to undermine and destroy the country and our institutions. We should, he said, not depend on outside support and sympathy until every effort of our own had been exhausted to sustain the Constitution. The European masses loved liberty. His house had been besieged by persons who wished to enlist in the armies of the Union, and he was at last compelled to put up a notice that his was not a recruiting office. The German troops were slow to move, but they always moved right; their impulses were strong for freedom. Wherever a good cause needs assistance, they were prompt to lend a helping hand, and no nation responded more heartily when appealed to in behalf of public liberty. [Cheers.] He had received hundreds of letters of sympathy from all parts of Germany. He saw an affecting instance of devotion to home and country while abroad. An American lady who had been stricken down by disease, when dying, asked that she might first embrace her little child, and then that she might be wrapt in the American flag and expire in its folds, as a testimony of her love for her country. The people of the South would say to him as ABRAHAM said to LOT, ""Let there be no strife between us, turn thee to the right or to the left as it pleaseth thee."" But ABRAHAM would not have said this had LOT overturned all the sacred arrangements of his household, and conspired to overthrow the patriarchal government and all that ABRAHAM held sacred. When the South should cease to pull down the pillars of the Constitution, and give over their efforts to subvert the fabric of government, then he would listen to them. Until rebellious hands were no longer raised in this suicidal work, let millions of money and thousands of lives, if need be, be laid upon the altar of patriotism, to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution. [Applause.] He was ready to hail with joy the day which should restore peace to the country, but he devoutly prayed that we might have no peace that was not founded in principle.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/08/archives/the-chamber-of-commrece-address-of-hon-ja-wright.html,,"The Chamber of Commerce held a special meeting yesterday, for the purpose of welcoming home Hon.

"Hard as the war we are now engaged in may bear upon individual interests, and calamitous as it doubtless is, for the time, to the commerce and trade of the country, yet it has its elements of good as well as of evil. The American people, in their fierce pursuit of those vast material enterprises, of the success of which we boast so much, were in danger of forgetting the necessity of providing for the possible contingencies of the future. More than three-quarters of a century of internal repose, and, with the exception of three or four years, of peace with all the world, afforded an opportunity of developing the natural resources of the country, of changing continental forests to farms and fields, of building up cities and towns; of creating for ourselves a world-wide commerce, and of advancement in a career of progress that carried us to a high position in the scale of nations. But this long period of peace made us negligent of preparing for the accident of war.In our prosperity we overlooked the teachings of history. The fallacy that the future would be as the past, that the Union would never be disturbed by internal revolt, because it never had been, that the people and the States would always be loyal to the Constitution, because they had never been otherwise, came to be with us an article of political faith, upon the assumed truth of which the policy of our Government was based. We kept no standing Army, because we had no martial neighbors whose enmity we feared, or whose power we had occasion to dread. Even the militia of the States came to be contemned as a useless pageant, and was fast falling into disrepute under the ridicule it attracted by its broad caricature of war. Thus, while all our energies were directed towards the accomplishment of physical enterprises, the martial spirit, so essential to the maintenance of the power and strength of a great nation, was fast dying out. We were warned of possible insurrection -- of collision between the State and National Governments. We laughed at the folly of the admonition. We refused to listen to the roar of the cataract, even when its sound was in our ears, until in sight of the rapids down which the inevitable drift lay. We started at last from our dream of security, to see treason organized into open revolt, without a preparation in advance to meet it. We had no Army, no arms, no munitions of war; and for the time, the Government was at the mercy of a rebellion whose conspiracies had been ripening for years.

"Two full-sized specimens of the species of whale called by ichthyologists the Beluga Catodon, but commonly known as the white whale of the Arctic Seas, are now on exhibition at Barnum's Museum These interesting and curious fish were captured in the river St. Lawrence, near the Isle aux Coutres, on Friday last, and were brought to this City yesterday by Mr. H.D. BUTLER, to whom so many are indebted for the pleasure they experience in the possession of parlor aquaria. Mr. BUTLER's attention was drawn to these whales about two years ago by Mr. DETU, a Canadian gentleman, who forwarded two dead specimens to this City, with a variety of beautifully-finished leather, which had been manufacturing of their skins. Being impressed with the idea that living specimens might be obtained, Mr. BUTLER conceived the purpose of making an expedition to the St. Lawrence to procure them. A schooner was chattered at Quebec, fitted with all the appliances necessary for the capture of the fish, with a crew well skilled in the art of taking them. The point selected was near la Riviere Orelle, below the Saginaw, where the St. Lawrence is about 16 miles wide. A trap several acres in extent was constructed of poles, into which the fish were decoyed and captured. The rise and fall of the tide which is some 20 fact at this point of the river, greatly aided the enterprise, leaving the fish nearly dry at low water. Large tanks had been prepared, into which they were placed, and transported by the Grand Trunk Railroad to Portland, and thence to this City. The fish are as large as any of their species being 20 feet in length, and weighing 2,000 pounds each. They are perfectly white, and appear to be in good health. An immense reservoir, purposely constructed for their accommodation in the basement of the Museum, affords them ample room in which to swim. It is found necessary to keep the water in the reservoir at a low temperature by supplying it daily with tons of ice.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/09/archives/live-whales-from-the-st-lawrence.html,,"Two full-sized specimens of the species of whale called by ichthyologists the Beluga Catodon, but commonly known as the white whale of the Arctic Seas, are now on exhibition at Barnum's Museum These interesting and curious fish were captured in the river St. Lawrence, near the Isle aux Coutres, on Friday last, and were brought to this City yesterday by Mr. H.D.

The St. Lawrence gave chase, and, on nearing the Petrel, she hove about and stood for the St. Lawrence, and soon fired three shots at the latter -- once with grape and twice with solid shot.

"The first naval engagement between the Confederate and the National Governments, according to the Petersburgh Express, took place on Sunday, the 21st of July, near the fortification at Oregon inlet, on the North Carolina coast, between the steamer Beaufort, commanded by Lieut. DUVAL, and a National steamer, name unknown. The particulars are given in an extra of the Raleigh Standard. The result is highly creditable to the gallant Lieut. DUVAL, who commanded, and his men. Though he fought against immense odds, he achieved a great triumph, which is the more brilliant from the disproportions between the vessels and their forces. The National steamer was a large three-masted propeller, carrying six heavy guns, and a rifled cannon forward and aft, and having on board at least 175 men. The Beaufort is a small steamer, carrying only one smooth-bored gun, and a crew of twenty-six. The engagement commenced at 10:15 A.M., and terminated at 11 A.M. The enemy fired fifteen shots, five or six of which were from the rifled cannon. The Beaufort, eight shots, three of which struck the enemy.

HORNER, a child 3 years of age, who was poisoned with alcoholic liquor, administered by ANN MCDERMOTT, her grandmother. The principal witness before the Coroner was JOHN REDDEN, a boy 14 years of age, who lives at No. 312 East Nineteenth-street, where the deceased and her grandmother also resided. The boy testified that the child's mother went to service in the country about a month ago, leaving her in the care of the woman MODERMOTT, who was in the habit of drinking to excess. He had often seen her drunk, and sometimes she gave liquor to the child. On Saturday last, just after 6 o'clock, he saw Mrs. MODERMOTT fill a large teacup three-quarters full with sweetened liquor, and make the little girl drink it. Soon afterwards the child was staggering about the sidewalk, making fun for the children of the neighborhood. The grandmother was drunk at this time. The witness saw her again, on Monday afternoon, give the child about the same quantity of liquor as she made her drink on Saturday. That night about 12 o'clock he heard the little one moaning loudly, and, going to the room, he found her lying insensible on the bed, with blood streaming from her nose and mouth, and the grandmother in a drunken stupor on the floor. He called in Policeman VAN ORDEN, of the Eighteenth Precinct, who took the child to Bellevue Hospital, and arrested the brutal grandmother. The little sufferer was placed under the care of Dr. VEDDER,the House Surgeon, but she never recovered consciousness, and death resulted on Wednesday evening. The Jury rendered a verdict inculpating the grandmother, who was committed to prison by the Coroner. The accused is about 50 years of age, and was born in Ireland. She states that she was very sorry for what she had done, but denied that she intended to kill the child.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fcf85b99-af11-5a50-b73d-c696888a520f,1130,nyt://article/fcf85b99-af11-5a50-b73d-c696888a520f

His text is repudiation; not National, but State repudiation, in which category, in order to make ""the balance of disgrace nearly equal,"" he is pleased to include Pennsylvania and Indiana, on the North, with Mississippi and Florida on the south of the line. The text, we may mention by the way, is one of the writer's own selection. The point was not made on this side, at the initiation or in the early progress of the present rebellion. JEFFERSON DAVIS and the State of Florida were first singled out and denounced in the columns of the London Times as gross and unblushing repudiators, and therefore unworthy of all confidence in their open rebellion against the National Government.

The report includes the statement of Major MURRAY himself, which was to the effect that ROBERTS attempted to shoot him, -- and that he killed him in order to save his own life. He said that he had never seen the man before, and could not imagine any motive or provocation for the attempted murder. The evidence of a lady who had been living with MURRAY for some years, as his wife, however, supplies the motive.

It consisted of seven thousand men, including two hundred cavalry, with eight pieces of artillery -- the object being to draw out Gen. BUTLER's forces and attack Hampton or Newport's News, if practicable, or at least to burn Hampton, to prevent its being used for Winter quarters by the National troops. Gen. BUTLER, acting on this information, at once repaired with a considerable force to Hampton Bridge, and took the necessary measures to prevent a crossing by the rebels. Gen. MAGRUDER, with about five hundred men of his expedition, made his appearance about midnight, and immediately set fire to the town. He also attempted to force a passage of the bridge, but was repulsed with the loss of three killed and six wounded.

"VERY ROMANTIC, VERY.

Her name is BRIDGET ...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/10/archives/general-city-news.html,,"VERY ROMANTIC, VERY. -- A fine-looking, bright-eyed girl of 16 was yesterday placed under the protection of Miss FOSTER, the matron of the City Prison, whose case presents features of a more than ordinarily interesting character. Her name is BRIDGET DOKAY, and her parents still live in the City of Dublin, which is her native place. The particulars of her romantic career were given by herself, with such an air of modest truthfulness that no one would wish to question her veracity. She stated that when thirteen years of age she became acquainted with a worthy young man named KELLY, a carpenter, who wished to marry her. Her parents, who were well-to-do, prudent people, objected to the match, because of her youth, and prevailed upon the young man to leave the neighborhood, giving him a fit-out of $100. His departure grieved her, and she determined to follow him. After the lapse of a few months she learned that he had procured employment on board a vessel as ship's carpenter, and that he sailed out of Liverpool. Thither she repaired as quickly as she obtained the means, but only to learn that KELLY's vessel had a few days previously sailed for New-York. The damsel was disappointed, but her desire to see her truant lover was not conquered. She immediately procured a suit of Sailor-boy's clothing, for which she discarded her own girlish attire, and then shipped, under the name of EDWARD JOHNSON, as cabin-boy for a trip to New-York, whither she arrived, but still failed to accomplish the purpose she had undertaken. Friendless and without means, after she had been here a week or two, it became necessary that she should obtain employment, and, noitwithstanding the hardships to which she had been subjected on her first voyage, there was a certain fascination about a sailor's life which induced her to follow it. So, for three years, she has been voyaging from port to port, two of which were passed in the capacity of cabin-boy, and the third as an able seaman, her robust constitution enabling her to take her ""trick at the wheel"" and perform the varied duties of her lot as well as the best man on board. During all this time, notwithstanding an evident refinement of manner not characteristic of an ordinary sailor, and delicatcy of appearance, which ought to have betrayed her sex, her secret was never discovered. She performed her duties so well that her three last voyages have been made in one vessel -- the ship Resolute, of the Black Ball line -- the Captain having pressed her to remain with him, and complimenting her as a ""promising young man."" But, amid all the hardships of her condition she lost no opportunity of searching for the young carpenter, of whom, however, she has lately lost every trace. On Thursday night, cherishing a hope that she might encounter him in some of the low saloons in Water-street, which seafaring men frequent, she determined to explore them. Mixing freely with the unruly characters there, she found it necessary to treat them to liquor. An attempt, however, was made to impose upon her liberality, which she resisted, and one of the ruffians made an assault upon her. The discovery of her sex was then made, and created such excitement that the police were attracted by the disorder which the crowd occasioned. The young sailor-girl was taken to the Station-house, where she made a partial statement to the Police Captain, who was favorably impressed with her ingenuous manner, and provided her with good accommodation for the night. Yesterday morning she was arraigned before Justice OSBORN, who lectured her upon the impropriety of her conduct, and informed her that she had been guilty of a misdemeanor, at which she seemed greatly surprised. Miss FOSTER, the matron, made her change her male attire for one more appropriate to her youth and sex, and she is now metamorphosed into a very pretty girl, rather sun-burned, it is true, and having her hair cropped too closely, but withal interesting and womanly. She acknowledges to feeling great restraint in her new garments, but declares she will never discard them again. Her great hope now is to obtain some respectable employment, and doubtless it will soon be found for her.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6ad672cb-64f4-5d7e-80db-41d188260313,1580,nyt://article/6ad672cb-64f4-5d7e-80db-41d188260313

We learn from our correspondents that wheat-cutting has been commenced in Essex, Kent and Devonshire, and that the crop exhibits what may be termed an irregular growth. Nevertheless, the yield, taken as a whole, will, it is thought, come up to the average of most previous years. Upon some of the heavy lands there is less corn to the acre than in 1859, but upon the light soils the produce is fully equal to that period. Of course some of the growers complain of a deficiency; but that portion of the crop now cut will, it is said, come up to quite five quarters to the acre. On some of the Highly cultivated soils between Colchester and Barking Creek, the produce will, it is thought, exceed six quarters, exclusive of the ""tail"" wheats. Throughout Yorkshire the crop is fairly represented even by the farmers themselves, since they admit that ""there is nothing to complain of."" In Cambridgeshire and Suffolk there is quite one-third more wheat than last season; and in Norfolk, especially upon the most sandy soils, the yield is likely to prove very large. The appearance of the crop in Surrey and Berkshire, as well as in most other parts of England, is said to be satisfactory, although it does not promise so heavy a yield as in 1859. For the most part the plants are strong and reedy, and a very small portion of the crop has been beaten down by high winds of heavy rains. So far, therefore, there are fair prospects before us; but we now require fine, dry weather to bring the produce to maturity. Anything short of that would, of course; place the crops in great peril. Hence the anxiety which prevails in all quarters, as to ultimate results, especially as so much damage was sustained last year from the long continuance, of unsually wet weather. As regards barley, the crops, it appears, are everywhere looking remarkably fine; indeed, judging from our reports, in no previous corresponding period was ever witnessed a finer or more healthy crop. In some of the best barley counties, the yield, it is said, will exceed five -- perhaps six -- quarters to the acre, and the entire crop is fully a fortnight earlier than in the ordinary run of years. The same remarks may be applied to oats, which upon many of the most inferior lands appear to promise one of the largest growths ever known. Considering, however, that the quantities annually grown in this country are very limited compared with the consumption, even an increased production can have very little influence upon the extent of our importations from, abroad. With some few exceptions, both beans and peas withstanding that they have grown rapidly, will [???] out heavy crops even in moderately farmed districts.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prospects of the Harvest in Great Britain', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prospects of the Harvest in Great Britain', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, July 26', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Mercantile', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Gazette', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}, {'firstname': 'July', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 3}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e8cd457-dd5b-5760-8b30-1a02e935f52d,1163,nyt://article/3e8cd457-dd5b-5760-8b30-1a02e935f52d

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/11/archives/what-have-we-already-gained.html,,"In the chagrin over the Bull Run affair, we seem to be almost unconscious of the peaceful victories which our cause has recently achieved. In the seceded States there are only about five millions of whites. In the Slave States, including Western Virginia, loyal to Government, there are fully three millions. The South has thus nearly divided itself, numerically as well as geographically, on this very subject of secession. This fact is really conclusive of the contest, whether considered in the light of the moral or material influence it carries. With Kentucky, Missouri, Western Virginia, Maryland and Delaware as a part of the Confederate Government, we should find ourselves in a very different position from that we now occupy. Had Kentucky seceded, she would have added immense strength to the rebellion, by her great wealth, by the abundance of her productions adapted to the subsistence of an Army, and by her geographical position. As it is, united with Western Virginia, of which our forces now hold undisputed possession, the high road to East Tennessee, which is also loyal, is fully opened. East Tennessee is the key of the military operations of the rebels. With this in our possession, the forces now collected at Manasses would break up without a soldier being directed against them. Kentucky against us would be an almost impassible barrier to our arms, extending from the crest of the Alleghanies to the Mississippi. Hence the earnest and constant efforts of MAGOFFIN and his crew, to place the State, when he found he could not carry it out of the Union, in a position of ""armed neutrality,"" to be crossed by neither party. The recent election has put an end to all such wretched subterfuge. Kentucky will now not only offer a free passage across her soil, but will contribute, and liberally, a most gallant soldiery to our Armies.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Have We Already Gained?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Have We Already Gained?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/721747b2-250f-572f-85e6-0ee5c1d18e1f,778,nyt://article/721747b2-250f-572f-85e6-0ee5c1d18e1f

"-- Right-Rev. Samuel Bowman, D.D., Assistant Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Pennsylvania, died suddenly on Saturday last, while on his way from Pittsburgh to Buffalo, whither he was going to discharge official duties. Bishop Bowman was a native of Wilkesbarre, and was born in 1800. He was educated for the Bar, but soon after admission turned his attention to the study of Divinity, and was ordained a Deacon, by Bishop White, in the year 1823. In the following year he was ordained a Priest. Immediately after he was ordained a Deacon, he took charge of St. John's Church, Piqua, Lancaster County. In October, 1825, he became Rector of Trinity Church, Easton, devoting also a portion of his time to an infant congregation at Allentown. In 1828 he was called to St. James' Church, Lancaster, and continued there for thirty years, only giving it up when he was elected Assistant Bishop of Pennsylvania, in 1858.

Although Dr. BOWMAN was voted for by the High Church Party, he has never been regarded as an ultra man. He was consecrated Aug. 25, 1858, so that he filled his sacred office less than three years.

TRUMAN SEYMOUR, of Fort Sumter fame, one of the prominent candidates of the New-York Delegation for a Brigadier Generalship, commenced his public career when about sixteen years of age, as one of the corps who, under the direction and authority of the Legislature, made the geological survey of this State, the results of which are now exhibited in our State Geological Hall at Albany. Young SEYMOUR was very efficient in this service, and made a fine individual collection, which, if we mistake not, he presented to the Albany Medical College, receiving therefor the thanks of the Trustees and Faculty of that Institution. Upon the completion of this work, and mainly through his own indomitable will and perseverance, he was appointed to the West Point Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1846. He soon after entered the Mexican campaign, and on the 19th of April, 1847, was brevetted First Lieutenant for his gallant conduct at the battle of Cerro Gordo, and on the 26th of August of the same year, he received the brevet of captain for like conduct at Contreras and Cherubusco. After the close of the Mexican War he was for some years an instructor at West Point. He served through the last campaign against BILLY BOWLEGS in Florida, visited Europe in 1859 and 1860, and was among the few in the latter year who ascended to the top of Mont Blanc -- his brilliant and thrilling description of which will be remembered by many of our readers. Capt. SEYMOUR, while in Mexico, also made the perilous ascent of Popocatapetl, a mountain whose summit is as rarely reached as that of Mont Blanc. On his return from Europe he repaired, we believe, directly to Fort Moultrie, where, and subsequently at Fort Sumter, his long-suffering and heroism in common with Major ANDERSON's entire command, are as ""household words"" throughout the country. On his release from Sumter, Capt. SEYMOUR's health was considerably impaired, but we believe it has much improved since he has taken the field.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/12/archives/agricultural-and-domestic-hens-nests-sure-remedy-for-eating-eggs.html,,"-- Fowls of all kinds, when laying, like a secret place, where their fellows cannot see them. Therefore, they do not like to squat down in the hennery, surrounded by a greedy flock, that are ready to pounce into the nest, as soon as an egg is layed, and devour it. Therefore, to gratify the hen's secretiveness, and at the same time save the eggs from being devoured by one of the flock my practice has been, for a number of years, to make their nests in nail kegs -- not those that are very small, nor the largest ones -- but of those that will hold about one hundred pounds of nails. In years past, I have been accustomed to fill a keg about half full of straw for a nest; but, the past Winter, I have sawed all the kegs in two equal pats -- knocking out the heads, and then nail a piece of cloth over the large end of each half keg, for a bottom. Any kind of old or new cloth may be tacked on with small trimming tacks. During the Winter, these half kegs are nailed up against the side of the hennery, about four feet from the floor. Hens that lay will soon learn that when they get into these nests, their fellows cannot see them, as they are completely secluded in their cosy little nests; and if they themselves are disposed to eat eggs, they find that, if they attempt it while standing on the edge of the keg, they cannot reach them conveniently; and if they hop down into the nest, and attempt to pick the eggs, they will roll down against their feet, and they soon learn that they are not able to pick hard enough in such a position to break the shell. I find that a cloth bottom is superior to a wooden bottom, covered with a nest of straw. As the weather becomes warmer, so that the hens seek nests in the yard, we make nests in secluded nooks, or the kegs might be removed from the hennery and nailed against the side of the fence, and a little roof made over them.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.; HENS' NESTS SURE REMEDY FOR EATING EGGS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.; HENS' NESTS SURE REMEDY FOR EATING EGGS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31afe89f-04ef-531d-ba28-c1e5477aa955,1436,nyt://article/31afe89f-04ef-531d-ba28-c1e5477aa955

Though to-morrow's telegraph may meek to-day's prediction, we do not hesitate to answer in the affirmative. What authorises us to speak thus is precisely the famous battle which is always going to but never does take place. We Europeans who enjoy the enviable happiness of having two million professional soldiers, are inclined to despise the American Volunteers, because they do not immediately fly at each other's throats. But if they do not fight, do not imagine it is because they fear death. A Western pioneer exposes his life, perhaps, as many times in the course of the year as the bravest European soldier. * * * But in proportion as the situation develops, the clearer becomes one fact of which the South had not dreamed, namely: That the war is useless; and another fact, still more singular, which the North will be obliged to confess before long, viz.: That war is all but impossible. They do not fight, in fact, because they do not know how to begin the conflict. Neither Army is organized for a long campaign; the spaces necessary to be occupied on each side are immense; and hardly could the most ingenious tacticians of Europe, having at their disposal old troops, be prepared to concentrate in masses, as wanted, or to spread themselves over the face of a country in a multitude of platoons -- hardly could they solve the problem of occupying so vast a field of operations. If the Anti-President of the South, (we must say, under the circumstances, Anti-President, as they used to say Anti-Pope in the Middle Ages,) if the Anti-President of the South, JEFF. DAVIS, had been able to carry out his first plan -- to inundate Virginia with troops, take possession of Washington by a rapid march, there proclaim himself sole legitimate President of the whole Confederation, drag into Congress the hesitating and the neutral, frighten the timid, and thus impose on the North, by quasi-legal means, the principle of the unlimited extension of Slavery -- a short campaign of that sort might have been of some service to the South. Now that the plan has failed, what can be the result of the war? If the slaveholding South succeeds in breaking up the Union, it will have created by its side a separate State which will be an open asylum for all fugitive slaves. If the North collects an Army sufficiently formidable to invade the South, and conquer it, the Union, at least in its present form, becomes dissolved by the very fact of victory; the most subtle imagination fails to conceive of a National system in which one-half of the federated States belongs, against its will, to a league, and at the same time remains free.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'French Views of American Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'French Views of American Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Paris Journal des Debats, July 28', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'July', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/442dc038-db1c-5548-ba9a-e774c8ba0a25,921,nyt://article/442dc038-db1c-5548-ba9a-e774c8ba0a25

The injured man, with a number of seamen, was drinking on Sunday night, at a porter-house kept by JAMES SMITH, at No. 346 Water-street. Finally, most of them became drunk, and a fight resulted, during which knives were drawn. One of the sailors, a man named AUGUSTIN BARCO, engaged WILLIAMS and wounded him in the side and abdomen with a sheath knife, cutting him so severely, that his liver was injured and his intestines came out. The ruffian next attempted to stab some of the others, but he only managed to cut one GEORGE JOHNSON slightly in the breast, after which he fled from the premises. He was not long at liberty, however, as Officer CRAIG of the Fourth Ward found him. He admitted that he had injured the sufferers, and yesterday Justice OSBORN committed him to prison.

This report caused great dissatisfaction among all adopted citizens, as we might have expected; for they are not only as a general thing devotedly patriotic, but already, in the present war, have shown praiseworthy alacrity in responding to the call of the Government for troops, and distinguished prowess on every battle-field. SIEGEL and ROSECRANS have won laurels as fadeless in the cause of the Union, as any soldiers who have a better acquaintance with English as their mother tongue; and their countrymen, and indeed all adopted citizens, regarded the Government order as a gratuitous and most mischievous insult upon their brilliant generalship and invaluable services.Explanations were immediately sent out by the Secretary of War, that the order had been wholly misunderstood - that it was not to disallow the enlistment of the foreign-born who could not speak English, - but only to decline their enlistment in companies that had officers speaking the English language only. The reason was given that they could not understand orders given them in English by their officers, and so could not be perfected in drill, nor understand orders given in presence of an enemy.

During the day the gale increased in violence, and the rain descended in continuous floods. There was some damage done to fruit and ornamental trees, and the fields of corn on Long Island and elsewhere were considerably prostrated by the force of the gale. The encampments near the City suffered more or less from the descending floods, and on Hiker's island, which was exposed to the full force of the northeast gale, the soldiers were pretty thoroughly drenched. It required great exertion to prevent the tents from being blown away. The tide rose to high that the outbuildings ranged around the shore were submerged, and wholly beyond reach for two or three hours. On the South Brother, where there is a small encampment, the tide covered about half the island, and also put their small buildings twenty or thirty yards out of reach in the water.

But do these definitions convey either a clear or a just notion of the qualities which they are intended to express? If the Chevalier BAYARD had lacked courage to face the danger which MGNS. BLONDIN gaily braved every time he walked upon that rope that trembled, with, the roar of Niagara; if RICHARD the Lion-hearted had shrunk from the midnight work which the resurrection-man performs with as much indifference as if he were digging ditches in broad daylight; if the woman who will go through fire and water for her child, swoons upon a giddy height, or shrieks at the sight of vermin; if the sailor who in black darkness furls the sail upon the slippery yard, that now dips in the ocean and now sweeps up to heaven, is palsied with terror on the back of a restive horse, do we call them cowards?

From the evidence of eye-witnesses to the fatal affray, it appeals that the deceased, the prisoner, and several of their companions, all of whom were sailors, met at a sailors' boarding-house, kept by a man named JAMES SMITH. They had all been drinking, deceaced was very much intoxicated, and the prisoner somewhat so, but not to that extent to incapacitate him for talking intelligibly, or prevent him from knowing what he was about. Deceased at length becoming offended at some remark, began calling his companions by foul and abusive names. The prisoner at once stepped up to deceased and inquired if thesefoul epithets were applied to him personally. The deceased replied in the affirmative, and at the same time expressed a desire to fight with BARCO, placing himself on the instant in an attitude of defence. At this point the proprietor of the house interfered, and told them to leave his house if they were going to fight. The whole party thereupon left the house and proceeded to the sidewalk, immediately upon reaching which the deceased struck the prisoner upon the neck a powerful blow with his fist, which brought him to the pavement. BARCO soon regained his feet, at once drew a dirk-knife, rushed frantically forward, and despite the efforts of two or three bystanders to prevent it, he plunged the dirt to the hilt into the abdomen of deceased, inflicting a ghastly and mortal wound, through which the intestines of the unfortunate man prodruded to the extent of thirty-six inches, as testified to by Dr. JAMES L. LITTLE, who made the post-mortem examination. BARCO immediately fled, pursued by GEORGE CHAMBERLAIN, one of the witnesses, but was unable to effect his arrest unaided, owing to the fact that the prisoner made an attempt to stab him, and threatened to kill him if he followed further. CHAMBERLAIN therefore abandoned the pursuit, and gave the Fourth Ward Police a description of him, which enabled Officer CRAIG after to take him into custody. The injured man was taken to the Hospital, where he died the next day. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the above facts, and the prisoner was thereupon committed to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury. He says he is a native of Spain, thirty-four years old, and denies having perpetrated the deed. The deceased was a native of Greece, and twenty-four years of age. The principal witnesses were sent to the House of Detention.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bee918b4-f4c6-56b3-bd04-c81765e37f60,740,nyt://article/bee918b4-f4c6-56b3-bd04-c81765e37f60

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/14/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"A dispatch from St. Louis, published in the evening papers yesterday, announced the defeat of the National Army at Springfield, Missouri, and the death of Gen. LYON. The information was first received in St. Louis by the Secessionists, on Monday evening, through a special courier from the vicinity of the battle, who rode several horses to death in his haste to be before the Government courier with the news. Gen. FREMONT, however, is stated to have received his dispatches about midnight. The rebel reports announced the total rout of the National Army; but the dispatches of Gen. FREMONT simply announced an engagement, with severe loss on both sides, the death of Gen. LYON, and the retirement of the National forces towards Rolla in good order, under the command of Gen. SIEGEL. Still later dispatches, however, turn the National defeat into a most glorious victory, although the report of the death of Gen. LYON is confirmed. The engagement took place on the 10th inst. The National forces, in three columns, under the command respectively of Generals LYON, SIEGEL and STURGES, made the attack at 6 o'clock in the morning, at a place nine miles southeast of Springfield. The enemy, according to the muster rolls captured on the field, numbered twenty-three thousand, including regiments from Louisiana and Tennessee, with Texas Bangers and Cherokee half-breeds, while our forces were but eight thousand strong, including some two thousand Home Guards. Gen. LYON fired the first gun, when the engagement immediately became general. After two or three hours' severe cannonading, the execution done by Capt. TOTTEN's Artillery proved too much for the enemy, and they commenced to fall back, when the National cavalry, posted on the enemy's left, and Gen. SIEGEL's artillery on the right, commenced a terrific onslaught, which spread slaughter and dismay in the rebel ranks. They were pursued to their camps, and shells from TOTTEN's artillery set fire to their tents and baggage, and completely destroyed them. The rebel Gens. McCULLOCH and PRICK were both killed. Gen.

In Martinsburgh, it is said, the Union troops found a few Union men; but in Charlestown, none at all -- not a living soul that avowed any love for the old flag, or any desire for the restoration of the Union. The ladies, even, forgot the proprieties of life and the decencies of the sex, in insulting officers, who treated them, however, always with marked consideration and politeness. The women would walk far around the flag-staff on which the Stars and Stripes were raised, in order, as they said, not to be dishonored by its shadow. They refused, in most cases, to sell to the troops the commonest necessaries of life; and poisoned two soldiers and attempted it on others. When they sold at all, they asked extortionate prices -- ""twenty-five and fifty cents a loaf for bread;"" and such price for other edibles as to put them ""virtually beyond the reach of all but officers;"" and this too at a time when the soldiers were ""absolutely suffering from hunger.""

We learn that the negotiations between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Banks may be regarded as mainly concluded. The arrangement is substantially that set forth in the TIMES of yesterday. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/the-new-government-loan.html,,"We learn that the negotiations between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Banks may be regarded as mainly concluded. The arrangement is substantially that set forth in the TIMES of yesterday. The Banks of New-York, Boston, and Phildelphia take at once, $50,000,000 of the 7 3-10 Government Bonds, with the privilege of taking an equal sum on the 15th of October; and a further equal sum on the 15th of December; no other Government Stocks or Bonds, excepting those payable on demand, to be negotiated or paid out until February 1, 1862, should the Banks conclude to take the whole amount named, the Government reserving the right to avail itself of a National loan or a loan in Europe. The details are not fully perfected, but these will not interfere with the consummation of the great event, which is by far the most important that has taken place since the outbreak. In effect, it pledges the entire capital of the country to the support of its military strength, and must, in the mind of every impartial person, be regarded as determining the result of the contest. It will everywhere carry conviction of success. There may be some hard fighting yet; but 5,000,000 people without means, without commerce, and without mechanical skill, cannot long resist 22,000,000, possessing abundant resources, the command of the sea, with the ability to supply themselves with the most approved weapons of warfare, and an abundant commissariat. Indifferent observers cannot resist the conclusion that, in the end, victory will remain on the side of the most numerous battalions, no matter what the reverses we sustain in the outset. The South, for years, have been preparing for the contest; the North only as many months. This gives them a temporary advantage, which in a few weeks more will be completely neutralized. Man for man, the North have shown themselves fully equal, to the South. As we can put five soldiers into the field to one on their part, our people hereafter will entertain no anxiety as to the final result. The action of the Banks will accomplish a vast good in a moral point of view, both at home and in Europe. It will be regarded as full proof of the loyally of our people. It will revive the sentiment of nationality, somewhat confused and shaken by recent events. It will strengthen the feeling that we still belong to one great family. It will place us on a height the Confederates can never reach. It shows that we are able to carry on the war with solid capital, and not compelled to resort to notes of insolvent Banks, or to the Quixotic scheme of Government taking to itself the entire crops and products of the people, to find a market for them if it can, and, if it cannot, to be without available means altogether. There is no doubt that the condition of the South is already well nigh desperate, and that fear and frenzy alone keeps up their organization. We profess to be contending for a principle; but if, with our vast superiority of numbers, we were in the position of the South with respect to means -- if our Banks were without specie -- if we were cut off from the sea, and if our Secretary of the Treasury, on visiting New-York for money, had been compelled to return penniless -- we should give over the contest as hopeless, however much it might mortify our pride or destroy the hopes we had entertained of our future career. The South are really in worse condition in respect to their finances than we can picture to ourselves. Time will soon begin to tell with fearful effect upon their organization. An Army must be regularly paid and fed, or it will not long remain an Army. It will one day tumble to pieces like a rope of sand. We shall then begin to wonder that such an inevitable event was not more clearly foreseen. The conduct of Mr. STEPHENS, Vice-President of the Confederation, in wandering about from county to county, soliciting contributions to the rebellion in whatever the planters and farmers raise, is enough to show that it is on its last legs. That such contributions are solicited proves that the rebels have no money.

"On the evening of August 1, Mr. JOHN BRIGHT spoke in Rochdale on behalf of Mr. CHEETHAM, the Liberal candidate for Parliament. His speech is reported in the Manchester Guardian. In the course of it he said: Without complimenting Mr. CHEETHAM, I can tell you that he is a most active -- I believe the most active -- member of an association formed in this district for the purpose of promoting a better supply of cotton, not from India alone, but from all parts of the world where cotton can be grown, and although perhaps it would be too much to say that that association had been able to produce any great results, because so short a time has elapsed since its operations began, yet it has now sown the seed as it were of a production of cotton in very many parts of the world, where that production probably would never have been heard of, or thought of, if it had not been for the labors of that association. With regard to the supply from India, I may tell you this, that there is no man from Lancashire of late who has been more assiduous in his attendance in London whenever anything was to be done with the Minister from India, or with the House of Commons, with the view to promote the opening of the industry of that vast country, so as to increase the production and export of cotton to this country. I think that, just now, if you can find a man who on questions of great State policy agrees with us, at the same time having a deep personal interest in this great cotton question, and having paid so much attention to it as Mr. CHEETHAM has, I think there is double resson why he should receive the votes and have the confidence of this division of the county. [Cheers.] Now, is this cotton question a great question, or not? I met a spinner to-day, -- he does not live in Rochdale, though I met him here, -- and I asked him what he thought about it; and he said, ""Well, I think cotton will come somehow."" [Laughter.] And, I find that there is that kind of answer to be had from three out of four of all the spinners you ask. They know that in past times, when cotton has risen 50 or 80 per cent., or some extravagant rise, something has come -- the rate of interest was raised, or there has been a commercial panic from some cause or other, and down the price has gone, and when everybody said ""There would be no cotton at Christmas,"" there proved a very considerable stock at Christmas. And so they say now. I don't in the least deny that it will be so; all I assert is, that this particular case is new; that we have never had a war in the United States between different sections of that country, affecting the production of cotton before; and it is not fair nor wise, but rather childish than otherwise, to argue from past events, which were not a bit like this, of the event which is now passing before our eyes. They say, ""It is quite true there is a civil war in America, but it will blow over: there will be a compromise, or the English Government will break the blockade."" Now, recollect what breaking the blockade means. It means a war with the United States; and I don't think, myself, that it would be cheap to break the blockade, at the cost of a war with the United States. I think that the cost of a war with the United States would give, probably, half wages, for a very considerable time, to those persons in Lancashire who would be out of work if there was no cotton, to say nothing at all of the manifest injustice and wrong against all international law, that a legal and effective blockade should be interfered with by another country. It is not exactly the business of this meeting, but my opinion is, that the safety of the products on which this country depends rests far more on the success of the Washington Government than upon its failure; and I believe nothing could be more monstrous than for us, who are not very averse to war ourselves, to set up for critics -- carping, cavilling critics -- of what the Washington Government is doing. I saw a letter the other day from an Englishman, resident for twenty-five years in Philadelphia, a merchant there, and a very prosperous merchant. He said, ""I prefer the institutions of this country (the United States) very much to yours in England;"" but he says also, ""If it be once admitted that here we have no country and no government, but that any portion of these United States can break off from the central Government whenever it pleases, then it is time for me to pack up what I have, and to go somewhere where there is a country and a government."" Well, that is the pith of this question. Do you suppose that if Lancashire and Yorkshire thought that they would break off from the United Kingdom that those newspapers who are now preaching every kind of moderation to the Government of Washington would advise the Government in London to allow these two counties to set up a special Government for themselves? When the people of Ireland asked that they should secede, was it proposed in London that they should be allowed to secede peaceably? Nothing of the kind. I am not going to defend what is taking place in a country that is well able to defend itself. But I advise you, and I advise the people of England, to abstain from applying to the United States doctrines and principles which we never apply to our own case. At any rate, they have never fought for ""the balance of power"" in Europe. They have never fought to keep up a decaying Empire. They have never squandered the money of their people in such phantom expeditions as we have been engaged in. And now at this moment, when you are told that they are going to be ruined by their vast expenditure, why the sum that they are going to raise in the great emergency of this grievous war is no greater than what we raise every year during a time of peace. [Loud cheers.] They say that they are not going to liberate slaves. No; the object of the Washington Government is to maintain their own Constitution, and to act legally, as it permits and requires. No man is more in favor of peace than I am; no man has denounced war more than I have, probably, in this country; few men, in their public life, have suffered more obloquy -- I had almost said, more indignity -- in consequence of it. But I cannot, for the life of me see, upon any of those principles upon which States are governed now -- I say nothing of the literal word of the New Testament -- I cannot see how the state of affairs in America, with regard to the United States Government, could have been different from what it is this moment. We had a heptarchy in this country, and it was thought to be a good thing to get rid of it, and to have a united nation. If the 33 or 34 States of the American Union can break off whenever they like, can see nothing but disaster and confusion throughout the whole of that continent. I say that the war, be it successful or not, be it Christian or not, be it wise or not, is a war to sustain the Government and to sustain the authority of a great nation; and that the people of England, if they are true to their own sympathies, to their own history, and to their own great Act of 1834, to which reference has already been made, will have no sympathy for those who wish to build up a great Empire on the perpetual bondage of millions of their fellow men. [Loud cheers.]",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/american-topics-abroad-mr-john-bright-on-our-troubles-and-the.html,,"On the evening of August 1, Mr. JOHN BRIGHT spoke in Rochdale on behalf of Mr. CHEETHAM, the Liberal candidate for Parliament. His speech is reported in the Manchester Guardian. In the course of it he said: Without complimenting Mr. CHEETHAM, I can tell you that he is a most active -- I believe the most active -- member of an association formed in this district for the purpose of promoting a better supply of cotton, not from India alone, but from all parts of the world where cotton can be grown, and although perhaps it would be too much to say that that association had been able to produce any great results, because so short a time has elapsed since its operations began, yet it has now sown the seed as it were of a production of cotton in very many parts of the world, where that production probably would never have been heard of, or thought of, if it had not been for the labors of that association. With regard to the supply from India, I may tell you this, that there is no man from Lancashire of late who has been more assiduous in his attendance in London whenever anything was to be done with the Minister from India, or with the House of Commons, with the view to promote the opening of the industry of that vast country, so as to increase the production and export of cotton to this country. I think that, just now, if you can find a man who on questions of great State policy agrees with us, at the same time having a deep personal interest in this great cotton question, and having paid so much attention to it as Mr. CHEETHAM has, I think there is double resson why he should receive the votes and have the confidence of this division of the county. [Cheers.] Now, is this cotton question a great question, or not? I met a spinner to-day, -- he does not live in Rochdale, though I met him here, -- and I asked him what he thought about it; and he said, ""Well, I think cotton will come somehow."" [Laughter.] And, I find that there is that kind of answer to be had from three out of four of all the spinners you ask. They know that in past times, when cotton has risen 50 or 80 per cent., or some extravagant rise, something has come -- the rate of interest was raised, or there has been a commercial panic from some cause or other, and down the price has gone, and when everybody said ""There would be no cotton at Christmas,"" there proved a very considerable stock at Christmas. And so they say now. I don't in the least deny that it will be so; all I assert is, that this particular case is new; that we have never had a war in the United States between different sections of that country, affecting the production of cotton before; and it is not fair nor wise, but rather childish than otherwise, to argue from past events, which were not a bit like this, of the event which is now passing before our eyes. They say, ""It is quite true there is a civil war in America, but it will blow over: there will be a compromise, or the English Government will break the blockade."" Now, recollect what breaking the blockade means. It means a war with the United States; and I don't think, myself, that it would be cheap to break the blockade, at the cost of a war with the United States. I think that the cost of a war with the United States would give, probably, half wages, for a very considerable time, to those persons in Lancashire who would be out of work if there was no cotton, to say nothing at all of the manifest injustice and wrong against all international law, that a legal and effective blockade should be interfered with by another country. It is not exactly the business of this meeting, but my opinion is, that the safety of the products on which this country depends rests far more on the success of the Washington Government than upon its failure; and I believe nothing could be more monstrous than for us, who are not very averse to war ourselves, to set up for critics -- carping, cavilling critics -- of what the Washington Government is doing. I saw a letter the other day from an Englishman, resident for twenty-five years in Philadelphia, a merchant there, and a very prosperous merchant. He said, ""I prefer the institutions of this country (the United States) very much to yours in England;"" but he says also, ""If it be once admitted that here we have no country and no government, but that any portion of these United States can break off from the central Government whenever it pleases, then it is time for me to pack up what I have, and to go somewhere where there is a country and a government."" Well, that is the pith of this question. Do you suppose that if Lancashire and Yorkshire thought that they would break off from the United Kingdom that those newspapers who are now preaching every kind of moderation to the Government of Washington would advise the Government in London to allow these two counties to set up a special Government for themselves? When the people of Ireland asked that they should secede, was it proposed in London that they should be allowed to secede peaceably? Nothing of the kind. I am not going to defend what is taking place in a country that is well able to defend itself. But I advise you, and I advise the people of England, to abstain from applying to the United States doctrines and principles which we never apply to our own case. At any rate, they have never fought for ""the balance of power"" in Europe. They have never fought to keep up a decaying Empire. They have never squandered the money of their people in such phantom expeditions as we have been engaged in. And now at this moment, when you are told that they are going to be ruined by their vast expenditure, why the sum that they are going to raise in the great emergency of this grievous war is no greater than what we raise every year during a time of peace. [Loud cheers.] They say that they are not going to liberate slaves. No; the object of the Washington Government is to maintain their own Constitution, and to act legally, as it permits and requires. No man is more in favor of peace than I am; no man has denounced war more than I have, probably, in this country; few men, in their public life, have suffered more obloquy -- I had almost said, more indignity -- in consequence of it. But I cannot, for the life of me see, upon any of those principles upon which States are governed now -- I say nothing of the literal word of the New Testament -- I cannot see how the state of affairs in America, with regard to the United States Government, could have been different from what it is this moment. We had a heptarchy in this country, and it was thought to be a good thing to get rid of it, and to have a united nation.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/affairs-in-the-united-states-prospects-of-the-war-a-manchester-view.html,,"Work, and not display, is now the order of things in the United States. The real business of war has begun, and men have already forgotten the phase of speech-making and flag-waving, of calls for universal sympathy, and anger at not obtaining it. It is a relief to find that the captious- ness and irritability with regard to this country which marked the first weeks of the war have almost passed away. The course taken by the British Government is now recognized as most just and fitting, and even the comments of British society are taken in good part. The Northerners seem at last to understand that when two adverse communities are in arms, sympathy with the one involves antipathy to the other. When an Army enters a hostile territory to conquer its defenders and coerce its inhabitants, it is impossible to desire the success of the invaders without desiring the defeat of the invaded. Now, we, having no quarrel with the people of the Confederate States, did not think it our duty to cheer on their enemies. In any misfortune caused by famine, or pestilence, or fire, or even barbarous foes like the Indians of the frontier, any American community would have the sympathy of Englishmen; but, as the North now tacitly acknowledges, any display of partnership on our part against the South would have been most ungenerous and offensive. The change in feeling, however, which has evidently taken place is due less to reflection on the matter itself than to the absorption of men's thoughts by more earnest business. In the first days of the war, as in the first days of all wars, there was nothing but excitement and speculation, enthusiasm and apprehension. It was a time of vague passion, which had not yet been concentrated into energy. All public uprisings, too, have in them something of vanity and display. When the young fashionables or the sober lawyers and merchants volunteer to march off anywhere for the defence of their country there is a consciousness of doing something fine, which, if not rewarded by immediate admiration, is apt to grow irritable. The mind's eye of Fifth-avenue turned to England while cleaning its rifles and buying its red shirts for the war. But this amateur spirit has been soon exhausted. A stronger purpose and a stricter organization have succeeded as the war has advanced. It is the usual, the necessary course -- from popular enthusiasm to military discipline, from the more refined to the coarser material of armies, from gentlemen who serve gratuitously to well-paid farm laborers, mechanics and navvies; from volunteers for three months to soldiers for five years -- in short, from a militia almost purely American, to a standing army in which Irishmen and Germans are counted by thousands.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AFFAIRS IN THE UNITED STATES PROSPECTS OF THE WAR.; A MANCHESTER VIEW.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The battle which took place near Springfield, Mo., on Saturday, appears to have been even more hotly contested than that of Bull Run. Viewed in a military light, it may be considered a drawn battle; but taking into consideration the great disparity of forces, it may well be considered a great victory for the National arms. Gen. LYON, it seems, was led to take the initiative by apparently authentic reports that heavy reinforcements under Gen. HARDEE were on their way to join the rebel forces under MCCULLOCH. Our Army marched out of Springfield on Friday evening, only fifty-five hundred strong -- the Home Guards remaining behind -- and rested on the prairie during a portion of the night. About sunrise on Saturday morning the enemy's outposts were driven in, and soon after the action became general. The main attack was made in two columns, led by Gens. LYON and STURGES, while Gen. SIEGEL had a flanking force of about a thousand men, with four pieces of artillery, on the south of the the enemy's camp. During the battle, which raged from sunrise until past one o'clock in the afternoon, three distinct charges were made by the rebels upon Capt. POTTER's Battery, but each time they were repulsed with terrible slaughter. Gen. LYON, it appears, fell early in the day, at the head of a Kansas regiment which he was leading on a charge - its Colonel having been disabled. The enemy at last was thrown into disorder, and commenced retreating, but our forces were so badly cut up that it was not deemed prudent to pursue. Gen. SIRGEL lost three of his guns, but spiked them and destroyed the carriages before he left them. Our loss is variously estimated at from one hundred and fifty to three hundred killed, and several hundred wounded; while that of the enemy is placed at least two thousand killed and wounded. They also lost, as before stated, all their tents and camp equipage, and about one hundred horses. Gen. PRICE was not killed, as stated in the first dispatches, and there appears to be some doubt about the death of MCCULLOCH. The rebels made no attempt to follow our forces on their retirement from Springfield, and it was considered probable that Gen. SIEGEL would not fall back further than Lebanon, where he would await reinforcements.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4712c4b-78a8-5d2c-8b5b-dcc617655ddd,1416,nyt://article/c4712c4b-78a8-5d2c-8b5b-dcc617655ddd

"BARNUM's MUSEUM. -- Mr. BARNUM has got a hippopotamus, and a Nubian keeper who speaks English with an Oriental accent. About the hippopotamus there is no sort of doubt, and we would be the last to cast a shadow of a suspicion upon the child of the Sun who looks after so distinguished a visitor for us. When the first, hippopotamus was taken to England the fashionable world there was moved to its centre. He was regarded as a rival of the Duke of Buckingham, and by the aflability of his manners and his readiness to dine with every one who asked him, did in point of fact supersede that lamented nobleman. The Duke had to fall back on turtle-soup and corporation dinners, and a sphere of action where a respectable hippopotamus with any sense of caste could not be expected to shine. But as a promiscuous gobbler his career was ended. Mr. BARNUM's hippopotamus is young. This, indeed, is his first season. He is bashful, like many another young swell, and retires into obscure corners, until he is wanted in the refreshment room. Offer him something to eat and he is seen to advantage. He will open his mouth for you to an extent that is truly appalling in these hard times. You can drop in a cob of corn, as if you were posting a letter, and see him chew it somewhere deep down in his throat, where his masticators appear to be located. A word from the keeper will send him diving in the water, where he seems well content to remain, until compelled to come to the surface for a breath of fresh air. On these occasions, his amiable face presents the appearance of a block of gutta percha on which some 'prentice hand had vainly endeavored to depict the countenance of a calf. In point of size, Mr. BARNUM's hippopotamus does not compare with the specimen in London, but its huge proportions will not fail to strike the visitor even now. In a few years he will get over the disadvantage of comparison with his European brethren. Every one has an idea of what a hippopotamus is like. Look at a cow, or a mammoth hog, through a very knotty pane of glass, where the best features are sure to be exaggerated, and you get a notion of our friend. He has a tail without a kink in it, but otherwise porcine, and by its symmetry perfectly distracting to the mind of a well-regulated dog. Take him for all in all, we doubt if we shall ever look upon his like again. Decidedly, Mr. BARNUM has the greatest novelty, and most valuable curiosity in the country. No one should miss the opportunity of seeing the hippopotamus.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/15/archives/general-city-news-arrest-of-a-gang-of-counterfeiters-vessels-in.html,,"BARNUM's MUSEUM. -- Mr. BARNUM has got a hippopotamus, and a Nubian keeper who speaks English with an Oriental accent.

Judge STORY says that ""a Constitution of Goverment is addressed to the common sense of the people, and never was designed for trials of logical skill or visionary speculation;"" and the great body of the people can only look upon the proceedings of the Government to crush out the great conspiracy as a common sense movement, special pleading to the contrary notwithstanding. As the Constitution provides no means for the destruction of the Government, it is but common sense to suppose that it is constitutional to use every effort to preserve it. These Constitutional sticklers have thrown up their hands and rolled their eyes in perfect horror at the impudence of President LINCOLN in asking Congress to sanction such of his acts as he deemed necessary for the preservation of the Government, forgetting that he but followed the example set by JEFFERSON, who deemed it for the common interest of the nation to purchase Louisiana, in face of the fact that there were no provisions in the Constitution for the acquisition of foreign territory; but, unlike JEFFERSON, he was not afraid to have his acts fully discussed. JEFFERSON said, to his friends, ""that it will be desirable for Congress to do what is necessary in silence. Whatever Congress shall think necessary to do should be done with as little debate as possible, and particularly so far as respects the Constitutional difficulty.""

"In yesterday's issue we announced the death of NOAH L. FARNHAM, Colonel of the Fire Zouaves. Col. FARNHAM was born in New-Haven, Conn., on the 6th of June, 1829. He enjoyed excellent educational advantages, which he faithfully improved, and at the age of sixteen, received a situation in the mercantile house of Messrs. S.M. BECKLEY & CO., recently the firm of CLAPP, BENT & BECKLEY. He found the confinement of the counter exceedingly irksome, as he possessed a remarkably vigorous constitution, and his tastes impelled him to seek the activity which his occupation did not afford in the ranks of the City Guard, at that time the crack corps of the City.

Although the transaction is unprecedented in amount, it is a small affair, considering the ability of the parties furnishing the money. These are really the capitalists and property holders of the loyal States; the Banks acting as their agents. If the latter chose, however, they could readily take and hold, on their own account, the first $50,000,000; at least till a renewal of business should again create the ordinary demand for their money. The capital of the Banks in the loyal States amounts to $329,831,896. They hold very nearly, if not quite, $100,000,-000 in specle, which is twice the ordinary average. Their deposits, not drawing interest, according to the latest reports to the Secretary of the Treasury, are $207,388,618. These are liabilities to be sure, but they are so much capital available for the war. The deposits in the Savings Banks of the State of New-York are $67,450,397; of Massachusetts, $45,654,584; of Rhode Island, $7,765,771; of Connecticut, $20,161,942 - the aggregate for the four States being $141,378,110. This vast sum is solid capital, a great portion of it being invested in securities immediately convertible into coin. It is probable that the deposits in all the Savings Banks in the loyal States will reach very nearly $200,000,006, making the total deposits in banks and savings and discounts fully $400,000,000.

Whelly devoted to the cause of our country, we earnestly desire and anxiously labor and pray for it success in the pending war. Nevertheless, we can only mourn over the slaughter of our countrymen. The loss of life, which is reported as immense on both sides, is cause for deep and poignant grief to hundreds and thousands of our people. For one alone of those who fell in battle, St. Louis will mourn, Missouri will mourn, and the nation will mourn. Of course, we allude to Brig.-Gen. LYON. He was a man of commanding intellect, of distinguished scientific, and literary attainments, and a polished soldier. To no one man in this war does Missouri and the National Union owe a larger debt of gratitude than to Gen. LYON. It was our good fortune that he was ordered to service at the St. Louis Arsenal in these difficulties. He came to St. Louis when the whole force at this post did not exceed, if we emember rightly, 380 men. Reinforcements were sought, but were not procured. It was with this small garrison that he was to defend the Arsenal and protect the public property here from an overwhelming body of the enemy, then organized and armed in this city, known as the ""Constitutional Guards,"" Minute Men,"" and a large portion of another body denominated ""Frost's Brigade."" And well did he perform his delicate and painful task. How bravely did he enter upon the work with his little body of men -- who does not remember, that could gain admission to the Arsenal in those days, how his cannon and his earthworks were made to coyer the assailable, points -- how his sand bags were distributed to protect his sentries on the rally, and with what desperate resolution he had mined the very buildings over his head determined in the dernier resort to blow them into atoms, and perhaps to perish amid their ruins. It was well understood that an assault upon the St. Louis Arsenal, with the forlorn hope that then constituted its little garrison, would be no idle business. The assault was not made. The known soldierly skill and valor of Capt. LYON deterred the enemy. It was while he was defending the Arsenal in this way, and dealing with the ""Minute Men"" and the ""Police Commissioners of St. Louis, who once ordered his patrols inside the arsenal walls, and placed their sentries over the arsenal gates, that Capt. LYON became satisfied that the Secessionists of Missouri were fatally bent upon war, and would never yield their purpose until they were utterly prostrated by the power of war. Sooner than others, he saw and understood the object of Camp Jackson, and seeing and understanding, did not hesitate to crush in embryo that incipient secession Army.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WORK ACCOMPLISHED BY GEN.

His absence gave rise to the most serious apprehensions, and strenuous efforts were made to ascertain his where-abouts, without success. Finally a note was received by one of his daughters, informing her that her immediate presence was desired at a house in the lower part of the city. She repaired there, in company with a servant, and was informed that her father was there, and was very sick. She desired to see him, but was told that she could not. The servant who accompanied her insisted upon the daughter's right to see her father, which led to a quarrel between her and the occupant of the promises, a widow, and she was driven from the door. Taking refuge behind a carriage, a stone was thrown at her, which smashed one of the carriage Windows. The daughter soon after left, her request to see her father being refused to the last. Proceedings were then commenced before Recorder ENUE against the widow, in which she was charged with assault and battery and malicious mischief. After the hearing, the accused was informed by the Recorder that the daughter had a right to see her father, and that she must be permitted to visit him, or legal steps would be taken to compel his production in court. The widow finally consented, and the family physician and one of the Recorder's officers accompanied the daughter. The father was found in a chamber, almost unable to speak from paralysis, one side being entirely paralyzed. The widow said that, soon after his reaching the house, he complained of diarrhoea, and she had given him a glass of lavender brandy; that as he drank it he was deprived of speech, and she called in her family physician, who had attended him. She objected to his removal, but he gave his daughter to understand that he desired it, and he was conveyed to his residence. Yesterday he was better, and hopes were entertained of his recovery.

"Death yesterday cut off in Lord HERBERT one whom nature had intended for a Prime Minister. It is quite certain, that had he lived, he would before long have attained that honor, if not by virtue of extraordinary intellectual qualities, yet by force of character, by charm of manner, and by aptitude for business. He was one of the most winning statesmen of his time, and, by aid of a great social faculty, rose above men who were on other grounds superior to him. What was most remarkable in him was his anxiety to do everything well. His labors were unceasing; he never spared himself; he gave up life and luxury for toil and trouble; and if he did not die in harness, it was in harness that he earned his death. It was not merely in the fulfillment of duty that he was thus self-sacricing; he was equally unsparing of himself in the discharge of those social observances which men usually bend to the convenience or humor of the moment. With great manliness of character there was curiously intermingled an extraordinary desire to please. He studied and strove to please, and heightened by all the arts of style the natural attractiveness of his character. He had in his favor every social advantage -- high birth, a great estate, a happy home, a handsome person, irresistible manners, many accomplishments, a ready address. He made the most of all this, so that his good nature seemed to be always overflowing, his frankness to be always unbounded, and his power of pleasing to be always undivided. So he won upon all comers, and won most upon those who knew him best. Men would give up to SIDNEY HERBERT what they would grant to no one else. He inspired no jealousy; for his superiority was less the result of brilliant parts than of that indefinable charm from which there is no appeal. Add his power of work and of public speaking to his rare power of making friends, and you have the possible Prime Minister. That power, and love of work, we grieve to say, has killed him, as it has killed many another statesman, before his time. He gave up the enjoyments of wealth and a brilliant home for the great game of politics, and has been known to pass a whole summer and autumn in London with only perhaps a day and a night at Wilton. He drove a good constitution too hard, and at Christmas last began to feel that sentence of death had been passed upon him. There is some reason to think that even then, had he given up all work, he might have recovered. All that he did was to leave the House of Commons and to try the comparative repose of the Peerage, still retaining his office, as Minister for War. The consequence has been fatal. He dies of overwork at the age of 51 -- a great loss to society, a still greater loss to his party.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/18/archives/death-of-lord-herbert.html,,"Death yesterday cut off in Lord HERBERT one whom nature had intended for a Prime Minister.

It is now easy to see the manner in which the rebels have, from the onset, been led on from one step to another, and the necessities that forced them to make the border States the seat of the war. Secession would never have been ventured upon, but for the belief that the North would be incapable of any aggressive movement, from internal divisions, and that, in case of War, it could be easily overrun by the South. This idea was entertained by many of the most prominent leaders of the Democratic Party, who constantly proclaimed that they would never tolerate any coercive movement, no matter the lengths to which the South might go. Mr. CUSHING publicly proclaimed, both in letters and speeches, that if there was to be any war, it was to be between the factions of the North. Mr. DAVIS, immediately upon his election to the Presidency of the Confederates, echoed the same statement. Secession was to incur no penalty, and be followed by no danger; when danger threatened, the battle was instantly transferred to the strongest ground of the rebels -- the border States. If these could be held, all would be well. To lose them would be a fatal blow. Consequently, the South has poured its whole strength into Virginia and Missouri. The moment a soldier could be made ready for marching orders, he was instantly dispatched North. In these States, the rebels have put forth their whole power. Notwithstanding almost incredible exertions, they have been driven very nearly out of one State, and out of one-half of the other. In Eastern Virginia, with all their immense force they seem incapable of anything but resistance; so that although they have recently achieved a victory, they have not attempted to follow it up by any attack upon our lines.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Position of the Rebel Forces.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Position of the Rebel Forces.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f802a84b-b021-5425-bf35-25d53ab754ae,998,nyt://article/f802a84b-b021-5425-bf35-25d53ab754ae

The purpose of this order must be to operate on the Union population of East Tennessee; for, as we are advised, all opposition to the despotism of the Confederate rebels has been thoroughly crushed out, long since, in every other part of the South. But in East Tennessee the opposition to the rebel rule was too formidable to be suppressed by the usual means of mob violence. Not only large communities, but entire counties and districts, were almost unanimously faithful to the old Union and resolved to know no other allegiance. To deal lightly with such an element was more than the wary traitors of the Confederate States were willing to risk. They have therefore temporized, coaxed, expostulated and flattered by turns, down to the present time. But no amount of persuasion, or cajolery, or intimidation, has been able to swerve the Union patriots of East Tennessee from their duty. And they have recently, by a vote of over thirty thousand, proclaimed anew their detestation of the Southern rebellion, and their purpose to resist it. They have so far defied JEFF. DAVIS and his Government as to elect members to the National Congress, at the very time when the rebel Congress was in session at Richmond, and claiming legislative authority over the State of Tennessee.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tightening the Chains.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tightening the Chains.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/305df38e-e8bd-5ad9-a6dd-59fc45e91180,968,nyt://article/305df38e-e8bd-5ad9-a6dd-59fc45e91180

They do not admire, and certainly do not imitate, that mixture of polished language with straightforward common sense which is now our accepted type of good writing on political subjects. It may be said that this only shows that they are not very cultivated, and that they have not skill enough to recognize what is best. But the thing which they do admire is one which in its kind is singularly good. They wait to see the salient points of a subject put in a consecutive, unmistakable, unanswerable way. Their writing is in fact modeled upon their speaking. What tells with the best kind of American mob is a speech with very little art in it, but with a continuance of plain and homely logic. Fond as they are of bombast and rhodomontade, they still award the palm to the speaker who puts into intelligible English arguments which are within the compass of ordinary minds. The present President had a reputation as a speaker long before he was thought of as a successor to Mr. BUCHANAN. No one thought him a very clever man, and still less an eloquent one; but it was generally recognized that he meant what he said, and had a happy facility in putting his case so that every sentence led the hearer a step further on towards the desired end. It was, as his admirers described it, as if every sentence drove a fresh nail in. His Message appears to us to have the characteristics that used to mark his speeches. It is badly worded, and in many parts is not English at all. But it puts in a plain and forcible way the case of the Government. It forces on our attention exactly what the North, as represented by the Executive, is doing, and has been doing, and purposes to do. It raises the real question at issue, and instructs the world what are the hopes and fears with which the Government enters on the dreadful struggle. We may be glad that so important a document should force us once for all to consider fairly the whole case of the Union party.

The programme contained some of the most popular military pieces of the day, and was interpreted with that precision and elegance for which the Band is justly famous. It is to be hoped that the liberal patrens, who furnish us with this agreeable weekly treat, will find it desirable to continue them during the coming days of Autumn. When the weather is reasonably fine nothing can be conceived more charming than listening to soft music, surrounded by youth and beauty, in the Central Park.

"The futile attempt of the Committee on Federal Relations to manufacture sympathy in behalf of the Commissioners of Police, imparts renewed interest to the scenes of the 19th of April last, in which these gentlemen bore a conspicuous part. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/19/archives/the-baltimore-police-commissioners-what-they-have-done.html,,"The futile attempt of the Committee on Federal Relations to manufacture sympathy in behalf of the Commissioners of Police, imparts renewed interest to the scenes of the 19th of April last, in which these gentlemen bore a conspicuous part. A very brief review of the events of that period will show conclusively that the complaints of the Commissioners themselves are hollow and groundless, that the pretended love of their secession sympathizers for civil liberty is hypocritical and dishonest, and that what has since been styled a riot, if not preconcerted and predetermined, had no sooner occurred than it was publicly indorsed by them, and hailed as a fortunate opportunity to precipitate Maryland into this infamous and bloody revolution. What are the facts? On the evening of the 18th April, the day preceding the riot, a large meeting of the Southern Rights, now the Peace Party, is held at the Taylor Building, some six or seven hundred persons being present, with their passions lashed into fury by the secession Press of Baltimore, and T. PARKIN SCOTT is chosen President. Very inflammatory speeches were made at this meeting, and some by men who are at this moment in arms against the National Government; and not the least significant among them was that of the President himself, who ""advised the States Rights Party to go to work, organize ward companies, elect officers, and believed that as there was plenty of money to provide them with arms, so they might soon expect to receive them."" This was certainly a most important announcement from ""head-quarters,"" and was an appropriate introduction, at least, to the riot, as it was called, which occurred accordingly on the following day. On the afternoon of the 19th, another public meeting is called at Monument-square. What was the character of its proceedings? The military are placed there under the order of Gen. Geo. H. STEUART now of the Secession forces, and Dr. A.C. ROBINSON, appears upon the stand with the Maryland flag, and ""informs the people that the time for sentimental abstraction was passed; he took pleasure in displaying the Maryland flag, and throwing all doubts aside, we would with our strong arms defend ourselves, or be aided in that defense by the stout hearts and vigorous arms of the South."" Mr. PRESTON, who came there with no intention of making a speech, told the people now was the time above all times for the sons of glorious old Maryland to stand firmly together in defense of her honor and of her independence. He had seen our citizens butchered in the streets of their own city. Mr. WALLIS ""had not come to speak, for if the blood of our brethren shed on the streets of Baltimore to-day, does not speak to the heart of every man in Maryland, then the human voice may well be dumb."" For himself, he was devoted to the cause of the South, and was ready to march forward under the flag of Maryland in the common cause of Southern freedom. Secession speeches of like sentiment were delivered by Messrs. MARSHALL, McLANE and others. It thus appears that just before and subsequent to the riot, the men who rose most conspicuous on the stream of popular passion, and directed its course, raised their voices then as loud for war as they do now for peace. Their speeches then were open and unmistakable indorsements of the assault on the troops ""who had invaded our soil,"" and show that these present peace-makers were satisfied that the revolution was complete, and that the time, ""yea, the set time"" of our redemption was nigh. The Police Board immediately after this appear upon the field of action. Information is given then that fresh troops are approaching, and it was immediately resolved to destroy the bridges, and the order was effectually carried out, the police law fortunately presenting no obstacle in the way. On the following day, large amounts of military stores of every description, belonging to the United States, some of it as much as nine miles from the city, are seized by the police by order of the Police Board -- the secession flag being now very liberally displayed over secession recruiting-offices in the city, while the provisions of the Police law, fortunately for our defence, again threw no obstacle in the way. During these events, it will be remembered, the military forces of the whole State were arming and flocking to Baltimore under the orders of this same Police Board and Police law, and most especially in response to the telegraphic dispatch of Marshal KANE to Bradley T. JOHNSON, now in the Southern Army, requesting the assistance of riflemen from Virginia, ""that fresh hordes would be down upon us tomorrow,"" &c. This dispatch, entirely ignored by the Commissioners in their ""memorial,"" by the Mayor in his message, and in fact by all their sympathizers and apologists, is nevertheless a fact as significant and full of meaning as any event of that period, and in relation to it we would simply inquire what provisions of our special police law direct the riflemen of Virginia or of any other State to be used to suppress a riot, especially after the riot is over. It was also early in the progress of these events that the Mayor and Board of Police invest J.R. TRIMBLE, now we are informed in the Southern Army, with military authority, and his military orders No. 1, 2, &c., now figure conspicuously in the public Press. A brief reference to the orders issued by him under the authority of the Police Board, will unmistakably define the relation of these Commissioners to the National Government. For instance, Order No. 1, April 21, 1861, two days after the riot: ""Wm. H. Norris, Robert M. McLane, Benjamin C. Prestman, Charles Wethered, E. Louis Lowe, Frederick Harrison, and Grafton D. Spurrier, are appointed aids to the commander of the Volunteer Uniformed Association, any order given by them will be duly respected. J.R. TRIMBLE, Commanding."" Order No. 2: ""Captains of the Volunteers Uniformed Association will report their names and the number of men under their command at the office of the Commissioners of Police."" By Order No. 9, ""Col. F.J. THOMAS, (since killed at Manassas, 'fighting in defence of our beloved city,') from his military experience is well calculated to supply the present deficiency of officers of the staff, and he is appointed Adjutant-General of the forces under my command. J.R. TRIMBLE, commanding."" On April the 26th, it is ordered by the Mayor and Board of Police that no provisions of any kind be transferred to any place until further orders, and the execution of this order is intrusted to J.R. TRIMBLE. The ERRICSSON steamers for Philadelphia, and that, too, with mails and passengers, on application to the Board of Police, was refused permission to leave for prudential reasons. The Bremen ship Admiral, with an assorted cargo of tobacco, &c, which cleared on the 22d, was prohibited from leaving the wharf, the police having taken charge of the ship. Then we have the following announcement: ""I hereby, by authority of the Mayor and Board of Police, direct that no steamboat shall leave the harbor without my permission. J.R. TRIMBLE."" What comment could add force or meaning to these indisputable facts of record? During the rapid progress of such wholly unconstitutional proceedings of the Mayor and Board of Police, we are informed by the Press ""that two suspicious characters made their appearance, and are taken up as spies, and detained at the Marshal's office; they are supposed to belong to the Massachusetts Regiment."" ""Capt. SCOTT, of the Maryland Guards, arrested last night, at Barnum's Hotel, one Sergeant SCHWARTZER, 'recruiting officer at Port McHenry, on suspicion of being a spy; he was committed."" This very brief statement of events brings us to Wednesday, the 24th of April, the day of election. No sooner are the election returns made public, than a sudden change comes over the whole aspect of affairs. A panic is visible in the ranks of the party, and at once Major TRIMBLE, his Aids and his military orders, violating every principle of civil law under the authority of the Board, now rapidly disappear from public view. His unlawful restriction on the trade of Baltimore is removed, ""the supply of provisions being found to be ample."" The police law is now restored to life, and again becomes the sole guide of official action. Every provision must now be sacredly observed, especially from any, the least infraction by the General Government. It now becomes necessary for the Commissioners, by a public declaration of April 28, to inform the people ""that the sole object of the Board, in all they had done, was to protect the lives and property of the people of Baltimore. This was the special purpose for which the Board was created,"" &c. Viewing this declaration in connection with the events of the week, it is somewhat surprising to see the number of secession soldiers and officers who cooperated with them in their patriotic efforts. We know of no men, in the least suspected of attachment to the National Government, who shared their confidence; on the contrary, some such were regarded and detained as spies, others had warning to flee the city; and this fact was boldly published in their own Press. It was in view of these facts, too, that they say in the same declaration that ""the Board have been governed by no political views."" It is in the face of this record that our Committee on Federal Relations have become so nervously alarmed for the fate of civil liberty, and are desperately struggling to save it by awakening sympathy for the very men who were the first to violate it, and to place the citizens of Baltimore under the military orders of Maj. TRIMBLE and his aids. It will take more, than a few short weeks to erase these facts from our recollection; but, appreciating as we do the efforts of our Committee, covering, as we are informed, seventy-five pages of foolscap, we are happy to recall to their recollection that part of the declaration of the 28th of April, which is so full of comfort to the Commissioners themselves in their confinement, and ought to be no less so to their friends, and which is so forcibly expressed in their own words, viz.: ""That the Board are entirely satisfied that their position is understood and appreciated by the General Government, by the authorities of the State, and by a great majority of the thinking and order-loving people of Baltimore.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BALTIMORE POLICE COMMISSIONERS.; WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BALTIMORE POLICE COMMISSIONERS.; WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Baltimore Clipper, Aug. 12', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Aug', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6723f347-d78c-504a-b4da-7c4619f9b323,1770,nyt://article/6723f347-d78c-504a-b4da-7c4619f9b323

BUTLER has promptly quelled the revolts in the Second, Ninth and Tenth Regiments at Fortress Monroe, by bringing his loaded batteries to bear upon the mutineers, while he secured the ringleaders and transported them to the Rip Raps to be speedily tried by Court-martial. This he wisely followed up by removing the causes of the regimental discontent -- taking upon himself the responsibility of paying the men their arrearages, and, in generous and manly words, promised them a redress of all their real grievances. The mutineers of the Seventy-ninth, also, have been promptly and sternly dealt with by Gen. MCCLELLAN. He surrounded the regiment with an overpowering force of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, ordered it to return to duty, and threatened to shoot on the spot every man who was disobedient. He then administered to it a terrible and somewhat passionate reprimand -- disgraced it by taking away its colors, and by other martial severities; while over fifty men from its battle-decimated ranks were by his order imprisoned and put in irons, and will be tried by Court-martial to-day. Gen. MCCLELLAN has also severely punished the insubordinates of the Thirteenth New-York and Second Maine regiments, by banishing over a hundred of their number to the Dry Tortugas, where they will be employed as laborers upon the fortifications until the expiration of their term of enlistment. The disaffected members of the Sixteenth and other regiments have been taken in hand with equal promptitude and rigor. In fact, the whole Army is now for the first time beginning to understand that a cheerful obedience to orders, and a manly submission to the necessary hardships of camp-life, are the first virtues of the soldier. These measures of just severity have already done much for the efficiency of the National Army; and will doubtless also do much to repress the frivolous complaints, of which the public and the better portion of the soldiers are now utterly tired. No one will uphold such measures more heartily than the true soldier, as none know so well the fatal results of loose discipline and disaffection.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Military Discipline and Soldiers' Grievances."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Military Discipline and Soldiers' Grievances."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db40a397-aa2e-55aa-b8dd-f574f15f230f,648,nyt://article/db40a397-aa2e-55aa-b8dd-f574f15f230f

The sudden demand of the Secretary of War for the immediate dispatch to Washington of all the men who had been accepted for the public service, whether organized or not, was held to indicate apprehensions of an immediate attack, either upon Washington, or upon Baltimore, in its rear. It cannot be denied that the document justified such an interpretation, especially in view of the rumors which have been for some days current concerning the movements of the rebel troops. There is certainly reason to believe that they intend to cross the Potomac some twenty or twenty-five miles above Washington, whenever they consider themselves in sufficient force to do it safely. Their troops are flushed with victory; they are known to have been rapidly preparing and accumulating large means of transportation during the past three weeks; they are believed to have not less than 100,000 men at their command; a bold and brilliant stroke, even if accompanied by corresponding hazards, is what is required by their situation, and an immediate advance upon Washington has been clamorously demanded by their troops, and confidently predicted by their journals for some time past.

"WINTER GARDEN. -- A sort of prefatory season to the regular campaign was inaugurated at this handsome establishment last evening, by Mr. J.S. CLARKE, a comedian whose great success last season has justified an experiment which, under other circumstances, would be dangerous. Three pieces were provided, and a number of artists comparatively new to our stage, introduced. In the first -- the ""Rough Diamond"" -- Mrs. ALEKINA FISHER BAKER, an experienced actress of a past school, made her rentree, and was warmly received by a very appreciative audience. The lady's performance of the character of Margery was marked by much vivacity, but was marred by certain nasal extravagances of style, which savored more of the stage Yankee ""gal"" than the English peasant. The word ""sass"" does not occur in any British vocabulary, nor do the village girls of Britain cultivate a healthyleisure by whittling on a pine board with a a jack-knife. Mrs. BAKER will probably be astonished when we tell her that her performance would be much improved by omitting these extravagances. Mr. CLARKE was the Cousin Joe, and made the most of the part, which, we may here add, has been reduced to a mere sketch. It was in the second piece -- theimmortal ""Toodles"" -- that the comedian was seen to the greatest advantage.

If gentry of this stamp could have their will, we should speedily see the deadliest feelings of animosity aroused between the two countries, and this great lake region, at present the scene of busy commerce and prosperous husbandry, become the theatre of a frightful [???] We do not, of course, anticipate that any such result can be produced by the puny means at their command, but it is abundantly evident that the dread of hostilities which some of the Ministerial journalists, perhaps unthinkingly, are endeavoring to raise, is likely to be exceedingly injurious to the Province Upper Canada is just emerging from a protracted period of depression; and we are all engaged in observing with gratified eyes the indications of returning prosperity. Can any one imagine a more fatal means of destroying our fairest prospects than this constant talk of war, this persistent call for troops and arms? We are looking anxiously across the ocean for new settlers to swell our population and our means; will they come if they think that they will be required on their arrival to take up the rifle and the sword, and relinquish the plow and the scythe. We need foreign capital for a hundred important objects; does any one think we will get it, if war, as these journalists aver, is at our gates? We are aware of one large monetary institution connected with Britain, which was asked by its correspondents there as to the prospects of war between the United States and England, and which sought to calm the fears of its clients by a statement of the actual position of affairs. If these gentlemen were to consult the organs of the Canadian Government, they would find a very distinct contradiction of their correspondents' views, but one entirely unsupported by facts. We hear of one large monetary institution making arrangements in London for carrying on its business with greater facility. Can that arrangement be made if the Ministerial journals are all crying out that the war is imminent? The Grand Trunk itself asks money for more rolling stock, yet its organ, under the inspiration of the confidant of JEFF. DAVIS, is proclaiming that at any moment its through traffic may be cut off by war. The people of Toronto are about to hold a meeting to discuss the propriety of proceeding with a much talked-of and very extensive public work, designed to carry the produce of the West through our waters; yet a city journal is industriously spreading the idea that that produce is about to be withdrawn from our canals and rivers by the influence of war. There is no department of business which this foolish suicidal talk does not affect. Who will buy wheat if there is danger that the American market will be closed to the flour into which it is to be ground? Who will buy logs and cut lumber if he thinks there is a chance of its being stopped by force of arms on its way to market? Surely Canada has passed through enough of real trouble during the past four years, without being made the prey of an imaginary danger, the sufferer by an evil which, in all probability, will never arise.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CANADIAN VIEW OF THE EVILS OF WAR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CANADIAN VIEW OF THE EVILS OF WAR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6cfa72cc-5fa4-52fb-9523-fbbcc67d75de,1055,nyt://article/6cfa72cc-5fa4-52fb-9523-fbbcc67d75de

On the other hand, the News, and other influential journals, which express the feelings of the masses of the people, are outspoken in our favor, and in favor of a cause which is identical with that which has given England all its worth and glory. Because we have suffered reverse they see that our cause is no less just or deserving of their sympathy. It is even foreseen that our disaster may not, in the end, prove to have been a disadvantage. The patriotism of the North and West is confidently counted upon as being equal to any emergency. The matter of our finances seems to give some anxiety to the friendly journals, and our supposed inability to negotiate the loan voted by Congress is dwelt upon with ardent satisfaction by those hostile to us. They confidently count upon having spoiled for us the English market. The people of that country well know that this, like all similar contests, is simply a question of money. Their surprise will besomewhat excited, and their respect very greatly increased for us, when they see upon the very heels of defeat, that all the money wanted by Government is readily proffered by our own people. This fact will tell with more effect upon the public mind of England than a dozen such actions as that of Bull Run. They will see that it was nothing but a skirmish of outposts, and is no more conclusive of the contest, than the repulse first sustained by them in the late contest with China was of that war. As our war progresses, Englishmen will gradually learn that the people of the Northern States are very like the old stock; addicted to peace; slow to acquire new habits; prone to commit blunders and mistakes on being forced into a war; but are not to be upset or discouraged by one, two or three severe reverses. Each one suffered only serves to stimulate us to renewed and greater efforts. Such will be the case here as there. Already, in our conduct under defeat, have we given them food for reflection, while the more they see henceforth, will only tend to confirm the feeling which, in that country, has already set in in our favor.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The English Press on American Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The English Press on American Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e209e98-110b-5297-ad27-af57ddf1d5a2,546,nyt://article/7e209e98-110b-5297-ad27-af57ddf1d5a2

"About 6 o'clock yesterday morning a very destructive fire broke out in the blind and sash manufactory owned and occupied by LEONARD BALDWIN, at No. 89 Delancey-street. The fire was first discovered in the engine-room situated in the rear, and, notwithstanding the fact that the alarm was quickly given, the flames spread to the main building with such rapidity that before the arrival of the firemen it was completely enveloped in flame, and soon afterwards was a mass of ruins. From this building thefire spread with great rapidity, and soon reached the large tenement-house of JOHN W. FARMER, located in the rear of No. 95 Ludlow-street, and being surrounded on all sides by other buildings, it was very soon a mass of fire from basement to attic. In this building there were over twenty families, and when the flames reached it, the frightened women and children were seen running in all directions, shrieking with the wildest terror, andcrying piteously to the firemen and citizens to save their furniture. Some, with three or four small children, who clung to them for safety, were trying to get out their little stock of goods with one hand, while the other held their infants. All the younger portion of the families were almost in a state of nakedness, having doubtless been aroused from their beds by the alarm. It is believed they all escaped with their lives, but how, under the circumstances, is truly wonderful. From this tenement-house the fire extended rapidly to the adjoining buildings, notwithstanding the steam and other engines by this time were well at work. On Orchard-street the fire did great damage. The first one on the street was No. 108 -- a lager-beer saloon -- which almost joined the building where the fire broke out. This was a two-story brick building, and was a total loss. The damage here was about $3,000. Insured for $1,000. No. 110 Orchard-street was the next building which took fire. This was occupied as a dwelling by Mr. HUNT and family. The most of their personal effects were saved. The damage to the building was very serious, though the firemen succeeded in staying the flames before it was entirely destroyed. No. 116 Delancey street, a three-story frame building, occupied by Mr. BALDWIN, was damaged to the extent of about $600. It was fully insured. No. 104 Delancey-street was a three-story brick building, occupied by Mr. TOOLEY, and was damaged about $500. No. 102 same street also took fire and was damaged to the extent of $300 or $400.

Cotton and sugar were grown, they said, simply because it was more remunerative to employ all the labor on them, and purchase the plantation supplies from the Northwest with a part of the product.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Good Omens of Slavery.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Good Omens of Slavery.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32108be5-0377-5a6e-aec7-4ae73af652bc,1325,nyt://article/32108be5-0377-5a6e-aec7-4ae73af652bc

"The arrest, at Cincinnati, of THOMAS B. LINCOLN, of Texas, but well known in this City as a full-blooded Secessionist, has furnished undoubted evidence, of the complicity of Hon. JESSE D. BRIGHT, Senator from Indiana, in the rebellion. Mr. BRIGHT has always been in the closest sympathy with the extreme Southern wing of the Democratic Party, and for his subserviency, was for many years elected President of the Senate pro tempore, and was by the Constitution eligible, in a certain contingency, to the Presidency of the United States. He was an ardent supporter of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE against Mr. DOUGLAS, and was found side by side with the former gentleman at the late session of Congress in opposition to the action and policy of the Government. While Senator, sworn to support and defend the Constitution, he salutes Mr. DAVIS as President of that portion of the country in rebellion against this Constitution, and sends a man to his Capital as the bearer of an improved weapon of destruction, to be used against his own constituents. The case of Mr. BRIGHT is only an illustration of the universal ramification of the great conspiracy, and of the shameless manner in which the oath of allegiance to the Constitution is habitually violated. Men set in Congress whose whole efforts are directed toward breaking up the Government. Only a few months ago a Cabinet, while holding office, was so employed. The population of Washington only a few mouths ago was composed of such conspirators, and is still swarming with them. Their name everywhere is legion, and up to this time, they have been the cause of nearly all our reverses. They still crowd, as officeholders, the several departments. A mistaken leniency yet allows them pretty free range. We are gradually working ourselves up to a proper treatment of such villains, and we trust and believe Mr. BRIGHT will be unceremoniously ejected from his seat in the Senate. Upon a prisoner lately captured in Missouri, a letter was found from Senator POLK, showing him to be one of the fellow-conspirators with JACKSON.

BANKS had withdrawn his army from its position contiguous to Harper's Ferry, and that this withdrawal had been immediately followed by the reoccupation of Harper's Ferry by the rebels under Gen. JOHNSTON, and the crossing of the Potomac by a portion of his command. It is almost needless to say, that there is no truth whatever in the report. At least, it is positively denied at head-quarters in Washington, where the news of such a movement would be likely to be received quite as promptly as at any other point. Even should Gen. BANKS' command be removed, as reported, there is little likelihood that JOHNSTON would pursue any such reckless course as that indicated. His forces would thus be divided, with a wide river between to prevent a rapid junction, and he might by this means lose his entire army. Besides, we have no positive knowledge that JOHNSTON was in the immediate vicinity of the Potomac with any considerable body of men. There have been rumors to that effect, but they have never been verified. It seems to be understood in Washington that all the approaches towards the river, and towards the Capital, have been merely feints, intended as much to deceive the rebel army as our own, and to inculcate on both sides the false belief that an immediate demonstration against Washington was the main feature in the programme of the rebel leaders.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c11cdae2-c9bf-5079-b806-d6f6d49160a1,1235,nyt://article/c11cdae2-c9bf-5079-b806-d6f6d49160a1

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/24/archives/the-blockade-and-neutral-rights.html,,"The correspondent of a New-York cotemporary, writing from Fort Pickens, undertakes, on the strength of a communication received from Havana, to give the substance of Admiral MILNE'S rumored dispatch to the Government, the contents of which, as well as the instructions in reply, are looked for with so much interest, both here and in America. The writer of the letter from Fort Pickens may be rightly informed, or he may be hazarding what he imagines a shrewd guess at the contents of the British Admiral's dispatch; but we do not require the information he professes to place before us, or the dispatch itself, to enable us to appreciate the conduct of the National Government with reference to the blockade, and of those officers instructed to establish it. The blockade of the Southern ports was formally proclaimed on the 29th of April, fifteen days of grace being allowed for vessels to clear out after the date of the proclamation. Some weeks subsequently another proclamation was issued, declaring all the ports south of Baltimore, Key West excepted, to be under blockade. We need not repeat what we have so often stated, upon the authority of the most eminent jurists, and especially those of the United States, that no blockade can be maintained without the continued presence of a competent armed force, except where that force may be removed by a gale of wind, or some temporary necessity. The ports at which, since the publication of the blockade, this requirement of the law of nations has been complied with are, Hampton Roads, Savannah, Charleston, Pensacola, Mobile, New-Orleans, and since the 7th of July, the port of Galveston. These are the ports at which blockading ships have been stationed, and, consequently, the only ports under such a blockade as can be recognized by a neutral State. At the ports of Wilmington, (in North Carolina,) St. Mark's and Apalachicola, (in Florida,) Beaufort and other places, no such steps have been taken to render the blockade effectual. No men-of-war have been stationed, or have even arrived, so far as we can ascertain, with that object. It is by no means improbable, moreover, that the blockade even of those ports where it has been regularly established has been irregularly and inefficiently maintained. We can hardly conceive how it could be otherwise, considering the vast extent of coast line the National Government have undertaken to close against commerce, and the limited resources at their disposal, to effect so extensive a blockade. The inability of the Cabinet at Washington to give effect to their war policy in this regard is manifest from the fact that they have been compelled, after the publication of the blockade, to leave the date and manner of effecting it entirely to the discretion of the commanders of the blockading squadron. This, in itself, must have created confusion and misunderstandings innumerable. The National Government may say that they are at liberty to take their own time in the matter of blockading the Southern coast, seeing that in doing so they are only closing their own ports. This is not an explanation which would for a moment be listened to by any European. Government, more especially by the Government of this country, which has expressly conceded to the South the rights of belligerents, and has acted from the first on the understanding that the National Government, in proclaiming a blockade of the Southern ports, was also exercising those rights which, in a spirit of rigid neutrality, we extended to North and South alike. Moreover, the National Government has within the past year refused to recognize the right of a Sovereign to blockade his own ports, and on these grounds actually obtained compensation from the ex-Government of Naples for losses incurred by an American ship during the blockade of the Neapolitan ports. The National Government must blockade as belligerents, or they cannot blockade at all; and what we have from the first contended for on behalf of neutral commerce is, that the blockade shall be established and maintained according to the strict usages of maritime warfare -- that it shall be effectual in form and impartial in its operation. This, we have no doubt, the British Government will insist upon, and they will be supported in their demand by all the maritime States of Europe; and if it shall appear that the National Government is unequal to blockade the whole of the Southern seaboard, then it will be the duty of the neutral fleets in those waters to see that neutral vessels entering or leaving unblockaded ports are not subjected to interference or molestation on the part of the National cruisers.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BLOCKADE AND NEUTRAL RIGHTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BLOCKADE AND NEUTRAL RIGHTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/05581d1a-8c6b-5363-bec7-a6dfd2baac1c,774,nyt://article/05581d1a-8c6b-5363-bec7-a6dfd2baac1c

Symbols may be taken for a time, but then only under a belief that what they represented will be forthcoming when called for. All currencies are repudiated the moment it is suspected that they cannot be instantly paid in gold and silver. It even matters not how well they may be secured by property which, in turn, may be converted into coin. The world is full of such illustrations, and upon a much grander scale than are furnished in commercial or Banking operations. The two most celebrated are the Continental money, or currency issued by Congress during the war of the Revolution, and the assignats issued by the French Government during the Revolution in that country. In neither case had the people the means for the purchase of the securities of the Governments issuing them; and, of course, had not the means for providing either the principal or interest of the debts or obligations contracted. As this fact forced itself upon the public mind, they gradually sank in value, so that in this country a dollar in coin could not be purchased by one hundred dollars in Government paper. So utterly baseless and discredited was this, that it was funded in the financial scheme of Mr. HAMILTON, at one hundred dollars for one, and hardly any complaint was made that the new Government was not liberal in recognizing it at all. It had a common history of all such issues. At first it was taken at par. As it sank in public estimation, the amount was increased till ten, twenty and thirty dollars, and so on, was paid out in discharge of debts and in making purchases, when only a dollar in actual value was due or to be received.

He has become conscious that had the handling of the troops been intrusted to leaders of skill, there was the material to insure victory. He has also learned, and taught his employers, who confess the knowledge editorially, that the spirit of the loyal North, so far from being impaired by the event, is strengthened by deeper resolutions, and a readiness for even exhaustive sacrifices rather than permit this apparent demonstration of the weakness of our Government to pass without emphatic contradiction. These indications of the docility of the Special Correspondent we may regard with satisfaction.

"After the review of Gen. McCALL's Brigade, on Wednesday, by Gen. McCLELLAN, the Commissioned Officers were called forward, They marched up to Gen. McCLELLAN, who, with uncovered head, saluted them and made a brief address part of which was lost to us by the unfavorable position we occupied. He said that he was proud of the display there witnessed, and that the President and Secretary of war had expressed much gratification at their fine appearance and perfection in drill. We have here the material for as fine an army as the world ever saw, and it is to you that the world look to do honor to Pennsylvania. A Pennsylvanian myself, I feel that upon your action will depend my own reputation. He asked them to continue to drill their men, morning, noon and evening, until every man knew the meaning of all the orders that were ever given. With a quiet salutation they withdrew, and the troops marched off to their camps. Gen. McCLELLAN then, surrounded by two companies of cavalry, moved off towards Gen. COUCH's brigade.

He said that he was proud of the display there witnessed, and that the President and Secretary of war had expressed much gratification at their fine appearance and perfection in drill.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/25/archives/the-philanthopists-and-womans-wrongs.html,,"-- The Tribune the other day gave a neat and comprehensive programme for the war, the authorship of which it attributed to some ""astute youth"" of its imagination, but which is marvelously like the plan lately advocated by itself with such vehement iteration: ""Just, march down there"" -- these are the words -- ""crush out the rebellion, and return quietly to your homes."" Brief, beautiful and dramatic; three brief acts, and then -- music by the band! It is not, however, in connection with fields of blood, nor the great march to Richmond, that our cotemporary now puts forth this remarkable bit of strategy. He has already broken his sword and thrown away the scabbard, and so can only display his tactical talent surreptiously in articles on other, and, as EMERSON would say, the otherest subjects. This time it is brought in in a very odd place. A few days ago the TIMES suggested a feasible and simple plan for the relief of the most helpless and suffering class in the community, the unemployed industrial women of the City -- just as months ago it had suggested feasible plans for the capture of Richmond. It was shown that many of the trades and industries which ordinarily furnish employment to tens of thousands of young women in New-York, were now utterly collapsed, and that consequently many thousands of these women were now idle and penniless; and it was suggested that now would be an opportune moment to put in operation some of the schemes discussed in bygone years for introducing them to appropriate employments, from which they are now virtually excluded, as shopwomen, accountants, clerks, waitresses, and-so-forth. This suggestion, simple, practical and practicable, the Tribune of course does not like. It says it is ""profound and of a serene fixedness;"" then it slyly introduces the military programme we have quoted, attributing it to an ""astute youth;"" then recommends the hapless girls to charity and the needle, and winds up by saying: ""May we not confide in the sex to sustain and comfort itself?"" It is hard to make out whether the article is military, benevolent or comic. But, nevertheless, we still think that employment such as we proposed is better than charity, and that the needle can furnish but a poor refuge, in these days of sewingmachines, to the tens of thousands of young women now idle and destitute; and, moreover, we are glad to inform the Tribune that our suggestion has been adopted by more than one business house, with the best results. It is practicable, however, on a widely-extended scale; and we, still believe that it would result in great and permanent advantage to both sexes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE PHILANTHOPISTS AND WOMAN'S WRONGS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE PHILANTHOPISTS AND WOMAN'S WRONGS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5cd305f1-74b1-59cc-b92d-209138105900,447,nyt://article/5cd305f1-74b1-59cc-b92d-209138105900

"By order of the Surveyor of the Port, the schooner Alabama which has been for several days past loading at Pier No. 8, North River, was seized and towed to the Atlantic Dock, where she will be overhauled and her papers examined. Various circumstances combined to warrant the suspicion that this schooner was laying in a cargo for a Southern port, intending to run the blockade, and yesterday it was ascertained that she had changed hands, the new owner purporting to be one JOHN E. BILLUPS who, on being questioned by the Surveyor, said the craft was bound for Washington, but could not give the name of any responsible person in that city to whom he was known, nor did he have the appearance of a bona fide owner of a cargo worth at least $15,000.

And the mail failing to disseminate the journals, a hundred avenues will speedily be found, whereby they will be disseminated wherever rebel malevolence shall choose to send them. The present policy of the Government is merely an annoyance to the secession prints -- it is not a corrective of the evil complained of.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEWSPAPER QUESTION.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/26/archives/health-of-the-arny.html,,"One of the most remarkable events connected with our present war arrangements, is the uniform health of the troops, both at the recruiting stations and also at the various camps about Washington and the Mississippi River. Even when the soldiers have slept for weeks in the open air, unsheltered by tent or roof, lying on the bare, often wet ground, there has been no disease engendered. The change of food, varieties of crude diet, beans, alternating with salt pork, green fruit, and even the poisoned gifts of Southern foes, have had no results of a deleterious character worthy the notice. In fact, the health of our troops in Washington, Cairo, Fortresses Monroe and Pickens has averaged better than in the City of New-York in its present, no more than ordinary, hygienic condition. Why this is so, it is not easy to say. For, notwithstanding the publication of little manuals of health, (Dr. Ordronaux's Hints on the Preservation of Health in Armies -- APPLETON's,) the numerous squibs of hygienic value in our various newspapers, the supply of Havelocks and flannels made by the patriotic industry of our ladies, the presence of the ordinary proportion of medical men, or the exertions of the Sanitary Commission, the question is not answered. Any one who has taken the trouble to run his eye over the features of the various corps who have embarked from this City for the South, whether starting from here or in transitu, will have made up his mind that instructive pamphlets or newspaper articles are rarely seen and less noted by the majority of them. The Havelocks worn with such ostentation by the recruit, like the gay ribbons of the French conscript, have, after going through a service as a handkerchief, been discarded as valueless by the veteran of a month's service in camp. The flannel body-bandages which volunteer regimental, surgeons have, with an apparent desire for notoriety, been calling for by the thousand, perhaps may have occasionally been put on by some, mindful of their mother's last directions upon leaving their home, ""to take care of their health."" But if the dweller in the sweltering casemates of Fort Monroe may have taken an occasional cool day to invest himself in this itching protective, with the first Southern puff flapping the lazy fold of his flag, he has more speedily doffed them.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HEALTH OF THE ARNY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HEALTH OF THE ARNY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/75f9f222-314a-5489-8dd1-98b8fa078666,1010,nyt://article/75f9f222-314a-5489-8dd1-98b8fa078666

The circumstances of the arrest, as stated by the Journal, are as follows: Last Sunday, during the examination of the steamer Samuel Orr by Capt. WOOD, a trunk was discovered for which no owner could be found. The Captain at once took the trunk to the warehouse,when it was opened and several treasonable letters were brought to light. On Monday a stranger appeared at the warehouse and demanded the trunk taken from the Orr. Capt. WOOD at once arrested him and took him before Surveyor ROBINSON, who sent him to Camp Vanderburg. The name of the prisoner is JOHN CARTWELL, of the firm of CARTWELL BROTHERS, Caseyville, Ky. One of the letters is from CARTWELL to Lieut. CHARLES SEMPLE, Louisville, an officer in the rebel Army. It states that he (CARTWELL) had a talk with Mr. ANDERSON, a bar-keeper at HAMILTON & BROS., Second, between Main and Market streets, Louisville, and that ANDERSON told him that he had 40 men for the Southern Army, but had no means of sending them to Tennessee. CARTWELL also tells SEMPLE that he would try and fill up the latter's company at Caseyville, whither he was bound at the time of his arrest. Copies of letteas, introducing Lieut. SEMPAMLE to JOHN M. BLAIR, of Clarksville, Tenn, as all right on the secesh question, were also found. CARTWELL also expresses the hope of meeting Lieut. SEMPLE very soon at Camp Boone, the head-quarters of the Kentucky traitors. CARTWELL will be held until orders are received from Gov. MORTON as to his disposal.

These unfavorable reports are supported by the statements of a few discontented, obscure members of disbanded regiments, and are, for the most part, so absurd and self-contradictory as to impose on no one of ordinary intelligence and information. It is gratifying to find that the sweeping charges thus boldly made can, many of them, be easily shown to be at variance with undoubted facts. Instances of incompetency, neglect, waste, peculation, or official mismanagement may no doubt be pointed out, the authors of which, we trust, will be severely dealt with. Still we are assured that in spite of these exceptional cases, and although some of the most trying and sickly months of the year have passed, our unacclimated troops have, on the whole, been so well cared for that they have emerged satisfactorily from the ordeal; and the various camps, with scarcely an exception, have, as yet, been more free from disease than might reasonably have been expected. Authentic statistical tables have, in a few instances, been published, and we further learn from the concurrent testimony of the representatives of the Press, of the Sanitary Commission, and of other unprejudiced observers at the seat of war, that although in camp as in civil life, some of the most simple and imperative sanitary precautions are often in abeyance, still the sick list has very rarely been immoderate, and the efficiency of our troops is less impaired by the virulence of dysentery, fever, diarrhea, and other camp diseases, than the public had anticipated under the peculiar circumstances of the case.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Recruiting and Army Hygiene.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Recruiting and Army Hygiene.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b773ed7c-1373-5676-acfa-a95abb956cd4,853,nyt://article/b773ed7c-1373-5676-acfa-a95abb956cd4

BONNELL WILSON, clothiers in Cortlandt-street, charged with having defrauded them of property valued at over $200, by means of false statements. Mr. BONNELL, a member of the firm, testified that on the 13th inst., the accused had rooms at the Western Hotel, and requested him to call and converse with reference to furnishing clothing for his regiment. He talked largely, saying that he should be obliged to purchase an immense quantity of goods, but he wanted no commissions and was only desirous of buying at fair prices. He also said that he had full authority to draw upon the Government for all the goods he wanted, and no other Colonel had been similarly favored. Unfortunately, however, he had left his documents at home, but in proof of his assertion, he referred Mr. BONNELL to the Washington telegraphic correspondence of one of the City papers, wherein he was spoken of flatteringly in connection with his regiment and the War Department. He closed his conversation by expressing a desire to ""take a few pants and shirts immediately for his suffering men,"" which the merchant gladly furnished to the amount of $212 50, and LATSON offered to give next day a Government draft [???]. These goods were duly sent to Camp Low. Staten Island, and at a subsequent interview LATSON renewed his conversation about purchasiug goods, but never alluded to the Government dran in payment for the first lot. On the 19th inst. LATSON again saw Mr. BONNELL, and spoke of the clothing he wanted. Mr. BONNELL, who had gradually been growing suspicious of the Colonel's honesty, declined to negotiate further until he was shown the authority to draw upon the Government. This LATSON did not satisfactorily exhibit, and as he omitted to pay for the goods he did receive, a warrant was issued for his arrest. Officer CUMMINGS, of the Police Court, took him into custody, and he was required to furnish bonds in $500 for trial.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bf4aadfa-c88f-528f-b216-cee094988d88,1860,nyt://article/bf4aadfa-c88f-528f-b216-cee094988d88

The rumor, an unauthorized one, that the regiment was to have a presentation of regimental colors by Mrs. President LINCOLN, raised the hopes of the men somewhat, but they finally concluded to wait for the realization of their hopes until they reach Washington. The Lincoln Cavalry have been recruited mainly in this City, with one company from Syracuse, and one from Michigan, and three in Pennsylvania. They are as fine a body of men as have left this City since recruiting began. Their appearance as they marched through Broadway to the Battery was very fine, the men in their neat uniforms, but without sabres, marching on foot, the staff officers only being mounted. Col. McREYNOLDS rode his handsome bay charger at the head of his regiment, and was frequently recognized and cheered as he passed along, the Colonel giving his friends the parting salute. A large crowd followed them to the place of embarkation, among whom were many of the wives and other female friends of the members, to take a farewell. As the regiment marched on to the pier, DODWORTH's Band, which had escorted them played ""Dixie's Land,"" while some of the more jolly in the ranks struck out into a kind of double shuffle, and went forward in the liveliest manner. The band then changed to ""Old Lang Syne,"" when the scene became really affecting. Wives and husbands, brothers and sisters, were for a time locked in each others arms, and the last good-by and parting kiss was given. Great credit is due to Lieut. LEAVITT, who has labored industriously from the beginning in recruiting this regiment, overcoming many difficulties which have opposed their progress.

Demonstrations of this character are intended to operate immediately, by scattering the rebel force congregated in Virginia. And so long as the particular points to be assailed are not designated, there is no occasion for reserve respecting the general plan. Secresy, indeed, might defeat it. There is one position close upon the Atlantic coast, which should not be omitted from the general programme, if such a programme exist. Beaufort, in South Carolina, is the chosen seat, the West End, the Versailles, of South Carolina aristocracy. There the PICKENS', the RHETTS, the BARNWELLS, whose town houses are in Charleston, have their country seats, and in all likelihood, are even now solacing themselves with cool sea breezes, after the heat and labor of the greater city. For Beaufort is famous for its perfect salubrity. At all seasons it is free from fever and miasm; and Northerner and Southerner, alike, may reside there the summer long in the enjoyment of the soundest health. So jealous are the South Carolina magnates of this favored spot, that they permit no mechanics, and only a necessary number of merchants, to inhabit the place. In the heart of a dense slave population, and so near as to control direct communication by rail between Savannah and Charleston, the eligibility of Beaufort, as a position to be held as an entrenched camp of instruction, which might be farther protected by a squadron in the harbor, wherein the largest men-of-war may ride at anchor, is too obvious to be questioned. Of course the healthfulness of the neighborhood would admit of earlier movements to seize it than would be practicable at any other desirable point on the coast.

They, escaped from East Tennssee at night, and with their clothes barely, and, is some few cases, a trusty fire-lock; and in this sad plight took up their weary line of march, as many a poor negro slave has done before them, towards the North Star. The pitiable precession arrived at Danville, travel-stained, ragged and foot-sore; and were received by the hospitable citizens of that loyal Kentucky town, in silence and with profound emotion, but with prompt and earnest sympathy A general contribution of food was made, and a generous dinner was soon prepared and set in the Seminary grounds for the fugitives. It was an acceptable gift, and gladly partaken of, amid the on-looking of hundreds of citizens of the surrounding country, whom the novel scene had gathered together. We can well believe the letters from Danville which say that the population of Kentucky through which the slow-moving caravan of fugitive freemen passed, had been excited to the highest pitch, and that a rage of honest resentment against the horrible despotism of JEFF DAVIS had seized all hearts. Surely, so incendiary a movement was never made in the South as this movement of exiled patriots out of it; and we greatly mistake the signs of the times, if it does not prove the fire-brand that will light the fires of civil war, down to the borders and on the soil of the State of Tennessee.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fugitive Freemen.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fugitive Freemen.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/576e8e36-0054-5293-90b0-206ff1ed2260,493,nyt://article/576e8e36-0054-5293-90b0-206ff1ed2260

The last veasel known to have been sent out by him was the bark Mary Francis, which was fitted out at this port about nine months since, ostensibly for Wilmington, N.C., to which port she did in fact go, but soon left there for the Coast of Africa, on pretence of going to one of the West India islands. The voyage was successful, and the Mary Francis landed between 500 and 606 negroes on the Island of Cuba.

Indeed Mr. MACHADO has long been regarded by those who knew him, as the king of the slave-traders in this City, and is said to have fitted out more than half of the slavers that have sailed from this port during the last five years.

EDGE, pyrotechnists, of Jersey City, are to give an exhibition this (Thursday) evening at Weehawken, in connection with Prof. GEANT, of their rockets and incendiary shells, which it is believed can be used with great effect against the enemy. The larger sized shells can be thrown froma mortar or cannon to a great distance. At the discharge from the piece it instantly ignites, causing a ball of fire four feet in circumference, which it is impossible to extinguish except by complete immersion in water. After burning fiercely for two or three minutes, an internal shell charged with powder explodes, and the outer shell is broken into not less than sixteen pieces, which are scattered in all directions with great force. One great advantage claimed for these shells is the facility they would afford in setting fire to the woods, and especially in the locality of masked batteries. They would also be effective against cavalry, not only by throwing the ranks into disorder, but by causing great destruction upon bursting. They have also a smaller missile which can be thrown from a paper mortar to a considerable distance, and presenting a ball of fire two feet in circumference. A mortar and twenty of these missiles can be easily carried by one man, and would be particularly useful at night in setting fire to the woods and driving the enemy from their strong-hold.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A ROCKET BRIGADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A ROCKET BRIGADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3091f88c-e8aa-5094-a754-93babe0cf100,400,nyt://article/3091f88c-e8aa-5094-a754-93babe0cf100

From those who visited the scene, we learn that everything seemed to have been done with care, and as little property destroyed as the nature of the case would admit. Indeed, to a careful observer, there were not wanting indications that the event had been anticipated, and carried out by the friends of the paper and the tory party, in order to create sympathy and make an excuse for violence and bullyism. The whole thing was a surprise, at all events, and the damage not very serious; and the well-known promptness and energy of the publishers will probably be displayed in producing a rampant specimen of toryism by the regular day of publication.All sorts of rumors are afloat in regard to the affair. One statement is that some tory friends from the country visited the office, and not being acquainted with the business of handling type, spilled, it and made it into pi. With the press they were entirely unacquainted, and injured that also in attempting to work off a paper. Some are uncharitable enough to charge the proprietors with instigating the whole affair, in order to gain sympathy and more extended credit, and allege many circumstances which they think tend to prove this to be the case. It is stated by some that the senior proprietor was seen a square or two from the office at 12 o'clock that night, in company with two or three others, and that the accident occurred between 12 and 1 o'clock.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SUSPICIOUS-VERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SUSPICIOUS-VERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38fe3ca8-ad01-5b46-bf26-82c2ec9621fb,473,nyt://article/38fe3ca8-ad01-5b46-bf26-82c2ec9621fb

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/29/archives/beautiful-cup-for-the-woodlawn.html,,"RACE COURSE. -- The entente cordiale which still exists between our Metropolis and Old Kentucky, is beautifully illustrated by a race cup of silver, just finished and now on exhibition by TIFFANY & CO. For years this house has filled all the orders required by our Southern friends of the turf, and regularly sent its annual trophy, in silver or gold, to New-Orleans or Louisville. But a few weeks ago it forwarded to Louisville the mammoth vase which is to be the hardbought prize of a three-years' winner of the Woodlawn Course -- the most magificent piece of silver of the kind ever produced in the country; and a month or so previous a splendid Crescent Cup for the Metairie track at New-Orleans. In view of the favor thus dispensed to them Messrs. TIFFANY have produced, on their own account, for the forthcoming races of the celebrated Woodlawn Association, of Kentucky, a cup, which, though surpassed by its predecessors in largeness, does not yield to them in beauty of design. Some time since, the Directors of the Course announced ""the Tiffany Stake,"" an entirely new event in the programme of the Association. This cup is the pleasant return which TIFFANY & Co. render for their courtesy. The piece is a tankard, some seven inches in height -- its design an artistic, variation from the familiar type which art-critics call the Flemish. The foot of the cup is a deep border in spirited engraving, horseshoes in etching, and the lighter lines of a wreath, in which the artistic eye will detect the spur, alternating to form it. The body is quite plain, with the exception of an oblong space, bounded by characteristic engraving on each side. One of these spaces is now occupied by a beautiful view of the Woodlawn Course; and the other will contain at no distant day the proper inscription with the winner's name. The top of the cup and the handle are Grecian in ornament, an exquisite medallion cameo after the antique finishing the latter where it joins the base. The main feature of the cup is a spirited statuette, some three inches in height, of the celebrated racer, Lexington, accompanied by his negro groom. This group is a perfect portraiture, the utmost care having been taken to attain the truth. The top of the cup is chased to represent a paddock, in which the group is placed. The cost of the cup is $250, and the hunters and racers of Kentucky may well be proud of this compliment from a New-York house.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEAUTIFUL CUP FOR THE WOODLAWN', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEAUTIFUL CUP FOR THE WOODLAWN', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/430ff486-e28b-5910-a885-c9c6dbf2e763,426,nyt://article/430ff486-e28b-5910-a885-c9c6dbf2e763

The command, numbering 750 men, reached the San Augustine Spring, in the Oregon Mountains, a march of about 20 miles when it was surrounded by the Texan horse, said to be only 300 strong. Major LYNDE, without firing a gun, and without making a show of resistance, surrendered his whole force into the hands of the enemy.

This is not the worst. Two companies from Forts Buchanan and Breckinridge, in the western part of the Territory, intended as reinforcements for Fort Fillmore, with 60 Government wagons, are supposed to be on the road, and most serious fears are apprehended that this detachment will also be cut off.

The larger sized shells can be thrown from a mortar or cannon to a great distance. At the discharge from the piece it instantly ignites, causing a ball of fire four feet in circumference, which it is impossible to extinguish except by complete immersion in water. After burning fiercely for two or three minutes, an internal shell charged with powder explodes, and the outer shell is broken into not less than sixteen pieces, which are scattered in all directions with great force. One great advantage claimed for those shells is the facility they would afford in setting fire to the woods, and especially in the locality of masked batteries. They would also be effective against cavalry, not only by throwing the ranks into disorder, but by causing great destruction upon bursting. They have also a smaller missile which can be thrown from a paper mortar to a considerable distance, and presenting a ball fire two feet in circumference. A mortar and twenty of these missiles can be easily carried by one man, and would be particularly useful at night in setting fire to the woods and driving the enemy from their strong-hold.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A ROCKET BRIGADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A ROCKET BRIGADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b9357b43-1393-5eb8-af2d-bd93896d19b1,400,nyt://article/b9357b43-1393-5eb8-af2d-bd93896d19b1

"Henry Farrington vs. John W. Latson. -- The plaintiff in this action having enlisted in the regiment now in course of construction by Col. Latson, the defendant, which regiment is at present in camp at Staten Island, and, as alleged, the said plaintiff having been guilty of a breach of discipline, after being sworn and mustered into the service of the United States, he was arrested by order of the Colonel and shut up in the guard-house. After he had obtained his release he proceeds to the City, obtains the services of a lawyer, and commences an action for false imprisonment, with an order of arrest against the Colonel. The Colonel, while on business in the City relative to his command, was arrested by the Sheriff and placed in custody. A motion now comes before the Court for the discharge of the defendant from arrest. The defendant presented an affidavit of the foregoing facts, and claims that he is not liable upon civil process. It is also argued that, if any disorderly member of a regiment at his own option can cause the arrest of his commanding officer upon civil process, such puts an end to all discipline, and will result in the total demoralization of regiments or companies, and defeat the purpose for which such regiment was enlisted. The Court, however, refused to decide the question upon the spot, but allowed the plaintiff's Attorney another day to present further affidavits upon the question. Col.

Latson. -- The plaintiff in this action having enlisted in the regiment now in course of construction by Col. Latson, the defendant, which regiment is at present in camp at Staten Island, and, as alleged, the said plaintiff having been guilty of a breach of discipline, after being sworn and mustered into the service of the United States, he was arrested by order of the Colonel and shut up in the guard-house. After he had obtained his release he proceeds to the City, obtains the services of a lawyer, and commences an action for false imprisonment, with an order of arrest against the Colonel. The Colonel, while on business in the City relative to his command, was arrested by the Sheriff and placed in custody. A motion now comes before the Court for the discharge of the defendant from arrest. The defendant presented an affidavit of the foregoing facts, and claims that he is not liable upon civil process. It is also argued that, if any disorderly member of a regiment at his own option can cause the arrest of his commanding officer upon civil process, such puts an end to all discipline, and will result in the total demoralization of regiments or companies, and defeat the purpose for which such regiment was enlisted. The Court, however, refused to decide the question upon the spot, but allowed the plaintiff's Attorney another day to present further affidavits upon the question. Col. Latson requested the Court to designate some officer in whose custody he was to remain; that he had been treated insultingly and tyrannically by the Under-Sheriff, and, although he had offered ample bail, it had been refused, and he was still in the custody of the Sheriff, while his regiment was being neglected.

It appears from the evidence of witnesses that deceased was a young married woman, of intemperate and dissolute habits, and for several months past resided with OWEN FAGAN, at No. 35 Prospect-street, in the capacity of housekeeper. On Monday evening last, about 81/2 o'clock, she went into Mrs.MCNULTY's store, in the same building where she resided, to borrow a phial. She said to Mrs. MCNULTY, ""before this time to-morrow night there will be a bully old time."" Deceased handed Mrs. MCNULTY fifty cents on account, and remarked: ""There is all I have got for you to-night, and God pay you the rest."" A short time after 9 o'clock the same night, two boys saw deceased going down Jersey-avenue, towards Hoboken, in company with a man whom they did not know. This was the last trace of her alive. A sister testified that deceased had attempted to destroy her life eight or ten times within the past seven years, by taking laudanum; and it was also shown that on various occasions she had threatened to destroy her life. Dr. W.J. HADDAN, City Physician, made a post-mortem examination. He found several bruises about the arms and legs. An examination of the internal organs showed that there was not sufficient disease existing to have caused death. The stomach and part of the intestines were removed, and a portion of their contents were analyzed by himself and ROBERT BIRCH. They found arsenic, and the Doctor was satisfied that death was caused by poison. The case was submitted to the Jury shortly before 11 o'clock, and the following verdict was rendered: ""That ELLEN BRACKEN came to her death by taking arsenic, but whether administered by herself or by some other person the Jury are unable to say.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-Jersey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-Jersey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-08-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10c7c7fa-585c-5577-95be-3504b2551ec0,632,nyt://article/10c7c7fa-585c-5577-95be-3504b2551ec0

Judge BEEBE, counsel for the prisoner, after consulting with his client, stated that Mr. MACHADO preferred not to give bail, but wished for an examination, and if he did not get it to-day he should demand his discharge. At this point Mr. DONOHUE, associate counsel for the prisoner, asked for the affidavit on which the warrant for the arrest of the prisoner was based, and on examining it, discovered, to his surprise, that It was entirely insufficient to justify the retention of the prisoner. The affidavit was made by a man in Boston, who is himself under indictment fur being engaged in the Slave-trade, and was sworn to before one THOMPSON D. LOTHROP, of Suffolk County, Mass. Upon this state of facts counsel demanded the immediate discharge of Mr. MACHADO on the ground that there was no proof before the Commissioner that Mr. LOTHROP was in reality a Justice of the Peace for Massachusetts, or, indeed, that there was any such man in existence.

The London Times' City Article again warns English capitalists against the probable consequences of lending their money to the Government of Washington. The writer says:  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/08/30/archives/the-american-call-for-money.html,,"""The Morrill Tariff, which commercially assimilates the United States with the most retrograde countries in the world, is not only to be maintained but to be increased in force by the imposition of additional duties. At the same time the Secretary of the Treasury is to be empowered to put forth an apparently unlimited creation of Treasury notes for amounts equivalent to L1 and L2 each ""for national circulation."" We are consequently to witness in combined action the two influences of a protective and prohibitory Custom-house system, and a paper currency of the most enticing and dangerous description. Coupled with this there is to be an income tax of 3 per cent. on all incomes of L160 per annum, which will leave entirely untouched the great mass of the people who regulate the politics of the nation, and which will depend for its amount upon the voluntary honesty of the returns sent in by the remainder. The measure was to apply in fair proportion to landed property, but the Western farmers would not submit to this, and the House of Representatives, it said, ""wisely gave way to their objections."" A tax of 2s. on silver watches and of 4s. on gold watches, as well as of 4s. to L1.0 on carriages, according to their quality, an excise on spirits and beer, an increased duty on sugar, and entirely new duties on tea and coffee, are among the other means by which it is hoped to add a few millions sterling to the revenue. The cost of collection in a wide country like America must, of course, be enormous, and 15 per cent. is to be offered to each State that will perform that task for itself, and thus save the necessity of providing a separate and costly machinery on the part of the General Government. The nine seceding States are reckoned among the contributories each in their proportion, and after they shall have been coerced back into the Union, and have ruined themselves as far as possible by their efforts in war, they will, therefore, have to meet heavy arreors while they are voluntarily voting the supplies to provide the dividends on such National loans as may have been raised for bringing them to obedience. The journals hold out that, ""of course, they do not anticipate any such state of things as the income tax becoming permanent, as has been the case in Great Britain;"" but the substitute that is to be found for it, when the results of borrowing enormous sums at 10 and 12 per cent. interest shall come to be truly felt, is not even hinted at. The National expenditure is now estimated, on good authority, to be going on at the rate of L75,000,000 per annum, exclusive of the distinct and sovereign expenditure of the thirty-four States. The ordinary National revenue, from all sources, is about L16,000,000. Supposing the new duties to yield the L4,000,000 or L6,000,000 anticipated, there remains about L50,000,000 or L60,000,000 to be obtained by loans in the shape of issues, either of stock, Treasury bonds, or notes for national circulation. At present, with an amount of bullion in the New-York banks far exceeding any sum ever before known, and while the money pressure from the new order of things has scarcely yet been practically felt, the lowest rate at which the Government can borrow, even for short periods, is ten per cent. What will be the charge when specie rapidly flows out in consequence of the gigantic expenditure, when a severe money market operates together with political distrust, and when it is found that three months' loans are as bad and deceptive as three months' enlistments? Already we have assertions that the votes in Congress have destroyed the credit of the Government, and that it could not now get L4,000,000 on any terms, in the New-York market, while the most hopeful and strongest friends of the Administration go no further than to allege that the Government credit will still prove good, ""if"" its financial scheme is broad enough to meet the necessities of the case; if, after the fashion of Mexico and Turkey, specific branches of revenue are pledged as security; and if L10,000,000 or L20,000,000 of paper circulation is put out. Under the circumstances, the most earnest wish of the friends of America must be that the difficulties thus in sight may accumulate with sufficient rapidity to bring both North and South to reason. If they were to be staved off by funds from Europe, the lenders would richly deserve that share of the bitter results which would be certain speedily to fall upon them.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMERICAN CALL FOR MONEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE AMERICAN CALL FOR MONEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-08-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd65838b-6f22-5ab0-9df2-99f0cd48a65a,774,nyt://article/dd65838b-6f22-5ab0-9df2-99f0cd48a65a

MCCUNN has been promulgated, and is fully indorsed by Gen. MCCLELLAN, who seems to think it is quite too lenient.

Mr. WEISSMAN opposed especially the item of fees for reporting to the Secretary of State the names of the parties convicted in the various Courts of the City. The bill was much discussed by Messrs. PORDY, BLUNT and others, but was finally ordered paid. The report on the tax levy was called up; but on motion of Mr. PURDY, it was laid over till Monday at2 P.M., for the purpose of enabling the Committee to examine more fully into some of the items containedin it; for although the law forbade the Board from in-creasing the sum total it was discretionary with them to make reductions. Mr. PURDY offered a resolution authorizing the Special Committee on Building a new Court-house, to employ an architect to prepare plans and Specifications therefor, and to proceed with the erection of said Court-house with all possible dispatch; to purchase all materials necessary therefor, and to have such parts of the same as they deemed best erected by days' work only, or by contract at their option; all contracts made by the Committee to be binding on the County, after being approved by the Board; and that the Comptroller be directed to pay all bills presented to him out of the $280,000 appropriated for that purpose, on being properly vouched and audited by the Committee, which was adopted unanimously.
