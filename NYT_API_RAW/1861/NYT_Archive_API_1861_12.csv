"-- The trial in this case has resulted in the conviction of the accused, who has been sentenced to be executed on the 7th day of February next. His guilt was beyond question, and the Judge, in pronouncing sentence, was clearly of the opinion that it was well merited, and should be carried into effect. We trust it will. It would be a violation of every principle of humanity for the President to interpose, and, in effect, to nullify the law against the Slave-trade. Of a cargo of 1,000 slaves taken from the coast of Africa for the West Indies, at least one-quarter, or 250 on the average, fell victims to the voyage, and are literally slaughtered in cold blood. Capt. GORDON is as responsible for the death of those lost on the voyage of the Erie, as if he had taken the life of each by his own hand. For once, when no doubt exists as to guilt, a terrible example should be made. It will do more to put a stop to the slave trade than a dozen war vessels on the African Coast. But this coast, the present war has compelled us to leave almost entirely unguarded -- only a single ship being detailed for this purpose. Immunity extended to Capt. GORDON would undoubtedly lead to the fitting out, in our town harbor, of a large number of vessels for the trade. The Augusta, just seized, is a good illustration in point. She came very near escaping the clutches of the law. Nothing will deter people from engaging in this infamous but profitable traffic, but the fact that detection and conviction is certain to cost the life of the offenders. To pardon Capt.

"The text chosen by Rev. Mr. SMITH was II Chron., ch. xx., verses 21-22. He commenced his sermon with a terse and forcible portrayal of the contrast between the condition of the country now, and as it had been when we came together to celebrate former Thanksgiving days. Whilst acknowledging that we are now suffering Divine chastisement, he contended that the war, for many reasons, was a cause for thankfulness; that, though an evil, great good would come out of it; that, even as a chastisement, coming as it does from God, we should thank our Heavenly Father for punishing us in the promotion of our good. The main point in the preacher's discourse, however, lay in his exposition of the way in which Slavery must be affected by the war. He said the Providence of God is working a solution of the most perplexing and dangerous question that has ever agitated our national councils. He has taken it out of our hands, except so far as we are instruments in the process. By a method unexpected, unsought, and which would have been deprecated and dreaded on all sides, He is practically determining what men have theorized about in vain. Ravings and objurgations pass for nothing. Theories of divine right and pleas for unconstitutional violence are alike pushed aside as cobwebs from the path of God's movements. There is almost a universal disposition to do as the army of Judah did -- stand still and see the salvation of God. We can no longer direct. We must follow -- reverently -- humbly. And, while we cannot believe that unreasoning passion will be gratified, we are assured that God will be honored in the issue. In His own good time and in His own way, He will make oppression to cease, and humble the pride of those who have sought to sacrifice the liberties of a mighty people on the shrine of their Moloch. * * * That the system or institution, in whose interests this rebellion is carried forward, is the sole cause of this wickedness, I see not how any one can believe who reads and understands history. That it has a vast deal to do with it, and is made the grand rallying cry for the abettors of this treachery, none can deny. And who will venture to say that God is sending this tempest into our political atmosphere only to leave the clouds as dark and ominous when it is over, and the thunderings as deep and dreadful -- significant of a fierce conflict of the elements still. It cannot be. I would rather believe that, here and now, we are to meet our ruin or find our salvation, and that God, when his time comes, will show us what he means by those sweet words of Jesus: ""The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty those that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.""

Should a reconciliation, or reconstruction be proposed, these men would still be the most efficient allies and advocates of the South. We do not question their loyalty, however much their sympathies may draw them in another direction. But these very men, either by accident or design, seem to have been the special target for rebel malevolence. This is as unkind as it is unwise. The steamer Nashville, on her voyage to England, seized and wantonly burned a magnificent ship, owned by a gentleman in this City, who has always been one of the staunchest and most unwavering defenders of Southern rights, and most closely identified with the rebels in business relations. But nothing is sacred against these ruthless destroyers. Friend and foe are alike sacrificed by them. Society among them is based upon the denial of the right of a man to own himself. From such premises it is not a great stretch to proclaim war upon all other kinds of property, irrespective of its ownership. It is everywhere destruction. Witness the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the managers of which were in close sympathy with the rebels, and were only overawed from identifying themselves with them by the overwhelming power of Government. This did not save their road, however. In Kentucky the first step of the rebels was to destroy as far as lay in their power, the public works of the State, which friends as well as foes were interested in preserving. This passion for destruction they turn upon themselves the moment they give way to the advance of the Government forces. Wherever the National troops gain foothold, they find that devastation has preceded them. The rebels are thus fast revealing their true character, and fast weakening the hold they had, not upon the sympathies of the peace party of the North, but of the world.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Ingratitude.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Ingratitude.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b9ebf95f-835b-5af8-b02a-2fb2543e018b,346,nyt://article/b9ebf95f-835b-5af8-b02a-2fb2543e018b,

"A SINGULAR CASE -- MELANCHOLY DEATH OF AN ARMY AT THE METROPOLITAN HOTEL. -- The Coroner held an inquest yesterday afternoon, at the Metropolitan Hotel, upon the body of Maj. DANIEL J. SUTHERLAND, late of the United States Army, who was found dead in his room at that hotel, at an early hour yesterday morning. The facts of the case as developed by the evidence given at the inquest, were as follows: Maj. SUTHERLAND arrived at the Metropolitan Hotel on Thanksgiving day, from Philadelphia. After dinner, on Friday, he went up to his room, attended by a waiter of the hotel. This was the last that was seen of him alive. About 4 o'clock yesterday morning, the night-watchman was passing through the hall near deceased's room, and saw the door open and the gas burning. Thinking this unusual at so late an hour, he walked to the door, said there saw SUTHERLAND lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He at once notified the Clerk in the office. Dr. QUACKENROSS was sent for, who came and made an examination. Upon the inquest the Doctor testified as follows: ""I found him lying on the floor in a pool of blood; he was dead, the body cold; he had probably been dead two hours when I saw him; I found that he had a contussed wound over his right eye, and a lasceration of the scalp on the left side of the head; I searched the room and everything in it, but could find no weapon of any kind, not even a pocket-knife; he had all his clothes on, even to his hat; I was present at the post-mortem examination, and, in my opinion, the immediate cause of his death was exhaustion from hemorrhage and congestion of the membranes of the brain."" Dr. BOUTON, who made the post-mortem, testified that he found a contused lacerated wound on the nose, an inch in length; also a similar wound over the right eye, and a smaller wound on the left parietal bone. The body was in a bloodless condition.

FULTON, a drover, hailing from the interior of the State, yesterday related a little of his experience in the City with a class of men familiarly known as ""pocket-book droppers."" The complaint, as taken before the Justice at the Tombs, states in substance that about two weeks since, as Mr. FULTON was passing along one of the streets in the City, he felt something suddenly strike against one of his feet. Uponlooking down he saw a well-filled pocket-book upon the walk. At that instant two men approached him, and one of them remarked that he had dropped his wallet.

The swindler then went on with the same old story -- that the money had been lost by some one who would offer a large reward for its return, that they were strangers in the City, just leaving for home, &c. The pocket-book in the meantime was examined, and found to contain four double eagles, six one hundred-dollar bills and quite a number of a smaller denomination. They ended by proposing that Mr. FULTON should give them $100, and he might keep the pocketbook and obtain the reward. After some hesitation, he gave them $40; and the two strangers, being in haste to reach the cars, suddenly left. Mr. FULTON found great difficulty in opening his prize after their departure, but at last, when he succeeded in getting at the contents, he found them composed entirely of pieces of old newspaper.

The orator was Judge PETIGRU, a man known in Charleston and throughout South Carolina, for his honorable life, his upright character, and high judicial attainments. The occasion was the response of the latter to a writ of garnishment which had been served upon him, based upon the rebel act sequestrating the property of Union men.

In the House, also, Mr. ELIOT introduced resolution, advising the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the army, to issue an order of general emancipation whenever such action should be demanded by military necessities -- which resolutions were afterwards amended so as to apply only to the slaves of disloyal citizens. Other resolutions on the subject were offered by CAMPBELL, of Pennsylvania, and by THAD. STEVENS, of the same State, one looking to legislative and the other to military action on the question. These signs indicate that the slave question is likely to occupy the most prominent part in congressional discussion and action this session. If the vote on tabling Mr. ELIOT's resolution is any indication of the divisions of parties, it would seem that opinion is pretty closely divided -- at all events on military abolition.

The customary joint committee was appointed to wait on the President, and notify him that they were ready to receive any communication he might be pleased to make and he signified his intention to send in his Message to-day, at noon. Previous to the adjournment of the Senate, Mr. TRUMBULL, of Illinois' gave notice that he will introduce a bill to confiscate the property of rebels, and give freedom to persons in Slave States, and Mr. WILKINSON, of Minnesota, similar notice of a bill to abolish the distinction between regulars and volunteers. In the House a number of new members were sworn in, among them Mr. MAYNARD, of Tennessee. There was some question as to his right to a seat, but it was explained that he was elected before the secession of Tennessee, and there was no further objection. The case of Mr. FOSTER, represented to have been elected from the Hatteras District of North Carolina, was referred to the Committee on Elections, as was that of Mr. SEGAR, holding a certificate of election from Eastern Virginia. A joint resolution of thanks to Capt. WILKES, for his arrest of MASON and SLIDELL, was passed. A resolution was passed expelling JOHN REID, member of the House from the Fifth District of Missouri, he having taken up arms against the Government. Mr. COLFAX, of Indiana, offered a preamble and resolution, which were unanimous-adopted, requesting the President to direct the confinement of the Rebel Envoy MASON in the cell of a convicted, felon, until Col. CORCORAN shall be treated by the rebels as the United States have treated all prisoners taken by them on the battle-field. It was subsequently decided to advise the same treatment of SLIDELL, in reference to the imprisonment of Col. WOOD. Mr. ELIOT, of Massachusetts, then offered a series of resolutions, solemnly declaring that the war now pending is simply waged by the Government for the suppression of the rebellion and the reestablishment of the Union, but twisting upon the right of the President to emancipate all persons held as slaves in any military district in a state of insurrection against the Government, and advising such a course. The Souse refused to table the resolution, 70 against [???], but its consideration was postponed for a week. Various other resolutions on the same subject were offered for future consideration. On motion of ROSCOE A. CONKLING, of New-York, the Secretary of War was requested to inform the House whether any steps had been taken to ascertain who was responsible for the disaster at Ball's Bluff.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f02fbff-fc5f-5964-bb5c-8e9f8f7be619,1121,nyt://article/4f02fbff-fc5f-5964-bb5c-8e9f8f7be619,

The fact that the slaves of that region, -- the most ignorant, secluded, and the least likely to be informed of the objects and progress of the war, refused to follow their masters when ordered away, and came voluntarily to our troops for protection, shows conclusively that we can paralyze whatever power Slavery contributes to the rebellion, just as fast as our armies penetrate the interior.

The crowd in attendance was less numerous far less enthusiastic, and infinitely less belligerent than of old. Still, there was a certain kind of joy manifested as the returns came in -- a joy not unlike that which one feels on seeing a bully antagonist, whom he is unable to whip himself, soundly thrashed by a third party, even though he has no particular liking for party No. 3. It appeared to be glory enough for one night to know that the great FERNANDO was whipped, even though Tammany did not apply the lash. And when the gradually accumulating returns indicated that WOOD was the third in the race, and that the great Mozart organization had finally dwindled down to a tail of the Tammany kite, shouts of triumph rendered the air scarcely less boisterous than if Tammany herself had been victorious. The early returns were quite favorable to GUNTHER, and the crowd that had congregated in the lower halls, previous to the opening of the Hall, began to get quite enthusiastic with the idea that their candidate was elected. Then it was that the utter insignificance and contemptuousness of FERNANDO and his faction were vividly portrayed. Above the din and cackle of the jabbering throng, through the clouds of smoke, and the all-pervading fumes of whisky, could be heard the constantly repeated declaration, that ""WOOD was played out;"" ""WOOD's gone in;"" ""WOOD's nowhere;"" ""D -- n WOOD;"" ""$500 to $200 that GUNTHER's our next Mayor,"" -- (this remark came from a man who had just borrowed six cents to get a drink;) ""Three cheers for GUNTHER."" At length it was announced that the doors of the Council Chamber were open, and the crowd rushed up stairs. Mr. JAMES NESBIT took the stand, and called the meeting to order. He said they had assembled to hear the returns of the election of C. GODFREY GUNTHER as Mayor of New-York. [Cheers for GUNTHER.] He had not much to say, himself, but would call on his friend, Mr. BOGERT, Mr. BOGERT not answering the call, there were cries for ""CORNELL! Senator CORNELL!"" Senator CORNELL also failed to respond, although he was in the hall, and there were calls for EBLING.

"When the monastic walls of the Brooklyn Academy of Music were unveiled to the heathen eye of this City, there was a vile architectural scandal that the place when it had done growing would become a church.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/04/archives/amusements.html,,"When the monastic walls of the Brooklyn Academy of Music were unveiled to the heathen eye of this City, there was a vile architectural scandal that the place when it had done growing would become a church. The severity of this judgment was subsequently modified when the Board sanctioned the performance of ""Don Giovanni"" and ""La Traviata,"" works which are not regarded as strictly Eclusiastical in their character. Still there was a churchiness about the establishment notwithstanding an occasional concession to the flesh and the devil, that made the itinerant sinner tremble in his musical shoes. The Board, an awful Institution, of fabulous numbers, mediaeval austerity and unimpeachable virtue, pervaded the lobbies, lingered on the staircases, guarded the stage, and creaked in all the private boxes. The Board, to say the least of it, struck terror into the bosoms of infidel managers, abashed the most reckless of that desperate band who persist in selling books in English and 1 -- taitan, and gave the thoughtful critic a piquant theme for home elaboration. Indeed, although one usually got wet and chilled by visiting the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it was impossible to resist the reflection that one must be the better for it, here or hereafter; and this penitential comfort we are glad to see is still, not to be denied us. A gentleman who has recently arrived from the sister city, where he enjoys the distinguished disfavor of several members of the Board, and who we are bound to confess, lusts carnally for the price of his shares, and is therefore an object of just suspicion informs us that the Academy will fulfill its destiny and at no distant day have an organ, and a choir, and a popular preacher, and a number of enthusiasts with dishes for the eleemosynary dime. So many theatres go to the bad that the happy destiny of this one would rejoice us but for a grave query: What is to become of the Board, and the pleasing and picturesque tableaux which the members thereof were wont to present to the profane gaze on opera nights? Next to the condition of Mexico, it is surely one of the most perplexing questions of the day. The Board would undoubtedly draw at BARNUM's but in that wicked establishment theatrica entertainments are permitted; moreover an undue preponderance of white choker might throw the Belunga off his balance and cause the Hippopotamus to yawn even more clamorously than he does at present -- a result which we may reasonably suppose would be fatal to that friendly power. It is this matter of theatrical entertainments, indeed, that endangers the very existence of the Board. There are stockholders, it must be known, who desire to witness the drama. In a memorial to the Board, they expressed this wish adding (as a frivolous reason for some attention from that august body,) that they owned a majority of the stock. The matter was brought before the Board, and a warm discussion ensued. It was decided that the Secretary should address a circular to each individual stockholder, requesting him to state whether he is in favor of or opposed to letting the building for dramatic performances, under proper supervision and restrictions. The answers are to be sent in by Thursday of next week. In the meantime, seven members of the Board have issued a circular warning the stockholders of the awful peril that awaits them, and exhorting them to think twice before they ""incur the risk of converting what is now a prejudice against the drama into a feeling of hostility to the Academy itself."" And then, in a more touching vein, the Seven -- who speak for the Board much as the three tailors of Tooley-street spoke for the people of England -- continue:",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/979240ee-65f5-5287-bf92-47ef954215ee,1382,nyt://article/979240ee-65f5-5287-bf92-47ef954215ee,

A year ago, or thereabout, Dr. LINARES, who had succeeded to the Presidency of Bolivia, after thirty six attempts at revolution, was in turn thrust aside by a military conspiracy headed by Gen. ACHA; the conspirators, scarcely an hour before they drew the sword against LINARES, having broken bread at his table. The Ex-President went to Valparaiso, and died there only last month. Gen. ACHA, of course, on his accession to power, found Ex-President BELZU, Ex-President CORDOVA, the son-in-law of the latter, and the friends of Dr. LINARES all leagued against him, and inciting the people to revolution. But having organized quite a large military force, under the pretence that Bolivia was to be attacked by Peru, he was able to suffocate easily all rebellions and to defy his enemies. On the morning of the 30th September last, one of these attempts against ACHA was made by the friends of BELZU, at La Paz, but was not very well supported, and about forty of the principal men of the city, who were charged with being the leaders, were seized and thrown into prison. La Paz, a city of 60,000 inhabitants, was declared in a state of siege, and Gen. PLACIDO YANEZ appointed military commandante. The city became tranquil again, but nevertheless, a good deal of dissatisfaction existed among the friends of the prisoners, that they should be kept in confinement without trial, and there were undoubtedly threats made that they would be violently rescued. Gen. YANEZ, it is charged, wishing to get rid of these leaders, instigated a sham emeute in the vicinity of their prisons, the object being made to appear to rescue them from the authorities. Accordingly at 12 1/2 on the morning of the 23d of October, a cry of ""Viva CORDOVA!"" was raised in front of his prison, when a sharp fusilade was heard for a few moments, and then all was still. Sixty of the principal men of Bolivia had been murdered -- some of them in their beds, and all in a defenceless condition, without arms, and one hundred and eighty poor Indians, or cholos, as an excuse for this massacre, were shot down like dogs in the streets! Among the prominent men assassinated, and who had been identified in the Pantheon, were:",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BOLIVIA,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BOLIVIA,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2faa4c80-ed03-5937-a336-d0de212c57ee,828,nyt://article/2faa4c80-ed03-5937-a336-d0de212c57ee,

"Coroner SCHIRMER held an inquest, yesterday afternoon, at the Sixteenth Precinct Station-house, in West Twenty-seventh-street, upon the body of PATRICK MCCUE, who came to his death on Tuesday evening last, by being shot with a pistol in the hands of THOMPSON MARTIN. A pretty full account of the affray was published in yesterday's TIMES, and the evidence taken upon the inquest has developed very few facts, not already made public. There were a large number of witnesses examined, and the inquest was not concluded until a late hour last evening. From the evidence of JOHN H. MCGINNESS, WILLIAM H. BULL, and several others, it appears that MARTIN fired the pistol at a time when he was closely pursued by a gang of Tenth-avenue ""roughs;"" that the attacking party had twice overthrown the box where he and his brother were engaged in distributing Opdyke tickets, and after beating the brother, JAS. MARTIN, in such a manner as to render him insensible, they turned upon him. He saw there was no chance for him to successfully resist so large a number. He, therefore, turned and fled, the crowd pursuing. He ran some distance, but finding himself closely pressed, he stopped short, drew a pistol from his pocket, and fired at random into the crowd. The shot took effect upon MCCUE, the ball penetrating his brain, and causing death almost instantly. MARTIN was immediately arrested by Officer ATKINSON, and held until last evening. At the conclusion of the testimony the jury rendered a verdict to the effect that the deceased, PATRICK MCCUE, came to his death, on the 3d day of December inst., by a pistol-shot from a pistol in the hands of THOMPSON MARTIN, and that said MARTIN was justified in the firing of the pistol, it having been done in self-defence.

About the banners of this modern Balfour of Burley, the faithful throng -- faithful men, who have testified their zeal by serviceable bridge-burnings, and the timely rescue of loyalists set upon by rebel murderers.

And victory, even by the rebel reports, was on the side of the gallant Parson. Now, as the Confederate Cabal has set the hitherto unquestionable example of selecting for Major-Generalships clergymen of Tennessee, and in the case of Bishop POLK, of a clergyman whose victories had all been achieved with the spiritual arm, there is precedent and reason, we conceive, in bestowing the same grade upon that notable Anabaptist, WILLIAM BROWNLOW.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Heroism in East Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Heroism in East Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f88a83a-98f3-5dfe-adea-0ae022a02083,489,nyt://article/0f88a83a-98f3-5dfe-adea-0ae022a02083,

After NELSON's victories, in the commencement of the present century, this position of preeminence was tacitly admitted by European nations; and it was not until within a very few years past that England's supremacy on the sea was in any manner disputed by her Continental rivals. During the Crimean war, no Russian fleet ventured within gun-shot of the English flag, either in the Black Sea or in the Baltic. We then heard of no such instance as our own National conflict has evoked, of an enemy's ship venturing from the protection of her forts to challenge an adventurous rival to single combat. It was said at the time that no fleet like that which Admiral NAPIER took to the Baltic had ever before been manned and equipped; and when, a couple of years later, England sought consolation for misfortunes and disappointments, in a grand exhibition before the world of her immense naval armaments, her own citizens at least felt satisfied that the supremacy of their navy was still secure, and that it only failed to achieve such triumphs as had distinguished it half a century previous, because there was no enemy bold enough to dispute its superiority on the ocean.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BRITISH NAVY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BRITISH NAVY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4208b7a2-4db5-575f-a118-bc991b37b275,1983,nyt://article/4208b7a2-4db5-575f-a118-bc991b37b275,

Gen. VIELE's expedition had not yet sailed, but was expected to leave immediately upon the arrival of an expected accession of troops. Beaufort still remained unoccupied, but was visited daily by officers of the army and navy, and the two gunboats kept watch and ward over her fortunes. During the few days which preceded the sailing of the Vanderbilt, stables had been constructed on Hilton Head Island for 1,100 horses; numerous ordnance storehouses had been erected, and the intrenchments across the island had been completed and the guns mounted. In addition to all this, several important reconnoissances had been made, which had resulted in establishing the fact that the whole seaboard, from Tybee Island to Charleston, is virtually in the hands of the National forces, it having been deserted by the white inhabitants. On Otter Point, at the northern extremity of St. Helena Sound, a fieldwork was found, which had mounted four or five guns, but it was entirely abandoned, as were also a battery on the Ashepoo and one on the Coosaw Rivers. The greatest distance touched inland was twelve miles, and the reconnoitering party approached within thirty-two miles from Charleston. The blacks everywhere seem to have remained behind when their masters fled, and welcomed our men with rejoicing. In some instances the cotton houses were set on fire on the approach of the Union troops, but this incendiary movement was by no means so general as the Charleston papers would have us suppose. Immense quantities of the staple are all ready for transportation, and under the regulations recently issued by Secretary CHASE, will soon be feeding the looms of the North.

Whether this navy will prove as efficient as that which gave France the supremacy of the seas under LOUIS XIV., or equal to that which balanced the fortunes of England under LOUIS XVI., is a question which the peaceful state in which these two powerful nations have lived, since 1815, prevents us from deciding. As far, however, as the small expeditions in which the French navy has been engaged for the last thirty years, affords us the opportunity to judge, it has not descended from the rank it occupied at the time when the names of TOURVILLE and JEAN BART, DE SUFFREN and D'ESTAING, illustrated that branch of the military service. Thus, the bold manoeuvre of Admiral ROUSSIN, forcing the entry of the Tagus, in 1831; the expedition of Ancona, in 1832; the taking of San Juan d'Ulloa, in 1838; the bombardment of Tangiers, in 1844; and, above all, the expedition of the Crimea, in 1856; and the embarkment of the army of Italy, in 1859, shows on the part of the officers a decision and a skill equal to that displayed by the English during the same period; while the administration of the naval service in all its branches evinces a real superiority over their mighty rivals.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRENCH NAVY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRENCH NAVY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e45fc40a-48ee-5e38-bd37-634100a2d52b,1818,nyt://article/e45fc40a-48ee-5e38-bd37-634100a2d52b,

"The reconstruction of the grades in the naval service recommended by Secretary WELLES in his Report, is a natural necessity of the immensely increased proportions which our marine has taken on under the inspiration of the war. There is no doubt that the efficiency of this important arm of the public service will be greatly increased by instituting the proposed changes, thus bringing up the system to the needs of the times. Secretary WELLES suggests the establishment of several new naval grades. Thus, the Lieutenant-Commanders, a grade used during the Revolution, may be employed as First-Lieutenants, and in the command of the smaller classes of naval vessels. Further, it is recommended that a grade to be designated Flag-Officer be established (the number limited to seven) to command the squadron to which he may be assigned, the appointment (except when the officer receives the thanks of Congress, on the recommendation of the President, for gallant conduct in battle) to cease when he hauls down his flag. It should be noted, that though certain Commanders (as, for example, Commodore DUPONT) are now spoken off as Flag-Officers, the title is purely by courtesy. But why would it not have been better had the title of Admiral, borne in almost every navy in the world, been assigned to the new grade instead of that of Flag-Officer.

Theodore Barealow, conductor of the train by which he was run over, testified to finding the deceased in a Central Railroad car, and being a commuter on the New-Jersey Railroad, he was given a choice of three things: First, to pay ten cents; second, that he would stop the train and allow him to get into one of the New-Jersey Railroad cars, which were in the rear, or that he might pass through the train while in motion, and get into the car in which he belonged. To this Mr. Jones objected at first, but on seeing the conductor place his hand on the bell-rope in order to stop the train, he consented to pass through while they were in motion; in stopping from the central Railroad car to one of the New-Jersey Railroad -- a distance of nearly two feet -- he fell through, and the remainder of the train passed over his body. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the above facts, stating that as the ""danger was heightened by a difference of some six inches in height between the platforms of the connecting trains, the jury are of the opinion that the conductor of the Central Railroad is censurable for not holding his lamp, it being very dark, and seeing him safe in the car of the New-Jersey Railroad.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e9df40b-d128-5677-a196-45e88933dc85,435,nyt://article/3e9df40b-d128-5677-a196-45e88933dc85,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/08/archives/agricultural-and-domestic.html,,"CULTIVATING MIXED VARIETIES OF WHEAT. -- Selected samples of distinct varieties of wheath are now generally cultivated in Scotland. It may be questioned however, if the practice has much to recommend it beyond securing a pure variety for sale or for resowing. At one time the wheat usually grown was a mixture or a number of varieties of white wheats, including velvet-eared, and occasionally bearded heads. There are districts in England and on the Continent, where a mixture is still preferred. In some instances in England, red and white wheats are grown mixed, from the belief that the produce of grain is on the whole more uniform, and larger, and the sample brings a higher price in the market, than when either the white or the red variety are grown separately. This is the general result in those localities where the wheat crop is liable to become affected with mildew. With more attention to the cultivation of wheat in Scotland, selection has been carried out, and the greater portion of the wheats in cultivation are true to their kinds. It is, therefore, important to ascertain whether, by cultivating genuine or unmixed varieties, the produce per acre is not impaired, and, as a consequence, the money return less, than when a mixture of varieties are grown. Several eminent physiologists state that a mixture of kinds of any of the seed-producing plants usually yield a larger amount of seeds; and this opinion is very general among farmers where the growing of mixtures of the cereals and leguminous plants are carried out. It is supposed by physiologists that the different varieties spread their roots at different depths in the soil, and thus draw a larger amount of the constituents of plant-life from the soil. Perhaps something is due to the difference of produce in the different varieties, arising from the character of the season, climate and soil. There are several recorded experiments which support this belief, but more experiments are required to elucidate this question. -- North British Agriculturist.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68245258-1c25-5abc-8087-e47644ac8d67,1756,nyt://article/68245258-1c25-5abc-8087-e47644ac8d67,

WILKES. Of the two legs upon which its reasoning runs, neither is stout enough to sustain the probability of a war with England. The first consists in an assertion that the Trent was stopped in neutral seas. It is needless to cite authorities to determine the law if such be the fact. The Government of the United States is not prepared, we may. rest assured, to controvert any well grounded and universally received principles of the international code; and none of these is clearer than that the right of search and seizure is confined to the high seas, and can under no pretext be exercised in neutral waters. The case of the Caroline might seem to place England in the category of maintaining the negative in this proposition; but the instance is exceptional. If the Trent was actually stopped in British waters, it is purely gratuitous to assume that the American Government will persist in approving the arrest, in the face of its obvious impropriety.

The ferry-boats plying between here and Brooklyn made very slow time, and used every precaution to prevent accidents by ringing bells and sounding whistles. The same is true of the Jersey City ferry-boats. The boats running to Staten Island discontinued their trips for several hours. The Albany and Troy boats did not reach their piers till long after the time due. The City of New-York -- one of the Sound steamers -- arrived at her pier about 1 o'clock, having been delayed over seven hours. The other Boston steamers did not come in till late in the afternoon. The Eastern boats came in several hours behind time. The City of Boston, of the Norwich line, was compelled to anchor off Hampton until 11 A.M. She then resumed her trip, reaching her pier at 1 P.M. While coming down the East River she ran into a canal barge, causing it to sink within a short time. The name of the barge could not be ascertained. When endeavoring to enter her slip at the foot of Vestry-street, the steamer struck the bulkhead of the pier, damaging her to a considerable extent. The steamer Commonwealth, of the Stonington line, was detained off Port Morris during the fog, and arrived at 3 P.M. The steamer Metropolis, of the Fall River line, anchored off College Point until it cleared. She arrived at 2 1/2 P.M. The steamer Petrel, of the Providence line, arrived about 1 P.M. The steamship Chesapeake, for Portland, and many outward bound vessels ready for sea, are detained by the weather. The British steamship City of Manchester, for Liverpool, left her pier about 3 1/2 P.M., and proceeded down the Bay, but probably anchored at Quarantine. A collision occurred at 1 o'clock P.M., between the Brooklyn ferry-boat Montague and a schooner, which was lying at anchor a short distance from the slip. The Montague had one of her cabins stove in, while the schooner escaped with only the loss of her bowsprit, it is believed that none of the passengers were injured, although they were all greatly frightened. The fog lifted about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but come on again more dense than ever at 4 o'clock, and had not lifted at a late hour last night.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e35b942d-1e5a-5082-bc5b-ff0fd6ea9daa,1268,nyt://article/e35b942d-1e5a-5082-bc5b-ff0fd6ea9daa,

It is only right that some compensation, beyond the mere pay of a private soldier, should be allowed to men on the recruiting service, because they are subject to expenses which a soldier on ordinary military duty does not incur.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ARMY AND NAVY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ARMY AND NAVY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/313d3e4d-0ebe-537c-b135-4c24ff966b5d,552,nyt://article/313d3e4d-0ebe-537c-b135-4c24ff966b5d,

With two or three exceptions, none of them have been invaded, yet the industry and prosperity of all, even of those most remote from threatened danger, have been as thoroughly wrecked as if blasted by the storm of war. Commerce in all is at an end. The people everywhere are subsisting upon what little of previous accumulations are still left them. The precious metals have long since disappeared from among them -- an unerring evidence of impending want. People hoard gold when they see that they will have to compete with others for those articles which sustain life, the supply of which is inadequate for all. Already has this competition commenced by the excessive prices paid for everything that goes into consumption. Articles which, before the war, were abundant almost as the air we breathe, are hardly to be had at any price. Even the great property of the South, slaves, are almost wholly unsalable; and measured by the price they bring, very nearly worthless. A property counted worth $4,000,000,000 a year ago, is not to-day worth $1,000,000,000 in the Southern markets. The tie that holds it being force, not law, is easily severed. The slightest disturbance disconnects the slave from his master. This disturbance has already set thousands free, and threatens, no matter what policy is adopted by either belligerent, the destruction of the institution -- as a system of Slavery worth maintaining can never be reestablished in the path of our armies. But worse than all, the labor, not only of the slave, but of all other kind, has ceased to produce anything that can supply the most pressing wants.

"The report of the Commissioner appointed by the Government of India to report on the cultivation of cotton is a thoroughly practical business-like document. It is confined to the cotton districts of the Doab, the districts lying between the Jumna and the Ganges, from the junction of the two rivers at Allahabad to the base of the Sewalic range of hills. This district contains all the elements of a good cotton field. It is extensive, embracing 25,901 square British statute miles, three-fourths of which are under cultivation; it is populous, having rather more than 350 persons to the mile, possessing, therefore, labor in abundance. It is generally of a light sandy soil of considerable depth, and of great fertility when duly irrigated, thus being well adapted to the growth of cotton; it possesses irrigation canals, with numerous branches, running nearly the whole length of the Doab, and traversing it in many directions; it is, therefore, in every respect, a good cotton field. Thirty, forty and fifty years ago it witnessed a considerable trade in cotton. Merchants and planters had cotton factories and cotton screws at Futtighur, Calpee, and Mirzapore. The trade gradually died away for want of a market for the cotton. The factories went to ruin, and the screws rotted away. The trade at present is in the hands of native merchants, and confined to home (Indian) consumption. The Commissioner observes: "" I have it on evidence from several native merchants that there are more than 50,000 bales of cotton at this moment at Mizarpore and Ghazeepore for which they cannot find purchasers. While, then, they hear on all sides that supplies of cotton to England from America have failed, while they are told that a great trade will spring up, and that hundreds of thousands of bales are wanted, while they see cotton seed distributed in all directions, and pamphlets teaching them how to cultivate by the astonishing facts that there is not one single purchaser among them, that their stocks of cotton are lying rotting at the marts of Mirzapore and Ghazeepore, and that the cry from Lancashire is merely a voice, and nothing more -- under these circumstances it will surprise no one to know that the breadth of cotton sown this year has been influenced only by their own probable home demands, and has in nowise been stimulated by the accounts from America or elsewhere."" The Commissioner states that when a real demand for cotton comes from England, a large and immediate supply could be sent from these provinces.

"Our American cousins have certainly the strangest method of making war that can well be imagined; and the affair of the Nashville, now lying at Southampton, and the Harvey Birch, now lying at the bottom of the sea, is not one of the least instances of the eccentricities of American warfare. The Nashville, it seems, a Confederate ship of war, comes here for the express purpose of bringing over an envoy from North Carolina, Col. PEYTON, on a special mission, we suppose, to the Government of this country, though what its nature is is not yet known. On its way the Nashville falls in with a Northern trading vessel, the Harvey Birch, going home in ballast from Havre to New-York; and the course the Nashville takes is, to bring the crew of the Harvey Birch on board the Nashville, to put them in irons, and then to burn and sink the ship. Now the maxim of war is well known, that one's business is to do the enemy as much harm and oneself as much good as possible. And, accordingly, when a war ship falls in with the enemy's traders, it is customary to take them and keep them, cargo and all; and ships of war roam the seas for this express purpose; but we do not remember hearing in warfare of any instance of a ship of war, expressly bound to a neutral country, to take there an official person, destroying the enemy's traders, when she can neither keep the ship or the cargo, if there be a cargo, nor make prisoners of the crew, being, by her very duty, obliged to go into the neutral port, where of course she could not be permitted to retain either ship, or cargo, or crew. Simply to destroy a vessel under such circumstances is a very unusual, and certainly seems a very wanton way of making war. With that, of course, we as Englishmen should have nothing to do, beyond having and expressing our opinion about it, if it in no way embroiled us. But we are as a neutral nation somewhat affected by the course taken by a war-ship of either of the belligerents, when she is coming into our ports on a mission to our Government, because that course may have a tendency to embrangle us with one or the other party. The Nashville, it seems, is some-what the worse for her passage, which has been a foul one, and is to go into one of the graving docks to be overhauled and refitted. Now, if she had come into our ports in a quiet way, merely bringing here the Confederate envoy and waiting to take him back again, and had received injury, we apprehend that the law of nations as regards neutral powers would not be very particular as to the extent and kind of assistance given in the neutral port to the disabled vessel. But it is a very different thing when she comes in red-handed, with prisoners in irons on board, whom she discharges in the neutral port. Under such circumstances everything beyond what is barely necessary to render her seaworthy may well be looked upon with jealousy by the belligerent power whose ship she has burned and destroyed, with no possible advantage to her own nation, except the destruction of an enemy's trading vessel.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/09/archives/the-nashville-not-entitled-to-supplies.html,,"Our American cousins have certainly the strangest method of making war that can well be imagined; and the affair of the Nashville, now lying at Southampton, and the Harvey Birch, now lying at the bottom of the sea, is not one of the least instances of the eccentricities of American warfare.

The Home School has only been established since June, yet is already largely patronized by the little ones orphaned by the war. It was intended at first to admit only those who had lost their mother, and were left to charity by their fathers having fallen in battle; but so great was the number of applicants, that now they take all children whose fathers bring them to their care previous to assuming army duties.

It is proposed to establish an interest in the regiments for the aid of the Volunteer fund, which shall levy upon them but once a month, and that for the small sum of one dollar, or more if they wish to give it. The Garibaldi Guard have promised to give $800 a year, made up of small contributions from their monthly pay.

"It was a good fortune to the person himself and to the world, that just before this terrible convulsion a candid, observing traveler and experienced agriculturist traveled the whole Southern country and carefully observed the effects of Slavery upon agriculture, upon manners, morals and social life. The same field will never be open again. Mr. OLMSTED has it all to himself. Whatever be the result of the rebellion, there can be no future opportunity for a dispassionate traveler to calmly watch and trace the features of a social system which belongs already to the past, and which the events of each day are rapidly changing. American Slavery can never be again altogether as it has been; it may even now be in the pangs of dissolution. However that may be, the future historian must seek in such pages as these of the well-known traveler and impartial observer, for the true characteristics and workings of the system. We have here traced by the hand not of an artist, but rather of a minute copyist, all those elements in the Southern population and their institutions which have burst forth in or have stimulated this gigantic and desperate outbreak. There is no apparent prejudice in OLMSTED's statements -- no even ordinary excitement, or enthusiasm in the expression of his conclusions. He gives us the clear simple daguerreotype of Southern life, and then leaves us to draw our own inferences. Sometimes the most fearful scenes are depicted with a sang froid which almost shocks one, until we see the intellectual object of this reserve. We behold in his sketches the shiftless, careless, lazy habits which Slavery naturally breeds; we stop at the dreary houses of the middle-class planters -- eat of the everlasting dyspepsia-giving hot bread and fat pork; talk with the surly women and the usually reticent men, whose conversation when excited becomes exuberant with oaths; we feel gradually, without ever being in so many words informed of it, the inherent ferocity and barbarity of society. The advantages also -- few though they be -- of the Southern system of labor are as faithfully given; the use of arms and the habits of command for which a class of masters or superiors to a servile class are naturally inclined, and the thoroughly disciplined and efficient ""organization of labor"" on some of the large cotton and sugar plantations, which perhaps could hardly be obtained without involuntary labor. The slave, too, is pictured with equal faithfulness -- perhaps some will think with too little sympathy, yet, no doubt, with perfect justice. His cost, his labor, his habits and diseases, his conversations and his spasmodic seasons of religious excitement and sentiment are most dramatically and closely described. Mr. OLMSTED has a certain nack of hearing and recording all the characteristic and droll stories, whether of white or black, which could meet a traveler at the South, while he gives certain conversations with a most vivid, life-like power. The result is that the book, apart from its great value as a book of information, is one of the most readable of the day.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/11/archives/new-publications-the-cotton-kingdom-by-fl-olmsted-mason-brothers.html,,"It was a good fortune to the person himself and to the world, that just before this terrible convulsion a candid, observing traveler and experienced agriculturist traveled the whole Southern country and carefully observed the effects of Slavery upon agriculture, upon manners, morals and social life.

It will end forever the long-standing jealousies and bickerings of Charleston and Savannah with regard to the advantages of their respective harbors.

"We publish elsewhere an interesting letter from Capt. WILKES to the Secretary of the Navy, on his arrest of MASON and SLIDELL. It gives an inside view of the affair, showing under what light, and with what views he performed the act. The public generally had been led to believe, from a remark which Capt.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/11/archives/brooklyn-news-a-just-warits-relation-to-a-nations-highest.html,,"Rev. Dr. STORRS last evening delivered a lecture at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, choosing for his subject the war in which the nation is now engaged, and the results likely to accrue from it to the people of this generation and their posterity. The lecturer having been introduced to a large and highly respectable audience, commenced his address with a general reference to history. He said that history is the biography of nations. It presents to us the vicissitudes of fortune through which nations have passed to greatness or decay. Each nation expects for itself a career of unexampled prosperity, and thinks it will somehow be exempted from the reverses that have befallen other nations. But all are liable to the same changes. These changes sometimes come unexpectedly, as in the case of this country at the present crisis. This country has suddenly awakened from the sunniest, softest dream of steadfast peace to find itself involved in a terrible war. Some sinking of heart may follow the sudden shock of this awakening. Still, as a resolute man will dominate in the midst of opposing forces, so will a nation, if of generous stock, rise superior to disaster. Thunderstorms, volcanic eruptions, are desolating phases of nature, that precede quietude and fruitful development; so, out of war, a people that manfully bears itself, sees brighter vistas in the future. This has been true of other nations. It will be so of ours. A just war, wisely waged, becomes a great improving, regenerating agent in the State. It is not the case with all wars; but will be the result of a war waged for a good cause, in a spirit of conscientious devotion. The lecturer cursorily touched upon the characteristics of wars, as usually precipitated and conducted, and deprecated the evils that they inevitably caused. Nevertheless, he contended that even the worst of wars had redeeming features. They draw forth from the rightful side striking examples of patriotism and self-sacrifice. They produced instances of that loyal spirit of self-defence that Christ himself imposed upon his followers. Some wars were a sharp and wide-spread administration of justice. They take on a judicial aspect; there is the crimson outside, but the lining is of purest ermine. The record of time has significance when such a war as the present marks its progress. Its effects upon our material interests must also be regarded. The waste of war is frightful, no matter how righteous the cause in which it is waged. It destroys men, and men are the producing agents from whom general prosperity accrues. Even brute animals can be made to produce more than they consume; so can slaves; how much more free, educated citizens. Yet the destructive influences of war have counterbalancing benefits. So far as expenditure goes, we have not approached many European nations in the amount of our pecuniary outgoings. We have not begun to rival the magnitude of the English national debt. In times of comparative peace we have spent $2,000,000,000 in movements against England, Algiers, Mexico and the Indians; surely we can bear some strain upon our resources in such a war as this. War does not involve annihilation, it merely causes redistribution. It is not always so disastrous as it at first appears to be. Many nations have achieved the highest pitch of prosperity in the very midst of continuous war. War impresses upon us many useful lessons. It teaches us a wise economy; it stimulates invention, shows us those deep reserves of power before unthought of, which always start into life under the spur of emergency. It opens up new schemes of remunerative enterprise. The lecturer proved how some of the most useful inventions and grandest progressive movements of former and contemporary nations followed upon periods of seemingly exhaustive war. Dr. STORRS then made the conventional contrast between the inhabitants of luxurious plains and those who breathed a more invigorative atmosphere, spoke of the elasticity and recuperative energies of the latter, as compared with the spasmodic passion of the former, and drew the inference which the peculiar geographical qualities of the North and South would naturally suggest. He went on to say that the trials we are called upon to undergo will make better men of us and our posterity. When the reaction consequent on reestablished peace comes, every species of prosperous enterprise will expand to more imposing proportions than ever. Like the fabled giant, we shall arise all the stronger for the touch of our mother earth that we received in the moment of temporary prostration. Dr. STORRS proceeded to expatiate at length on the moral aspects of the war. The war will educate and inspire us. It is a great thing for a nation to come to a knowledge of its own martial strength. A greater sense of responsibility -- a more even-tempered magnanimity are thereby created. We are made more patient -- less petulant. The lecturer spoke at length on the better submission to discipline which the war will produce. It will render us more subordinate -- more ready to yield obedience where obedience is due. A Republic gains greatness by the strength of the Government it imposes on itself, and the readiness of its obedience to such delegated authority. The volunteer army, when it disbands, will diffuse this spirit of subordination amongst all classes. The war will knit together all sections of the community. The voice that rolls along the battle's edge is just as musical, whether German or American; there is no distinction now between Hungarian and Huguenot: the green flag, shamrock and all, floats nobly beside the Stars and Stripes. Great good will be derived from instances of individual heroism. We shall take a more exalted view of things. The lecturer, in a fine strain of eloquence, referred to the heroic sacrifice of Gen. BAKER, and to various cases of glorious personal achievement that have obtained historic fame, and declared that they had all had their share in the improvement of the race. War will bring our foremost men to the front. It will give power to the best and greatest. It will deliver us from insidious foes who seek to undermine our rights and liberties, and, viewed in that light, must be regarded as a blessing. It will teach us to call things by their right names -- American Slavery amongst the rest. The final peace, the immortal serenity that we all look for comes to us through the august travail of ages; so may the ordeal through which we are now passing soon bring us a foretaste of that peace. Dr. STORRS was warmly applauded throughout, and that by listeners of more than usual discrimination.",12,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""BROOKLYN NEWS.; A JUST WAR--Its Relation to a Nation's Highest Development.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/13/archives/the-recent-railroad-casualty-a-general-wreck-of-matter.html,,"The accident which occurred on the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad near Gray's Ferry Bridge, on Friday night, resulted in the destruction of several cars, injury to locomotives, and some narrow escapes. The train due at the ferry about 11 o'clock, was processing towards the bridge at a very slow rate of speed, the night being so foggy that the engineer could not see very far. The train going south was advancing with much greater speed, it having started a flew minutes late from the depot, Broad and Washington streets. The two locomotives came together on the curve a short distance beyond the bridge, and with sufficient force to smash cow-catchers, lamps, and injure the machinery of both locomotives, but not to any great extent. Both trains being long and heavily laden, great damage was done to the cars nearest the locomotives by the momentum of those behind them. The baggage-car and the mail-car of the up train were completely demolished, one of them having been removed from the trucks and pushed into the other like a telescope, within eight or ten feet of the end. The cars being at a slight angle to each other, by their position on the curve, one side of the mail-car was carried away. The Express baggage-master, Mr. SAMUEL BENNER, had his coat caught between the trucks in such a way that he had to be cut loose from it. The mall agent, Mr. TRAIL, had to be taken from the top of the car. The injuries of both of these persons were very slight. The platforms and draw-bars of some of the cars on this train were broken. The Adams' Express car, on the train going South, was perfectly wrecked, and its contents strewn upon the ground. Some of the soldiers from a camp near by laid in a large supply of turkies, chickens, eggs, &c., which were on the way to soldiers near Washington. Some of the platforms of the cars on this train were also broken. The damage to the company will not be very heavy, as the running gear of the cars injured were not damaged. The accident, it appears, was caused by the rule of the company, requiring trains going South to stop at the bridge a certain length of time having been violated.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Recent Railroad Casualty.; A GENERAL WRECK OF MATTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Recent Railroad Casualty.; A GENERAL WRECK OF MATTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Philadelphia Ledger, Dec. 9', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Dec', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/078a8197-df2c-5da9-85b4-cd9eca39b580,385,nyt://article/078a8197-df2c-5da9-85b4-cd9eca39b580,

The first news of the affair received in England was by the British West India mail steamer La Plata; and the account seems to have been tolerably fair, excepting a few exaggerated details thrown in for effect. It produced considerable excitement in London, Liverpool and elsewhere; though not as much as had been anticipated by some people here. The Times discusses the legal rights and precedents in the case, but says that it requires a strong effort of self-restraint to do so. It says that the legal course; for the American naval officer would have been to take the Trent into port, and have the case adjudicated in a Court of Admiralty. It hopes that the British people will not meet this provocation with an outburst of passion, or rush to resentment without full consideration of all the bearings of the case. The Star says that the opinion of the law officers of the Crown had been taken on the subject, and that it is in favor of the right assumed by the United States Government. It urges coolness and temperance, and trusts in American justice. The purser of the Trent publishes a statement of the case which is somewhat mendacious and dramatic. The dispatches of MASON and SLIDELL, which escaped the vigilance of Capt. WILKES, had been received in London by the La Plata. The Times' City Article gives a high coloring to the British excitement, and says that English funds fell one per cent., from which there was afterward a rally of a half per cent., while at Lloyd's war risks of five guineas were demanded on vessels from New-York.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2222b12f-c222-5362-af90-eb651b80ce80,681,nyt://article/2222b12f-c222-5362-af90-eb651b80ce80,

Dr. BELLOWS, of the Sanitary Commission -- a man not likely to use strong words in reference to the conduct of the war on the Union side -- in a report to Government on the condition of the prisoners he visited in the New-York prisons, declares that ""it was very trying, almost inhuman;"" but it must be added, in justice, that he proceeds to state the wants and privations to which they were exposed, and which were disgraceful to the State, had been relieved, and that they had nothing to complain of except severe diseased and sickness. However, they had been for some weeks in that state of suffering before he saw them, and political prisoners who are not in the possession of funds have full reason to lament their hard fate. A Mr. MAURY, and Englishman, brother of the young gentleman who was arrested the other day for carrying correspondence directed to persons in the South, was seized in the State Department the day before yesterday, as he was inquiring after a portmanteau which had been detained at Cleveland, but for the release of which he had received the order of the Secretary of State, and he was placed in a room, as I am informed, without a table, fuel, or even a bed, where he passed the night, having been refused permission to communicate with his friends, or any explanation of the grounds of his arrest.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/829bde23-be8c-53cc-b0aa-20e8edf74db9,304,nyt://article/829bde23-be8c-53cc-b0aa-20e8edf74db9,

As we now know the point against which the Federal operations are directed, and have learnt their first success, there will be necessarily much speculation as to this subsidiary campaign, and the designs of the Government in sending an army to the coast of the Atlantic cotton States. In the first place, we must do justice to the energy of the Federal Government. Whatever may be the plans of its military men, and whatever may be the result of the expedition, it must be said that the fleet was well fitted out and skillfully handled. Even with the command of the sea, it is not an easy thing to land a large force on an enemy's ground, on a coast very dangerous at all times, and now deprived of every guide to the seaman in the shape of lighthouses or buoys. But, in spite of a succession of very heavy gales, and in spite of the resistance of the Confederates, who seem to have been not unprepared for a visit, the Federals have established themselves on another spot of Southern ground, and have a base from which to carry on any future operations which they may think advisable.

To be sure we had the gratification to know that we had the law on our side, and were rectus in curia: but who does not know that, in such matters, human nature is governed not so much by the principles of pure reason as by local sentiments and patriotic prejudices?

But one night, Lieut. SLEMMER, Capt. VODGES and the other loyal officers in command, put their heads together, and the next morning BRAGG lifted up his eyes and beheld the two latter strongholds evacuated, their late occupants find most of the stores and moveable artillery they contained having been, between sunset and dawn, cautiously transferred to Pickens, which their concentration made a rather awkward nut to crack. BRAGG foamed in impotent rage. At first, he could not imagine through what source his enemy had been warned in time, and authorized to take so decisive a measure of defence; but the idea suddenly occurred to him that, the previous day, April 11th, he had granted a pass to one Lieut. WORDEN, of the United States Navy, permitting him to go aboard the sloop-of-war St. Louis, there to have communication with Captain ADAMS. Lieut. WORDEN had fulfilled his mission, had returned by way of Pensacola, and was on his journey back to Washington, when this luminous revelation burst on BRAGG's benighted mind.

"The District Attorney has caused a medical examination to be held in the case of THOMAS A.

RANNEY and Dr. BENJAMIN OGDEN. They made their report yesterday to Mr. WATERBURY, the District Attorney. They state that MCGILL is at present insane -- in fact, a maniac of the most dangerous description. That from his statements and appearance they conclude that his insanity is either mania recurrens -- a form in which the paroxysms of violence and lucid intervals again and again succeed each other -- or an attack of acute mania, or the result of a debauch. A knowledge of his previous history would afford the means of determining the precise form. They further say that the public safety seems to require some form of legal action to prevent his immediate discharge from an asylum. If placed in an asylum under an ordinary commitment for insanity, he would, at anytime, be discharged at the request of his friends. If the form of insanity be paroxysmal, whenever a lucid interval occurred, it would be the duty of the Superintendent to discharge him, even if no application were made. On the patients of an ordinary asylum, the reception of a homicide produces an injurious effect, and the rooms of such a building are not properly constructed for the safekeeping of such a patient.

"ARREST OF A NOTORIOUS COUNTERFEITER. -- HENRY COLE, alias JOHNSON, was arrested yesterday afternoon upon the charge of counterfeiting. In August last, the accused and three other men -- all of whom are connected with a gang of counterfeiters, who for months have been prowling throughout the country -- visited Albany, and there presented a large number of $5 and $10 bills to the Albany banks. They purported to be genuine issues of the Prescott Bank, at Lowell, Mass. So well executed were they that the banks took them without hesitation, and paid gold in exchange. Very soon, however, the billswere ascertained to be bogus. No clue could be obtained until yesterday, as to the whereabouts of the guilty parties. COLE was arrested by Detective SLOWEY, in Grand-street. One hundred and sixty dollars in gold were found upon the prisoner. He was taken to Police Headquarters, and there detained for a short time.

In August last, the accused and three other men -- all of whom are connected with a gang of counterfeiters, who for months have been prowling throughout the country -- visited Albany, and there presented a large number of $5 and $10 bills to the Albany banks. They purported to be genuine issues of the Prescott Bank, at Lowell, Mass. So well executed were they that the banks took them without hesitation, and paid gold in exchange. Very soon, however, the billswere ascertained to be bogus. No clue could be obtained until yesterday, as to the whereabouts of the guilty parties. COLE was arrested by Detective SLOWEY, in Grand-street. One hundred and sixty dollars in gold were found upon the prisoner. He was taken to Police Headquarters, and there detained for a short time.

If what seems to be involved in the telegrams be true, that the line of flame stretched from the eastern end of Broad-street well across to the western lines of the city, and from thence swept northward up King and other parallel streets, as high as and beyond the old theatre, those who know the city will see how completely Old Charleston has been gutted. The latest dispatch -- up to Thursday night -- says that the fire was still raging, and that it had then crossed Broadstreet, and was sweeping furiously on.

This is done either by beating a portion of the whey, (which should not be heated to the boiling point,) and pouring it into the vat till the whole is raised to the desired temperature; or, when steam can be applied to the vat, it is heated in this way. The temperature varies somewhat in different dairies, from 102 to 108 degrees. After the scalding, the curd is allowed to stand in the heated whey about forty minutes, and the whey and curd is then poured on to a cloth placed on a shallow wooden vessel, with a hole in the bottom, which allows the strained whey to run off. The curd is then broken up fine and salted to suit the taste -- say a teacupful to each ten or twelve cows. The curd is then placed in the vat and put under the press, where it remains till the next morning. Those acquainted with the English method of making cheese will see in what respect the two processes differ. The method so imperfectly and inadequately described above, is not half as much labor as the Cheshire or Gloucestershire process. The method of heating the milk by the application of steam to the cheese-vat is a great improvement. Then the method of separating the curd from the whey by straining it through a cloth is much more expeditious. In Cheshire the whey is removed by pressing down a flat-bottomed pan gently on the curd in the cheese-tub, and allowing it to fill. When the curd is thus partially freed from the whey, the curd is again gently broken and allowed to settle and separate, and the whey ia baled out slowly, the curd being placed on one side of the tub, which is slightly raised, and a board is placed on the curd, with heavy weights on top to press out the whey. The curd is then cu. into pieces six or eight inches square, and again pressed with heavier weights.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a7a6fca-ecd0-5acf-b316-9ebc25cd1fb8,1540,nyt://article/6a7a6fca-ecd0-5acf-b316-9ebc25cd1fb8,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/15/archives/some-additional-points-of-international-law.html,,"The precedents to which the London Times makes an indirect allusion when it says that Messrs. MASON and SLIDELL, could not be arrested because they were not officers of the army or navy, are very likely drawn ultimately from certain clauses contained in treaties between European nations, of which the treaty of Utrecht furnishes the most complete exemplar. It is said in this document that all men engaged in the army or navy (hommes de guerre) are contraband of war, and can be arrested. This doctrine, though disregarded by England in her war with France, was supported by the majority of writers on international rights during the last century. But modern publicists have improved upon it. They do not limit the right of seizure to military men alone, but apply it to all men engaged in the service of the enemy. Thus, D'HAUTEFEUILLE, an extreme advocate of the rights of neutrals, says on this subject, that by military men, we must not understand officers, soldiers and recruits alone, but all men who have contracted with the belligerent the engagement of serving it during the war. When such men as these are found on board of neutrals, the belligerent has an uncontrovertible right to look upon them as enemies perpetrating acts of hostility, and to treat them as such. According to this writer's opinion, the name homme de guerre does not apply simply to the profession of the man, but to the nature and character of his services. Accordingly, a minister of the Gospel, a lawyer, a merchant, may be as much an object of contraband of war as an admiral, or a general -- an opinion which leaves no doubt upon the arrest of Messrs. MASON and SLIDELL. The Times is then in fault when it professes not to know of any authority which will show them to be contraband of war. Aware as that paper is of the character of these gentlemen and of the nature of their mission, it might have declared their arrest justified as well on the ground of English precedents and ""antiquated law,"" as on the ground of the opinions enunciated by living publicists and writers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Some Additional Points of International Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Some Additional Points of International Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b9b9305-1257-5c28-a3d0-c45366e0274f,772,nyt://article/6b9b9305-1257-5c28-a3d0-c45366e0274f,

The Secessionists gloatingly prophesied that infuriate mobs would go howling ""bread or blood"" through our streets; and nobody needs to be reminded what New-York journal gave these diabolisms daily expression. Europeans -- out of whose heads it seems to be impossible to get the idea that class-interests are somehow mixed up with this war -- told us we should soon have ""dangerous socialistic upheavals, and the terrible cry of the French Revolution reechoed by the masses whom the war will plunge into poverty.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War and Our Social Prosperity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War and Our Social Prosperity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cda1e0ab-505d-5a44-9b2e-32c234670f37,1194,nyt://article/cda1e0ab-505d-5a44-9b2e-32c234670f37,

Nearly the whole of that pestilent city has been destroyed by an incendiary fire, the torch being applied by a negro -- a free negro, the dispatches state. The fire broke out in a sash-factory on Hazel-street, and communicated to buildings on the opposite side, when, under the impulse of a stiff breeze, the conflagration soon assumed a formidable character -- aided, perhaps, (though the dispatches do not so state,) by the incendiaries. The business portion of the City appears to have been almost entirely swept away, including the Institute and St. Andrew's Halls, the Theatre, the Catholic Cathedral and the Circular Church -- and last, though not least, the Mercury and Courier offices. Our latest advices are to the afternoon of Thursday, when the fire was still raging, as it had been since 9 o'clock on the previous evening. Thousands of houseless persons were huddled in the streets, and supplies for their relief were being sent in from the surrounding country. But the most important announcement in connection with this conflagration is that it was intended as only one scene in the horrible tragedy of a slave insurrection. The plot is said to have been disclosed by the body-servant of a military officer, and the discoveries which had followed had created the greatest consternation. Families were closing and barring their windows, and taking other measures to secure themselves. There are rumors, also, that insurrections had broken out in the interior of the State two days before the fire, and at last accounts were still raging unchecked.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7f0e5ad-08c2-5541-a4b3-4a27c799573f,677,nyt://article/d7f0e5ad-08c2-5541-a4b3-4a27c799573f,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/16/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- To remind us of certain dues which fall about Christmas time, JAMES MILLER publishes in royal quarto form a sumptuous volume -- Lyra Germanica -- a selection of hymns from Chevalier BUNSEN's comprehensive collection, Versuch eines Allgemeinen Gesang and Gebetbuchs, translated from the original by CATHARINE WINKWORTH. The German language, in its wealth of sacred poetry, is rivaled by no other. It abounds with rare old hymns, the compositions of such masters as LUTHER, ANGELUS and PAUL GERHARDT, which move the soul like organ notes. The wealth of the Germans in this respect may be traced to the fact that with them the singing of hymns is considered quite as actual a part of public worship as prayer. In our church it is customary for choirs to perform for the edification of the congregation, and because the services would not be considered as quite complete without the opening and closing hymns. But in the German Church the whole congregation unites in an anthem of praise, sending up their song as prayer. This demand for good hymns naturally produces them. The collection of Chevalier BUNSEN, before alluded to, contains something more than nine hundred sacred lyrics, and scarce a feeble one can be selected from them all. The German mind views the hymn as a vehicle of worship, and aims in it rather at the expression of a devotional feeling than the paying of common-place compliments in regular metro, to the Deity. Accordingly we find the German Hymn full of fire and strength, replete with clear Christian faith, and expressing a brave joyful trust. The difference in structure of the two languages makes the rendering into English verse a most difficult task, but in the vollume before us, the spirit of the compositions is faithfully preserved, and the slight alterations of text which occur were rendered necessary by the exigencies of poetical translation.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/867aebb8-1fb2-50ed-8cc5-0050bebea4fd,2875,nyt://article/867aebb8-1fb2-50ed-8cc5-0050bebea4fd,

--We but pay the Atlantic for January a deserved compliment when we rank it as the best number that has appeared in the history of the magazine. It is always the custom of magazine proprietors to make the initial number of the year an extraordinarily good one.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/16/archives/the-magazines.html,,"-- We but pay the Atlantic for January a deserved compliment when we rank it as the best number that has appeared in the history of the magazine. It is always the custom of magazine proprietors to make the initial number of the year an extraordinarily good one. In this instance, the gentlemen who guide the destinies of the Atlantic have achieved an eminent success. If the same standard of excellence which distinguishes the January number could be maintained throughout the year, we should have a magazine to be proud of, and a ready answer to the taunt that, though our country produces many remarkable dailies, it cannot get up one respectable and readable monthly. Every one will hail with pleasure the reappearance of Rev. HOMER WILBUR, with his neat classical allusions and quotations. He introduces our old friend, Birdofredum Sawin, Esq., who favors us, by means of a letter to Mr. Hosea Biglow, with a versified account of his experience in the South. It is in LOWELL's best vein, and fully equals the best of the Biglow Papers. The leading article, ""Methods of Study in Natural History,"" is by Prof. AGASSIZ. Dr. WINDSHIP -- why isn't he called Steamship? the name would be more suggestive of strength -- gives us ""Autobiographical Sketches of a Strength Seeker."" According to his story, the Doctor has been enabled to raise his enormous weights by adopting the principle of the man who by lifting a calf everyday, was finally enabled to shoulder it when it grew to an ox. He first determined to practice litting until he could raise a weight of twelve hundred pounds. Having attained that development of muscle some time since, he now intends to rest satisfied when he can lift three thousand. Thus it seems that the attainment of strength is somewhat like that of wealth -- the votary is never satisfied, but marks out a fresh endeavor as soon as he attains the sum of his first ambition. And why do not those wise ones who advise against the accumulation of riches have a word to say against this gathering of muscular power? The same argument would hold good in both cases, for a man can no more carry muscle out of the world with him then he can money. ""Jefferson and Slavery,"" a clear and admirable article, is by Prof. WHITE. RALPH WALDO EMERSON contributes a delightful essay, ""Old Age,"" and NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE a charming account of a ""Pilgrimage to Old Boston."" ""Fremont's Hundred Days in Missouri,"" is a semi-defence of the ""Pathfinder,"" by WM. DORSHEIMER. The author disdains any intention of appearing as an apologist, but gives a graphic sketch of what FREMONT did do in the hundred days of his command. This is perfectly fair, as multitudinous mouths have been opened to tell what he did not. In addition we have a tale, ""Love on Skates,"" by the late THEODORE WINTHROP; ""Light Literature,"" by Rev. D.A. WASSON; ""Per Tenebras Lumina,"" a poem, by Mrs. H.D.T. WHITNEY; another poem, ""The True Heroine;"" an appreciative article on JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, by GEO. S. HILLIARD, a continuation of Mrs. STOVE's ""Agnes of Sorrento;"" further chapters of ""A Story of To-day,"" by the author of ""Life in the Iron Mills,"" and the usual reviews and literary notices.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Magazines', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-12-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d88555cf-bb79-5b8d-85cb-a4c10b27ba1b,1056,nyt://article/d88555cf-bb79-5b8d-85cb-a4c10b27ba1b,

"The advices brought by the Europa, and confirmed by the City of Washington, convey the startling intelligence that the English Government, after submitting the case of the Trent to the law officers of the Crown, has decided to regard the seizure of Messrs. SLIDELL and MASON as a violation of international law, and to demand of the American Government an apology for the act, and a restoration of the rebel envoys to the shelter of the British flag. A Queen's messenger, bearing dispatches to Lord LYONS, conveying this demand, is on board the Europa and arriving at Boston to-morrow night, will reach Washington by Wednesday. In the meantime, the most energetic preparations for war are making in England. Every dock-yard is active, and steamers are taken up by the Government to carry troops, arms and artillery, heavy and light, to Canada, while it is understood that the first cruise of the mailed monster, the Warrior, will, in the event of a rejection of an English ultimatum, be made in American waters. A royal proclamation has forbidden the exportation of arms, of gunpowder, and of any material used in the manufacture of that explosive. The popular excitement was intense.

But the entire drift of opinion appeared to be in the direction of war, the Ministerial Press fanning the popular flame by promising to clear the sea of the American navy in a month; acknowledge the Southern Confederacy; and, by breaking the blockade, letting out cotton, and letting in British manufactures. A blockade of the Northern ports is also on the war programme. The London Observer, the more intimate mouth-piece of the Ministers, declares it would be not only proper, but easy, to cause SLIDELL and MASON to be delivered to a British frigate, anchored in front of Washington, with twelve other royal men-of-war attending as witnesses of the humiliating spectacle. The tone of the Press generally is violent and uncompromising; and little hope is expressed that the United States will make concessions.

FLETCHER, arrived at Fortress Monroe on Sunday afternoon, where she called for orders, on her return from Ship Island, Mississippi Sound, having safely landed at the latter place, Dec. 4, the two regiments, (Twenty-sixth Massachusetts, and Ninth Connecticut,) which embarked on her at Boston, the 18th and 21st of November. In this southward expedition, after proceeding to Portland for the Twelfth Regiment of Maine, which did not embark on her, the Constitution proceeded to Fortress Monroe, Nov. 23, where she arrived on the 26th. She coaled, and left on the 28th, and, after a very pleasant passage, arrived at Ship Island, Mississippi Sound, Dec. 3. Her arrival here was as gratifying as it was unexpected by the little fleet and small garrison which have been holding the place against constant threats, and occasional attacks from the rebels. By the assistance of two large river steamers, which had been captured in Mississippi Sound only a short time previous to her arrival the troops and material of war, and subsistence stores, were landed between the 4th and 8th of December -- a single accident only occurring, by which one of the steel rifled guns belonging to Capt. MANNING's Light Battery was lost overboard. The two regiments were comfortably encamped on the island, near the lighthouse, and the Salem Battery near the fortification. On the 6th the last of the cargo was landed on the beach, and was taken charge of by Commissary BUTLER, brother of Maj.-Gen. BUTLER, who will probably join the expedition in a short time with a large accession to the force. The Constitution left at Ship Island her splendid rifled long-range guns, and also six fine life-boats, of the Francis and Raymond patterns, for the use of the command. During the day on which the Constitution sailed from Ship Island, a naval engagement took place within sight, and quite near the island, between the United States gunboat New-London and the steamer De Soto, and two rebel armed vessels -- the Pamlico and California -- which were attempting to run the gauntlet from New-Orleans to Mobile. ""Nobody was hurt"" on either side. The Constitution sailed from Ship Island Saturday, Dec. 7, at 5 P.M., and arrived at Key West on the 9th, where she put in to obtain coal, but not being able to obtain it there with dispatch she proceeded to Havana, arriving on the 10th. Here she coaled, and again left on the 12th, at 8 o'clock A.M., and arrived at Fortress Monroe on Sunday, at 3 1/2 o'clock P.M.

Much labor has also been expended in the preparation of the skating ponds, the construction of refreshment saloons and other necessary buildings. These buildings will be rented to parties desiring to furnish refreshments to the visitors at the Park, and the income thereof is to be applied to the adorning of the grounds and the improvement of the ponds. Mr. C.G. WHITE, of Brooklyn, has presented to the Superintendent a couple of cranes. They are objects of much interest to those visiting the Park. A pair of deer have also been placed in an inclosure near the Mall, where all may have an opportunity of seeing them. Mrs. CRAWFORD, the widow of the celebrated sculptor of that name, has caused to be placed in the Park a copy of each of her husband's works in plaster. They make a very fine appearance. A great amount of shrubbery and large numbers of trees have been transplanted within the last year, with great succees. Several new avenues have been opened, and five archways, of great architectural beauty, have been constructed in different parts of the Park. Several wealthy parties in the upper part of the City are now making arrangements to erect a glass conservatory at their own expense.

She overhauled altogether fourteen suspicious-looking craft, some of which she warned, driving off others, and laying violent hands on two, the Adelaide and Zealand, taking them into Key West, where the Adelaide, on unquestionable evidence, was of course condemned. Both vessels were sailing under British colors, and were caught in the act of trying to run the blockade. The Adelaide had a valuable cargo, consisting of a great quantity of sugar, some thirty tons of coffee and some small arms, mostly sabres. The Zealand seemed to be only in ballast, but it was shrewdly suspected, by Capt. WOODHULL and the Prize Commissioners, that she had, when she found herself in peril of capture, dumped overboard everything of any worth that she had aboard.

The news from Havana is destitute of importance. From Mexico we learn that the ultimatums of France and England had been presented to the Mexican Government, and on the 21st ult. a treaty had been celebrated conceding the English demands. On the 22d this treaty was sent to Congress for ratification, where it was rejected by a decided vote; the objection turning to the requirement common to both the French and English ultimatums, that the Custom Houses should be placed in charge of Foreign Commissioners. It was feared this demand would be fatal to negotiation, it being considered as opening a fatal door to the destruction of Mexican independence. To show a disposition to comply in other respects, Congress at once authorized the President to lower the rate of duties, an authority he alone exercised; and also abolished the obnoxious law of July 17, thereby placing the foreign debts in course of immediate payment. On the 24th, Sir CHARLES WYKE sent in his ultimatum, upon the rejection of which he was to withdraw and leave the Mexican Government to the consequences of its obstinacy, but up to the close of our correspondent's letter, the final answer of the JUAREZ Cabinet had not been received. The French Minister had already terminated his negotiations. Against Spain the National resentment was fearful. Gen. URAGA had been placed in command of the region between the capital and Vera Cruz, and was about to leave with his army for Jalapa. Gen. ORTEGA would probably be commissioned, and sent to hold the lower road, by way of Orizaba, while Gen. TAPIA was instructed to put the neighborhood of Tampico in a state of defence.

There was but one sentiment prevalent, and that was that no quarrel with England must be permitted to interfere at this moment to stay the reduction of the Southern rebels. The Government is probably satisfied that the clamor for a war with England originates with, and is propagated by, sympathizers with the Southern rebellion. It knows that nothing would so gratify the rebels; would so restore their vanishing confidence, and reinvigorate them to redoubled efforts at defence, as the news that England is to be permitted to come to their rescue. It believes it has no right to give new life to the rebellion by entering upon another and vaster quarrel, which would at the same time increase tenfold the burdens upon the people of the North; and it naturally hesitates to adopt a policy which would carry joy to every traitor in the country, and weigh down to poverty the loyal and law-observing citizen. But whether these or other considerations govern in the matter, I have the best authority for saying the demands of England will be met in a spirit of conciliation, which will at once refute the calumny that Mr. SEWARD or any other member of the Cabinet has been eager to provoke a foreign war. The intelligence received by the Jura, that the dispatches with which SLIDELL and MASON were intrusted reached England, notwithstanding their arrest, renders the question as to the disposition of the persons of the rebel envoys one of secondary moment, and a most inadequate one on which to base a great international struggle. It will be borne in mind that the Administration is still uncommitted on the Trent business. The subject was not mentioned in the President's Message: and the language of Secretary WELLES, in his report and his letter to Capt. WILKES, are rather professional and personal than diplomatic, and in no degree bind the State Department.

The demands of England, whatever they may be, will be met in a spirit of conciliation, in marked contrast to the precipitancy with which she has sought to make the seizure of the rebel envoys a casus belli.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/592d0937-68d5-5716-97f7-e9b222ef7045,757,nyt://article/592d0937-68d5-5716-97f7-e9b222ef7045,

That loyalty to the Union is the fashion in East Tennessee, we have had, first and last, sufficient evidence. The plans of DAVIS and his cabal found little favor there from the outset. Faithful to the traditions of JACKSON, the population cherished a veteran hatred of nullification and its posterity, and regarded South Carolina, always restless, ambitious and mischievous, with incurable aversion. These sentiments found expression through such newspapers as BROWNLOW's, and the oratory of JOHNSON, NELSON and MAYNARD. When, therefore, the engines of rebel terrorism were brought to bear upon the East Tennesseeans, in order to force them into a vote for the ordinance of secession, the machinery, so infallible elsewhere, was at fault. East Tennessee remained for the Union; and in the multitudes of refugees it has sent to the North; in the other multitudes it has contributed to the National army in Kentucky; and, above all, in the heroic labors of BROWNLOW and his band, upon whose success at Morristown doubt has very unjustly been cast, we may see how inextinguishable is the zeal of these consistent patriots.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Signs of Reaction Against the Rebels in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Signs of Reaction Against the Rebels in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6833c375-bf49-5229-b948-658d6a0e47e9,752,nyt://article/6833c375-bf49-5229-b948-658d6a0e47e9,

The tone of the Press is less recklessly defiant, and such organs of the Liberal party as the London Daily News, the London Star, and the Mannchester Examiner, take a generous and conciliatory view of the cause of agitation. The News in its earlier article was unconditionally for war. It is now reported as approving of the spirit and purport of a letter of Gen. SCOTT, wherein the veteran affirms the legality of the act of Capt. WILKES, but acquits the Washington authorities of having ordered it, and as expressing a belief that a collision may still be avoided, if the same spirit and purpose animate the Secretary of State. These changes of sentiment were to be expected. It must be kept in mind that the information upon which the first action of the British Government was founded was entirely one-sided, and stated so grossly to the disadvantage of the United States, that it would have been marvelous indeed if the resentment of the British people had not been provoked to the utmost limit. Every subsequent arrival from America has tended to correct these injurious impressions. The action of Capt. WILKES, it has been found, was taken upon his individual responsibility, and cannot therefore be ascribed to that wanton craving for a foreign war, which the London journals persist in ascribing to the administration of President LINCOLN. They have found the failure of Capt. WILKES to capture the steamer -- which when the dispatches now known to have been on board had been discovered, would have been a lawful prize, -- was due to his desire to exhibit every possible courtesy and favor to the ship, its officers and passengers. They have read the President's Message at the opening of Congress, and found that while the people universally commended Capt. WILKES, on the assumption that he had kept clearly within the law, the President carefully refrained from committing himself; so that there is no evidence that what the Administration did not order it has since approved. The knowledge of these points cannot fail to moderate very sensibly the first extreme ardor of English passion, and even before the response of our Government to the demands of Lord RUSSELL returns to England, we may confidently anticipate an entire disappearance there of the warlike fever which at first ran wild over the country.

Probably this is only meant as a sounding piece of British bluster, for, as a historical statement, it is rather too audacious for even that wanton journal to make. There are no instances in the history of enlightened nations in which a war has been originated by a single event -- a single demand in the form of an ultimatum. It is said, however, that England has sent such an ultimatum to the Government of the United States in the case of MASON and SLIDELL -- demanding the delivery to British protection of the persons of the rebel emissaries, or -- war! Certainly, whatever be the nature of the instructions which the Queen's messenger has conveyed to Her Britannic Majesty's representative at Washington, the English journals have not scrupled to flaunt this defiant ultimatum in the face of America, and have gone on to discuss how, in the event of our refusal to comply with a demand for the surrender of the prisoners, our fleet is to be swept from the seas in a week, our blockade of the Southern ports raised, and our own ports blockaded.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Pretext but no Ground of War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Pretext but no Ground of War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4d8d949-d3ae-5f50-bdb0-4e6621c3210a,639,nyt://article/f4d8d949-d3ae-5f50-bdb0-4e6621c3210a,

In the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another cloud twice as portentous as that which had darkened the horizon. It is not to be wondered at that excessive alarm should, for a day or two, prevail; for no event has happened since the breaking out of the war, which has given the secession element, with which every pore of New-York society is saturated, such power for mischief. Every traitor among us was instantly converted into a flaming patriot, burning to maintain the honor of the country, and eager to defend the act of Capt. WILKES with the last drop of his blood. At the same instant, the inevitableness of the war, with its terrible consequences, was painted in the most frightful colors, and insinuated into the ears of the timid with all the cunning that the most devilish ingenuity and hate against the North could devise. From such arts, coupled with exaggerated rumors, upon the first arrivals of the late steamers, how set afloat we will not now inquire, and with the complications between the Banks and the Government, yesterday was altogether a blue day in our calendar.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Favorable Aspect of the English Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Favorable Aspect of the English Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f5f0783d-dbff-5db6-b7d8-0062ab2620d6,666,nyt://article/f5f0783d-dbff-5db6-b7d8-0062ab2620d6,

It is from the pen of Mr. TOM TAYLOR, and illustrates a phase in East Indian life, in which the army officers of her Brittannic Majesty, in their social relations do not come in for a vast amount of glory. The principal character is a Major -- a blackleg of the better kind, who swindles the verdant cornets of his regiment, and falls even lower than that in a matter of love. Contrasted with this unenviable personality is a lady, Mrs. Col. McCunn, who outwits the polite sharper in all his little schemes, and in the end rescues the lady whom he has schemed to ensnare. The drama depends on these two characters, which are very well drawn, and is therefore somewhat scant in incident. Materials so slight indeed in feebler hands would be uninteresting; carpentered by Mr. TAYLOR they furnish a certain amount of intellectual pleasure to the watchful. The dialogue, without being brilliant, is easy and agreeable. It shows how two well-bred people can light a battle of life and death without a coarse display of temper. In the last act the hand of a master is clearly perceptible, all the nerves of the story being gathered up with surgical accuracy. So excellent is this, that the piece, which somewhat drags in the earlier stages, is completely redeemed, and leaves a favorable impression on the mind. Whether this result is due mainly to the author, or partly to the actors, we shall not now stop to inquire. It is certain that Mrs. HORT plays a very important role, with charming determination of purpose and admirable effect, and that Mr. FISHER has never been seen to greater advantage. Miss HENRIQUES has a spasmodically sentimental part, but succeeds by natural grace and modesty in rescuing it from insipidity. Mr. FLOYD, as Lieut. Greenway, is also excellent. The scenery and appointments we need scarcely add are all that could be desired.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2468d97b-0d48-55a5-9996-9bccaa2d7d62,404,nyt://article/2468d97b-0d48-55a5-9996-9bccaa2d7d62,

The ubiquitous marine Proteus now turns up at the scene of its old exploit, near the mouth of the Mississippi, the very place where erst it broke its nose. The Fortress Monroe correspondent on the Philadelphia Enquirer, writing of an engagement which took place there on the 12th instant, says: ""HOLLINS' Turtle or ram was disabled, and the Massachusetts made up the stream to capture her, but found her deserted aground and going to pieces."" As we have heard nothing of this pretended engagement we sincerely hope the whole story is a mistake. It would pain us extremely to think that the ""ram"" should vanish from the world of being; and the thought of it ""deserted, aground and going to pieces,"" would haunt our midnight vision. We have had so much genuine fun out of this marine monster, that in losing it we should lose the one comic element in the war. The country will hold HOLLINS to a severe account if, in allowing aught of harm to reach it, he dry up forever the source of many a side-shaking joke. Evehis Caesarem, said the Roman Emperor to the bark that bore him: so the Falstaffian Commodore, Evchis Hollins -- you bear HOLLINS, and in doing so you bear that in which the whole nation has an interest.

SLIDELL and MASON on the steamer Trent, and the approval of the same, were all based upon the assumption that with the rebel emissaries were captured their dispatches, which were to be our evidence to vindicate the act. We stated at the time that Capt. WILKES did not go far enough -- that with the rebels and their dispatches he should have brought in the ship convoying them, for adjudication in a Court of Admiralty. Unfortunately this was not done, and it now turns out that only the persons of the rebels were taken, while their dispatches went forward in the steamer. Capt. WILKES thus allowed both the subject matter of adjudication, with the proofs to be presented to secure it, escape. It may be entirely competent for an officer to visit and search; and in case articles contraband of war are found on a ship of a neutral nation, to bring her into port. But here his authority ends. He is the bailiff; not the court. His office is purely ministerial, not judicial. Did he not then, (from the best of motives, to be sure,) commit a grave oversight, leaving us no choice but to make the proper amends, whatever these may be? No Court has jurisdiction unless the subject matter to be passed upon is within its reach, so that its judgments can take effect either upon persons or property. The subject here was the steamer or some article contraband of war. Were the rebels such? Can they be adjudicated upon as contraband in a Court of Admiralty? Is not their offence of a nature entirely different? If, then, we have no competent proof with which to condemn the ship, and as she is out of our jurisdiction if we had, no judgment in the case can be passed. Are we not, then, bound to restore matters to their original status, which would involve the return of the rebel Ministers?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Probable Solution of the English Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Probable Solution of the English Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab1aa366-45ca-592b-bb5b-3723681b3977,631,nyt://article/ab1aa366-45ca-592b-bb5b-3723681b3977,

There are in Kentucky three distinct and fundamental points of military operation, both for the rebels and for the National forces -- an Eastern, a Central, and a Western. The Eastern base is on or near the Cumberland River; the Central, on and near the Green River; the Western, on the Mississippi. On the East we have Gen. SCHOEPF, at Somerset, opposed to ZOLLICOFFER on the other side of Green River, and to CRITTENDEN at Cumberland Gap. This, on our part, looks to the possession of the Gap, and the occupation of East Tennessee; while from here the rebels look to the possession of Lexington and the control of Eastern Kentucky. In the Centre we have the main body of the National Kentucky army on the line of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, extending as far south as Munfordsville and the crossing of Green River; the advance of which is under Gen. MITCHELL, of astronomical fame. Opposed is the main body of the rebels at Bowling Green, under BUCKNER and ALBERT S. JOHNSTON. This, on our part, looks to the possession of Nashville and the control of the great system of railroads running eastward and westward; the rebels from here look to the possession of Louisville and to carrying the seat of war up to the banks of the Ohio. On the Mississippi we have the army at Paducah and the army and navy at Cairo, under various Generals, opposed to the rebel army at Columbus, and the rebel batteries on the river. This, on our part, looks to the occupation of Memphis and the control of the Father of Waters; the rebels here, probably, intend to remain simply on the defensive, and make the point a base for incursions into Kentucky and Missouri.

POPE in Western Missouri are again attracting some attention to that unfortunate State. After the termination of FREMONT's campaign and the withdrawal of our troops from Springfield and the Southern border, it seemed as though all that section of the State stretching from the Arkansas line to the Missouri River must soon again fall into the hands of the magniloquent PRICE, and the speedy advance of his ragged mob on the heels of our retreat gave strength to the impression. But the bulk of FREMONT's army was not moved out of the State nor even north of the river; it was only stationed at points where it could be used effectively against the rebels should they attempt to advance on St. Louis, Jefferson City, Lexington or Kansas. Of that extensive section of country stretching from the Osage River to the Missouri, and westward to the Kansas line, Gen. POPE was appointed military commandant, with a force of some twenty thousand troops. He at once got his soldiers into condition for action; and energetically prepared to rout the rebels out of the domain under his supervision. Gen. POPE issued no pronunciamiento, gave the rebels no notice of his plans, and indulged in no brag. He knew the field, knew his men, knew the enemy, knew his work, and was determined to do it. And almost every day during the past fortnight has given evidence that the work was steadily progressing; and that his field of operations would soon have to be extended beyond its original boundaries.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Campaign in Missouri Dashing Operations of Gen.

"Hen. THOMAS S. WILLIAMS, Chief Justice of Connecticut, died in Hartford on Sunday, of pneumonia. He was born in Wethersfield, on June 23, 1777, and was the youngest but two of twelve children, all of whom he survived. Graduating at Vale Colleges in 1794, he was admitted to the bar of Windharn County in 1799, and in 1803 removed to Hartford, where he has since resided. For a number of terms between the years 1815 and 1820, he represented his district in Congress, and in the latter year was appointed an associate Judge of the Supreme Court of Errors. In 1834 he received the appointment of Chief Justice, and the honorary degree of LL. D. was conferred upon him in 1834 by his Alma Mater, Yale College. His Chief Justiceship he resigned in 1847, but while holding it, from 1831 to 1835, he acted as Mayor of Hartford. His legal reputation was very extensive and his decisions are widely quoted.

In this condition of things the citizens did not return during the Summer to look after their forsaken homes and property.

"We are not of those, our readers will have discovered, who believe a war with England will grow out of the Mason and Slidell affair, but, even should such a calamity result from it, England has evidently no chance of drawing France into the quarrel, and must be content to bear the brunt of the contest alone. For a few days, indeed, after intelligence of the abduction of the rebel Commissioners from on board the Trent had reached Paris, the tone of the leading French journals was almost as excited and indignant as that of their British cotemporaries. Gradually, however, the Gallic effervescence subsided, and French redocteurs began to take a calmer and more rational view of the matter. Nor should it be forgotten that the official Moniteur itself, the special organ of the Imperial Government, was the first to adopt a pacific tone, and to put forth words of sense and soberness on this subject. It considered a peaceful solution of the difficulties not impossible, and counseled France to await the issue with calmnesss.

The lower part was occupied by HEGEMAN Co., as a wholesale and retail drugstore. They are the greatest sufferers, although there are several other parties who have sustained damage to a large amount. The alarm was given immediately after the discovery of the fire, and the firemen were early on the ground; but such was the inflammable nature of the contents of the store, and the fire had gained such headway before the hose could be brought to bear upon it, that it soon became obvious that the entire structure would be demolished. The attention of the firemen was therefore mainly directed to the protection of the adjoining buildings. Within an hour after the fire was first seen, the whole of the building was a mass of smouldering ruins. Very little, if anything, of the contents of the drug-store was rescued from the flames. The upper stories were occupied by Messrs. ELLINGHAM & POLMYER, paperbox manufacturers. They had a large amount of stock on hand, which was totally destroyed. The estimated loss on the building and contents is $65,000. The buildings Nos. 157 and 159 are occupied on the lower floor by E.J. SCHENCK, auctioneer. His damage by water is considerable. He had a large quantity of furniture and other goods stored on the first floor and in the basement, and much of this its ruined by the flood of water with which the firemen deemed it nececessary to drench every part of the premises. His damage could not be definitely ascertained. DOUBLEDAY & STEWART occupied the upper floors of these buildings, and were damaged to the extent of $200, mostly by water. No. 163, on the other side of the burnt building, is occupied, on the first floor, by JOHN FOLEY, gold pen manufacturer; and on the floors above by Messrs. ROTHSCHILD & SANGER, dealers in furs. The stock of each of these is believed to be considerably damaged by water, but owing to the fact that the stores were closed yesterday, the loss could not be ascertained.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISASTROUS FIRE IN BROADWAY.; Destruction of Hegeman & Co.""s Drug-Store Loss About $65,000 Narrow Escape of an Inmate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISASTROUS FIRE IN BROADWAY.; Destruction of Hegeman & Co.""s Drug-Store Loss About $65,000 Narrow Escape of an Inmate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b26c40d-199b-5237-abd4-fa8128b4c012,586,nyt://article/4b26c40d-199b-5237-abd4-fa8128b4c012,

"-- TICKNOR & FIELDS are producing some books of which they have very good reason to be proud. One volume in particular, the Spare Hours of Dr. JOHN BROWN, of Edinburgh -- the best John Brown, by the way, that has yet figured in history -- does the Riverside Press lasting credit. It is too often the case with books as with men -- a prepossessing exterior is adopted as a sort of set-off against the astounding emptiness within. But not so with these Spare Hours, of which the judicious reader will incline to make many careful minutes. There is a charming vein of uncommon sense in these papers, together with a pathos and tenderness that is real -- not brought up like a stage heroine's tears from an artificial well by the bucket of premeditation. The Dr. is an inveterate hater of all shams. He can sympathize with affliction, but he has no bowels of compassion for imaginary ills. He delights in stripping off disguises, and getting at the actual anatomy of the fact with which he has to do. Once his diagnosis is made he proceeds accordingly. No hesitating treatment ensues at his hands. Immediately he fancies that he has found diseased flesh, his knife is at work without any preliminary flourishes. Occasionally in making these excisions he cuts a little deeper than is necessary, but the sufferer has ever the consolation of knowing that he is honest in his surgery, and has no venal end in view. He does'nt kill for the sake of being enabled to dissect the remains. But it does seem to us that he punctures the buoyant complacency of the very ingenious PHILIP JAMES BAILEY rather deeper than the exigencies of the case demand when he pins down the poem on which his reputation is chiefly founded, as ""the somewhat tremendous, absurd, raw, loud and fuliginous 'Festus.'"" Milder treatment would have answered. But the similie that follows is so delightful that even the author of ""Festus"" must perforce smile in his pain. ""We would, we repeat, as much rather keep company with 'V.'"" (the poems of another are under consideration, and he is pointing their merits by contrast,) ""as we would prefer going to sea for pleasure in a trim little yacht, with its free motions, its quiet, its cleanliness, to taking a state berth in some Fire-king steamer of one thousand horse-power, with his mighty and troublesome throb, his smoke, his exasperated steam, his clangor and fire and fume, his oils and smells."" There is much truth in this verdict of the Doctor's, but we apprehend that he pushes his conclusions slightly beyond truth, and this is quite as unfair as to stop half-way. But, without an occasional exhibition of intolerance, what would a Scotsman be? We might as well have a Dutchman at once. In this reprint of the Horoe Subsciroe, our Boston friends have given us one of the most charming volumes of light reading that ever came to enliven the horizon of dullness.

"-- A Baltimore correspondent in this morning's TIMES suggests a very singular, if not original, method of making Slavery inure to the damage of the rebels.

By driving the slaves back upon their masters, who must for their own preservation maintain and feed them, while under the circumstances they can derive no possible return for their labor."" He then mentions that it is now the Southern Winter, that pork there is forty-eight dollars a barrel, that there is no sale for cotton and consequently no money, and that, Cuffee's appetite being undiminished, he will first ruin and then devour his master. Now, if the master fed, or was compelled to feed Cuffee upon this high-priced article of pork, and if Cuffee spent his whole time in gormandizing, this argument would be conclusive for driving the slaves back upon their impoverished masters. But in the first place, the slaves will not be likely to be fed upon any such expensive luxury as prime mess pork at present; and next, the rebels do not stultify themselves by permitting the slaves to remain a negative power in the present war. If, for instance, there were ten thousand slaves at Port Royal and the adjacent sea-islands when Gen. SHERMAN landed his forces there, and if their masters and the rebel army succeeded in driving the majority of them inland, who believes that they were permitted to sit down leisurely on the other side of the rebel lines and devour pork at forty-eight dollars a barrels? On the contrary, is it not a great deal more likely -- as indeed we know was the case -- that the slaves got rations of Indian corn and rice, which are as cheap and plenty there as here, and were instantly put to work throwing up fortifications and digging trenches at Coosawhatchie, and working might and main at the defences of Charleston? It is in a military aspect we view the question at present. And it must be evident to everybody, that the force, the military force, represented by these ten thousand slaves, is of far greater gain to whichever side uses it, than the mere coarse rations they consume is loss. In fact the labor of every slave there, if he be put at the proper kind of work, and properly handled, is worth more than the labor of two white men; while our correspondent himself estimates the cost of the black man's sustenance at one-third less than that of the white. Our troops at Port Royal are now suffering very severely from sickness, brought on in great part by the extraordinary amount of hard manual labor that has devolved upon them since they were stationed there -- all of which should have been performed by the slaves who are now working on the other side.

REYNOLDS and of his own regiment, on Sunday, and brings the first full and authentic account of the late battle between our troops under MILROY, and the rebels under JOHNSON, that has reached us.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/23/archives/miscellaneous-rebellion-news-the-victory-at-camp-allegany-va.html,,"Col. KIMBALL, of the Fourteenth Indiana Regiment, arrived in this City on Tuesday night, on his way home from Western Virginia. He left Phillippi, the headquarters of Gen. REYNOLDS and of his own regiment, on Sunday, and brings the first full and authentic account of the late battle between our troops under MILROY, and the rebels under JOHNSON, that has reached us. He was not present, but from the official report of Gen. MILROY, and the statements of officers engaged in the battle, has learned enough to give us a fair idea of its plan and result. The enemy were posted in an intrenched position near Yager's farm, about eleven miles directly east of the camp at Greenbriar, where Gen. REYNOLDS defeated them last October, and where by the way, as our men have learned beyond question, by the graves found in the camp, and from the reports of prisoners, we killed fully 500, and inflicted a total loss of about one thousand, in spite of the reports to the contrary, After the retreat of the enemy from that position, the main body scattered, probably joining other divisions, leaving about two thousand men at this Yager camp, to hold our forces in check. Here they had intrenched themselves strongly, and undoubtedly expected to stay all the Winter. These Entrenchments consisted of four lines of earthworks and ditches, placed at various distances behind each other, so as to afford four successive lines of defence. The attack was left entirely in the hands of Gen. MILROY, who commanded the Brigade at that point, and he selected for it the Ninth and Thirteenth Indiana Regiments, and portions of one Ohio and the Second Virginia Regiments. The column marched on the night of the 12th, so as to reach the enemy and begin the light at 6 o'clock on the morning of the 13th. A battalion of the Ninth Regiment, under Col. MOODY, was ordered to make a detour to the enemy's left, so as to reach and attack them in the flank at the some time that Gen. MILROY attacked them in front. Owing to the darkness, and the wretched mountain paths, or no paths, through which this division had to pass, it failed to arrive at the time, and MILROY, expecting it every moment and eager for a fight, began the attack without it. The battle was warm and doubtful. Our force was unprotected, the enemy was intrenched, and at least two to our one. Once there were signs of wavering, and portions of some of the regiments fell into disorder. In the nick of time, Maj. DOBBS, of the Thirteenth, came up with a portion of that regiment which had been left behind, and restored the fight. A little after 8 o'clock, Col. MOODY, with his division, came up, joined the attacking column, and then our men began the work of cleaning out the intrenchments in earnest. One after the other of the four lines of breastworks and ditches was carried, the enemy rallying in the next one behind as fast as the one in front was stormed, so that our troops had to make four separate and hard fights of it before they cleared the field, At last, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, after a scattering but bloody battle, lasting all day, our men drove the enemy from the last earthwork, and were masters of the position. In the last ditch young JOSEPH GORDON was killed, after having fought with extraordinary gallantry all day, and killed five of the enemy. He was shot through the head, and died instantly. A little earlier in the fight, Capt. MADDEN, of the Ninth, was killed, but how we do not know. After driving the enemy from the intrenchments which protected their camp, our troops retired, it being then dark, and slept on the field, to renew the fight next morning. But the enemy had had enough of it. Our scouts, as soon as it was light, saw that the redoubtable chivalry had burned everything that couldn't be carried off, and would burn, and had retreated nobody knew where. Col. KIMBALL is satisfied that the rebel force is utterly disorganized, and that five hundred men cannot be found together anywhere in Western Virginia. We lost thirty men killed, and rather more than that number wounded. Of the enemy over 150 dead bodies were found in the intrenchments by our men before Col. KIMBALL left. Among them was that of a Colonel, supposed to be that of Col. JOHNSON, who commanded. On Saturday night a party of Col. KIMBALL's scouts brought in nine prisoners, among whom was the noted Col. STERN or STORM, who has been one of the most active leaders of the guerilla bands in the country. Two Colonels, and probably five hundred men killed and wounded, with thirty prisoners, make up a very handsome victory, and the enemy confess it by burning up their camp and scattering in every way. We lost nine prisoners, of the Ninth Regiment, by their headlong disposition to get ahead of the rest of the regiment. Our total loss, we suppose, is about seventy, in killed, wounded and prisoners.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS REBELLION NEWS.; THE VICTORY AT CAMP ALLEGANY, V.A.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS REBELLION NEWS.; THE VICTORY AT CAMP ALLEGANY, V.A.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Indianapolis Journal, Dec. 19', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Dec', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1673ca9-2382-5887-ade6-620c6c12d973,1018,nyt://article/e1673ca9-2382-5887-ade6-620c6c12d973,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/24/archives/the-war-on-the-kansas-frontier.html,,"Gen. HUNTER'S Department, as recently organized, embraces the State of Kansas and the four vast Territories to its north, south and west Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, and the Indian domain. In geographical extent it is far the largest of any of the military departments. His command comprises now about sixteen thousand men, mostly stationed at Leavenworth and other points on the Missouri River border, at Fort Scott and other points on the western land line of Missouri, with detachments at Denver and elsewhere in the Territories, and some in Missouri. The work to be accomplished is to defend Kansas from PRICE, RAINS and MCCULLOCH's marauders; to keep in subjection the wild Indians of the Plains; to rescue the Indian domain west of Arkansas from the hands of the semi-civilized secession red men; to tickle the ribs of Arkansas itself; perhaps to trepan Texas; and may be, in certain events, to make a bold push southward even for the Gulf of Mexico. The first part of the work, the defence of Kansas, may almost be said to be accomplished already, by Gen. POPE's dashing operations last week in Western Missouri; for PRICE will never dare now to move west of his present position, where he might be suddenly cut off from retreat by POPE, and the rest of his ruffians be as neatly bagged as a couple of thousands of them have just been by that intrepid General. The Indian difficulty is now also likely to find a very easy solution, since delegations from the tribes have visited Washington, and been impressed by the fact that the National army was what they loftily designated a ""big thing."" The whole army of this Department will thus speedily be set free for a Winter campaign in the seceded States of the Southwest or somewhere else. The troops composing this column are of the very best material for campaigning in the whole army. They are mostly Westerners, hardy and self-helping, accustomed to exposure, expert with the rifle, and full of adventure and the spirit of war. Most of them, too, have seen service during the past Summer in Missouri, and are anxious again to meet the rebel foemen with whom they have already measured blades. The force in the Department will probably be increased ere long to twenty or twenty-five thousand men.

Our London correspondent says that the British Government is preparing for war with the utmost energy; that businessmen are getting ready for the storm, and that nearly the whole English nation, including the mob, is reveling in literal madness on account of the alleged insult to the English bunting. The air was thick with canards of every conceivable kind. Nevertheless, a majority of the ministry and of the commercial classes are opposed to war, and if MASON and SLIDELL were returned, a rational reaction may be expected. That, however, is universally demanded as a preliminary to any negotiations whatever. The Secessionists in Europe are in raptures over the prospect, and expect that the English Government will presently be their avowed ally. The British Press, or at least a part of it, is more temperate in its comments than it was a fortnight before; the Times, however, is as malignant as ever. Gen. SCOTT's letter had produced a mollifying effect in some quarters. Several liberal members of Parliament, among others JOHN BRIGHT, had made efforts to calm the excitement, but apparently with little effect. We have a report of the anti-war meeting in Dublin, and the speech of T. O'DONOGHUE, which was received with bravos, yells, hisses and cheers. It appears, however, that the Irish malignity against England is strong as ever. The Shipping Gazette shows that England is not dependent on this country for Breadstuffs; and that in that respect a state of war will make little difference to her. The English secession Presses were feeding the people with daily doses of the most astonishing lies -- some of which we copy.

And on this point, if we are not able to cite an exact precedent, there is, at least, on record an acconnt of baptism having been performed in this wholesale style. The story is told of a Polish Bishop, who, being called upon to perform the ceremony on a heathenish and unchristened army, summoned them by battalions, and, waving a huge besom over them, baptised the first as collective Peter; second, Paul, etc. Why should not some such plan he inaugurated in what is, in more senses than one, our grand Union army?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY MATRIMONY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY MATRIMONY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ae3773a-4f11-5a60-a5bc-5b86e67359a1,203,nyt://article/9ae3773a-4f11-5a60-a5bc-5b86e67359a1,

"TIGHT BARNS.--The Massachusetts Ploughman has the following eminently sensible remarks on a very important subject: ""Cattle must have air, or they die. Hay must have air, or it becomes musty. Corn must have air in the crib, or it rots.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/26/archives/agricultural-and-domestic.html,,"TIGHT BARNS.--The Massachusetts Ploughman has the following eminently sensible remarks on a very important subject: ""Cattle must have air, or they die. Hay must have air, or it becomes musty. Corn must have air in the crib, or it vote. Many farmers seem not to understand this; and they inclose their barns as tight as double-boarding will permit -- making it necessary to give their hay two or three hours more sunning than it would need in barns that admit some air between the boards. It is an universal law that all living animals require air. Even fish in the ponds die very soon when deprived of air. They inhale a small quantity through their gills; and, by closing those gills tight with twine, they die in their own element. Some animals require much more than others. Those living under water require the least, while the fowls of the air require the greatest quantity, and their blood is warmer than that of cattle. But the blood of fishes is comparatively cold. The alarming fever among cattle, which prevailed here last year, was generally supposed to have come from Holland, whence Mr. Chenery, of Belmont, imported his cows. Different opinions were given on this point; but most of the papers on fanning were filled with accounts of fevers that had often prevailed in Germany, England and France. And they had not the least doubt that Mr. Chenery had imported the German fever with the German cows. But we are now confirmed in the opinions heretofore expressed by us -- for Mr. Chenery himself told us, last week, that he had no doubt the fever among his cattle was caused by their being confined closely in his very tight barn. His agent, also, who has the care of his cattle, stated to us explicitly that the want of free air was the sole cause of the fever. And now for tight barns. Why will practical farmers continue to throw away their money in buildings barns so tight that the cattle cannot breathe in them -- so tight that the hay becomes musty, and the horses become diseased with the heaves? We have been recently informed that a gentleman in Walpole has been building a barn so costly that but few farmers could think of imitating it. The cost was $6,000. Well, it was filled with hay last Summer, but it could not hold hay. Soon after haying was over the owner went into his barn, and declared that the hay was on fire. It actually smoked so much that he thought spontaneous combustion must take place. He ordered the mows to be overhauled, and the side-boards to be opened to let in air. His hay, of course, was nearly spoiled, and would be worthless without removal. It is cruel to keep cattle tied up in cold barns, as many have done, where drafts of air pass through, and the frost freezes hard the manure behind them. But the poorest farmer can prevent all this, if he has ingenuity enough to place his principal haymow on the cold sides of his barn, to stop all draft of air through it. The hay maybe dealt out in Winter in such a way as to leave that portion of the mow on the cold side or sides untouched till mild weather comes. A hay-cutter will leave the mow in good trim. The wall boards of barns should not be jointed. It is loss of labor and of lumber to make the edges straight by planing or jointing. Good barn boards will come together quits close enough by merely pressing them together by means of a small iron bar. Boards put on in this way will keep the snow out, and let a little air in -- enough to keep hay from spoiling and cattle from catching fevers.""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a42bea08-a6d0-5761-b90d-a8ca7bb03876,2024,nyt://article/a42bea08-a6d0-5761-b90d-a8ca7bb03876,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/26/archives/christmas-in-newyork-brooklyn-and-jersey-city-the-dayits-general.html,,"For reasons but too evident to the sense of every citizen, the high festival of the Christian Church, sacred forever to a fallen race, was not cele brated yesterday with that boisterous and exuberant hilarity which has for a generation past distinguished its recurrence in this City. Christmas to our people has been the gala day of our tenderest associations the very jubilee of every kindliest and purest thought. In comparison with all other days of the whole year -- working days and festive ones alike -- we have made it what the charmed circle of home is, contrasted with the dullness or turbulence of the outer world. From infancy to manhood, the anniversary of the Saviour's birth has been the heaven of memory. Dedicated to God by the laws and observances of our religious faith, it has been continually sanctified in our hearts by the traditions of family and home. It is with the Christmas times of by-gone years that most of us associate the pleasantest and fondest recollections that are left to us of all that we have loved and lost; or with the hope of its return, bearing wealth and honors to our hearths, that we connect the inmost longings of the future. Because then Christmas among us belongs to the fireside where parent and child, sister and brother, have been wont, each year, to reassemble for the renewal of fond pledges, and the sharing of innocent joys, it was outwardly less gay with us here than for half a lifetime gone. Too many were far away, exposed to privation, wounds and death; too many had already paid the debt of patriotism in the sacrifice of their lives, and still too many more were groaning on beds of sickness or mutilation, not to leave the public heart full of sober reflection, sometimes of heavy grief. But even this changed mood gave in the minds of most a higher significance to the day. The glow of the national purification rested on the popular gaze, and where, here and there, the battle-cloud obscured a spot of the horizon, it seemed but to enhance the splendor of the morning close at hand for our country and the system she defends. In this spirit, a vast portion of our people went heartily to work in the celebration of the merry Yule-tide. A grand body of irrepressibles, and among them the Celt and the Teuton loomed up largely, and defying pestilence, famine and death, in the pursuit of their native humor, gave full vent to jollity in a Metropolis where no one of the terrors indicated existed beyond the realm and sway they always claim in any hive of human beings.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Christmas in New-York, Brooklyn and Jersey City.; The Day--Its General Observance--The Churches, Charitable Institutions, and Places of Amusement--A Bright and Happy Festival.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Christmas in New-York, Brooklyn and Jersey City.; The Day--Its General Observance--The Churches, Charitable Institutions, and Places of Amusement--A Bright and Happy Festival.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Christmas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4907eb8-f370-555e-8d0e-6af9ebcf8360,3271,nyt://article/a4907eb8-f370-555e-8d0e-6af9ebcf8360,

It not only championed the National Government against the London Times, the Herald, the Saturday Review, and other revilers and contemners of the American people, but became the medium through which loyal Americans in Europe might file their answers to the misrepresentations of those papers. But the cartel of the ""Purser of the Trent,"" put the News fairly to the right about. No Tory organ was more thoroughly out of temper, and given over to more revengeful appetite. The demand for redress, which Ministers were assumed to be drafting, was required to take the form of an ultimatum. The steamer waiting to carry it out was to be followed by the entire available navy. Armies were to be forthwith launched upon Canada; the Empire was to be placed upon a war footing -- not so much by way of intimidation, as of precaution against the supposed hostile animus dictating the policy, of which Capt. WILKES was the instructed agent. It was in fact the worst feature of the first English intelligence after the fact, that the steadiest friend our people was known to have in the English Press should turn thus fiercely against us, excelling, indeed, in its ferocity, the attitude of the Times itself.

In some of the journals there are evidences of returning reason. At a United Prayer Meeting, Hon. BAPTIST NOEL and others fervently prayed for peace. Lord SHAFTESBURY thought this a rebuke to the Government, and that it would be better to pray privately for peace. Various religious bodies, together with the Peace Society, were deprecating hostilities. The Bight Honorable J.K.

In another column we produce a series of extracts from journals collectively of vast circulation and influence, which unite in deprecating a war upon a ground so frivolous as the search of the Trent, and concur in recommending a reference of the case to arbitration, and a submission to whatever award an impartial tribunal may make. When the first tidings of the transaction reached England no such voice was raised. The rush of popular indignation carried the entire Press along with it. The London Star and Manchester Examiner called indeed for a suspension of judgment until the American representation of the affair should arrive; and doubted whether a belligerent motive had prompted the instructions under which Capt. WILKES was presumed to act, but they went no further. To-day we find a score of influential newspapers sturdily combating any resort to war; and a few of them going so far as to justify the action of the American Captain by appeal to British precedents. The change is striking and gratifying. When the Ministerial Press shall have sufficiently out-vapored and out-thundered the Conservatives to render moderation possible without risking a Parliamentary defeat, it too may be expected to join in the cry for peace, and show all readiness to meet half way the pacific dispositions of the American Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ENGLISH WAR-FEVER ON THE MEND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ENGLISH WAR-FEVER ON THE MEND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f39b1c7-e953-5358-97b5-df93553fcaa0,236,nyt://article/0f39b1c7-e953-5358-97b5-df93553fcaa0,

He desires it to be understood that he came clothed with no mission and charged with no message whatever, from any foreign prince or power; -- that he had no interview either with the Emperor NAPOLEON or with M. THOUVENEL, his Minister of Foreign Affairs; and that his reason for coining home was the apprehension of immediate hostilities between England and the United States, and the fear that, if he did not embrace this opportunity of returning, he could not return at all. The only high personage with whom Gen. SCOTT had any political conversation in France was Prince NAPOLEON -- and to him he expressed his confident belief that, if foreign nations did not interfere, the rebellion would be effectually suppressed by midsummer, and that before that time cotton for the supply of the immediate necessities of other nations would be supplied through the Southern ports of which our troops are taking possession. Gen. SCOTT states that the feeling in England and France was universal that war is inevitable. He shared it himself to the fullest extent until he reached this City. What he has since seen of public sentiment on this side the Atlantic has, however, very materially modified this opinion. The cause of the extraordinary anger of England, Gen. SCOTT believes, is the conviction on the part of the great body of the English people that the United States are resolved upon war, to punish England for her concession of belligerent rights to the rebel States. The affair of the Trent is regarded as having been made the occasion for manifesting this feeling toward Great Britain; and not one man in a thousand believed that the Government of the United States would disavow the act, or make for it the slightest reparation or apology, -- no matter how clear might be their conviction that it was in manifest violation of the principles of international law. Gen. SCOTT is satisfied, as every person in this country must be, that this assumption is utterly unfounded, -that this Government has not the slightest wish or willingness to insult Great Britain, and that any reparation consistent with National honor, for any wrong that may have been done, will be promptly and cheerfully afforded.

The City and Central Railroad Companies had a long and expensive contest about which had the best right to the use of Furman-street, and, after a year's wrangling, and the expenditure of a vast amount of money, they made a compromise. The Newtown Railroad Company and the Coney Island Railroad Company have been set by the ears through the secret machinations of another Company, it is believed, interested in having the operating of these roads delayed. The ostensible difficulty is about the approach to Fulton Ferry through Water-street -- both claiming exclusive privileges on this street. The Coney Island Company, seizing upon a favorable opportunity got their track down first, when the other company also attempted to lay another track on the same street, but were restrained by an injunction. Several injunctions have been granted on both sides, and amended and annulled so often that the parties in interest hardly know now where they do stand. At all events the Newtown Company resolved yesterday morning to tear up the track of the Coney Island Company, and at 11 1/2 o'clock commenced the work, when they were stopped by a posse of Police by direction of Superintendent KENNEDY, who also gave instructions not to permit either company to do anything in the disputed district until the legal questions involved shall nave been decided.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4bfb352-3867-5bfe-83c2-b1fe8b40fc47,371,nyt://article/e4bfb352-3867-5bfe-83c2-b1fe8b40fc47,

We this morning publish the diplomatic correspondence between the Governments of France and England on the one hand, and that of the United States on the other, concerning the question of in ternational law, involved in the seizure of the rebel Commissioners. The first document is a note from Mr. SEWARD to Mr. ADAMS, in which the case is briefly mentioned, and in which Mr. SEWARD says that the action of Capt. WILKES was without any instructions from the Government, and he trusted that the British Government would consider the subject in a friendly temper. Then follows a note from Earl RUSSELL to Lord LYONS, dated Nov. 30, reciting the English version of the case -- declaring that the act of Capt. WILKES was an affront to the British flag, and a violation of international law; and announcing that the ""liberation of the four gentlemen named, and their delivery to your lordship,"" together with a suitable apology for the aggression, alone could satisfy the British nation. To this Mr. SEWARD responds in a paper, addressed to Lord LYONS, under date of the 26th inst., in which he analyzes at great length the principles of public law involved in the case, and arrives at the conclusion that the Government of the United States would be wrong in refusing to comply with the British demand, so far as relates to the disposition that shall be made of the persons captured. He closes by saying that the ""four persons in question"" will be cheerfully liberated; and your lordship will please indicate a time and place for receiving them."" No ""apology,"" however, is offered, because no offence was intended. To this Lord LYONS responds by announcing that he will forward the communication to Her Majesty's Government, and will immediately make arrangements to place the ""four gentlemen"" again ""under the protection of the British flag."" Beside these documents on the Trent case, there is a dispatch from M. THOUVENEL, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, to M. MERCIER, the ""Minister of the Emperor at Washington,"" in which THOUVENEL pronounces the conduct of the American cruiser unjustifiable, but hopes for a pacific solution of the difficulty. To this Mr. SEWARD responds in a note to M. MERCIER, in which he corrects an error of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, refers him to his correspondence with the British Government, and exchanges assurances of friendship. The whole correspondence will doubtless be universally perused.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dfeaee2-b99e-564a-b116-1051b4db8bc9,693,nyt://article/4dfeaee2-b99e-564a-b116-1051b4db8bc9,

The London Times, in commenting upon this speech, commends its sentiments. Mr. SEYMOUR FITZGERALD made a speech at Bury on the 11th, in which he deprecated a war with the United States, and hoped it would be averted. Mr. FREDERICK PEEL also made a speech on the 11th, in which he counseled moderation in regard to the Trent affair. He likewise gave his views relative to the struggle between the United States Government and the rebellion, in which he expressed his belief that the North was fighting for dominion as well as for union, and that the South was fighting for self-government as well as for Slavery. Mr. H. BRAND, at Lewes, on the 10th, insisted that England regarded with the most friendly feeling the people of the United States, and looked upon war with them as a great calamity to be averted, if possible, without loss of National honor. Mr. MILLER, at Leith on the 10th, denounced the affair of the Trent as a gross insult to England, the culmination of a series of offences for which America ought to be punished.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/12/29/archives/the-affair-of-the-trent-further-indications-of-british-opinion.html,,"Mr. HORSMAN, M.P., addressed his constituents at Stroud, on the 10th. The right honorable gentle man referred to the principal questions discussed during the past session, and expressed his approval of the policy of non-intervention pursued by the Government with respect to the affairs of foreign nations. With respect to the Hungarian question, he said: ""I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion, which the friends of Austria ought to regard, that unless Austria does by some means or other conciliate her Hungarian subjects, the first shot fired in Europe may bring about such a state of circumstances that any man, a few years hence, looking at the map of Europe for the empire of Austria, may haply look in vain."" Passing on to the affairs of America, he expressed his conviction that the truth with regard to the latter was as stated by Earl RUSSELL -- ""that the North were fighting for empire and the South for independence."" He continued: We know that the Northerns have been swelling almost to bursting with the contemplation of the future grandeur of the great American republic embracing one whole continent, with a population so vast, and so compact in its structure, that it would give the law to all the other nations of the world. I have never met with an American, with any traveler or writer who could give any assignable limit to an American's vision of the future grandeur of his country. He has looked upon it in commerce, in arts, in arms, in everything that promotes civilization, as the future government and guide of the whole world. On the other hand, the Southerns say that they desire immediate independence, and that they prefer independence to the yoke of partnership in future grandeur. They say that they are strong enough and large enough to maintain themselves. They argue that they lose more than they gain by their connection with the North, and that, in abandoning the North, they are merely giving effect to the same principle which the founders of the republic established when they repudiated their connection with England. [Hear, hear.] The war proceeds, and in a short time it is shown that the English Government were right in their estimate of the power and the prospects of the contending parties. The South has proved itself able to hold its own, and the North has shown not only military failures, but a complete break-down of civil government. There is not a security that was established for liberty of speech, writing, or motion, which has not been swept away; and there is not amongst the most despotic Governments of Europe one spot on the earth in which every constitutional right has been so entirely suspended, and in which the freedom of individuals is so utterly destroyed, as in the States of North America. [Hear, hear.] An opinion has been expressed that Democracy in America has failed. I am not desirous of going into that question now, but I may say that the result of what has been going on shows that the military enterprise of the North has so far proved a failure, and that its civil Administration is at this moment utterly disorganized, and has completely broken down. [Hear, hear.] The Cabinet of the North are in a state of great difficulty and embarrassment. The population have been so harrassed that they are almost in a state of desperation. They admit the war must be a long one. And then the question occurs, what is it for? It is obvious that the Union is not easily to be restored; and even if it could, we all know that a Union cemented by blood will not be the old Union founded by the original fathers of the Republic It is not, therefore, the question of the restoration of the Union. It is rather a question as to the terms of separation, as to the boundary to be established. That is a question for arbitration that could be more easily carried out before more blood is shed, before more exasperation is caused, than after a long, pernicious and calamitons war. [Hear, hear.] He next came to the affair of the Trent. The Law-Officers of the Crown have advised Her Majesty that the act complained of is a breach of international law, and, according to some semi-official statements which have been published, the Government have sent a dispatch to Lord LYONS, laying down the terms on which he is instructed to demand reparation from the Cabinet at Washington; and I believe there are two characteristics of that message which are generally acceptable to Europe. The first is, that the demand is said to have been made with great firmness; and the second is, that it is said to be couched in terms the most conciliatory, so as to give the American Government every possible opening to recede with honor, and not imposing upon them the slightest humiliation. [Hear, hear.] I believe that the proceedings of the Government have been approved of from one end of the kingdom to the other, and I believe it is the consciousness of the people that the right course has been pursued and steadily persisted in, that has produced the calm which pervades the whole community. [Hear.] So far as our interests and sympathies are concerned, they would go with the South. When the war first broke out, all our sympathies were ready to enlist themselves with the North, because they believed the cause of the North was that of emancipation; and it was only when we found that they were ready to compound with Slavery, to perpetuate Slavery, to combine all the profits of Slavery with all the advantages of professed abolition, that the reaction took place, and that the English public determined to observe that strict neutrality which to this moment has never been departed from. There was a danger, in the event of war breaking out, that we should be made participators in much we should disapprove, but his sympathies must go with the party that is most moderate, and the most ready for the conclusion of an early peace. [Cheers.] There is one plea the force of which we must all admit: the weakness of the North is not admitted; on the contrary, they are ready to push at the South, dispose of England, and help themselves to Canada. [Laughter.] We must remember that the abuse of England -- the menacing of England, has not only been a habit but a profitable trade in America. The newspapers are sold by it, the members of Congress get their elections by it, the Secretaries of State are raised to office by it, the Presidents mount the highest steps in the ladder by it. It is the whole political capital on which men thrive -- perpetually reviling and challenging England. We have disregarded it, as we could well afford to do: but it is our duty, in the interests of America, as well as in the interests of Europe, to see that she is brought to her senses, and we must teach her that if she wishes to be respected, that respect must be founded on her own regard for international obligations, her own respect for civilized law, and that she is not to be respected in proportion to her own menacing and bluster. [Cheers.] It is my ardent and sincere belief that there will be no war. In the first place, it is not the interest of the Northern States to go to war. What are they to do if they go to war? At present they are occupied altogether in the South. But they say, ""We are dealing with the South. We may lose territory there, but we shall compensate ourselves by taking Canada. But what do the Canadians say to that? They say they live in too great a proximity to the great Republic, and have formed a very correct notion of the value of its connection. They think the English, monarchy is far more respectable. And there is another argument. If the Americans are unwise enough to show themselves over the frontiers of Canada, they may probably meet with rather a hot reception; and they will soon find some difference between a war with Canada and a war with the Southern States. After an engagement with Canadian regiments, when the Northern heroes run away, they will be followed over the frontier; and, instead of the States annexing Canada,it may happen that Canada may annex a goodly portion of the States themselves. [Cheers.] Well, then, what are they to do by sea? In the last war the American privateer was a very dangerous element to be considered, and people say you will have the American privateers again. But where are they to sail from? The whole South seaboard of the States, which were their great harbors both of exit and refuge, will be closed against them. No Northern privateers can sail from these harbors, and if one enters it will be captured. The whole of the ports of the European Powers are closed against privateers, and there are only two or three harbors which the Americans have, which can be easily blockaded, so that any attempt at privateering would be checkmated. [Hear.] I believe that when it is not the interest of America to go to war with us, it may also be shown to them that it is consistent with their character and honor to remain at peace. [Hear, hear.] I believe that these two motives combined will make them ready to meet half way the judicious concessions asked by England. But whether there was peace or war, he believed there was an end of the Union, and the separation would not only deal a death blow to Slavery, by rendering Fugitive Slave Laws impossible, but would also give strength to the Northern States. They would start up a new empire. The disasters of the present day having opened their eyes to the unsafe parts of the Constitution, they would form a stronger Government, when the few would govern and the many obey, instead of every man governing and no man obeying. [Hear, hear.] If war, he concluded, is to decide these painful and unhappy difficulties, there never was a time when England was in such a condition as to make the results of that war both brief and certain. Commercially, our position is sound. Financially it is so good, that while other nations are endeavoring to extricate themselves from the prospect of bankruptcy, the only quarrel with the House of Commons is, whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall put on or take off another million of taxes.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE AFFAIR OF THE TRENT; Further Indications of British Opinion.

"The heat edifice, just completed, for the St. John's Independent Methodist Church, in Forty-first-street, near the corner of Sixth-avenue, was dedicated yesterday with appropriate exercises. The Society was formed about three years since, commencing with eleven members and seventeen Sabbath School scholars. There are now eighty-eight members and over a hundred scholars.

Some parties who were desirous of creating a disturbance, made an attack upon YOUNG, and three other persons who were with him, and, it is stated, used very abusive language towards them, on the ground that they were Englishmen. The difficulty began at the Ferry-house on the New-York side, and the attacking party continued their denunciations of England and Englishmen while on the boat. When they arrived at Jersey City, the leader of the gang opposed to John Bull, drew a knife and struck it into the right side of YOUNG's head, near the ear. Such was the force of the blow that the blade was broken, and a portion of it left in YOUNG's head. Dr. VARICK was sent for, and succeeded in extracting the broken instrument.

The slave question cannot lose its importance -- cannot become backneyed. There are now in Beaufort District, alone, I am informed by official personages, nearly 16,000 slaves, whose masters have fled, and Beaufort District is but a small portion of the country at present in our hands. I have accompanied a number of the reconnoissances made in all directions from this post, both by sea and land; have witnessed the exploration of the country from Tybee Island on the South, to North Edisto on the North, an extent of at least sixty miles, and have penetrated as far into the interior, on some of these excursions, as our troops have yet gone. Everywhere, I find the same state of things existing; everywhere the blacks hurry in droves to our lines; they crowd in small boats around our ships; they swarm upon our decks; they hurry to our officers, from the cotton-houses of their masters, in an hour or two after our guns are fired.

I have seen negroes who reported themselves as just escaped from their masters, who came breathless to our forces, and said they dared not go back, for their masters would kill them; who told that their masters were at that moment armed and threatening to shoot any slave that did not fly with them; who declared they had tricked their owners and came away in boats that they were bidden to take back to the whites. I have talked with drivers and field-hands, with house, maids and coachmen and body-servants, who were apparently as eager to escape as any. I have heard the blacks point out how their masters might be caught, where they were hidden, what were their forces. I have seen them used as guides and pilots. I have been along while they pointed out in what houses stores of arms and ammunition were kept, and where bodies of troops were stationed. In a few hours I have known this information verified.

On the contrary, recruiting was never so dull as it is now, particularly in this City. The few applicants who do present themselves for enlistment are married men, and, therefore, cannot be taken without an order from the Superintendent. The Secretary of the Navy has adopted a plan which might be followed, with advantage, by the Secretary of war, viz.: that of advertising the different naval rendezvous and undertaking to pay the mileage of acceptable recruits from their place of abode to the nearest rendezvous. This plan will save the expense of opening additional naval rendezvous It was expected that Congress would at once act upon the recommendation of Secretary CAMERON, and authorise the payment of part of the $400 bounty to a recruit on his enlistment, but nothing has been done as yet. The allotment system, already in force in the navy, should be made applicable to the regular army as well.

If America had done wrong, she would apologize for it; if she had done anything contrary to international laws, she would be the first to say so. Why did the English people settle the question before hearing the other side? Why did they not wait until they had heard from the other side of the water? North America was the friend of England, had always been, and always desired to be. Mr. TRAIN proceeded to demonstrate this amid frequent interruptions, during which the Chairman threatened to call in the police and have the disturbers ejected.

On the other hand, our troops are making rapid advances into the State, making their positions secure as they go, and scouting-parties are daily pushed in every direction -- one proceeding from Port Royal Island almost within sight of Savannah. A. portion of the Seventy-ninth Regiment had made a reconnoissance fifteen miles from Beaufort, and taken six rebels prisoners. These reconnoissances and scouts had established the fact that the rebels are able to concentrate, in a short time, upon any given point, from fifteen to twenty thousand men. Another important gunboat reconnoissance had been made, which had been pushed within fifteen miles of Charleston, at a town called Rockwell. Here a force of four hundred rebels was found, which fled in a panic when an inferior force of our men was landed. The Empire City also brings later news from Tybee Island. The Union forces there are still engaged on the intrenchments. It is expected that a movement will soon be made in the direction of Savannah. The number of rebel troops at that place is put down at about two thousand. On the 23d inst. a boat containing a number of rebels came down the channel from Savannah, to sound the bar, it is supposed, for the British steamer Fingal, which is loaded with cotton, and waiting to run the blockade.

"About 7 1/2 o'clock last evening, a fire was discovered in the Judd Linseed and Sperm Oil Manufactory situated at No. 512 Cherry-street. The building is a very large one, being four stories in height, and about two hundred feet in length. It was built of brick, in the most substantial manner, for a manufacturing establishment. The fire originated on the second floor, and, as it is believed, from spontaneous combustion. The firemen were very promptly on hand, and after about half an hour, they succeeded, as it was supposed, in effectually extinguishing the flames. They therefore pulled up and left the premises. In about an hour after, the bells sounded again for the same district, and it was soon ascertained that the flames had broken out a fresh on the upper floors of the establishment. This time the firemen came on in large force, and worked with great zeal. But owing to the inflammable character of the material, the fire raged with great violence, and spread over the third and fourth floors with alarming rapidity. In a brief space of time nearly the whole of the upper part of the building was entirely destroyed. About one hundred feet of the second story was also burned. At least $20,000 worth of property was destroyed. It is fully insured, but in what companies, could not be ascertained. The steamboat of the Harbor Police was promptly on hand, and did very efficient service in protecting the shipping in the immediate vicinity, as well as in throwing water upon the burning building.

Last evening it seemed as if all the old forces had returned to their allegiance with the determination to bear the veteran triumphantly through the season. GOLDSMITH's play of ""She Stoops to Conquer,"" was given, and with a distribution which included all the leading artists of the establishment. It would be more than a raice-told tale to dwell at any length upon the performances of Mr. LESTER WALLACE as Young Harlow: Mr. BLASE as Hardcastle; or Mr. REYNOLDS as Hustings. They were, as heretofore, excellent, and gave to the piece -- which lacks serious interest -- the lightness, hippancy and temper is required. Mr. HISOKIN HOLLAND as Tony Lumpkin was the best representative of the part we have seen on the American stage, imputing a lumpish breadth and jollity to the character which his predecessors have failed to convey. Two small parts, played excellently well by Mr. JOAN SENTON and Mr. YOUNG, deserve honorable mention, simply because such parts are usually [???] on the piece.

""The American Government and the American Press, particularly the New-York Herald,"" (says the Herald of yesterday,) ""are guided by lofty principles of statesmanship, the strictest rules of international law, and a due regard to the requirements of justice and humanity. Had Mr. Seward and the Herald,"" the Herald adds, ""followed the inclinations of the mob, Earl RUSSELL's demand would have been replied to with defiance, and war would have now existed between England and the United States."" Fortunately for the world, ""Mr. SEWARD and the Herald"" did not ""follow the inclinations of the mob."" ""On the first receipt of the news of the arrest of the Trent,"" says the Herald, ""we said if the proceeding should turn out to be irregular, and contrary to international law, of which there was some doubt, it would be the duty as well as the interest of our Government to make an apology and give up the traitors.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How It Was Done--Splendid Zampillaerostation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How It Was Done--Splendid Zampillaerostation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8915a12-411e-5d6b-93e0-5d23c99cf9fc,1239,nyt://article/a8915a12-411e-5d6b-93e0-5d23c99cf9fc,

WILKES cut short six weeks ago. There is evidently an intent to mystify the public as to their departure, however, for it is affirmed and denied, and denied and affirmed again. Perhaps it would not do to break the news too suddenly to the Bostonians, and make them utterly inconsolable at the loss. The rest of the country, however, ardently hope that the riddance may be as speedy as possible, and sincerely pray that they may not be drowned in transitu -- to the end that the other half of the proverb may at some future day be illustrated in their persons. There is one class of persons who will bitterly mourn the departure of MASON and SLIDELL -- the rebel leaders at Richmond, who would a thousand times rather have them as ""Ambassadors"" to Fort Warren, with the prospect of trouble between the United States and England in consequence, than at the posts to which they were accredited. As everybody knows how profoundly JEFF. DAVIS and his crew will be chagrined at the upshot of the matter, and as everybody is prepared to hear a howl of hypocritical taunting from their journals, it will, on the whole, be a very capital joke. But six weeks have passed since their journey to Europe was interrupted; they now resume it, but they go to Europe totally different men. They are rendered perfectly harmless. For the case they have raised has defined American policy in Europe, and when Mr. SEWARD's dispatch reaches the other side they will have done more to extinguish the rebel hopes of foreign recognition, and to raise the cause of the Union in England and France, than any or all influences together. The teeth of the serpents have been drawn, the wings of the birds have been clipped, and they are, on the whole, damaged dry goods. A kind of theoretical interest will attach to them as to persons identified with a cause celebre. And as the ""Ambassadors"" flit uneasilly around the outer doors of St. James and the Tuilleries, individuals of an antiquarian turn of mind will point to them as MASON and SLIDELL of the Trent.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MASON AND SLIDELL', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MASON AND SLIDELL', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c270230b-21ec-57c5-ae76-dcb82ce91b91,399,nyt://article/c270230b-21ec-57c5-ae76-dcb82ce91b91,

"DARING EXPLOITS OF TWO COLORED MEN. -- Officer SLOWEY, of the Detective Police, yesterday arrested two colored men named JOHN and PETER WHITEHEAD. The former is about 18, and the latter 21 years of age. They state that they are brothers, and natives of New-Jersey. They are charged upon several complaints with larceny and burglary. Not long since Mr. MOSES TAYLOR, residing in Bergen, N.J., where he is the proprietor of a store, was robbed, one dark night, in a very mysterious manner. Some time in the evening he closed his place of business, took his tin box, which contained $75 in money, a knife and considerable other valuable property, and proceeded a short distance to his house. When he reached it, he placed the box on the steps while he felt in his pocket for a key to unlock the door. Upon stooping down for the box a moment after, he found, to his great surprise that it was gone. It was most unaccountable, and no information could be obtained as to the whereabouts of the guilty parties until yesterday, when they were arrested at the house of a Mrs. BROWN, in Mercer-street, in this City. A clue to the culprits was obtained in this way: Last Friday night the house of JOHN FARDON, also a resident of Bergen, was broken open, and an overcoat and other property, amounting in value to $40, was stolen therefrom. The same night a barn was entered in the neighborhood, a fire kindled therein, and a horse taken from the stable and rode as far as Hoboken, where it was released. These offences greatly alarmed the Bergen people, who sent immediately to the New-York Detective office. A description of the men enabled Officer SLOWEY to trace them to the house in Mercer-street where they were found. When PETER WHITEHEAD was searched, the knife belonging to Mr. TAYLOR, was found upon his person. They were both taken to Headquarters, where, after a good deal of quibbling, they finally confessed that they were the persons who stole Mr. TAYLOR's box, and who shortly after broke into Mr. FARDON's house.
