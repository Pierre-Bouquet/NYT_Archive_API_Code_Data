In view of the recent intelligence of movements at Charleston, the principal interest centred in the Congressional proceedings -- it being expected that some allusion would of course be made to events which have transpired during the brief holiday recess. In the Senate galleries a great crowd was gathered -- the attraction being a speech by Senator BENJAMIN, of Louisiana, which he intimated in advtance would be a secession speech. After some preliminary business, Mr. POWELL, of Kentucky, Chairman of the Special Committee of Thirteen on the State of the Union, reported that the Committee had been unable to agree, and asked that the journal of their proceedings be printed. Mr. DOUGLAS intimated a desire to speak upon the subject, but postponed his remarks until Wednesday. Mr. CRITTENDEN'S joint resolution was made the special order for Wednesday. Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, offered a resolution, which was objected to and laid over, requesting the Secretary of War to inform the Senate relative to the condition of the arms in the national armories, &c. The special order -- Territorial business -- was then postponed, and Mr. BENJAMIN proceeded to make his expected secession speech, which he closed with a declaration that the South could never be subjugated, A scene of indescribable confusion thereupon ensued in the galleries, which were finally cleared by the Sergeant-at-Arms. Mr. BAKER, of Oregon, obtained the floor for a rejoinder, but yielded to a motion to adjourn. The House also had an exciting session. The Speaker presented the communication from the Secretary of War, published in yesterday's TIMES, and it was referred to the Select Committee on the Abstraction of the Bonds. Several resolutions were offered, having for their object an inquiry into the condition of the forts and arsenals, but being objected to, they were laid over under the rules. Mr. PRYOR, of Virginia, offered a resolution declaring that any attempt to preserve the Union by force would be impracticable, and demanded the previous question, which was ordered. After considerable objection to the vote being taken, and a somewhat excited discussion, the resolution was tabled, 98 to 55. The Committee on Military Affairs, on motion of Mr. STANTON, of Ohio, was then instructed to inquire into the manner in which arms had been distributed during the year 1860, the condition of the forts, arsenals, &c., and whether the fortifications are suitably garrisoned -- the Committee having power to send for persons and papers. Messrs. DAVIS and HOLMAN, of Indiana, each presented resolutions relative to the recent action of the South Carolina Convention, but the House adjourned before any action on them was taken.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/210fc674-ac87-532e-90ae-f0da41e14f2b,1709,nyt://article/210fc674-ac87-532e-90ae-f0da41e14f2b

The good burghers in the day of the Dutch domination were wont to make the first day of the year the occasion of family reunions and revivals of old friendships. But we have changed all that. Of late it has come to be thought of rather as an opportunity for forming new acquaintances, and quietly dropping those which may have ceased to be desirable. Further than this it is to very many merely a season for testing their capacity for strong drink; or, for learning and retailing the small scandals of families; or, for squaring the circle of their female society, -- determing how many it contains, that is, (its superficial contents, generally) and visiting all in order that they may boast of the achievement afterwards. Then there are others who look upon the 1st of January as the day specially appointed and set apart for the drawing of matrimonial lotteries.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/01/archives/let-the-pacific-railroad-bill-pass.html,,"On Wednesday next the Senate is expected to take up for final action, the bill from the House of Representatives, for the construction of a Pacific Railroad, the measure having been made a special order for that day. The pending bill extends the aid of the Government to the construction of two roads -- one by the central and the other by the Texas route. To an outside observer it would appear certain that the Senate will promptly concur in the action of the House. There are few men who have studied the subject, probably, who have the slightest idea that more than one of these roads will be completed during the next 50 years, if even then; but, paradoxical as it seems, that is the very reason why a bill providing for two roads is the only one that can become a law.

He had a narrow escape from bringing down upon his head, as a New-Year's greeting, the thanks and applause of millions of American freemen. The telegraph announced in the afternoon that Gen. SCOTT had been appointed Secretary of War ad interim, and that the Cabinet Councils had been purged of their disunion virus by the resignations of Messrs. THOMPSON and THOMAS. Wherever the report went, it created universal rejoicing. Men of all parties exulted in the prospect of again having a Government around which the hope and the courage of the nation could rally, and which could be relied upon under all contingencies to maintain unsullied the honor of the American flag. If the news had proved to be true, the President would have been greeted to-day with salvos of cannon from one end of the Union to the other. And this would have happened, -- not from any wish, as the groveling partisan of the Constitution affects to fear, for the establishment of a military dictatorship, nor from any personal devotion to the fortunes of the veteran Chieftain of our Republic; -- but because the nation reposes with unwavering confidence on his single-hearted patriotism, and on the high-toned, wise and unswerving devotion to the Union and the Constitution which he would bring to the duties of that great office.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Prospects at Washington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Prospects at Washington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bddf717a-55f0-5843-a61b-97ff28d05468,868,nyt://article/bddf717a-55f0-5843-a61b-97ff28d05468

Another significant indication is to be found in the fact that the militia of the District of Columbia is to be reorganized, the Secretary of War having, at the recommendation of Gen.

Plaintiff also claims that if his private sewer is used by the defendants for such a purpose, he should receive a fair compensation for such use.

"The death of this nobleman is announced. JAMES ANDREW BROWN DALHOUSIE, Marquis of Dalhousie, was the tenth Earl of Dalhousie. He was born at Dalhousie Castle, near Edinbro', in 1812, and was therefore in the forty-eighth year of his ago. As Lord Ramsey, his title by courtesy, he was first educated at Harrow School, and then took his degrees at Oxford, in 1833. He contested, without success, the representation of Edinburgh, on Conservative principles, with Mr. ABERCROMBY subsequently Speaker of the House of Commons, and with Sir JOHN CAMPBELL, the present Lord Chancellor. By his frankness, and manly straightforwardness, however, he won golden opinions, not less from his adversaries than from his partisans. In 1837 he was returned to the House of Commons for the County of Haddington, and on the death of his father, in, 1838, he succeeded to the earldom of Dalhousie. In 1843 he was appointed Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and in 1845 President, with a seat in the Cabinet, resigning with the Ministry in 1846. In 1847, on the return of Lord HARDINGE from India, he was offered and accepted the Governor-Generalship, being the youngest man ever appointed to that responsible office. The Sikhs, shortly after his landing, broke out a second time into war. Under his management they were defeated everywhere. He then annexed the Punjaub, seemingly indifferent to public opinion as to that decisive step: Pegu, Bezar, and Nagpore, and lastly, Oude came under the same system of political acquisition; but while conquering and annexing, ho did not forget to develop the internal resources of the country. Railways, canals, and telegraphs were established; she sought to reform the administration of the civil and legal departments, and extended education and public works. In 1849 he was elevated to the dignity of a Marquis, receiving at the same time the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. He was a K.T., and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Marquis returned from his duties in the East, in shattered health, in 1855.

"The Woman's Library will be found a pleasant place this Winter for those who avail themselves of its privileges. Many beautiful books have lately been added to its former handsome collection, among which are two splendid editions of Shakespeare, and other rare and valuable books, from BURTON's Library. Of the Shakespeares, one is the edition of JOHNSON & STEVENS, of 1778, in twelve large volumes, and the other is HANMER's (Oxford) edition of 1771. There is also BOYDEL's Plates of SHAKESPEARE, the most beautiful engravings illustrating the works of that great man ever executed. Another fascinating book is HOLBEIN's Court of Henry VIII. The ladies examining this curious volume, will get some new ideas as to the fashions of headdresses of the greatest beauties of the Court in those days, and will be surprised to find that bewitching creature, ANNE BOLEYN, with her head tied up in a dingy handkerchief, and looking, as Mrs. Crupp would say, ""quite ornary."" HOLBEIN was the great painter of HENRY VIII.'s Court; and the portraits in this book are perfect copies of those which hang upon the walls of Hampton Court Palace. But perhaps the most acceptable addition to the books of the Woman's Library will be the books of fashion, which will be imported direct from Paris every month, beginning with last December, for the benefit of those women engaged in various branches of millinery and dressmaking, whose means have prevented their access to the highest authorities in fashion, and whose opportunities for improvement in their business has been thereby cramped and delayed. The subscription price to the best magazines of fashion published in Paris is from $10 to $15 a year; and the Woman's Library has ordered nearly a dozen of the best, comprising those containing plates and new patterns for needlework and crotchet, as well as those for dresses, cloaks, mantillas, and millinery. Paper patterns accompany the magazines devoted to the latter, and the subscribers to the Library will be permitted to cut patterns from them. Thus they will have artistic rules to guide them, and may become finished artists in their work themselves. Would not the gift of a year's subscription ticket to the Library be acceptable to most not over-rich young women?",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/04/archives/a-pleasant-place.html,,"The Woman's Library will be found a pleasant place this Winter for those who avail themselves of its privileges.

Mr. RAREY, the most renowned of this class, and a man who is acknowledged to be without an equal, and so far as we know without a rival, having graduated in Europe, comes back to the land of his birth for the applause which should surely await him. His first ""lecture,"" (for so it is properly called, inasmuch as its object is not merely amusement but instruction,) takes place to-day, at Niblo's Garden, commencing at 3 o'clock. The event will need, we are sure, no more than this simple mention. But we may add, as a circumstance of decided public interest, that Mr. RAREY has succeeded in securing a horse of due viciousness, and one who is likely to do full justice to his peculiar powers of persuasion. The animal, Joe Anderson by name, Is known extensively to those who frequent the road, his owner being Mr. LUFF, a hosteler of high fame in the up-town eastern side of the City. Joe is descended legitimately from the famous Messenger, and is supposed to be the only scion of that distinguished horse now in America. His antecedents are in the highest degree unsatisfactory. Mischievous treatment in early horsehood soured the natural sweetness of his disposition, and from the time when an accidental injury was inflicted on him with a pitchfork, he has never been known to do a kindly thing. For the last four years he has been allowed to have, his own way, and has taken advantage of the opportunity to inflict all the injury on his friends that was possible. It is said that among other feats he has killed two boys who were indiscreet enough to come within his reach. During the entire period he has never had a shoe upon his feet. His owner is is incredulous of Mr. RAREY'S powers, and will be satisfied if the redoubtable Joe can be subdued, oven with the grim hand of death. He is regarded as incorrigible, as a veritable Cruiser, and a blessed malcontent whom the public will relish hugely.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Rarey's First Lecture."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Rarey's First Lecture."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Horses', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-01-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/25b83d77-9f5b-52bd-8f4b-b4013140c9a9,435,nyt://article/25b83d77-9f5b-52bd-8f4b-b4013140c9a9

He commenced his discourse with a reference to the unusual circumstances under which the congregation had been called together. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/05/archives/rev-p-strobels-discourse-the-political-crisis.html,,"He commenced his discourse with a reference to the unusual circumstances under which the congregation had been called together. The Union which they loved was in jeopardy. The President, dispairing of all help which might be afforded by human counselers, called upon them to draw near to God, asking His interposition. They had responded to that call, and he need not tell them how deeply he entered into the spirit of the day. The seceding State was his birthplace -- the home of his mother and dearest kindred. Must not, then, his soul feel some sympathy for it. Here, now, was his home, and the birthplace of his children, and how could he feel otherwise than alarmed at the dread separation, which seemed to be impending. Let them look, then, together at the hopes vouchsafed of God's interposition in these dark days. In seeking a proper solution of the text they must recur to the age in which it was written. Rome was then the mistress of the world; her procurators and governors everywhere ruled her captured provinces; her officers and soldiers everywhere displayed the imperial standard, and commanded an unwilling obedience. Publicans were engaged in the thankless office of levying taxes upon the industry of the world, and sending them up to the Metropolis to swell the tide of wealth which flowed at the feet of the Caesars. The religion of the day was a superstitious idolatry, the immorality the most debasing and beastly that ever disgraced the world; the amusements, on the one hand licentious, and on the other cruel and inhuman; the bondage of the slave intolerable, the punishment of the prisoner barbarous; and while there was intelligence, learning, refinement in the better classes, we could scarcely conceive of a state of society so degraded, immoral and destructive to the best interests of religion and humanity, as the rule of despotic Rome. Here and there throughout that vast empire there was to be found little clusters of Christians who had given their hearts to the service of Him who had been crucified, adopting his precepts as the rule of life, and trusting to His promises as an unfailing source of happiness. Persecutions innumerable surrounded their path. To the dungeon and the cross thousands of them were marched, presenting a long catalogue of martyrs called to suffer and die for the sake of Jesus. What was their duty in their said condition? The great Apostle answering, said: ""I exhort, therefore, first of all, supplications, prayers, and giving of thanks to be made for all men."" The Christians prayed in faith, and the result was a great change, a great reform. Every evil, perhaps, was not reformed; there were still drunkards and debauchees, unfaithful public servants, cruel masters and rebellious slaves; but the Gospel triumphed, and the world was Christianized. And now was there not a much neglected duty brought before them as citizens of the great Republic -- and he asked that God might give them grace to enforce that duty and reduce it to daily practice. From the Capitol, from the great metropolis, from every quiet village and little hamlet, from the extreme North and South notes of alarm were daily wafted to our ears. They told us that the interests, cemented by the blood of our Fathers, rose in jeopardy; that the affections, the patriotism which had stood the best of more than three-quarters of a century; that men's hearts were quaking for fear, and that the future looked dark and ominous. Prejudice and passion seemed to have usurped the place of truth and reason, and in the present unhappy dilemma public men seemed to have lost the power of steering the ship of State out of the quicksands upon which she was in danger of being stranded. Under such circumstances it was the duty of Christians not to leave unemployed the peculiar weapons of their faith to avert the dangers which they feel and fear. We live under the most benignant Government that ever existed -- one which gave us civil and religious liberty, and protected our rights. Granted, that it had its evils, that bad men were sometimes in office, that things were permitted which we did not approve -- still, would we exchange it, with all its imperfections, for any other under the sun? Then, when these notes of alarm reached their ears, what should they, as Christians, do? They should do just what the Christians in Rome did under circumstances infinitely more unpropitious and forbidding. They should pray for the President, for Congress, for the Governor, the Legislature, for the Democrat, the Republican, for the Slaveholder and Abolitionist, for all sorts and conditions of men; for the Christian should have a heart large enough to carry them all with him in the arms of love to a throne of mercy. Let them then pray for the peace of Jerusalem, crucify every feeling which should be banished from the large heart of the patriot Christian, and look upon the whole people of our country as brethren. The more dire the confusion, the more earnestly should they pray, for he knew that He that stilled the tempest still heard prayer, and could produce peace out of discord, friendship out of hate, and, as the now threatening clouds began to disappear from our political horizon, would give us fresh assurances that ""blessed is that people whose God is the Lord.""

How strikingly is this solemn declaration verified by the history of the past? The fulfillment of the prediction will be equally true in all coming time. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/05/archives/rev-dr-canfields-discourse-corruption-in-high-places.html,,"How strikingly is this solemn declaration verified by the history of the past? The fulfillment of the prediction will be equally true in all coming time. Reason alone forbids the belief that the declaration of the text can ever be falsified. Our nature and the circumstances in which that nature is developed and exercised make it impossible that it should be otherwise. Nations are but the aggregate of the individuals who compose them. What God requires of one in his individual capacity he demands of the whole in their associated character. He requires each accountable being to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before God, to look for honor in honoring him, and for prosperity in seeking his blessing. Hemakes the same requisitions of nations, and in case of disobedience is sure to visit with punishment. The law which governs nations is as inevitable as the law of gravity. This is written in the plainest language all over the history of the world. As nations have no existence as such in another world their retributions must be meted out and suffered in this. The wisdom, the justice and the perfection of God's government are strikingly illustrated in the fact that the great fundamental laws of our humanity and of our social being execute their own penalty when violated, vindicate themselves as certainly as any law of the physical universe. Their constant, because their natural tendency, is to punish wrong and reward the right. Up to a certain point we may appear to escape, in some instances, the results of our wrongdoing, but the appearance is always a delusion. Sin against God or man is always the seed of sorrow. The harvest may, in a measure, be gathered at the very time of sowing, or an interval may be allowed, to enable it to mature its results, and present them at once, with awfully accumulated force, and in the most crushing and destructive form. As in the individual human system, so in the great body politic, vices cut its sinews --injustice and impiety dig its grave. Under the just and inevitable operation of these great laws of our nature and of God, we find ourselves to-day involved in commercial disorder and treasonable guilt, excited and inflamed by plans and movements for civil revolt, threatened with fratricidal war, and in one portion of the country panic-struck and appalled by fears of a servile insurrection, whose horrors no imagination could conceive. We look upon all this to-day and see in it all the fulfillment of God's word and truth: ""The nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""REV.

"Rev. Dr. RAPHALL delivered a discourse in the Synagogue, in Greene-street, yesterday. His text was the 5th and 6th verses of the 3d Chapter of Jonah. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/05/archives/rev-dr-raphalls-discourse-his-opinion-of-slavery-and-of-rev-henry.html,,"Rev. Dr. RAPHALL delivered a discourse in the Synagogue, in Greene-street, yesterday. His text was the 5th and 6th verses of the 3d Chapter of Jonah. He commenced by saying: We meet here this day under circumstances not unlike those described in my text. Not many weeks ago, on the invitation of the Governor of this State, we joined in thanksgiving for the manifold mercies the Lord had vouchsafed to bestow upon us during the past year. But ""coming events cast their shadows before,"" and our thanks were tinctured by the foreboding of danger impending over our country. The evil we then dreaded has now come home to us. As the cry of the prophet, ""Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,"" alarmed that people, so the proclamation, ""the Union is dissolved,"" has startled the inhabitants of the United States. The President -- the chief Officer, placed at the helm to guide the vessel of the Commonwealth on its course -- stands aghast at the signs of the times. He sees the black clouds gathering overhead, he hears the fierce howl of the tornado, and the hoarse roar of the breakers all around him. An aged man, his great experience has taught him that ""man's extremity is God's opportunity;"" and conscious of his own inability to weather the storm without help from on high, he calls upon every individual ""to feel a personal responsibility towards God,"" even as the King of Nineveh desired all persons ""to cry unto God with all their strength"" -- and it is in compliance with this call of the Chief Magistrate of these United States that we, like the many millions of our fellow-citizens, devote this day to public prayer and humiliation. The President, more polished though less plain spoken than the King of Nineveh, does not in direct terms require every one to turn from his ""evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands."" But to me these two expressions seem in a most signal manner to describe our difficulty, and to apply to the actual condition of things both North and South. The ""violence in their hands"" is the great reproach we must address to the sturdy fire-eater who in the hearing of an indignant world proclaims ""Cotton is King."" King indeed, and a most righteous and merciful one, no doubt, in his own conceit; since he only tars and feathers the wretches who fall in his power, and whom he suspects of not being sufficiently loyal and obedient to his sovereignty. And the ""evil of his ways"" is the reproach we must address to the sleek rhetorician who in the hearing of a God-fearing world declares ""Thought is King."" King indeed, and a most mighty and magnanimous one, no doubt, in his own conceit; all-powerful to foment and augment the strife, though powerless to allay. Of all the fallacies coined in the North, the arrogant assertion that ""Thought is King"" is the very last with which, at this present crisis, the patience of a reflecting people should have been abused. For, in fact, the material greatness of the United States seems to have completely outgrown the grasp of our most gifted minds: so that urgent as is our need, pressing as is the occasion, no man or set of men have yet come forward capable of rising above the narrow horizon of sectional influences and prejudices, and with views enlightened, just and beneficent to embrace the entirety of the Union and to secure its prosperity and preservation. No, my friends, ""Cotton"" is not King, and ""Human thought"" is not King. Adonai Melok. The Lord alone is King! Umalkootho bakol mashala, and His royalty reigneth over all. This very day of humiliation and of prayer, -- what is it but the recognition of His supremacy, the confession of His power and of our own weakness, the supplication which our distress addressee to His mercy?

Everywhere the day was spent quietly and soberly; and the churches in which services were held were more than usually well filled. Several of the religious denominations united their congregations, and met for prayer in one church. The reformed Dutch Churches assembled at the church in Lafayette-place, at noon, where prayers were offered up by Rev. Drs. DEWITT, HUTTON, HARDENBERGH, BETHUNE and Chancellor FERRIS. In the evening, Dr. BETHUNE preached in his own church, in Twenty-first-street, from the 14th chapter of Jeremiah, contrasting the troubles of the Israelites, at that period, with the dangers with which, as a nation, we were now threatened. In the City of Brooklyn there was also a large Union Prayer Meeting, at the First Presbyterian Church in Henry-street, at which Rev. Drs. STORRS, COX, EELS, ROBINSON and others, made short addresses. In Jersey City the places of business were mostly closed, and many prayer-meetings were held which were well attended.

--The recent news from Peking proves conclusively how incontestible is the Chinese claim to being considered barbarians. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/05/archives/chinese-barbarities.html,,"-- The recent news from Peking proves conclusively how incontestible is the Chinese claim to being considered barbarians. The treatment they bestowed upon the English prisoners was at once childish and brutal -- pulling their hair and whiskers, rubbing their heads in the dust before the feet of petty mandarins, forcing them to their knees, and subjecting them to kindred indignities. They evidently supposed they were establishing their own superiority when they forced the faces of their prisoners to the ground. They imagined that by literally making the unfortunate men bite the dust, they were humbling the power of England. This puerile mode of manifesting, their rage was, however, aggravated by absolute cruelties. The unlucky Messrs. PARKES and LOCH were not only thus insulted, but were tied with thongs so contrived as to cause them acute agony, were thrown into a cart, and then drawn rapidly for many miles over a rough road, while every jolt of the vehicle increased their sufferings. Meanwhile, the Celestial savages amused themselves by seizing their arms and legs, and pulling them, to see if it would hurt them. They were subsequently loaded with heavy chains, their ears were cuffed, they were thrust into a prison along with the commonest and vilest of even Chinese malefactors, and only brought out occasionally, to be subjected to new and more exquisite cruelties and ignominies.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHINESE BARBARITIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CHINESE BARBARITIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-01-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f909e896-1ef3-5200-860e-7d7fbfe8438e,419,nyt://article/f909e896-1ef3-5200-860e-7d7fbfe8438e

His shameful prostitution of the public patronage of the Old Dominion, while he was its Governor, to subserve the private interests of his brother-in-law, General LEWIS, has not yet be a forgotten; nor his complicity in the frauds of certain New England and Virginian backs; nor his infamous collusion with Mr. RAND in the affair of erecting a monument to GEORGE WASHINGTON in the Capitol square of Richmond; nor the secret motives which made him so anxious that Mr. RAND should leave the State Capital with no pecuniary cause of complaint against the generosity of the Chief Magistrate of Virginia. All these things still live, and are matters of daily reference in the respectable circles of the Old Dominion -- a commonwealth so ancient and proud of her honor, not soon being able to forget the first Governor who indulged an ostentatious immorality, and whose official robes were sullied by only too many proofs of collusion with jobbery and organized default.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Floyd in Flight.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Floyd in Flight.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6eb55825-473f-5ebb-bc46-78e6283c54ca,1219,nyt://article/6eb55825-473f-5ebb-bc46-78e6283c54ca

His experience' consisted in the fact that he had hazarded his cash on certain games known as faro and roulette, which games the gentleman in question nightly induced himself and other unsophisticated persons to participate in, to the destruction of their morality and peace. Having thus become ""played out"" himself, he wanted those who had brought him to his present undesirable condition to be placed in the same category. The Magistrate, upon the strength of Deyo's representations, issued warrants for the arrest of Keese, George W. Brown, his dealer, McCann and Williams, and the Police of the Fifth and Fourteenth Wards respectively executed them. The visitors at Keese's place, to the number of eleven, were apprehended about 8 o'clock on Monday evening, and several hours later eight of the patrons of the other establishment were also placed in durance. Yesterday all the prisoners were arraigned before Justice KELLY, at the Tombs, and examined upon the charge. The hearing resulted, apparently, to the great gratification of a large audience of sporting men, in the discharge of all the accused, excepting the proprietors of the houses, on the ground that they had only been spectators of and not participants in the games.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/09/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- The management of this establishment supplied its patrons, on Monday night, with a capital evening's fun, and this, too, without the slightest expenditure of novelty -- for the burlesque of ""Mazeppa,"" although new here, scarcely comes under that head. Mr. JOE JEFFERSON was the spirit of the occasion, appearing in no fewer than three pieces. The first of these was the respectable, but not at all dull, comedietta, called ""Lend Me Five Shillings,"" in which' the comedian's quick style of humor was seen to great advantage. The house was kept in a constant roar of merriment. Then came the burlesque of ""Mazeppa,"" and lastly the screaming farce called the ""Spitfire."" It is only necessary to add a few words to this enumeration of good things. The burlesque has been freely altered from the London edition, and adapted to this locality by the usual references to Jersey and lager-beer. Quickened with this infusion of American wit, it is now, we suppose, a better work than it ever was before, and certainly sufficiently amusing to merit a long career. The puns with which the dialogue is studded are frequently admirable, and perplex the ear of the intellect to a degree which renders laughter or madness inevitable. The action, -- well it is not necessary to analyze the action, -- it is sufficient that it moves on the most improved style of rocking-horse. We have seldom seen a piece played with greater spirit. Mr. JEFFERSON was truly excellent, and danced his minuet and performed his daring act in the ring to perfection. The latter, by the way, is a new revelation, and a vast improvement on the old wicker-horse arrangement. It was so good, indeed, that the audience without any regard to the effort required in making it so, persisted in encoring it, or rather bringing the appl use to such a point that Mr. JEFFERSON had to beg to be excused from the overtaxing honor. Mrs. CHANFRAU supported Mr. JEFFERSON with great spirit, and achieved in consequence a decided success. Mr. J.H. STODDARD was very good in the burlesque, and also in the comedietta. Some of the minor parts were but indifferently studied; notably in in the case of Mr. DAVIDGE; otherwise they were well distributed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/459dbae9-0613-553b-bc01-5f0193f81359,450,nyt://article/459dbae9-0613-553b-bc01-5f0193f81359

Beneath the portrait was suspended a framed copy of the ""Declaration of Independence,"" while on either side, were the names of JEFFERSON, MADISON, MONROE, and WRIGHT. Around the Hall, at regular intervals, were hung the arms of the original thirteen States, with two oil portraits of WASHINGTON, and one each of POLK, CLAY and LAFAYETTE.

"THE ACCIDENT AT SPEYERS' BREWERY -- A VERDICT OF CENSURE. -- Coroner SCHIRMER on Monday commenced an inquest upon the body of JACOB MUSLER, a mason, who was killed on Saturday at Speyers' Lion Brewery in One Hundred and Ninth-street, near Ninth-avenue. MARTIN VOGEL testified that he was at work in the Brewery, which is unfinished, and that about noon on Saturday the masons went to the malt floor, on the second story, to eat their dinner. A few minutes afterwards the foreman called to them from below to ""come away."" Deceased descended by one of the ladders and witness followed. When witness had got about half way down he heard a crashing noise, the grain from above poured upon him and the ladder was broken by a falling beam. A plank fell on witness, who was knocked down and nearly suffocated by the grain, but Mr. SPEYERS and the workmen rescued him. Deceased was found soon afterwards at the foot of the ladder suffocated and covered by grain to the depth of ten feet. Mr. SPEYERS testified that his Brewery was in process of construction, and that Mr. LOUIS BURGER, the architect, had full power to do everything to insure its stability and safety. Coroner SCHIRMER and the Jury examined the premises, which demonstrated that the immediate cause of the accident was the falling of a partition wall, which formed part of the old building. A number of iron pillars which rested on this wall, as supports to the floor above, were found to have been forced into the brick-work by the weight of the grain. Dr. BOUTON made an examination of the body of deceased, and finding no marks of violence, gave an opinion that death had resulted from suffocation. The Coroner, having been unable to secure the attendance of certain witnesses, adjourned the investigation until yesterday afternoon. At that time the case was again opened, and a large quantity of testimony was given with reference to the construction of the building. The jury, after due deliberation, returned the following verdict: ""We find that deceased came to his death from suffocation, by having been covered with barley, in the malt-house of Speyers' Lion Brewery, Jan. 5, 1861, in consequence of the falling of the malt floor, occasioned by the use of a defective wall in the rebuilding of said brewery.

"The Message of Gov. LETCHER, of Virginia, has been briefly sketched by telegraph. After a few introductory remarks by way of impressing upon the legislators the importance of their responsibilities in the present crisis, he addresses him elf to the discussion of our Federal Relations. The country, he says, is torn by dissension; -- the vile spirit of faction shows itself on all sides. Confidence is destroyed; the ties of brotherhood have been severed, and though living under the same Constitution the sections seem to be as hostile, each to the other, as if their citizens belonged to unfriendly Governments. Under such circumstances it is hardly possible for a Government to live; but it is useless to look at the past, for in the present, if it is improved, the ties of affection may be recruited, and the fires of patriotism rekindled, and if this is done a bright and glorious future is still before us. Gov. LETCHER then alludes to our progress as a nation. From an original area of 549,615 square miles our country has expanded until it covers 1,602,000, exclusive of the Mesilla Valley, embracing 78,000, and the Indian Territory, embracing 187,000 square miles. Our power, influence, agricultural and manufacturing wealth have increased beyond all expectation. No people was ever blessed as we have been, and if the judgments of men were consulted the Union would yet be saved from overthrow. Yet all see and feel that the danger is imminent, and if the country is saved at all it must be by wisdom, prudence, and patriotism, aided by Divine Providence.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/10/archives/virginia-and-secession-message-of-gov-letcher-of-virginia.html,,"The Message of Gov.

Under such circumstances it is hardly possible for a Government to live; but it is useless to look at the past, for in the present, if it is improved, the ties of affection may be recruited, and the fires of patriotism rekindled, and if this is done a bright and glorious future is still before us. Gov. LETCHER then alludes to our progress as a nation. From an original area of 549,615 square miles our country has expanded until it covers 1,602,000, exclusive of the Mesilla Valley, embracing 78,000, and the Indian Territory, embracing 187,000 square miles. Our power, influence, agricultural and manufacturing wealth have increased beyond all expectation. No people was ever blessed as we have been, and if the judgments of men were consulted the Union would yet be saved from overthrow. Yet all see and feel that the danger is imminent, and if the country is saved at all it must be by wisdom, prudence, and patriotism, aided by Divine Providence.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VIRGINIA AND SECESSION.; Message of Gov.

"Yesterday morning Inspector Carpenter was called upon at Police Head-quarters by the senior member of a firm of prominent shipping merchants engaged in the Southern trade, who desired to make a complaint against Mrs. Barker, one of the guests at the St. Nicholas Hotel. The gentleman stated that the fair one on Sunday last called at his residence and presented a letter of introduction to his wife which purported to have been written by a very intimate personal and mercantile friend of his at Savannah, Ga. The epistle set forth the merits of the lady, who had come North on a visit, representing her to be possessed of all womanly virtues, worthy of their highest regard, and an ornament to the best society. As soon as the gentleman was apprised of the fact he told his wife that no expense should be spared to make the fair Southerner's sojourn in the City agreeable. The next day he personally paid his respects to Mrs. Barker at the hotel, and found that her appearance and manner fully verified all that had been stated in the letter of introduction. After an agreeable interview he went to his place of business, and not many hours passed before he there received a note from the lady, requesting the loan of sixty dollars until such time as she should receive a remittance from home, as unfortunately her pocket had been picked of $200. The cautious merchant, before loaning his cash, deemed it the part of prudence to telegraph to his friend in Savannah to ascertain if the lady was ""all right,"" The answer astonished him. It set forth that she was an impostor, who had just fled from Savannah, after coming the confidence game over a gentleman there to the tune of $500. The merchant went home, and examined, for the first time, the letter of introduction, which he found bore no resemblance to the handwriting of his friend, from whom it purported to have come. He therefore laid the facts, at the earliest moment, before the authorities. Detective King was sent to take the fair deceiver into custody, and he soon brought her to headquarters.

"Our advices from Charleston are of the most startling character, and indicate most unequivocally the intention of the authorities of South Carolina to precipitate a collision with the Federal Government. The steamship Star of the West, which recently left this port with reinforcements for Major ANDERSON, arrived off Charleston Harbor yesterday morning, and, on endeavoring to enter, was fired upon by the South Carolinians on Morris Island, and also from Fort Moultrie. Some twelve or fifteen cannon shots were fired at her -- with what effect is not known -- when she again put to sea. Subsequently, Lieut. HALL, of Fort Sumter, visited Charleston with a flag of truce, and had an interview with Gov. PICKENS and his Council, which lasted some two hours. The nature of his communication is not known, but it was intimated that it was of the most threatening character. The course to be pursued by the commander of the troops on board the Star of the West, is, of course, now a matter of conjecture, but he will probably keep the steamer off the harbor, out of harm's way, until he receives instructions. Meantime a telegram from Norfolk informs us that the Brooklyn, which has been in readiness for several days, put to sea last evening with sealed orders, and the supposition is that she has also gone to Charleston. What course will be pursued when she arrives there, remains to be seen.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/10/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Our advices from Charleston are of the most startling character, and indicate most unequivocally the intention of the authorities of South Carolina to precipitate a collision with the Federal Government.

Intelligence yesterday reached there that the sloop-of-war Brooklyn was on the way to aid the Star of the West to enter the harbor and land the troops at Fort Sumter. This caused the greatest commotion, and steps were immediately taken to resist her approach. The determination was to fire upon her, when it was understood that Fort Sumter would take part in the proceedings, and the expectation entertained in Charleston was that a general action would be fought. Our telegram from Charleston states that the steamship Marion has been purchased for the use of the State of South Carolina; but a dispatch to SPOFFORD, TILESTON & Co., of this City, states that she was seized, with no intimation of any design to pay for her.

It will be remembered that in May, 1860, Mayor Wood appointed to the office of Chamberlain of the City Mr. Nathan C. Platt. During the recent absence of the Mayor, from the City, the President of the Board of Aldermen, acting as Mayor, removed him with the concurrence of the Board and appointed in his place Mr. Daniel Devlin. On the 6th of January, 1861. Mr. Devlin obtained an order to show cause requiring Mr. Platt to deliver up all books and papers appertaining to the office, which order was made returnable on the 10th. At the opening of the motion Mr. Whiting, as one of the counsel for Mr. Platt, served upon the Judge a writ of certiorari, which he had just obtained from Judge Barnard, removing the hearing of the cause to the Chambers of the Supreme Court. On the service of the order the Judge remarked that he knew of no authority vested in a Judge of the Supreme Court to issue such a writ to him, and unless sufficient authority was shown he should not regard it, but proceed in the cause. Mr. Whiting, appealing for Mr. Platt, argued that the writ of certiorari was good and valid, and authorized by law, and operated as a stay of proceedings. He also took objection to the order which had been served on Mr. Platt, on the ground that it did not show upon its race that facts sufficient had been stated to counter jurisdiction; that no affidavit had been served with it, and they were left entirely ignorant of the facts on which the order had been granted, and had nothing to show cause against. The counsel then asked for time to answer the complaint, saying that he had relied upon the writ of certiorari, but seeing the disposition of the Judge to disregard it, they should have time to answer.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Chamberlain Controversy The Functions of Writs of Certiorari The Powers of Acting Mayors.; COMMON PLEAS CHAMBERS.

They cover the period ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/12/archives/milmans-history-of-latin-christianity-in-eight-volumes-sheldon-co.html,,"The second and third volumes of this great historical epic, embrace a series of events of almost unsurpassed interest. They cover the period extending from the close of the sixth to the close of the eleventh century, a period which witnessed some of the chief internal and outward revolutions in the history of the Papacy -- a period which commenced with the Pontificate of GREGORY the Great, (I.,) under whom the Roman See began to exercise a virtual temporal sovereignty, and including that of the Great GREGORY, (VII.,) or HILDEBRAND, under whom it consolidated its spiritual power. The several scenes, as they pass before us, are such of absorbing interest. The rise and spread of Western monasticism, with the life of the founder of that Benedictine order to whose learned labors both sacred and secular literature is so largely indebted -- the rise of that gigantic system of fanaticism and imposture which, bursting forth from the Arabian deserts, carried the religion of ISLAM from the banks of the Euphrates to the banks of the Guadalquiver, wresting some of the fairest portions of the earth from the dominion of Christianity -- the reconversion of Britain to the faith which had been trampled out by the idolatrous hordes of Saxon invaders -- the iconoclastic contests which issued in the final sundering of the Western Church from its connection with the Eastern Empire -- the splendid reign of CHARLEMAGNE -- the humiliation of the Papacy and its subjugation to the Princes of Germany -- and finally, the accession of HILDEBRAND,and the energetic acts by which he broke the yoke of German power, reformed the abuses of the Church, and asserted and made good its supremacy over the mightiest secular Potentates. These are some of the topics which in these volumes are treated with a fullness of knowledge and a breadth, though not always accuracy or elegance of style, characteristic of their eminent author. At the present day, when the foundations of the Papacy seem to be giving way; when questions of vital interest are clustering about the destiny of the See of Rome, the history of its varying fortunes in the past, of the successive steps by which it built up the colossal structure of its power -- a survey of the principles on which its wide and enduring sway has rested, must, to every thoughtful mind, be invested with tenfold interest. We commend, therefore, with emphasis to the reading public, this elegant edition of one of the great historical works of our times -- a work which unites English soundness of judgment with continental depth of research and fullness of learning, and which under the guidance of a Christian scholar, conducts us through both the political and moral history of Mediaeval Europe.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""MILMAN'S HISTORY OF LATIN CHRISTIANITY.

"Amid the various political, commercial and social topics which engross our attention at this time, it behooves us not to forget the claims of the poor. Winter, with its home ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/12/archives/the-duty-of-providing-for-the-poor.html,,"Amid the various political, commercial and social topics which engross our attention at this time, it behooves us not to forget the claims of the poor. Winter, with its home comforts, its gayeties, its holidays, has ever its shadow creeping stealthily beside it, the gaunt, pinched form of Poverty. And again arises the ever-recurring question, ""What shall we do for the poor?"" We cannot give indiscriminately to every case that applies to us, else we may be supporting the vicious at the expense of the deserving; we may be adding to the miser's hoard, instead of placing food in the poor man's mouth. These are important considerations to those who give, as well as to those who receive. For the indigent of our great cities consist of two classes -- those who cannot, and those who will not labor. For the former class -- those who from sickness or accident are rendered unable to help themselves, and those who by providential causes are rendered so destitute that their labor is insufficient to maintain them, it is a pleasure as well as a privilege to provide.

We have not the slightest disposition to interfere with any intellectual pursuits in which these gentlemen find recreation and delight at this period of civil commotion; but we should like to know what special public service they expect to render the country, by stimulating and sustaining this line of argument. Do they deem this a proper time to undertake the conversion of the great mass of our community to this extreme doctrine on the subject of Slavery? They can scarcely be ignorant of the fact that the pressure of this ultra position by the South has contributed very largely to that extreme exasperation of the public mind, which is now working out its legitimate fruits.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OF DOUBTFUL UTILITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OF DOUBTFUL UTILITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1df347ad-6a50-5d97-a533-bf39482d0f84,297,nyt://article/1df347ad-6a50-5d97-a533-bf39482d0f84

LOFTUS made affidavit to the effect, that on the evening in question, he was standing at the place designated, conversing with CATHARINE CARE, a young woman of his acquaintance, when he accidently came in contact with a man named MICHAEL JOSTEN who was passing by. JOSTEN immediately turned upon him and without listening to an apology stabbed him in the left arm. A Fifth-ward policeman, who had by this time reached the scene of the affray, at once arrested JOSTEN, who was locked up to await the result of the deponent's injuries. The woman CARR was also apprehended and detained as a witness of the affray. On Saturday morning LOFTUS died, and yesterday Coroner SCHIRMER held an inquest upon the body, at which evidence was elicited putting a different complexion upon the case. CATHARINE CARE deposed that about 10 o'clock on New-Year's Eve she was standing with MICHAEL JOSTEN at the corner of Worth-street and Broadway, when the deceased, ROGER LOFTUS, came staggering up along. He jostled against JOSTEN in a violent manner and the latter turned and grappled with him. In the struggle both slipped and fell, and LOFTUS having recovered his feet attempted to kick his antagonist Witness then took a penknife from her pocket and stabbed LOFTERS in the left arm. She had no intention of doing him a serious injury, but merely desired to keep him from kicking JOSTEN. Very soon Policeman came up and arrested all of them. The Jury upon this testimony rendered a verdict as follows: ""That deceased died from exhaustion, produced by a stab-wound at the hands of CATHARINE CARE given while MICHAEL JOSTEN was engaged in a fracas with deceased."" Coroner SCHIRMER examined CATHARINE in the prescribed way, and in reply to his questions she said: ""I am a native of Ireland, 19 years of age, residing at No. 67 Sullivan-street. I inflicted the wound, and JOSTEN had no knife in his possession when the stabbing occurred."" She was committed to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury, and JOSTEN was sent to the House of Detention for witnesses.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2890f41c-7c68-5355-a0de-57a75ffc2da9,1156,nyt://article/2890f41c-7c68-5355-a0de-57a75ffc2da9

He presents only those which commend themselves to the general judgment of the whole country. He bases his appeal on the universal sentiments of national ambition, love of liberty, and pride of public character which pervade the whole people and make them loyal, if anything can, to the Constitution which has given them such free and such vigorous development.

Corner SCHIRMER, yesterday afternoon, opened an inquest and took the testimony of several witnesses, in whose company the deceased had been up to a late hour previous to the time when his lifeless body was discovered by the police, but their statements failed to fix suspicion upon any one. It was shown that deceased had been on a drinking bout, commencing at a late hour on Saturday night, and that he was in a semi-intoxicated condition when his acquaintances last saw him alive. He is represented to have been of a violent temper, and quarrelsome when under the influence of liquor. One of the witnesses testified that on Saturday night while intoxicated, deceased made a wanton assault upon himself and his (witness) brother, with whom he was on the best of terms, and the next day, when partially sober, he made a most abject apology for his misconduct. Edward Doyle, a young butcher, employed at Clinton Market, had been drinking with the murdered man on Sunday afternoon, and it was in his company that he was last seen. He is in custody as a witness and his testimony will be given to-day.

"As Detective Wilson was passing through Sullivan-street, about 12 o'clock, on Monday night, he observed two men dodging in an erea way, and suspecting that they were thieves, he stopped to watch their actions. One of them happened to see him, and picking up a club from the ground he approached in a threatening manner. Wilson warned the man to keep at a respectable distance or he would shoot him, but his words were disregarded, and fearing that he would get a severe beating, he drew his revolver and fired. The ball took effect, for the man uttered a cry of pain and ran off. Wilson immediately went to the Fifteenth Ward Station-house, near which the occurrence happened, and procured assistance, under the impression that the wounded man would be found lying upon the sidewalk.

During yesterday afternoon the brother of the wounded man called upon Justice DUSENBERRY, who is temporarily presiding in Justice CONOLLY's place at Jefferson Market Police Court, and prayed that a warrant might be issued for Wilson on a charge of felonious assault.

"The consequences which have immediately followed the election of a Republican President have probably taken the South as well the North by surprise. Loud threats of secession had been so habitually used that they were generally classed among the exaggerations of American party warfare. There was undoubtedly some affectation both in the sinister forebodings of the Democrats and in the obstinate incredulity of the Republicans; but it was only in South Carolina, and one or two adjacent States, that the disruption of the Union was seriously contemplated. The authors of the movement probably formed a small minority even in Charleston itself, but they have taken advantage of a moment when the Pro-Slavery orators had committed themselves too far to recede. South Carolina has practically thrown off the Federal authority, and the remaining Cotton States seem about to adopt a similar course. The older slaveholding communities are agitated by conflicting uncertainties, wishing at the same time to cling to the Union and to extort impossible concessions from the Northern States. The Republicans are evidently perplexed by their triumph, and their Democratic opponents see in the unexpected fulfillment of their own predictions the imminent ruin of their party, through the secession of their slaveholding allies. The election of Mr. Lincoln is in itself only an imaginary or symbolic grievance. The President has no initiative in Federal legislation, nor is it in his power to interfere with local rights of property. The ostensible points in dispute are the right of possessing slaves in the Territories, and the unconstitutional acts by which some Free States have rendered the Fugitive Slave law inoperative. Both questions lie within the competence of the Supreme Court, which has uniformly interpreted the Constitution in accordance with the pretensions of the slaveowners. The President has no means of influencing the decision except by the nomination of partisan Judges to vacancies which may occur on the Federal Bench, but the Southern States resent the discovery that a majority of the entire population is opposed to the extension of Slavery. A reconciliation seems hopeless if the the Unum is only to be preserved on the conditions suggested by Mr. Buchanan in his Presidential Message. The New-England States might, perhaps, repeal the laws which they have passed in defiance of the Constitution; but it is absurd to expect that the Republicans will turn their victory into a defeat by acknowledging the abstract right of property in slaves, or by legislating in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in favor of Slavery in the Territories. The prospect of the maintenance or restoration of the Union must de derived from more general considerations, which have hitherto been obscured by party passions. The States which meditate secession have as yet by no means realized the establishment of an inland frontier with strangers, and perhaps enemies, on the other side. The evils of which they complain can only be aggravated by the abdication of the hold over their confederates which they derive from the Constitution and from their alliance with the Democrats of the North. Separation will convert every Free State into a safe asylum for fugitive slaves, and, if a partition of the Territories is effected, the Southern Confederacy will only obtain the portion which must from situation and climate necessarily have fallen to its share. Mr. BUCHANAN was right in thinking, if not in saying, that it is impossible to coerce a seceding State, because American institutions involve no provision for the government of a conquered province. The pride of belonging to a great nation, the habit of union, and the convenience of unrestricted intercourse, will probably induce the Slave States to devise some attainable compromise, if only time is given to negotiation and reflection. The feelings, and perhaps the interests of England, are on the side of continued Union. The free commerce which might be opened at Charleston or New-Orleans would fail to produce cordial relations with a Confederacy which would be pledged to promote the indefinite extension of Slavery, even if it were not tempted to revive the Slave-trade.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/16/archives/an-english-view-of-secession.html,,"The consequences which have immediately followed the election of a Republican President have probably taken the South as well the North by surprise.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/16/archives/the-financial-crisis.html,,"At starting we find both Consols and the bank bullion at the lowest points of the last twelve months, and the rate of discount more than twice as high as on the 1st of January, 1860. These,however, are not material considerations. In the face of the decline in the bank bullion the remedy of a fresh advance in the rate of discount is simple, and the mercantile world have at length learnt that, so far from a full rate of interest being injurious to business, it operates, when resulting from natural circumstances, to the benefit of the legitimate trader, by bringing down all the unsound speculators who are playing with the means of other people. But there is apparently no reason to anticipate any prolonged increase of pressure in the money-market. Although rates may remain high for some time, there are three millions at the credit of our account in China, and two millions have been dispatched to America, which are likely to create a remarkable influence on our interchanges with that country during the next few months. There is scarcely a single point to which we have remittances to make for installments of loans, and in India it seems at last to have been discovered that there are limits within which it is expedient, for the preservation of credit, to confine the system of draining the London market. By this time a large part of the grain importations rendered requisite by our own deficiency must have been paid for, and, although the ability of the United States to continue sending us large quantities at prices considerably below those now prevalent is usually underrated, and will probably be found much greater than has yet been supposed, the movement is not, under any circumstances, likely to do more than prevent money from becoming particularly abundant. The Turkish loan having been a failure in London, no outgoing will take place in that respect, while, if the whole should be subscribed in France, a not insignificant part of the proceeds will find their way to this country in liquidation of balances due to us from Constantinople.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the same Article', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ae7e263-b18a-5373-997f-a9f1efebd61c,639,nyt://article/8ae7e263-b18a-5373-997f-a9f1efebd61c

It is sufficient to understand that the penalties of treason are the only legal securities against the overthrow of the Federal Government; and that a neglect to enforce them places the whole costly machinery of its administration in the hands of any body of daring conspirators whose knowledge of the impunity assured them may invite to acts of active hostility, to understand the absolute necessity of putting these laws in force, or of admitting our Federal system to be too weak and worthless to deserve preservation. The convictions of a vast majority of the American people are evidently founded upon this impression. It is, of all things, most desirable to avoid such conflict between local interests, and passions, and national obligations, as may bring the highest of political crimes into, existence; but the moment such conflict is clearly inevitable, equally inevitable is the stern duty of applying all constitutional and legal agencies to the cure of the popular distemper.

Upon filing their charter with the Comptroller, that officer, pursuant to the statute, appointed the defendant, John Raymond and Royal Chamberlain, as Commissioners, to examine the assets of the Company, and certify whether the capital named in the charter had been paid in good faith, and was the property of the Company in its own right. The Commissioners having made the requisite examination, certified, under oath, that the capital of the Company had been paid in good faith and was their property, and having made out the necessary papers, gave them to an officer of the Company, who dispatched a messenger with them to the Comptroller to obtain that officer's official certificate necessary to authorize the Company to commence their business. On the next day the Commissioners presented a bill to the Company for services rendered, amounting to $300. The Company objected to the bill as exorbitant, and declined to pay it, but on being told by the defendant that if the bill was not paid he should inform the Comptroller of the non-payment, the Company paid it under protest, and this action was brought to recover the same.

The women commenced hostilities in the forenoon, but without coming to a settlement they were separated by their friends. A few hours later the belligerent sisters resumed active demonstrations by knocking furiously at the door of Mrs. WESTON'S room. The husband of the latter opened the door to learn what might be the matter, when one of the women, it is said, struck him a blow on the head with a hatchet, which rendered him insensible. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, and placed under the care of the House Surgeon, Dr. PAYNE, who at first did not think that his injury was of a fatal character. Lately, however, his symptoms have become unfavorable, and on Tuesday he died. The women were arrested soon after the commission of the assault, and required to give bail to appear and answer. Coroner JACKMAN yesterday investigated the case and took testimony of a somewhat conflicting character. It was not positively shown that either of the accused inflicted the violence upon the deceased, though the inference that one of them did could not be stronger. Dr. PAYNE testified that he made a post-mortem examination of the body, finding a large abscess in the brain, quite remote from the wound, and in his opinion death was caused by the abscess, which was the result of the injuries. A verdict was given to the effect that the deceased died from violence at the hands of some unknown person, but the Coroner determined to hold Mrs. MCCARTY and Mrs. MCCLAIN in bonds of $500 each as witnesses.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/17/archives/police-reports-a-couple-of-artful-dodgers-committed-for.html,,"Mr. Henry Livingstone, a middle-aged man of respectable appearance, who plumes himself upon his lineage and family connections, was apprehended on Tuesday evening by Detectives Slowey and Sease, on a warrant charging him with having defrauded Messrs. Warnock Co., hatters and furriers, No. 519 Broadway, of two wolf-skin robes valued at $40. The fraud was perpetrated about a year ago, the prisoner having selected the property, and directed that it should be left at Mr. Treadwell's boarding house in Fifty-second-street. Accordingly the robes were dispatched there by an errand-boy, who delivered them to a member of Treadwell's family, by whom he was told that Livingstone was not at home, and he must call again for the money. The youth told his employer what had occurred, and the latter becoming impressed with the idea that they were to be the victims of a confidence game, determined to discover if their suspicions were well founded. A member of the firm, therefore, called at Treadwell's house and asked for the money, but was coolly informed that Livingstone did not live there, and that no package had been left for him. Messrs. Warnock consequently obtained a warrant for the swindler's arrest, but the officers were unable to find him until yesterday. In the interval, seven or eight complaints for transactions of a similar character have been lodged against him at the Police Courts, and among them is one from the proprietors of the drug-store at the Fifth-avenue Hotel, from whom he is said to have obtained $20 worth of medicines. The landlord of Gardner's Hotel, Park-place, also alleges to have lost the price of the prisoner's board and lodging for a few days. The officers yesterday searched the house in Fifty-second-street, and found the two robes which had been procured from Messrs. Warnock, in the possession of the man Treadwell, who was arrested as an accomplice with Livingstone in the theft. Both prisoners are detained at Head quarters pending a hearing before a Police Magistrate......Another adept in the practice of artful dodging was arrested in the Eighth Ward on Tuesday night. He is a young man named Gilbert Morris, of prepossessing manner, but whose distinguishing characteristic is a gift of gabbling. The complainants against the prisoner are numerous, and yesterday an army of them presented themselves before Justice QUACKENBUSH, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, to initiate proceedings against him. He operated mainly in silk goods, and his victims are sufferers generally to the extent of $40. There was nothing original in Morris' mode of swindling. His plan was the old one of calling at a store, selecting a piece of goods, and directing that it should be sent to his residence, where he would be in waiting to receive and pay for it. Having obtained the package from the messenger he would tell that individual to wait while he went up stairs for the money, instead of doing which, however, he would leave the premises by another door -- a corner building with a side entrance being necessary to make the dodge successful; The house No. 609 Broadway, corner of Houston street, was a favorite place of the prisoner's, and there, under the name of Sheffield and various other aliases, he had often played his game. Among the merchants who have received his attentions are Messrs. Uosdell, Pierson & Lake; Arnold, Constable & Co.; Jackson & Co.; Strang, Adriance & Co., and Joseph Balter, of Sixth-avenue, while still others are expected to make themselves known.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLICE REPORTS.; A COUPLE OF ARTFUL DODGERS.

"The store of Messrs. Fishers & Co., importers and dealers in lace goods, No. 69 Worth-street, was visited by burglars on the night of the 17th of November last, and robbed of laces valued in the aggregate at $4,000. The thieves forced an entrance to the premises through the scuttle on the roof, but they must have become frightened while conducting their operations and left in a hurry, from the fact that next morning a large quantity of goods were found packed in bundles ready for removal. A careful examination of the store afforded no clue by which the identity of the offenders could be established, and the Detective Police who took the case in hand foresaw that much difficulty would be experienced in tracing out the perpetrators of the burglary. Sergeant Dickson, with Officers Farley and Eustace, however, undertook the task, and after two months' time spent in investigation they have succeeded in accomplishing it. The officers commenced operations by diligently inquiring of persons in the neighborhood of the store whether any suspicious characters had been loitering about the premises on the night of the robbery. Finally they received information which led them to suppose that two well known burglars, named George Smith and John Campbell were the guilty men, as their personal appearance corresponded with a description of two fellows who had been lounging about a grocery near. Messrs. Fishers & Co.'s establishment. A few days afterwards the suspected individuals were traced to a boarding-house in Sullivan-street, where Campbell had lately engaged board. Upon inquiry of the landlady, it was ascertained that her newly-arrived guest had brought with him two apparently well-filled trunks, which were pointed out to the officers. The officers felt confident, therefore, that they were on the track of the thieves, but having no authority to open; the trunks, they determined to keep quiet until morning, when, after procuring a search-warrant they would return and make an examination. In the morning, however, when the officers went back to the boarding-house they learned that Campbell had been there and taken the trunks away. For a week or two the officers could obtain no information of Campbell or of the property, but notwithstanding the fact of their having been baffled they were not discouraged. An untiring search finally resulted in tracing Campbell to Albany, whither he had taken the laces for the purpose of disposing of them. Farley then learned that a man who has often been arrested for receiving stolen goods, had followed Campbell to that place, undoubtedly with the object of becoming the purchaser; consequently he also went up to the capital to watch the turn of events. Through some mischance, however, the receiver, to whom the detective is well known, happened to learn that the latter had come up to Albany, and, suspecting the cause of his visit, the bargain was not consummated. Subsequently, the goods were sent down to Yonkers, and the Police again lost sight of them for a time. A few days ago, however, the Officers regained their clue, and having traced the trunks to a house in Yonkers where they had remained two days, it was found that thence they had been removed to a respectable boarding-house in Bleecker-street. On Wednesday the officers went to the house in question, and were fortunate enough to recover the long-sought trunks. Upon breaking them open, it was found that they contained about $2,500 worth of laces, all of which have been since identified by Messrs. Fishers & Co. as belonging to them, the burglars having neglected to remove the trade-marks. It transpired also that the property had been brought there by Smith, one of the suspected men, who was subsequently arrested. Upon searching him, samples of the goods were found in his possession, and Justice KELLY yesterday committed him, pending an examination. Campbell, the alleged confederate of Smith, was apprehended a few days since, charged with assault and battery, and having been convicted at the Court of Special Sessions, is now serving a term of imprisonment at the Tombs.

"Ex-President TYLER presents his views of the crisis, in a long communication to the Richmond Whig. Assuming that the Constitution is only a compact, he claims that any State has a right to secede for cause. Were this not so, he says, ""the States would occupy the same position, and none other, to the Government of the United States that each county or town occupies to the Government of a State. The uprising of a county against the State would be unqualified rebellion, and all concerned in it would be guilty of high treason. * * No matter what the evil complained of, no redress is left but out-and-out rebellion, and each and all engaged in such rebellion have entered into it with halters around their necks, to be used, unless the rebellion proves successfully the consolidated Government at its will and pleasure."" The remedies which the Constitution provides for redressing wrongs are unavailable against an overwhelming sectional majority, and the Supreme Court, Mr. TYLER thinks, will have its character materially modified by Mr. LINCOLN. But the right to secede which is new resorted to after a long course of forbearance on the part of the South, should be regarded as a means of perpetuating rather than imperiling the existence of the Government, for if acknowledged it must operate to restrain the conduct of majorities and officials. Mr. TYLER then considers the consequences resulting to the seceding States from their exercise of this right. It would be better that a full adjustment of all the responsibilities to which each member of the political partnership is liable, should be made before the act of separation, but as this is not practicable, all that each State which secedes can do is to declare her readiness to assume her portion of the public debt, and her determination to have her share of the public domain and other property. The trade and commerce of each State are under its exclusive control, and revenues collected in its ports are subject to its own orders. In discussing the effect which this withdrawal of one or more States will have on the rest, Mr. TYLER is disposed to regard the Constitutional compact in the light of a mercantile partnership, and to argue that the States which do not secede are absolved from their obligations to one another, and that the best thing they can do is to set about the reconstruction of the Government. As well might North Carolina and Rhode Island have laid claim to the public property because they refused to abandon the ""Perpetual Confederation"" when it was merged into the present Union, as those who cling to this compact refuse to give those who repudiate it their share.

"government, because without the enforcement of the laws the Union could not continue. But that reme dy did not meet the existing state of things. They could not, under any provision of the Constitution, enforce the law against a seceding State. The law was applicable to individuals, and to enforce the law against the individual you must have judges and juries, and you must proceed against him, according to the Constitution, in the State where the crime was committed. It was clear, therefore, that they could not enforce the law against an individual in South Carolina, for no jury would bring in a verdict of guilty upon any indictment found at this juncture and under present circumstancesstances. It was true there was a general domain for the enforcement of the laws, but however true as an abstraction, however necessary at all tunes and imperative it might be on the Government to enforce them, it was impracticable and impossible, as welll as wholly unsuited to the occasion. The question then was, what was the duty of the Admnistration and of Congress? It was one of pacification and reconstruction; a duty which must undeubtedly to committed to the next Administration, and the country must therefore await an appeal to the people. But what, in the meantime, is to be done? As yet no practical remedy had been devised, and State after State was going out of the Union. All the votes taken in the different crisis committees tended to strengthen the indication that a remedy from these sources is cut of the question. The dominant party have shown an indisposition to make those concessions indispensable to a reunion. Their bounden duty, then, was to preserve the status quo, and to preserve the existing state of things as nearly as possible -- to avoid the employment of coercion. But to do this it was essentially necessary to their policy that a like purpose and spirit should animate their Southern friends It would not do for the South to protest against coercion, while at the same time they seized the arms, arsenals, fortresses, navy-yards and ships that come within their reach and power. To act thus was not and could never be peaceable secession-that would not be preserving the status quo. It was a declaration of war; and when sovereign States make war they could not cry peace, nor call for protection against coercion. The constitutional compact was a compact between equal sovereign States, and when, therefore, a sovereign State did an act, whether by law or treaty, or by grant on parchment, ceding unalterably apiece of territory, large or small, whether for the purpose of erecting on it a fortress, or fort, or Custom-house, or city, or town, that State could not recall that cession nor unmake the grant. That was cut of the question. Such a proposition was monstrous in law, in morals and politics, and was utterly untenable and indefensible. He hoped the South, therefore, would not force an issue of war in defence of this incontrovertible right, and in discharge of the imperative and paramount duty of occupying and keeping those fortified places provided for the common defence of the country. It was on this point alone the whole danger of collision was to be dreaded-on this only civil war can happen, and on this position the first battle may be fought. It cannot be said by the South that the seizure of the forts had been made for the purpose of protection. Remember, the course of events in South Carolina in her Convention, convened for the purpose of taking steps to secede, met with no interference from any quarter -- no interference from the Executive or from Congress. That Convention was held -- the ordinance of secession was passed, and they met with no interference with the act -- none whatever. No army or naval forces were sent for the purpose of coercion. But what had the Legislature of South Carolina done? They organized an army, and yet there was no interference with that hostile act from any quarter. The act of secession, from its inception to its consummation, was rendered as complete and perfect as human agency could make it, and not the slightest interference was asserted or attempted by the Executive or legislative departments. Through all these acts there was no show of coercion. The transfer of sixty men from one fort to another, however, simple as it was, gave rise to unfounded apprehensions, not only in one Stale, but throughout that whole section of the country. The mere transfer of a handful of men, not under instruction to menace or attack anybody, was assumed to be a warlike measure on the part of the Federal Government What next? An unarmed vessel approaches the harbor of Charleston, bearing dispatches and provisions and men to a place within the unquestionable jurisdiction of the Federal Government of the United States. From its masthead is displayed the American flag, and as she approaches and is within sight of a fortification of the General Government -- the o fficial character of the vessel being well known -- the authorities of South Carolina opened a fire from their guns upon her, defenceless as she was, and compelled her to return and abandon the legitimate and peaceful character of her mission. That was an act of war, of unqualified and flagrant war; and had such an act been done by another Government or authority, by any foreign Power whatever, it would have aroused theire of every man in the nation; and have elicited from every patriot heart a loud and earnest protest, and a demand for an immediate appeal to all the measures necessary to repel the insult and avenge the outrage. It was an act of war. But, eternal thanks to the moderation and noble magnanimity of gallant Major ANDERSON it was not so regarded by him. He remembered it was an act done by his fellow countrymen, by men excited and milled by the apprehension of force to be employed against themselves, and aroused to blind zeal by their own anomalous political condition. In retaliation of that net of war, Major ANDERSON might have laid Charleston in ashes, and civilization and history would have approved the act. He emphatically announced his conviction that no man, looking at the responsibility of Major ANDERSON, could honestly lay his hand upon his heart and condemn him for such a vindication of the honor and the lights of a flag which his sword and his life were pledged to maintain. But this was not done, and he thanked heaven for it. If is had been done is would have been impossible to reconstruct the Confederacy, which now seemed the only peaceful escape from their difficulties. In view of mere coercion, he would repeat that they could not recruit a regiment in New-York to march over the frontier to any State for the purpose of coercion against a people in the exercise of their legitimate and holy rights. Never -- never! But the men of New-York would march in untold thousands anywhere to protect the honored flag of the Union, and to defend and maintain its glory and renown in any event, or in any emergency where it was necessary to do so. He would call attention once more to the great and grave distinction between an issue where force is employed against a sovereign State to compel its abandonment of any political act within her legitimate jurisdiction, and an appeal to arms in defence of the indisputable right and jurisdiction of the United States, when that jurisdiction had been ceded by the act of the seceding State. Reference had yesterday been made (by Mr. GARNETT) to the probability of a hostile visit from the armies and navies of France and England for the purpose of interfering with our jurisdiction. This very probability showed it would be worse than madness to surrender the fortified places, which alone could enable them to assert and maintain that jurisdiction. Whatever might be the views of gentlemen as to a peaceable secession, however they might meet the exigencies of the times, they had yet their political position to maintain as a great commercial nation. The elements of that commercial greatness was in the North and West, and not in the South. They had absolute duties to perform for self-defence, and these ports and fortified places are indispensable to the protection of their position as a commercial and maritime nation, and as a means of self-defence against those very eventualities which accession roust necessarily bring with them. The possession of these fortified places became more important with secession an accomplished fact than when secession was never dreamed of. There was no possibility of foreign intervention without secession; with secession it was almost inevitable. On all these considerations it was their absolute duty to hold those places; nay more, it was madness on the part of those who sincerely deprecated war to seize and to attempt to hold them. Their statute books were full of precedents to justify their regaining possession of them. In 1811-12 Congress, by a large majority, into which Southern men entered, determined to take possession of the country west of the Mississippi and of Florida, and of the Territories adjoining, because their possession was essential to our political safety and to our territorial protection; and therefore all the statesmen of the South were committed to the recognition of the right of the Government to hold those fortified places, at all risks and under all circumstances. The history of this, as well as of all great countries, was full of precedents for this course of action, whatever may be the issue of events-whether happily by conciliation and justice to the South we may and an honorable and fraternal solution of our difficulties, or whether unhappily we blindly drift into alienation, war and irrevocable separation--the great commercial interests of this country require, the destiny of American civilization demands that the political and territorial control of this continent, from the mouth of the Hudson to the mouth of the Mississippi, from the Atlantic to the Pacific seas, shall remain where it now exists -- in the hands of the Government of the United States. In all the partisan issues between the South and the Republican Party the people of the City of New-York are with the South, but when the South makes an untenable issue with our country, when the flag of the Union is insulted, when the fortified places provided for the common defence are assaulted and seized, when the South abandons its Northern allies for English and French cooperation, then the loyal and patriotic population of that imperial City are a unit for the Union.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/18/archives/front-page-1-no-title-the-national-troubles.html,,"government, because without the enforcement of the laws the Union could not continue.

"There was a sound of revelry last night, and the Metropolis had gathered there its children, and the chandeliers shone bright o'er dawning women and incipient men. A gentleman of some literary repute a few years since opened a description of a ball with lines somewhat similar to the above, but the appreciative observer will mark the added beauties which present themselves in the present version. The occasion of the revelry was a soiree dansante given by Prof. FEBRERO, and the scene was in the Academy of Music. The Academy was not built for a ball-room, but it answers a very good purpose, and loses less money when put to this use than in the legitimate operatic line. The soiree dansante of last evening was a Prince's ball in miniature. The inevitable Policemen were in attendance; the carriages relied to the doors, debarked their fairy freight and departed; gossamer visions flitted past the guests whose tickets only entitled them to stand on the steps, and buried themselves from sight in the vestibules.

A gentleman of some literary repute a few years since opened a description of a ball with lines somewhat similar to the above, but the appreciative observer will mark the added beauties which present themselves in the present version. The occasion of the revelry was a soiree dansante given by Prof. FEBRERO, and the scene was in the Academy of Music. The Academy was not built for a ball-room, but it answers a very good purpose, and loses less money when put to this use than in the legitimate operatic line. The soiree dansante of last evening was a Prince's ball in miniature. The inevitable Policemen were in attendance; the carriages relied to the doors, debarked their fairy freight and departed; gossamer visions flitted past the guests whose tickets only entitled them to stand on the steps, and buried themselves from sight in the vestibules.

The parties were married at Hoboken on the 12th of July, 1860. The defendant is a lithographer and at the time specified in the pleadings was in the employ of Conrad Fatzer, of this City. The cause of their difficulty appears to be a yellow dog, the property of the defendant. The plaintiff testifies that she and her husband went out for a walk on the 12th of August, 1860, and on returning home found the dog on the bed. The plaintiff then told him that the housekeeper had said they must not keep a dog as it would be apt to frighten the children in the house. The defendant, as alleged, thereupon struck his wife twice on the nose and once on the cheek, which caused her to fall insensible on the floor. On the 20th of August, 1860, while they were alone together, he told her he would sirike her so that she could send him to the Tombs. Attempting to put his threat into execution, she opened the door of the room in which they were, when he dropped the stick of wood with which he had attempted to strike her. These two acts are alleged as the cause of action. The plaintiff having closed his testimony, the Court remarked that a general impression seemed to prevail that an action of this kind could be supported by but one or two acts of cruel treatment. It was but justice to the public generally to inform them that it could not. That the uniform character of decisions, both in England and in this country, have held that such an action must be sustained by repeated and continuous acts of cruelty. That the wife should not seek on slight provocation to dissolve that sacred tie which binds her to her husband for life, for better or worse. The Judge then remarked that the present case presenting no feature which would warrant him in granting a separation between the parties, the complaint was dismissed.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': '""Wives be Obedient unto Your Husbands"" Law of Limited Divorce.; SUPERIOR COURT SPECIAL TERM.

The mortality of the past year having been 22,710, shows an apparent increase in the mortality over 1859 of 1,005; but when the increase of the population for that period is taken into account, we have an actual decrease in our death list.

Under these circumstances we are disposed to anticipate a good season for the associated artists, especially as it is apparent that it will be conducted with energy. We trust for the sake of our most elegant and refined amusement that the public will lend its aid to the undertaking. A great deal depends on the success of the experiment; it will determine probably whether or not we are to have a vigorous Spring campaign.

"Within a week past, in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, two culprits have been convicted of the crime of arson, and sentenced to State Prison for life. While the successful issue of the public prosecutor's efforts to bring these criminals, of a most dangerous class, to justice, will increase the public feeling of security, by furnishing dreadful warning to those whose interests or inclination might tempt them to commit the offence, it illustrates, at the same time, the benefits which result to public justice from applying the ""division of labor"" principle to the duties which public officers have to discharge.

"A great deal of excitement was occasioned in the Twentieth Ward, on Saturday forenoon, by the rumor that a woman had been brutally murdered at a shoemaker's shop in the basement of 171 West Twenty-ninth-street. Officer IRVING was dispatched to investigatethe circumstances of the case, and he found the deceased -- an Irishwoman named MARY ANN LOVE - lying upon the floor, with marks of violence upon her face, and her fingers were mutilated as though they had been gnawed by rats. Two men, named SAMUEL LOVE, brother of the deceased, and PETER BRADLEY, one of his friends, were found in a drunken sleep in the room where the body lay, and suspicion at once pointed to them as being the murderers. Coroner JACKMAN was notified of the matter, and in the afternoon he held an inquest upon the body, conducting the proceedings at the Twentieth Ward Station-house. The testimony showed that BRADLEY and LOVE are shoemakers -- the former hiring the shop where the occurrence happened, and the latter having bench-room there, obtaining his work from down-town stores. The deceased, who was an unmarried woman, about 39 years of age, had been, until about tour weeks since, at service in the country, but having lost her place, she took up her residence with her brother, and both of them slept in a small, dirty room, partitioned off at the back part of the cobbler's shop. BRADLEY boarded elsewhere. On Friday the deceased and both of the men had been drinking freely, and their carousal was continued until a late hour, much to the annoyance of the neighbors. The shop not having been opened at a late hour on Saturday morning the neighbors suspected something wrong, and on searching the place they found the woman dead and the men in the condition above stated. It was also shown that the deceased and the prisoners had been quarreling while in their cups, and the face of each exhibited severe scratches which, doubtless, had been given during the fight. Dr. JOHN BEACH made a post mortem examination of the body, and was of opinion that the woman died from intemperance, as he could trace no connection between the marks of violence exhibited by the body, and the cause of death. The case was submitted to the jury, who returned the following verdict: ""That the deceased came to her death by intoxication, and that she had been killed by violence."" This paradoxical production the Coroner refused to accept,and six wise men were sent back to reconsider it. After a short time spent in deliberation, they reappeared with the following: ""That deceased came to her death by intemperance, hastened by violence at the hands of PETER BRADLEY."" The Coroner thereupon committed the accused to answer any action which may be taken against him by the Grand Jury. He stated in his examination that he was 20 years of age, and a native of Ireland. In reference to the charge, he said that he had no knowledge of having use I violence toward the deceased, but that he had saved her once or twice from being abused.

Our neighbor proposes the purchase of the slaves in Delaware and Maryland, together with those of the States west of the Mississippi, including Louisiana, by the Federal Government. It is supposed that these States now contain about 600,000 slaves, and that the owners would do well to sell them for $100,000,000. We think that our cotemporary underrates both the number of the slaves and the price the owners would be willing to take for them. But supposing these points adjusted, why select these particular States as the objects of Federal bounty? Does the Tribune contemplate the secession of the remaining States? Nothing could be more abhorrent to them than this policy of surrounding them with a cordon of emancipated slaves.

On board the receiving ship North Carolina the guns were placed in position and shotted for immediate use, and every officer was ordered to be on the alert. In the Wallabout, and near the Navy-yard, several boats made their appearance shortly after dark, filled with policemen. Simultaneously with these ominous preparations at the Navy-yard, the military of Brooklyn in strong force were observed to be gathering at the new armory and also at the new arsenal, and crowds of wondering citizens assembled, anxious to know the cause of the sudden military display. During the evening it became known that there were apprehensions of an attack upon the Navy-yard by an organized force, with the intention of holding it in the interest of those favoring the Southern Secessionists. Portions of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Twenty-eighth Regiments, of the Fifth Brigade, numbering over three hundred men, responded to the call of Major-Gen. DURYEA, and held themselves in readiness to cooperate with the forces at the Navy-yard for resisting the apprehended attack. The movement was made at the request of Mayor POWELL.They remained under arms until a late hour of the night, and were then dismissed for the present.

The history and statistics of this important staple are given in a brief but clear account, derived mainly from ELLISON's Handbook, the latest authority on the subject. It is, indeed, a wonderful history. No other product of human labor -- no other element in the commerce of the world -- has played so momentous a part. In less than a half century the manufacture of cotton has quadrupled the wealth and power of Great Britain. In the same short period its culture in the United States has changed the current of events and controlled our national politics. Among the causes which have conspired to bring our country to its present critical condition, cotton stands preeminent. The change which has taken place in Southern opinion and feeling as to the nature and tendencies of Slavery, and the entirely altered tone of Southern language on that theme, began with the rising prospects of cotton, and have kept pace with the progress of that great staple. Such a change very naturally awakened the jealousy and called forth the remonstrances of the North. The purposely irritating assaults of the Abolitionists, and even the milder comments of those who could not but condemn the institution, while they deprecated all interference with it, reacted on the Southern mind, and by a process perfectly natural, drove it still further in the wrong direction.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COTTON AND THE COTTON TRADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COTTON AND THE COTTON TRADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/48aa7874-0a5d-5798-9e71-5ac3347017e3,2314,nyt://article/48aa7874-0a5d-5798-9e71-5ac3347017e3

Upon the trial of this cause, there were several prepositions presented by defendants' councel to the Judge, upon which to charge the jury, all of which the Court refused to charge.

Among those who gave him their confidence was Mr. A.H. Little, an extensive dealer in silk goods, at No. 325 Marketstreet. Mr. Whiting expressed his desire to purchase a valuable estate belonging to Mr. Little, and negotiations were entered upon with that object in view. While these were pending, the old gentleman incidentally remarked that he had determined upon making his wife and daughter each a present of a gold watch and guard-chain, and would like Mr. Little to recommend him to a trustworthy jeweler. That gentleman complied without hesitation, particularly as he had a very worthy friend in that branch of trade, who kept an establishment in the upper purl of the same building where he (Mr. Little) conducted his own business. The name of the jeweler is Mr. Jas. Watson, and under the influence of a personal introduction from Mr. Little, he let Whiting have two gold watches and three chains, valued in the aggregate at $670, taking in payment a check drawn by the later upon the Girard Bank, Philadelphia. It was after banking hours when the transaction took plane, but early the next morning the check was sent to the bank for payment, when it transpired that there were no funds there credited to Whiting, nor had there been any. Mr. Little was informed of the matter, and, loth to believe that the venerable stranger had been doing wrong he went to his hotel for an explanation. But he could not find him, and, after searching several days, he reluctantly made up his mind that he was the dupe of an imposter. In his mortification, he determined to spare no pains to affect Whiting's apprehension, and came to New York to look for him. Arriving at Jersey City by the 10 1/2 o'clock train on Sunday night, he took the ferry boat, and was fortunate enough to final on board the very person for whom he searched. Officer Clark, of the Third Ward, was, therefore, notified, and took Whiting prisoner. He will be sent to Philadelphia for trial. Not the least fortunate part of the arrest was the fact that the watches and chains were all found in the prisoner's possession.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLICE REPORTS.; A GAY THOUGH VENERABLE DECEIVER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POLICE REPORTS.; A GAY THOUGH VENERABLE DECEIVER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e1da8d9-bb7e-5b66-b049-e302463484a5,845,nyt://article/7e1da8d9-bb7e-5b66-b049-e302463484a5

None of us are likely to be deluded by the empty compliment implied"" in a Southern cry for a return to monarchical government. In some of its ideas, particularly those on the subject of slavery, the English people are more advanced than the American; and it is no flattery to be told that a slaveholding community considers a monarchy likely to be more conservative of its institutions than a republic. Besides, every one among us who can observe, will vehemently doubt whether the Southern monarchy would have much that is constitutional about it. When a majority, consisting of men equal among themselves, gets into a violent fright about the supposed designs of a minority, we have European experience to show us to what sort of protection they are apt to fly. If the Southerners ever take a king to reign over them, it is not a constitutional monarchy but a military despotism which they will probably establish. Great as are the political aptitudes of the English race, it has always shown that its love of liberty was in some danger from its love of gain.

In some of its ideas, particularly those on the subject of slavery, the English people are more advanced than the American; and it is no flattery to be told that a slaveholding community considers a monarchy likely to be more conservative of its institutions than a republic. Besides, every one among us who can observe, will vehemently doubt whether the Southern monarchy would have much that is constitutional about it. When a majority, consisting of men equal among themselves, gets into a violent fright about the supposed designs of a minority, we have European experience to show us to what sort of protection they are apt to fly. If the Southerners ever take a king to reign over them, it is not a constitutional monarchy but a military despotism which they will probably establish. Great as are the political aptitudes of the English race, it has always shown that its love of liberty was in some danger from its love of gain. Cupidity has often made Englishmen and Americans tyrants -- who knows but that, if it be allowed to get the upper hand, it may yet make them slaves?",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ENGLISH VIEWS OF SECESSION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ENGLISH VIEWS OF SECESSION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Saturday Review, Jan. 5', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Jan', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31b44092-66f7-5561-84aa-2745113b0b88,444,nyt://article/31b44092-66f7-5561-84aa-2745113b0b88

"James F. Whiting, who was arrested on Sunday evening, on a charge of having defrauded a Philadelphia jeweler to the extent of $670, turns out to be an old acquaintance of the Police, noted for his expertness in swindling by means of various ""confidential"" devices. He was taken to Police Head-quarters, yesterday, for the purpose of having a photograph taken, and Detective Keefe recognized him as an escaped convict from Clinton Prison, who was sentenced in 1856 for a robbery committed at Saratoga Springs. Whiting, who there was known as A.M. Kingsland, had taken board with his family at Congress Hall, and during the time of his residence at that hotel, Gen. Robert Halsey, of Utica, who was also a guest of the establishment, lost $14,000 in cash under circumstances which left no doubt of the prisoner's guilt. He was arrested and tried for the offence, with a confederate named William Henderson, and having been proved guilty, each was sentenced to Clinton Prison for a term of nine years and six months. In April last, however, Whiting managed to obtain a suit of citizen's clothes, and, disguised as a visitor, he escaped from prison. Detective Keefe told the prisoner that the circumstances of his past life were pretty well know to the police, and after a while he admitted that he was the person whom he was taken for.

"The Mayor, &c., of New-York, vs. The Parker Vein Steamship Company et al. -- At a trial term of this Court, a judgment of $3,350 was rendered against the defendants, under the following circumstances: The defendants, it appears, run a line of steamers between this City and the City of Baltimore. On the 1st of May, 1854, the defendants leased of the plaintiffs the wharf known as No. 13 North River, for the use and occupation of vessels of more than five tons burden, which lease dated from that day, and was to continue in force to the 1st of May, 1855. By a separate lease dated the same as those before set forth, they further leased of the plaintiffs the Pier No. 12 North River, at the foot of Albany-street, at a stipulated rent. Each of these leases, it appears, contained a covenant that, if the rent was behind for the space of ten days after the dates on which payment was to be made, the Comptroller might cause a notice to be served on the defendants declaring the lease null and void, and that the service of such notice should be conclusive evidence that the defendants had failed to perform their agreement, and that the plaintiff should have the immediate right of reentry upon the said premises as if no such leases were in existance, and that the defendants should be liable for rent to that time. It appears that such notice was served on the 11th of September, 1854. Two of the defendants in this action, Jewett and Mali, thereupon made and executed to the defendant a bond under seal, conditioned for the payment of the rent. They having failed to comply with the condition of their bond, and the rent not being paid, this action was brought against the lessees as well as the obligers. The defendants admit the claim, but set up that after the defendants entered into possession of Pier No. 13 they made temporary erections and fixtures thereon, and that at the termination of the leases the plaintiffs prevented them from removing said fixtures, but converted them to their own use. The defendants therefore claim that the value of these fixtures should be allowed as a counter-claim. The Court below having held that this was not properly the subject of a counter-claim, an appeal was brought upon this ground alone. The principal point taken by the defendants in support of this position are: First, That the counter-claim set up is within subd, 1, sec. 150 of the Code, because it arises out of a contract on which the plaintiff sues; the right asserted by that contract, being involved in and implied by that contract. That the counterclaim arises out of the transaction set forth in the complaint, viz; the lease, the possesion, the incidental election of fixtures, the interference with the outgoing tenants, and the appropriation of their fixtures.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/23/archives/city-sues-to-recover-wharfage-improvements-on-the-piers-set-up-as-a.html,,"The Mayor, &c., of New-York, vs. The Parker Vein Steamship Company et al. -- At a trial term of this Court, a judgment of $3,350 was rendered against the defendants, under the following circumstances: The defendants, it appears, run a line of steamers between this City and the City of Baltimore.

"Yesterday morning a terrible encounter took place at Astley's Amphitheatre. An under-groom, named SMITH, was litterally throttled to death by one of the lions which play so prominent a part in the holiday entertainments at that favorite place of amusement. The lions, three in number, are confined in a cage at the back of the stage. When the night watchman left the theatre yesterday morning a few minutes before 7 he reported ""all right."" Shortly afterwards SMITH, the deceased, entered the place and found the lions prowling about. They had torn off a heavy iron bar which crossed the front of their cage, and then burst open the door. SMITH was alone, and, not being familiar with the animals, he attempted to escape into an adjoining stable yard. His situation was a frightful one, and most men would have acted precisely as he did under the circumstances; but the probability is that if he had stood his ground boldly his life would have been saved, unfortunately, one of the lions -- that which is known by the name of Havelock -- caught sight of his retreating figure and instantly sprang upon him. It seized him by the haunches, pulled him to the ground, and then fixed its teeth in his throat. Death must have been almost instantaneous; but, as SMITH was found a good deal cut and bruised at the back of the head, it is supposed that the lion, after bury big its fangs in his throat, dragged him about and dashed his head against the ground. It seems, in fact, to have worried him, though the wounds inflicted by the brute are neither so numerous nor so severe as might have been expected. There were no cries for help, but a sort of shuffling noise was heard by a man in the stable yard. He suspected what had occurred, and did not venture to open the door through which SMITH had endeavored to escape; but he gave the alarm, and in a few minutes was joined by several grooms and others Connected with the theatre. They were all, however, too much afraid to enter the place, and nothing was done to ascertain the fate of SMITH until the arrival of CROCKETT, the lion conqueror, to whom the animals belong. As soon as he reached the spot he passed through the door alone, none of the others daring to follow. The body of SMITH was lying upwards a few feet from the door, and Havelock was crouching over it as a hungry dog hangs over a piece of meat. CROCKETT immediately threw the animal off, and dragged the body into the yard; It was still warm, but life had been extinct for some time. A surgeon was sent for, but of course he could render no assistance. CROCKETT lost no time in securing the lions. They allowed him to capture them easily enough. Even Havelock did not offer any resistance, and the other two, which had taken no part in the terrible scene with SMITH, seemed rather afraid than otherwise. In a few minutes all three were back in their cage again, and last night they went through their usual performances before a crowded audience. SMITH was unmarried.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Miss ISABELLA HINKLEY may congratulate herself on having achieved one of the most successful debuts ever won in this City. For one may safely say that in the large audience assembled last evening there was not one who failed to recognize in her initial effort all the prominent indications of a great fuure. Miss HINKLEY, of whom we have already distantly spoken in these columns, reechoing the applause that greeted her in Brussels, is a native of Albany; she has studied in Europe; appeared there successfully, and now returns to the land of her birth to reap the rewards of industry and triumph. Her voice is a soprano of the best class, unusually full, large and dramatic, for the kind called legere, and especially brilliant and exquisite in the upper register. Her manner of producing tone is defective, leading frequently to a peculiar style of mouthing, which is known as churchey, and which in a small room is effective, but in a large theatre intolerable. It is, however, a minor defect in comparison with her positive merits. And foremost amongst the latter we would direct attention to the really remarkable clearness with which all her passages are conceived and executed. A scale is of course a scale, whoever may sing it. Your mechanic will run through it like a column of figures, but your true artist presents it as a chain of pearls, each link giving to its fellow a borrowed light. It is not our purpose to overrate Miss HINKLEY in this comparison, but simply to hint that she possesses the true art temperament; -- the sensitiveness which instinctively rejects every thing mechanical, and soars effectively or otherwise on its own pinions. This, be it remembered, is the rarest of all gifts, and covers a greater multitude of musical sins than can be laid to the charge of the present debutante. In the agreeable but slightly hackneyed role of Lucia, Miss HINKLEY has a fair scope for the exercise of her powers, and especially for the display of certain niceties of execution in which she is perfect. But whilst cheerfully awarding her a very emphatic success, and hailing her as the best gifted of the many American debutantes we have had of late, we are sure that we shall yet see her to greater advantage. Her physique and her voice alike point to a higher range of feeling than that elicited by the lovelorn heroine of DONIZETTI'S work. The applause last evening was vehement.

"THE ALLEGED MURDER ON THE SHIP PAMPERO. -- The report given by us yesterday, in relation to the alleged murder of a sailor on board the ship Pampero, while coming out of port from San Francisco, appears to have been unjust toward Capt. WM. LESTER, the commander of that vessel. He certified to the death of the sailor, GOLDSMITH, precisely as it was reported to him at the time by the second mate -- that he fell from the topgallant forecastle. This statement was corroborated by three witnesses, then on the vessel, who took the body ashore to the Coroner in San Francisco. It was not until he reached this port that Capt. LESTER knew anything about the charge of murder against his third mate, or that he was in any way implicated in GOLDSMITH'S death. This information was brought to him by the Harbor Police themselves, after the third officer and most of the crew had left the ship.

The Bank of France have this day adopted a measure which is without parallel in the history of the institution.

They have raised the rate of discount 1 per cent. in one day. Their charge, which was advanced from 4 1/2@5 1/2 cent, on the 2d inst., is now raised to 7, or the same as that of the Bank of England. This decision implies that the Council are determined at present to follow a correct principle. The course pursued will be far more efficacious than the poor palliative involved in making foreign purchases of gold at an artificial price.

When wearied with set speeches and squared stories, there is a pleasant relief in throwing one's-self at the feet of an intelligent old gentleman, and gathering the narratives which tremble on the lips of garrulous age. The same feeling of relief is experienced when we turn from the stately march of history to the easy flow of personal reminiscences. To get at the real characters and habits of the celebrities of any period, you must consult with one of their cotemporaries. The premeditated Lives, prepared by judicious friends, are very uncertain guides. You meet the object of your curiosity dressed for dinner, as it were; or in the formal attitude which people generally assume when intending to have their portraits taken. They have their company-look on. And you turn disappointedly away, wishing that you could meet them in their, every-day guise, hob-a-nob with them in their familiar haunts, and know what manner of men they actually are.

Why, that woman has not only seceded from her husband -- a good, vigorous, noble man, handsome, too, with no fault towards her, except a blind eye to her carryings on, and a gentle rein over her, made, as you may say, of silken cobweb; but she has taken away the children as lawless as you please -- but that ain't all, dear RAYMOND, she actually insisted upon his yielding her her full income, just as if she was living with him -- and she got so enraged fit nothing, that one day in her mad pranks she cut holes in his trowsers, and spoilt one of his best suits -- a suit that he wore on general training day, and looked mighty handsome in, too! And, I do say, that was the unkindest cut of all. I always knew she was awful proud -- why, the pride and vanity of that one little woman was a sin to behold! She was so lazy that she kept as many as four helps to wait upon her alone! She never pretended to pay her bills, and when her old man let her have money for the house, she appropriated it all to herself! The main folly of all is, that she actually plumes herself that she is now sitting upon a pinnacle of greatness, and that we women-folks are going to recognize her as doing something lawful and proper -- to say nothing of the glorification she thinks men folks are going to grant her; it is so ridiculous that I am near about down sick about it.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Recent Case of Secession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Recent Case of Secession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a47d9a7-7fd0-5dfb-83d8-a18a3a39ecf9,804,nyt://article/5a47d9a7-7fd0-5dfb-83d8-a18a3a39ecf9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/25/archives/foreign-gossip.html,,"HABITS OF COUNT CAVOUR. -- This distinguished statesman has been dangerously ill, and at one time the ruiner gained currency that he was dead. His complaint, for which he was twice bled, was not of an apopleptic nature, as was at first feared, but an inflammation of the digestive organs. Great fears, however, are entertained that his health will give way before his intense and incessant occupation, strong appetite, luxurious living, plethoric habits, and want of bodily exercise. He is always up and at work at 5 o'clock in the morning. From 9 till 6 1/2 in the afternoon he directs all the business of his own department, and takes a general survey of those of his more helpless colleagues. Then follows dinner, his only meal in the 24 hours, and none of the lightest. He uses no carriage, but a walk from his private residence in the Via Cavour to the Ministerial offices in the Piazza Castello is but poor relaxation. The activity of the man's mind is immeasurable. He neglects nothing, forgets nothing; no scheme of policy or diplomacy is too high, no mean detail or particular is too commonplace for him. He has an eye for everything; he trusts few men, and these generally obscure but able individuals of his own choice and creation. He writes most of his letters with his own hand. He writes a plain and distinct round French hand, with lines wide apart -- a hand of which strength and decision would not, on a first inspection, seem to be the most obvious characteristics. A whole volume might be written about the expression lurking beneath every line of the half good humoredly, half sarcastically smiling mouth. It is the smile of a man who has early found out ""how little wisdom it takes to govern the world,"" and whose noble heart has prompted him to rule over it for its own greatest advantage.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d6586a0-09fe-5c4e-a8d1-c7150d0bf333,1436,nyt://article/5d6586a0-09fe-5c4e-a8d1-c7150d0bf333

BARNUM'S expense is not an every-day luxury, P.T.B. for many years having had the laugh on the other side. But at length the Prince of Showmen has been shown a trick that he did not know before, and the hero of the occasion has been, as is very usual on such occasions, a son of the Emerald Isle. It seems that BARNUM, a few days ago, was in a great hurry to be shaved, and entered his ordinary place of tonsorial resort under the Park Hotel; but all the operatives were engaged, and one other customer -- a great brawny Irishman, just landed, and with a beard and head requiring very extensive attention -- stood between the exhibitor of the ""What-is-it?"" and his turn as ""next."" ""I am in a hurry, my good man!"" said PHINEAS T., addressing Pat; ""and if you give me your ""turn I will pay for what you want done here."" ""All right,"" responded the delighted Irishman; and the showman was soon shaved and on his way to keep his engagement, merely saying as he left the door to the proprietor of the saloon, ""Do what this man wants,"" pointing to the exile of Erin, ""and charge it to me."" No sooner was he gone than PATRICK took off his ""trusty,"" and a thick cotton neck-tie, at the same time asking the barber, ""Now tell me all you do?"" ""Why, Sir,"" responded the tonsorial operative, ""we shave, cut and curl hair, shampoo and bathe."" ""All right, then,"" said PAT; ""Do all them things to me. Sorra wan of me knows what they mane, but as he said he'd pay for them, just do them all, an' God bless you!"" The barber saw the joke and did as requested, putting the big Irishman through all the processes, and bringing him out so pleasantly altered that he scarely knew himself. We leave our readers to imagine 'BARNUM's face next morning, when the proprietor of the saloon handed him a bill -- "" For shaving irishman 10 cents, cutting his hair 25 cents, curling it 25 cents, shampooing it 25 cents, and bathing Irishman 25 cents -- total for Irish man $1 10."" BARNUM at once acknowledged the com -- gave a receipt for the maize; but he is after the Irish exile, and swears, if he catches him, that he will place him check-by-jowl between the ""What is it?"" and the Aztec children.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'P.T.

About one hundred have thus far been found duly qualified and sworn into office, and as many more have been rejected as not coming up to the required standard. A large majority of the new appointees bear Irish names, which, in the absence of other explanation, would seem to indicate superior mental and physical qualifications on the part of Ribernia's sons. The examination is very rigid, and many are the dodges resorted to by the candidates to pass the ordeal. They are required to read and write, and to stand five feet eight in their stocking feet The test of the first qualification was, for awhile, decided by their ability to read a sign on the opposite side of the street to the Commissioners' office, but this had to be abandoned after a short trial, as it was found that the candidates bad got wind of the fact, and those who were not able to spell out the sign had sought the aid of their more gifted friends, and committed it to memory. Those who can read, and yet lack the required stature, sometimes resort to other dodges not less artful. One candidate, after taking off his boots and being measured, was found to reach the exact height required, but on a closer inspection he was discovered to have concealed under the soles of his feet, inside his stockings, two folded newspapers, thereby adding to his height, and at the same time confirming his literary claims.

Emulating the example of his immortal predecessor, Daniel Tucker, Esq., who, it will be remembered, came too late to get his supper, Mr. TUCKER came too late, and indeed, seemed somewhat tuckered out in the effort of his imposing entrance. The lecture consisted mainly of a compilation of the history of secession, and was interspersed with the highly original and instructive information that our forefathers -- WASHINGTON, WEBSTER and CLAY -- were great men; that the memory of DOUGLAS ought to be consigned to eternal infamy; that South Carolina ought not to secede; that the Union ought to be preserved; that Major ANDERSON is a hero, and that JAMES BUCHANAN, Esq., of Washington, D.C., is not doing his duty.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SECESSION DISCUSSED AT CLINTON HALL.

"WINTER GARDEN. Mr. CHARLES DILLON, an English actor of high repute, made a sudden and unexpected appearance at this Theatre on Thursday. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/26/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. Mr. CHARLES DILLON, an English actor of high repute, made a sudden and unexpected appearance at this Theatre on Thursday. The night was extremely inclement, and the attendance in consequence more complimentary to the actor than remunerative to the management. Mr. DILLON selected for the occasion a play long since made familiar to New-Yorkers, ""Belphegor"" by name, it is one of the very best pieces of its class, and the version played by Mr. DILLON struck us as being fuller and more able than the one we have naturalized on this side of the Atlantic. The gentleman's performance was of course the principal feature of interest, and in expressing our surprise at its great excellence, we shall but if echo the general feeling. Of late, we have not been accustomed to receive the best of talent from our English friends, but rather an inferior and greatly over-rated sort, which we could very readily dispense with. Mr. DILLON brought with him the usual quack hand-bills containing the opinions of the English Press, and was therefore justly viewed with suspicion by the initiated in such matters. A preparation so ridiculous was in his case assuredly unnecessary. Talent is not so plentiful here that we can afford to question it about its antecedents, and where exhibited so unmistakably as by Mr. DILLON, these need be no fear of the result. This fine artist's success was one of the most distinct we have ever placed on record. In the affecting scenes of the first act be was really superb, and this, too, without the slightest straining after effect. Mr. DILLON is natural to a point, but one degree removed from affectation; he does nothing in the usual way -- which in stage matters means the conventional way -- but trusts to the instant suggestions of a powerfully emotional nature. His voice is by no means pleasant, and is impeded with a noticeable lisp; yet these very defects are converted into excellencies by the realism of his style. The whole performance was characterized by originality and power, and under favorable circumstances would secure for the piece a long run. We trust that Mr. DILLON will have another opportunity of appearing before our public.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4f63d55-14c9-5519-8382-fcc43b80460a,841,nyt://article/c4f63d55-14c9-5519-8382-fcc43b80460a

We say the usual performance, because whilst we have a season we naturally expect one on Monday, as well as Wednesday and Friday, but there seems a strong probability that we shall not long boast of having a season at all. The attendance last week, notwithstanding much musical and artistic attraction, was so discreditably small, that the associate artists are undoubtedly justified in closing the doors on any night they choose, and it is rumored that they will assuredly do so if the next night or two does not afford them greater encouragement. In the meantime, our friends on the other side of the East River are warming to the operatic muse, and showing by liberal attendance and kindly appreciation, that they do not regard the erection of a handsome building as the only thing that is necessary to the permanent success of their undertaking. It seems indeed at present as though Brooklyn would take the lead in supporting Italian opera, and New York sink into the condition of a mere dependence, a place where one or two performances may perhaps be given at certain favorable periods of the year. There can be no apology for the miserable neglect with which our Fourteenth-street establishment is treated. Hard though the times may be, they are certainly no worse in New-York than in the City of Churches. It is the disposition that is wanting here. Our Academy, with its legions of free-admissionists, is no longer a pet toy with the classes for whom it was erected, and the general public has never been reconciled to the restrictions with which it is hampered in regard to seats and stockholders privileges. It seems to be ""played out."" Our Brooklyn friends are of course jubilant over their novelty, and will for several seasons cheerfully support a good company and an enterprising management. These, it seems to us, they have fully secured in the present organization. The best of ourtstablished favorites are COLSON, PHILLIPS, BRIGNOLI, SUSINI and FERRI; the most promising of debutantes is Miss HINCKLEY; the ables tof Italian opera conductors is Mr. MUZIO; the politest of managers, Mr. GROW. To this competent list must be added the name of Signorina ELENA, a young prima donna who is said to possess every qualification for success, and who will shortly make her debut in a new opera. The second performance of ""Il Giuramento"" was so dismally attended on Friday night that we can scarcely hope it will interest a large class of our readers to announce that "" Il Trovatore"" will be played to-morrow evening. Still for the benefit of the stockholders, the press, and especially of Miss HINKLEY, who is to make her second appearance as Leonore, we announce the fact. A larger community will learn with pleasure that VERDI's agreeable opera of the ""Sicilian Vespers"" will be given to-night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and to hear that there will be three performances at the latter establishment and two at the Four-tenth street one, during the present week.

The patients however, are mostly persons dependent upon the precarious earnings of a husband or a parent, or upon their own little earnings or savings, and owing to the severity of the times they fear that it will be impossible for many to pay this Winter at all, and indeed there are some who are already alarmed, on this acccount. Instances of this kind are stated in the Report, and one instance is mentioned of a patient who has hitherto paid regularly, but who now, from want of means, is no longer able to do so, and who has been transferred to the Free Ward of the Hospital, and there retained. The executive Committee fear that there will be a falling off from the receipts of the institution during the ensuing Winter, growing out of this cause. During the past year 130 patients have been admitted, of whom 99 have been discharged, 41 permanently relieved, 52 perfectly cured, 2 deceased, and 4 incurable. The rest are still in the Hospital. The increased amount of donations of goods, provisions, &c., during the past year, has in some measure made up for the lack of pecuniary donations. The share of the institution in the State appropriation to charitable institutions in New-York City has been lost, and the reserved fund, being the remains of $10,000 donated by the State several years ago, will not be more than enough to pay the next quarter's rent. There are at present in the Hospital 132 patients -- 17 paying and 15 free. The out-door patients still continue to come on Fridays in great numbers, to receive gratuitous treatment. The report contained, also, a list of the donations received by the institution, and which were of many and various kinds.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Anniversary of the New-York Woman's Hospital."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Anniversary of the New-York Woman's Hospital."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30afc1b6-21bd-5274-918b-b02b66b2b52a,1483,nyt://article/30afc1b6-21bd-5274-918b-b02b66b2b52a

While passing through Thirty-ninth-street, on their way back to the vessel, and when near Tenth-avenue, a number of ruffians attacked and robbed them, leaving SUTCLIFFE almost dead upon the sidewalk, but not injuring his companion to such a degree as to prevent his crawling away from the place and finally reaching the vessel. In the course of the night, SUTCLIFFE, still insensible from the blows of his assailants, was found by two policemen, and conveyed to Bellevue Hospital, where he received medical attention. His injuries, however, proved of a fatal character, his skull having been broken, and, after lingering several days in an unconscious condition, he died. The Coroner's investigation failed to discover the names of the murderers, but enough testimony was obtained to afford the police a basis for further inquiry. A few days after the inquest had been closed Officer IRVING, of the Twentieth Ward, apprehended five men, suspected of implication in the murder, one of whom, JEREMIAH FLYNN alias Blueskin, was positively identified by SUTCLIFFE's companion. These persons were all committed to prison by one of the Police Justices, and the officer continued his investigations with the object of securing indisputable evidence against them.

Hardly had his royal feet touched the Canadian shore, when the residence of the Governor-General was besieged by representatives of the illustrated papers, who desired photographs of the Prince and of his suite, that they might be reproduced in wood-cuts for the next week's paper. Each and every daguerrean artist, every photographer, and all the lithographers in the country, bothered, pestered, perplexed and waylaid the attendants of the future King, that through their influence his English born, but Teutonic fashioned countenance, might attract the passers of their gallery windows. The entire party were taken at least forty times prior to their advent into this Confederacy. Standing, sitting, grouped, singly, on foot, on horseback, and in carriage of state, in every conceivable way, shape and manner, were these regal visitors compelled to gaze, with winning smile, at the round glass mouth of the camera. The same fate awaited him and them in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

He stretches the events preliminary to the meeting of the State Convention, and the action taken by that body; expresses the conviction that all the people of the State will give a cordial support to the Ordinance of Secession, and gives a history of the seizure of the forts at Mobile, where were found about one hundred cannon -- 32 and 24-pounders, and of the capture of the arsenal, which contained 22,000 stand of small arms and 150,000 pounds of powder. All the indications are that Alabama must maintain her sovereignty and independence by force of arms; and, with this contingent cy in view, Gov. MOORE urges that the State should be at once placed on a war footing. Another million of dollars should be borrowed on bonds, in sums of $500 and $1,000 each, bearing interest at 8 per cent., and a force should be enlisted for twelve months, two years, or until peace should be concluded, as may seem best. The Governor frankly acknowledges that there may be much suffering and perhaps starvation among the poorer classes, unless the Legislature take some action, such as empowering the County Commissioners to levy and collect a tax for the purpose of affording relief to the needy. Gov. MOORE asks for two Secretaries, advises the increase of the contingent fund to $29,000, and says that he has purchased 9,000 stand of small arms, 10 brass rifled cannon (6-pounders;) 2 columbiads, 20,000 pounds of lead, 700 kegs of powder and 1,500,000 percussion caps.

The technical question involved in the recent decision of Lord Chief Justice COCKBURN, as to whether the Province of Canada is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench, is one for the future consideration of the British lawyer; but the Chief Justice, in the emergency of the case, has, for the present, assumed that it is, and his assumption has been regarded withsatisfaction in England, and will be hailed with joy throughout the length and breadth of Canada. Upon this point there can be no mistake. Popular sympathy is unusually excited in favor of ANDERSON, and if his redemption the doom of a Toronto Court had not been effected by habeas corpus to the Queen's Bench in England, it would certainly have been effected by an appeal either to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, or to the Court of Error and the House of Lords.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Canada Fugitive Slave Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Canada Fugitive Slave Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-01-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31f7a7bb-21f8-56e4-a54f-4b02b58d7423,908,nyt://article/31f7a7bb-21f8-56e4-a54f-4b02b58d7423

The Anna, a first-class tow-boat, to which the wheel has been attached, made a trial trip some fifteen miles up the East River, during which the party inspected its working with much interest. In the new wheel the whole power of the engine is exerted directly in propelling the boat, instead of being more or less wasted in submerging and lifting the floats, giving increased speed, or power for towing as the case may be, and wholly overcoming the unpleasant, jarring motion caused by the old wheel. There was also greater steadiness in the action of the engine, and no violent commotion or sea in the wake of the wheels. Capt. HITCHCOCK asserted that he could now tow two barges as easily and as rapidly as one could be be towed before. She made full fifteen miles an hour going and returning, with an average of 30 pounds of steam, and only partially open; revolutions from 23 to 27 per minute.
