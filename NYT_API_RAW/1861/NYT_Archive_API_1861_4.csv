BALL, BLACK & Co.'s, the manufacturers, on the corner of Prince-street and Broadway. It has a testimonial from the officers and privates of the Seventh Regiment, to their late Colonel, DURYEA, under whose fostering care the corps had earned and received a world-wide reputation for superiority in all that pertains to an organized volunteer corps. The service was manufactured by Messrs. BALL, BLACK & Co., at a cost of $5,000, and, aside from its magnificence, it is a masterpiece of workmanship. It consists of eight pieces, a centre piece or epergne, one soup tureen, two gravy tureens, two vegetable dishes, and two meat dishes, with stands for lamps. The epergne is of circular base, about twenty inches in circumference, with three small external bases, on the summit of which are the arms of a culrassier, with flags on each side. The middle base is thirteen inches in diameter, surmounted by all the arms of modern warfare, stacked in graceful style.

"TRIAL TRIP OF THE STEAMSHIP ILLINOIS. -- The steamship Illinois made a trial trip on Saturday to test the working of DINSMORE's feathering floats, which have been attached to that vessel during the past Winter.

Average pressure of steam cut on at hall stroke of piston, 18 pounds per square inch; vacuum in condensers, 26 inches; average revolutions of puddles, 20 per minute; highest pressure of steam, 25 pounds; greatest number of revolutions, 24 per minute; greatest speeed through water, 10 knots per hour; diameter of paddle wheels, 33 feet; paddles, 20 inches wide, 9 feet 6 inches long; immersion of paddle, 5 feet 6 inches; paddles immersed at same time, 4.

"The debate on the Slave-trade in the British Parliament, on the 26th ultimo, in which the history of the efforts of England, France, Portugal and Holland to suppress it were reviewed, and the obstacles apparently opposed to those measures by Spain and the United States were exposed, has elicited a warm expression of remonstrance and indignation from the Spanish Cortes. We took occasion, at. the time, to review that debate, with special reference to the exaggerated strictures of Lord JOHN RUSSELL on the obstructive attitude of this Government in the vexed question of Right of Search, as well as to the extended remarks of Lord PALMERSTON, which included certain severe but just animadversions upon the honor and responsibility of Spain.

"Coroner JACKMAN held an inquest yesterday, at the New-York Hospital, upon the body of a man named John Hopps, whose skull was fractured on the 19th inst. by a blow from a stick in the hands of a young man named Henry Rowland. The testimony was in substance as follows: Rowland and a colored man, Frederick Johnson by name, both of whom are employed at Schermerhorn's livery-stable, No. 172 Mercer-street, were amusing themselves on the afternoon of the 19th ult. by playing cards: while so employed, Hopps, the deceased, who acted as coachman for a gentleman whose horses were kept at the stable, went in and became a witness of the game; he was apparently somewhat intoxicated, and, looking over Johnsons hand, volunteered advice as to how the cards should be played, much to the annoyance of Rowland, who requested him to mind his own business and leave Johnson to act without assistance; Hopps thereupon became angry, and high words passed between the men, resulting in Rowland receiving a blow in the face from his opponent's fist; at this point other parties interposed and prevented further violence; Rowland then asked Hoops to leave him, but the latter again made an effort to renew the assault; having lost all patience, Rowland wrenched a stick from a bale of hay and struck Hopps upon the forehead with such force that he fell to the floor insensible; efforts were made to restore him to consciousness, but they failed, and he was removed to the Hospital, where, having languished until Tuesday night, death resulted. Rowland was not arrested at the time of the assault, as none who witnessed it would lodge a complaint against him. As soon, however, as the Police of the Fifteenth Ward heard of Hopps' death they took him into custody pending the result of the inquest. After hearing all the evidence in the case the jury were of opinion that ""death was caused by a blow at the hands of the prisoner, HENRY ROWLAND, who had inflicted it under circumstances of great provocation.""

"This Association met last night at their rooms in the Cooper Institute. During the temporary absence of the President, Prof. MASON, the Chair was occupied by Mr. J.P. VEEDER. The Professor subsequently arrived, and assumed his post. Mr. J.T. SEELY presented a model of a new water-wheel for grist mills, factories, &c., which would, as alleged, cost much less than the wheels now in use, while it would perform much more work. No action was taken thereupon. Mr. C.A. SEELY made some remarks on the use of Kerosene oil and other burning fluids, which elicited some discussion respecting their tendency to explosion. The main topic of the evening was ""Iron-clad Ships,"" which was introduced, in continuation of the same subject, left unfinished at the last meeting, by Mr. DIBBIN. He claimed that Mr. R.L. STEVENS, of Hoboken, was their originator, and instanced, what he admitted wasa ""nondescript,"" the mysterious battery not yet finished, in that, or rather under that, desirable locality in New-Jersey. He proceeded to describe the ""non-descript,"" but did not do much to clear up the obscurity which will probably for a long time to come envelop the work which has cost the Government so much money, and of which the present generation, in all probability, will not see the benefit. In Mr. DIBBIN's opinion an iron-plated ship would be far less useful in warfare than a ship built of wood, for the reason intimated by Mr. STETSON at the last meeting, namely, that the shot striking it would tear away so much of the surrounding iron work, that ten times the damage would be done which would accrue to a wooden vessel. The question to which the attention of the meeting was thence directed was the comparative invulnerability of a series of iron plates riveted together, and of a solid plate of iron of the same thickness. Wrought iron, it was claimed on one side, could not be shattered by a projectile made of cast-iron, while the contestants, on the other hand, argued that it could. Mr. STETSON and others continued the argument. Capt. BARTLETT, U.S.N., spoke at length on the subject of resistance to projectiles, and exhibited several specimens of shells to be thrown from cannon. Iron-clad ships, in his opinion, might be used in harbors, for defensive positions, but would not be available for general naval warfare.

"Amos Neary vs. Charles Germaine. -- This was an action to recover damages for personal injuries. The plaintiff was a deck-hand on the steam-tug Screamer, of which defendant was captain. When the steamer Black Warrior was wrecked on Rockaway Beach, some two years ago, the tug was engaged in trying to pull her off the shoal, in connection with the steam-tug Satellite. The Satellite was pulling ahead of the Screamer, when her hawser broke, and by the action of the wind and tide, the Screamer was swung round towards the shore. Her master, to bring her up, ordered the hawser, on which she was pulling, to be carried from the bitts amidships to the quarter-check. The plaintiff, with two other hands, was engaged in doing this, and after two unsuccessful trials, succeeded in getting it fast to the quarter-rail, the chock being carried away. When the strain came on the hawser as the boat went ahead, it broke away a piece of the rail which swung round inboard, and striking the plaintiff, who stood near, broke both his legs. For this injury the suit was brought, the plaintiff claiming that the defendant maliciously, and with intent to injure him, gave the order to go ahead at full speed instead of going slow until the hawser was taut. The only evidence of malice, however, which he offered, was that the defendant was swearing at the men for not fastening the line quicker, and on receiving what he understood to be a saucy answer from one of them, said, ""If you don't look out I'll break some of your necks,"" or, as one witness said, ""I'll come down and break your head.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/04/05/archives/a-deckhand-sues-his-captain-singular-allegations-of-malice-common.html,,"Amos Neary vs. Charles Germaine. -- This was an action to recover damages for personal injuries.

The services of Detectives Farley and Eustace were then invoked in the matter and the Baron was apprehended. It has now become known that the Baron is a nobleman, only by title, and that the appellation is self-conferred. He left Konigsberg, it is said, to avoid a prosecution for forgery, having formerly been a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Oppenheim & Warfchauer, whose names he made free use of in extensive forging operations, but who detected him before any loss accrued to their firm. His real name is G.H. Wenghoefer, although since his residence in this country he has sometimes called himself Robert Gilbert.

The Secretary read the report of the Council, recommending for election, as resident member, A. VON STEINWHR, and as corresponding members, all the Ambassadors to foreign countries, just apponted by the new Administration. Mr. CHARLES DANA, of New-York, a resident for the past three years in Honolulu, and its neighborhood, read a paper on the Sandwich Islands, in which he treated of heir history, natural productions, scenery, and present states of civilization and cultivation. Thousands of miles from any continent, they were a sort of half-way house for navigators. The natives, far from being the savages they were supposed to be, were among the most inoffensive beings in the world. A stranger might travel anywhere there without apprehension, and sleep in any native hut without fear. The women, when young, were remarkable for beauty, and equally notable for hideousness when old. In ""full dress,"" they overburdened themselves with clothing, but relieved themselves after that ceremony by emulating the pristine simplicity of Eve in Paradise. The men rejoiced in blankets, which they wore with dignity, feeling that with dress, or without dress, ""a man's a man for a' that."" The food of the natives was principally fish, but dogs were also eaten, though not so much as formerly. The lecturer had eaten ""dog,"" and thought it. far better than ""hog."" It was a more cleanly animal than a pig, -- it was, in fact, very good eating. Mr. DANA took a new view of Capt. COOK'S history. The Captain and his crew were a hungry set. They ate so much that they starved the Hawaiians out, and only paid for their food with a few trinkets. COOK caused himself to be worshipped as a God; he broke the idols of the natives, and attempted to abduct their king. They accordingly rose up and murdered him. Mr. DANA gave a highly graphic account of a visit to the celebrated volcano of Kileuau. A vote of thanks was passed for his discourse, and the meeting adjourned.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Meeting of the Geographical Society.; MR.

"Hon. JOHN MCLEAN, L.L.D., who died at Cincinnati yesterday morning, was born in Morris County, N.J., on March 11, 1785. His father, who was an Irish emigrant, and a weaver by trade, removed to the West when his son was four years of age, settling first at Morgantown, Va., afterwards in Jessamine, near Nicholasville, Ky., then in the vicinity of Mayslick, finally taking up his permanent abiding place in 1799, in that section of Ohio now included in Warren County. Here Mr. MCLEAN cleared a farm on whichhe resided until the time of his death, which occurred in 1839. His son was sent to school at an early age, and availed himself of the limited advantages which were afforded him so eagerly, that when sixteen years of age he was placed under the tuition of Rev. MATTHEW WALLACE and one Mr. STUBBS, who grounded him pretty thoroughly in Latin and Greek. All this time he was doing his full share of labor on the farm, with that self-reliant disposition which has characterized him through his long and eminently useful career, refusing to allow his father to defray the expenses of his education. When eighteen years of age Mr. MCLEAN left the farm to enter upon the study of the law in Cincinnati, and while pursuing a course of reading in the office of ARTHUR ST. CLAIR, he contrived to support himself by husbanding the meagre salary which he received from a position which he had procured in the office of the County Clerk. A short time before his admission to the Bar, in 1807, he married Miss REBECCA EDWARDS, daughter of Dr. EDWARDS, formerly of South Carolina, and in the Fall of that year opened an office in Lebanon, Warren County. Mr. MCLEAN rapidly attained eminence in his profession, and in 1812 was the successful one of three competitors for Congressional honors in the Cincinnati District. At this time Mr. MCLEAN was an ardent Democrat, never allowing his devotion to party, however, to overcome his sense of duty, for again and again where principle was concerned, he left the ranks and voted against political friends. During his first Congressional term he was an ardent supporter of Mr. MADISON'S war policy, and so successfully did he represent his constituents that in 1814 he was returned to the House without opposition, actually receiving every vote cast in his District. During his second term he rendered distinguished services on two Committees -- those on Foreign Relations and the Public Lands. In 1815 he was tendered the nomination for the United States Senatorship, which was equivalent to an election, but he could not persuade himself that he would be doing his duty to his constituents in withdrawing from the position in which they had placed him, and declined the honor. In 1816, however, having nearly completed his term, he resigned his seat in the House, to take one on the Supreme Bench of Ohio, to which the Legislature elected him unanimously. This position he held for six years, when President MONROE appointed him Commissioner of the Land-office, and in the next year (1823) he was elevated to the Postmaster-Generalship. He discharged the duties of the office with such eminent success, that the salary attached to it was raised from $4,000 to $6,000, by a nearly a unanimous vote in both the Senate and House -- JOHN RANDOLPH remarking at the time that he would vote for the bill if it were made to expire when Judge MCLEAN left the position. When President JACKSON came into office he was desirous of retaining Judge MCLEAN in his Cabinet, but he thought it expedient to decline all offers which were made him to this end, and wasnominated for a seat on the Supreme Bench, which he accepted, entering upon his duties in the January term, 1830. The decisions which he has given during the thirty years which he has occupied this position have filled out the measure of his fame, and given him a leading place among the first jurists of this or any other country. One of his most memorable charges was delivered during the Canadian excitement, in 1838, when he took strong ground against the practice of aiding or in any way favoring unlawful military combinations among our citizens against any Government with which we were at peace. His opinion on the Dred Scott case, in which he dissented from that given by Chief Justice TANEY, will cause his name to be remembered.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/04/05/archives/obituary.html,,"Hon.

His son was sent to school at an early age, and availed himself of the limited advantages which were afforded him so eagerly, that when sixteen years of age he was placed under the tuition of Rev. MATTHEW WALLACE and one Mr. STUBBS, who grounded him pretty thoroughly in Latin and Greek. All this time he was doing his full share of labor on the farm, with that self-reliant disposition which has characterized him through his long and eminently useful career, refusing to allow his father to defray the expenses of his education. When eighteen years of age Mr. MCLEAN left the farm to enter upon the study of the law in Cincinnati, and while pursuing a course of reading in the office of ARTHUR ST. CLAIR, he contrived to support himself by husbanding the meagre salary which he received from a position which he had procured in the office of the County Clerk. A short time before his admission to the Bar, in 1807, he married Miss REBECCA EDWARDS, daughter of Dr. EDWARDS, formerly of South Carolina, and in the Fall of that year opened an office in Lebanon, Warren County. Mr. MCLEAN rapidly attained eminence in his profession, and in 1812 was the successful one of three competitors for Congressional honors in the Cincinnati District. At this time Mr. MCLEAN was an ardent Democrat, never allowing his devotion to party, however, to overcome his sense of duty, for again and again where principle was concerned, he left the ranks and voted against political friends. During his first Congressional term he was an ardent supporter of Mr. MADISON'S war policy, and so successfully did he represent his constituents that in 1814 he was returned to the House without opposition, actually receiving every vote cast in his District. During his second term he rendered distinguished services on two Committees -- those on Foreign Relations and the Public Lands. In 1815 he was tendered the nomination for the United States Senatorship, which was equivalent to an election, but he could not persuade himself that he would be doing his duty to his constituents in withdrawing from the position in which they had placed him, and declined the honor. In 1816, however, having nearly completed his term, he resigned his seat in the House, to take one on the Supreme Bench of Ohio, to which the Legislature elected him unanimously. This position he held for six years, when President MONROE appointed him Commissioner of the Land-office, and in the next year (1823) he was elevated to the Postmaster-Generalship. He discharged the duties of the office with such eminent success, that the salary attached to it was raised from $4,000 to $6,000, by a nearly a unanimous vote in both the Senate and House -- JOHN RANDOLPH remarking at the time that he would vote for the bill if it were made to expire when Judge MCLEAN left the position. When President JACKSON came into office he was desirous of retaining Judge MCLEAN in his Cabinet, but he thought it expedient to decline all offers which were made him to this end, and wasnominated for a seat on the Supreme Bench, which he accepted, entering upon his duties in the January term, 1830. The decisions which he has given during the thirty years which he has occupied this position have filled out the measure of his fame, and given him a leading place among the first jurists of this or any other country. One of his most memorable charges was delivered during the Canadian excitement, in 1838, when he took strong ground against the practice of aiding or in any way favoring unlawful military combinations among our citizens against any Government with which we were at peace. His opinion on the Dred Scott case, in which he dissented from that given by Chief Justice TANEY, will cause his name to be remembered.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'MCLEAN, JOHN', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1861-04-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e3eaa55a-e4ef-5d02-90c7-a12fba81fdb1,807,nyt://article/e3eaa55a-e4ef-5d02-90c7-a12fba81fdb1

"About three weeks since Messrs. Livermore, Clews & Mason, Stock-brokers at No. 29 Wall-street, received a quantity of Virginia State Sixes from a man named James Elliott, then in Washington, D.C., with the request that they should be negotiated, and the money forwarded to him. This was done, and a day or two since Elliott called in person at the office of the firm, and put in its hands what purported to be $3,500 worth of the same stock, with the request that it should be sold, and the proceeds retained, subject to his order. Certain peculiarities in the appearance of these last-named bonds, induced the brokers to suspect that they were not genuine, and upon comparison their suspicions were confirmed. Yesterday morning, therefore, when Elliott sent down a draft for $1,000 on account of the bogus stock, it was refused ostensibly because of an informality in the filling up, and Detectives Slowey and King were informed of the matter. These officers took stations at the brokers' office in anticipation of Elliott's appearance, and they had not long to wait ere he arrived. In the midst of his explanations to Messrs Livermore & Co., he was astonished to feel a hand upon his shoulder, while at the same time one of the officers whispered in his ear the ominous words ""You're my prisoner."" Elliott was then removed to Head-quarters, where he will be detained pending a magisterial investigation of the case. The forged drafts bear a strong resemblance to the genuine, but a minute comparison shows that they are not of so dark a color, and the paper is of poorer quality. The signature of U.R.C. Drinkhard attached to the coupons, is also unlike that gentleman's autograph. These forged bonds are dated ""Richmond, Va., July 1, 1861,"" and are made payable in this City. It is probable that a large number of them have been manufactured and are in circulation. During his negotiations with Messrs. Livermore & Co., the prisoner went by the name of Barbour, but after his apprehension he stated that his real name is Elliott.

In the midst of his explanations to Messrs Livermore & Co., he was astonished to feel a hand upon his shoulder, while at the same time one of the officers whispered in his ear the ominous words ""You're my prisoner."" Elliott was then removed to Head-quarters, where he will be detained pending a magisterial investigation of the case. The forged drafts bear a strong resemblance to the genuine, but a minute comparison shows that they are not of so dark a color, and the paper is of poorer quality. The signature of U.R.C. Drinkhard attached to the coupons, is also unlike that gentleman's autograph. These forged bonds are dated ""Richmond, Va., July 1, 1861,"" and are made payable in this City. It is probable that a large number of them have been manufactured and are in circulation. During his negotiations with Messrs. Livermore & Co., the prisoner went by the name of Barbour, but after his apprehension he stated that his real name is Elliott. He asserted that he obtained the bonds from responsible persons, and his ability to prove his innocence of the crime laid to hit charge.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Forgery of Virginia Bonds.; A DEALER IN FANCY STOCKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Forgery of Virginia Bonds.; A DEALER IN FANCY STOCKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62824c61-a7af-555f-b3df-96b1b044597f,372,nyt://article/62824c61-a7af-555f-b3df-96b1b044597f

The report that the supplies for the garrison had been cut off by authority, is corroborated by the Charleston papers which reached us last night. The Southern Commissioners, now in Washington, our correspondent informs us, still express a belief that a peaceful policy will prevail, though their sincerity may with propriety be questioned, in view of all that is transpiring.

"On the 17th of last November, the warehouse of Messrs. Thomos and William Fisher, lace importers, at No. 69 North-street, was visited by burglars who entered by removing the scuttle on the roof, and managed to carry away nearly $3,000 worth of laces without attracting attention. Detectives Farley and Eustace were assigned to the work of tracking the thieves, and after two months labor, notwithstanding the fact that the search was prosecuted under the disadvantage of having no clue upon which to base their movements, these officers arrested one of the burglars, named George Shrimpton, who was convicted and is now serving a term of four years and six months in Sing Sing prison. At the time of his arrest, the Detectives recovered $800 worth of the stolen laces, but not being satisfied with obtaining so small a portion of the property, their efforts to secure the remainder were not at all relaxed. Recently they received information from one of those secret sources whom ""shadows"" delight in knowing, which carried with it the conviction that the Test, of the laces were concealed at a house in West Hoboken, about five miles from the ferry, formerly tenanted ""General"" Greenthal, -- as expert a rogue, 'tis said, as ever England furnished to the criminal ranks of this country, who is at present also doing the State ""some service."" On Thursday evening the officers decided that a call should be made upon the ""General's"" wife, who still retained possesion of the premises, and a request be made her to surrender the goods. This arrangement was duly executed, but Mrs. Greenthall was not communicative, and although she did not deny for a moment that the officers had received correct information as to where the goods had been concealed, she refused to point out the precise spot, requesting the police to look it up themselves, chuckling triumphantly as she bade them search the premises, in the belief that the lace was beyond their reach. Nothing discouraged, the detectives, who had been joined in the matter by Sergeant Dickson, also of the detective force, entered upon a minute examination of every nook and cranny where it was thought possible the plunder could be stowed away. When, however, the search was extended to the coach-house, Mrs. Greenthal, (weo had closely watched these movements, and had in turn been watched herself,) betrayed considerable anxiety, which only served to convince the police that the prize was there concealed. A very minute examination was then undertaken, -- the hay bales and feedbags were overturned, on the supposition that the lace had been buried in them, the walls and floors and lofts were each subjected to a close scrutiny, but no suspicious trap-doors or panels were found. Finally the officers were about to give the matter up as a bad job, when one of them noticed that several of the crevices in the flooring, in the centre of the stable, were free from dirt, while the remainder of the cracks were choked up as would ordinarily result from use. This fact convinced him that the flooring ead recently been taken up, and consequently he proposed to push the search in that direction. His companions acquiesced, and after ripping up the planks they were rewarded for their pains by the aight of a number of sacks. These were speedily, emptied of their contents, which consisted of the laces that they had been seorching for. The property was gathered up again and brought over to New-York, where it was fully identified by Messrs. Fishers & Co., whose trademarks were still upon it. The woman Greenthal was arrested, as well as her daughter, Hannah Davis, a young woman of 25 years, and a man named Jacob Ort, each of whom is held as a receiver of stolen goods.

"Early on Saturday morning Redmond McManus, a Deputy Sheriff, formerly a Police Officer attached to the Lower Police Court, in company with one of his friends named Davenport, went into the coffee and cake saloon No. 36 Bowery and ordered refreshments. McManus was intoxicated, and while the waiter went to procure what had been called for, he produced a revolver and offered to bet Davenport that he could extinguish a gas-light in the rear part of the saloon at the first shot. Davenport expressed incredulity, and immediately the boastful drunkard fired. As might have been anticipated, the ball went wide of the mark, but McManus excused himself for the failure by pleading nervousness, and nothing further was thought of the matter. Having eaten what had been ordered the men stepped to the bar, and while settling with the proprietor, the subject of pistol-shooting was again spoken of. Suddenly, McManus a second time drew his revolver and discharged it in the same direction as at first, unhappily with a more serious result. The bullet entered the forehead of a man named Wm. Hogan, who was seated at one of the tables, and glancing around the skull, caused a very severe and painful scalp wound. The excitement attending the occurrence attracted several police officers, to the saloon, and McManus was taken into custody. Hogan was removed to the Tenth Precint Station-house, and attended by a police Surgeon, who failed to extract the bullet, and the patient was afterwards taken to the New-York Hospital. The Surgeon of that institution was finally successful in tracing the course of the missile, which he succeeded in removing, finding it to have been flattened by contact with the skull. The injury is said to be of a dangerous character, but at present no fears of a fatal result are entertained. The prisoner was taken before the magistrate at the Tombs on Saturday morning where affidavits were made by several witnesses of the occurrence, and he was committed, pending Hogan's recovery or death.

"On Friday night an attempt was made to set fire to the tenement-house No. 102 Ridge-street, in which twenty-four families find accommodation. SIMON SALEY, a butcher, occupies the front basement as a shop, and the passage-way leading to the cellar was used as a storehouse for his meats, while a large dog was chained near by as a protection against thieves.

"We have now before us the text of the manifesto of the Czar, announcing to his subjects the emancipation of the serfs. His Majesty tells them that on ascending the throne he resolved in all sincerity to acquire the affections of his subjects of every rank and condition -- ""from the warrior who nobly carries arms for the defence of his country, to the humble artisan engaged in works of industry; from the functionary who pursues the career of the highest employments of the State, to the laborer whose plow furrows the fields."" His Majesty proceeds to glance at the patriarchalrelations which have hitherto existed between the peasants and their proprietors, and to show that as simplicity of manners has disappeared, the condition of the serfs has been unfavorably affected. He was convinced, therefore, that a great amelioration of their lot was a mission to which he was called by Divine Providence.

Now Mrs. Alexander, who resides on the second floor of the aforesaid premises, is the happy possessor of an earthen tureen, (politely speaking) to which vessel there was a cover of the same material. With this in hand she was proceeding slowly but surely to the aforesaid edifice in the rear of the yard, when opening the door and discovering a Lundy in possession, she was moved by some mysterious and inexplicable providence to dash the contents of her tureen in the face of the Lundy. This was the tocsin of warfare Clan Lundy and Clan Alexander rushed furiously upon one another, and were quite playful for some time. In this metes Mrs. Alexander's tureen was made to play a conspicuous part. It was the only weapon, with the exception of fists, that the evidence developed, and told fearfully in the hands of the irate Mrs. Alexander, while the cover in the hands of a Lundy also made its impression.

For this indignity an action was brought against the offender in the Supreme Court, which he allowed to go by default. The case came up on Monday night before the regular panel of the Sheriff's Jury, whose duty it is to assess damages on all cases which have gone by default -- and after a patient hearing of the evidence pro and con, and which was published in the TIMES at the time of the occurrence, the jury awarded Alderman RUSSELL the sum of $1,000, as compensation for the indignity perpetrated, and the damage done to his nasal protruberance. As there is no appeal from the verdict of a Sheriff's jury, Mr. WILSON will have to pay up the penalty. Many years since, but within the memory of those who would not care to be classed among the ""oldest inhabitants"" of the City, Dr. HART, then musical and theatrical critic of the Courier and Enquirer, chanced to offend Mr. WOOD, the singer, then performing with his wife at the Old Park Theatre. Coming together by accident in the lobby of the theatre, Mr. WOOD, after some words of crimination and recrimination, spat in Mr. HART's face, for which he was afterwards mulcted in the sum of $3,000, in a civil action, and the occurrence was the occasion of the celebrated ""Wood riot,"" which was so disastrous to the Park Theatre. The inference to be drawn from the two verdicts is, that while a reporter's face is worth $3,600 and a riot, an Alderman's note is only worth $1,060 without the addition of the riot.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2dacec50-42cb-52eb-a4aa-26f868c2cf09,508,nyt://article/2dacec50-42cb-52eb-a4aa-26f868c2cf09

"BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- A contented mind is a continual feast in morals and in music. Those who looked for ""Linda"" last night were regaled with the ""Somnambula,"" and the disappointment occasioned by the same, was borne with all the fortitude which we have a right to expect in such a building in such a city, and from an audience accustomed to the contemplation of human nature in a white neck-tie. All things considered the attendance was good, and the appearance of the house brilliant and fashionable. Miss KELLOGG appeared as Amina -- the third role she has undertaken in public. Inasmuch as the opera was substituted at the last moment for another that could not be given in consequence of the indisposition of Signer FERRI, it was, we presume, played without rehearsal. Some allowance has to be made for all the artists, especially for the lady who is comparatively new in the part, having sung it only in Boston. Signor BRIGNOLI, in point of fact, needed a good deal of allowance, and Signor SUSINI's throat-trouble cried aloud for tender consideration. Miss KELLOGG sang the music of her part with decided skill, and acted naturally and spontaneously in all save the finale to the second act, which was, to our mind, fidgety and overwrought. We do not, however, regard Amina as one of the roles peculiarly fitted for the powers possessed by our New-York primadonna. It is true that an excellent method and a quick nervous facility in overcoming obstacles enable her to attack almost any kind of music with success. But it is clear that her style is dramatic, and that the quality of her voice lends itself better to largeness than to brilliancy. In Linda she is the equal of almost any artist we have ever had in the part, and the superior of the majority of those who have essayed it. We cannot say the same of her Amina, although we may gladly recognize in it the indications of a true artist.",https://www.nytimes.com/1861/04/10/archives/amusements.html,,"BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- A contented mind is a continual feast in morals and in music.

Extravagant as it may seem, it is actually the belief of ninetenths of the South Carolina fire-eaters today, that such is the terror of their name and their superhuman prowess in warlike exploit, that did but the ""Rhett Guards,"" or the ""Whippy-Swamp Avengers,"" or other company of scowling heroes, raise their dread ensign in Washington or New York, SCOTT and all his hirelings, SANFORD and his Abolition cohorts, would rush helter-skelter into the Potomac and the Hudson to escape their all-devouring blades. The braggadocio of their military and political leaders, and of their press, actually realizes the absurdest types of Spanish-American rhodomontade; while their contempt for the cowardice of those of their fellow-countrymen who, at the worst, are but guilty of an intellectual disagreement with them, knows no limit. It was long a solemn article in the creed of the jolly British tar that one Briton was as good as three Frenchmen, while every man in the corps d'armee of France, in turn, as devoutly believed that one Frenchman was equal to at least half a dozen Englishmen; and neither of these theories are altogether outside of the boards of reason, -- indeed, striking confirmations of the truth of them both can easily be found in the course of the interminable wars of England with France. But your genuine fire-eating Carolina blockhead -- though, unfortunately for him, history has as yet furnished no basis for his faith -- establishes no such modest equation between himself and the twenty-seven millions of other Americans yet to be found outside of the limits of South Carolina. Indeed, with him there seems to be virtually but two divisions of the human species -- Carolinians and cowards; and what one whale is to an infinite shoal of minnows, so is one of the former to an indefinite number of the latter.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bluster and Back Down.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bluster and Back Down.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e642a5c-6148-5c74-8b46-a71b3a4f9570,899,nyt://article/1e642a5c-6148-5c74-8b46-a71b3a4f9570

"Three million of dollars are allotted to the Banks of New-Orleans. This is a sad damper upon the enthusiasm of secession, so that for several days past we have had no jubilant telegrams from that city. An ominous quiet has prevailed. This is the first real taste of secession. The agreeable prelude, the great theft of the United States Mint, did not last long. More money was wanted. The new loan was created, but no anxious bidders crowded around the Treasury benches entreating for the privilege of subscribing to it, notwithstanding the telegraphs so ostentatiously sent over the country, repeating the announcement that it was all subscribed for at par. All these boastings were simply confessions that the loan could not be sold at all, and to divert public attention from this disagreeable fact. Not a cent could be had in open market, in which our Government can get millions at will. The South was never flush of money, and the few that possess it regard secession with a hatred, of which we at the North have a feeble conception. It can be had of them only by pressure. A second attempt of the kind can hardly be made, which shows the very limited tether of the new Government, and explains the great anxiety that Mr. DAVIS has manifested to postpone hostilities. He cannot move or maintain large bodies of troops for want of cash. This is the sine qua non of all operations, both civil and military. In these days, success is measured by the length of purse. War no longer depends upon personal prowess, but upon the number of ships a people can put afloat, and the number of soldiers they can clothe, feed and arm.

The new loan was created, but no anxious bidders crowded around the Treasury benches entreating for the privilege of subscribing to it, notwithstanding the telegraphs so ostentatiously sent over the country, repeating the announcement that it was all subscribed for at par. All these boastings were simply confessions that the loan could not be sold at all, and to divert public attention from this disagreeable fact. Not a cent could be had in open market, in which our Government can get millions at will. The South was never flush of money, and the few that possess it regard secession with a hatred, of which we at the North have a feeble conception. It can be had of them only by pressure. A second attempt of the kind can hardly be made, which shows the very limited tether of the new Government, and explains the great anxiety that Mr. DAVIS has manifested to postpone hostilities. He cannot move or maintain large bodies of troops for want of cash. This is the sine qua non of all operations, both civil and military. In these days, success is measured by the length of purse. War no longer depends upon personal prowess, but upon the number of ships a people can put afloat, and the number of soldiers they can clothe, feed and arm. A Government that has no other resource for these objects than forced loans is not far from its end.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fifteen Million Loan National Credit and Repudiation.; We have it from good authority that $5,000,000, the first installment! of the $15,000,0008 per cent, loan of the Confederated States, are now being apportioned among the Banks of New-Orleans, Mobile, Savannah and Charleston, with some small allotments to other places.

The assistants employed by the detective, who, like himself, were strangers in Baltimore City, by assuming to be Secessionists from Louisiana and other seceding States, gained the confidence of some of the conspirators, and were entrusted with their plans. It was arranged in case Mr. LINCOLN should pass safely over the railroad to Baltimore, that the conspirators should mingle with the crowd which might surround his carriage, and by pretending to be his friends, be enabled to approach his person, when, upon a signal from their leader, some of them would shoot at Mr. LINCOLN with their pistols, and others would throw into his carriage hand grenades filled with detonating powder, similar to those used in the attempted assassination of the Emperor LOUIS NAPOLEON.

The dispatches from Charleston, which we publish in the order of their reception, contain various absurd statements relative to the execution done by the batteries against Fort Sumpter, telegraphed probably on the authority of those interested in having the country believe that the fortress is to be immediately reduced. It is best to await intelligence from a more reliable source before accepting all the statements made. The only definite intelligence relative to the fleet of relief vessels sent from this port and from other points, is the statement that three steamers, two of which were the Harriet Lane and the Pawnee, had made their appearance off the harbor. The impression prevailed in Charleston that an attempt would be made during the night to reinforce Fort Sumpter by means of small boats. Another impression also prevailed -- which may be considered somewhat significant -- that Major ANDERSON, from the regularity and spirit of his replies to the iron hail poured in upon him, must have more men under his command than has been supposed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/072baac0-422b-5bd6-a8db-8b28f8d4d945,1566,nyt://article/072baac0-422b-5bd6-a8db-8b28f8d4d945

"Miss KELLOGG'S best success so far has been made unquestionably in Linda di Chamounix, an opera which, on its production here last season, we referred to at length as the vehicle that had established the lady's position. It was repeated last evening to one of the most fashionable audiences we have ever seen in our handsome Fourteenth-street establishment, and the public verdict fully confirmed that previously rendered by the critics. In the second act, where prima donne not unfrequently make a comparative failure of situation which is full of natural pathos, Miss KELLOGG is all that correct taste and sensibility can require. Her acting, without being visibly studied, is full of good dramatic effects, and, what is better, never loses the grace and charm of maidenhood. Vocally regarded, the role of Linda is admirably adapted to the lady's quality of voice, and especially to her style of singing We may say briefly that, in all respects, the performance was eminently satisfactory, and merited all the applause that was bestowed on it.

"THE HOMICIDE OF THOMAS EAGEN, -- THOMAS EAGEN, the young Irishman who was stabbed on Monday night last, in an affray at the billiard saloon, No. 31 Baxter-street, kept by two Italians, brothers, named ANTONIO and JORALARMO MORELLO, died on Friday at the Hospital, in consequence of his injuries. The circumstances attending the case were made the subject of an investigation on Saturday before Coroner JACKMAN, when a state of affairs was shown differing materially from what the deceased had asserted in his ante-mortem deposition. Upon his testimony the man, JORALARMO, was charged with having given the fatal blow, and by the direction of the Coroner he was committed for trial.

"Fort Sumpter was surrendered to the authorities of the Confederate States on Saturday afternoon, after having been bombarded incessantly since about 4 o'clock on Friday morning. We gather this fact from the mass of confused dispatches which have reached us from Charleston, -- also the additional one that those of the United States vessels which, had arrived off the harbor -- four in number -- took no part in the engagement, and made no effort to relieve the beleaguered garrison. It appears, also, that previous to the surrender considerable damage had been suffered by the Fort. The wooden structures inside had all been set on fire by a hot shot fired from Fort Moultrie, and the horrors of a conflagration were thus added to the difficulties with which the scanty garrison were obliged to cope. Numerous explosions of bombs were also caused by the fire, it being found impossible to remove them in time. It seems almost incredible that no lives were lost during the bombardment, but such, appears to be the fact. Only four of Major ANDERSON's men were wounded, -- one of them, perhaps, mortally. The Major, after the capitulation, was for a short time a guest of Gen. BEAUREGARD in Charleston.

"A rumor prevailed in Washington, yesterday, that Fort Pickens had been attacked, but it could not be traced to any responsible source, and was undoubtedly untrue. The event, however, will probably be not much longer delayed. The Cabinet is almost constantly in session, deliberating upon the grave questions which have been called up by the attack upon the Government, and in deciding upon the plans of operations presented to them by the military and naval authorities. Much anxiety prevails in Washington as to the course which Virginia is likely to pursue in the present crisis, and opinions appear to be pretty equally divided, that the Convention will decide to secede immediately, and that it will vote to keep the State on the side of the old Union. It is quite generally believed, however, that should the Convention vote to secede, the people will reject its action.

"REMARKABLE SUICIDE OF AN UNHAPPY WOMAN. -- Mrs. SUSAN REEK, an Englishwoman, 40 years of age, was found dead in bed yesterday morning, at the house No. 424 Third avenue, under circumstances of melancholy interest. Very nearly ten months ago she obtained a divorce from her husband, in the Court of Common Pleas, upon the ground of ill-treatment, and during the subsequent period she has lived at the house of Mr. SPRINGSTED, in Third-avenue, with whose family she was on terms of intimacy. Since obtaining the divorce she has at times exhibited much objection, in consequence of her unhappy domestic affairs; and still entertaining feelings of love for her former husband, a short time since she proposed to him that they should again live together. To this he would not assent, as he had formed an illigal relationship with a woman in New-Haven, and Mrs. REEK was rendered still more miserable by the refusal. Finally she conceived the idea of ending her troubles, in this life at least, by poisoning herself, and the result has shown that her preparations for the purpose were made with great deliberation. Last Friday she informed Mr. SPRINGSTED's family that it was her intention to take the train for New-Haven, in order to see Mr. REEK and win him back to herself, but that on Tuesday she would be home again. The poor woman, however, did not do as she had said. Retiring to her room she replaced her ordinary dress with a bridal robe of pure white, with under-clothing to match; then, having arranged her toilet with great care, she drank two ounces of laudanum, lay down with composed limbs and folded hands and expired, her features retaining the placidity of sleep. Yesterday her protracted absence alarmed the family, and, suspecting the truth of the matter, the door of her room was forced open only to find the conjecture verified.

This was a libel filed by the owners of the steamboat Ansonia to recover about $800, the amount of the damages occasioned to her by a collision with the schooner, which occurred about noon on the 19th of May, 1858. The steamboat was on her accustomed course between Bridgeport and New-York, and the schooner was bound from Madison, Conn., to New-York. The collision took place near Hunt's Point. As the steamer came round that point her master saw the schooner on the south side of the channel, in the wind. She came round on her starboard tack close hauled, heading north north-east. The wind was east by north or east north-east. As to the amount of wind there was great conflict of testimony. The libelant claiming that it was a working breeze, the claimants insisting that it was light and baffling, and so feeble that they had to use sweeps to help her round in tacking. The libel alleged that after the steamer had passed Hunt's Point a sloop was observed coming down, which, by a sudden tack, compelled the steamboat to keep to starboard; that she blew her whistle to call the attention of the schooner to her position, and seeing that there was danger of a collision stopped her engine and backed as soon as possible; that the schooner kept on till she was close to the steamboat when she tacked, but almost immediately shifted her helm and came into the steamboat on her larboard side.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DECISIONS IN ADMIRALTY.; United States District Court.

"Albert Blackman and twenty-three others vs. The ship Staghound. -- This was a libel filed to recover wages alleged to be due the libelants as seamen on the ship. They shipped at Hong Kong for a voyage thence to a port or ports in China, and thence to Cuba. The vessel set sail about Dec. 1, 1859, from Hong Kong, and went to Swatow, and there took on board a cargo of some 400 coolies, with which she sailed for Cuba. She is a vessel of about 1,600 tons, and had a crew of thirty-four men, with three mates and two quartermasters and a carpenter. On the 31st of March she arrived in Angier Roads, and on that day a difficulty occurred on board. For some fifty hours, while working up the Roads the men had been kept at work without much sleep, but the evidence showed that this was necessary in the working of the ship. During the 31st, however, the men had rested. About 8 o'clock P.M. the first mate who had been ashore, was below. The third mate had had his shoulder dislocated, and the Captain was in feeble health. The mate was called up by a noise of the men, and found all the crew standing on or near the starboard bridge. He ordered them forward, and Hussey, the second mate, a son of the Captain, stepped forward to enforce the order, when he was stabbed by Morris, one of the crew, with a sheath-knife, in the abdomen, from which wound he died some days after. The first mate stepped up to Morris also, but was also stabbed by him in the breast, though not dangerously. He then went to the cabin and got a pistol, and coming out told the men that he would shoot the first one who came aft. Morris stepped out and told him to ""fire and be d -- d,"" on which the mate fired, but missed Morris, hitting one of the crew. The Captain by this time had crawled on deck and threatened to shoot any man who should try to come aft. He was greeted, with a storm or abuse from Morris. He then ordered a boat to be manned to go for a surgeon. None of the crew, obeyed, or answered to a subsequent call for volunteers to man the boat, and the carpenter and quartermasters with the third mate to steer, with his one arm, went to the British man-of-war Odin for a surgeon and for assistance. Nothing further was done with the crew that night. Next morning they were ordered to wash the decks, but refused to do any duty. They were reasoned with by their officers and by the officers of the Odin, who came on board, but still refused duty, and with the assistance of marines from the Odin they were put in irons. On the 3d of April, a Dutch man-of-war came up from Batavia and the men were mustered and again urged to return to their duty, but would not, even refusing to help got up the anchor.

There have been gala days, and funeral pageants, and military shows, and complimentary receptions, and triumphal processions that filled the streets with crowds of curious, wondering, sympathetic people, but never has there been developed such a universal, heart-felt, deep-rooted, genuine enthusiasm.

The awful solemnity of civil war came pressing home to our people who had sons and brothers and fathers just departing, perhaps never toreturn.

They are, accordingly, taking all necessary defensive measures, so as to render the chances of success sufficiently desperate to discourage the attempt. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company, besides supplying their vessels abundantly with small arms, including revolvers, muskets and cutlasses, and ammunition, each steamer will carry at least two heavy carronade or twelve-pound cannon. Instructions have also been dispatched some time since to thoroughly sheath the bows of each ship with iron, so as to enable them, without injury to themselves, to run down and sink any pirate or privateer which might attempt their capture. As they are all fast vessels, they would prove in this way most formidable in an encounter on the usually calm Pacific, where sailing vessels could not so well manage to escape.

In like manner we hear of numbers wailing and refusing to be comforted because the present exhibition is not as the others have been -- quite forgetting that all that may be very true, and yet a very wide margin indeed be left to give visitors their full two shillings' worth. It is only the most vulgar of minds which require that any given work or collection of art be everything or nothing. As regards the claim of this year's exhibition to patronage, we can only say that there is probably not one who reads us who has not scores of times paid the usual twenty-five cents to see one-twenty-fifth part of as much attractiveness, and yet departed perfectly satisfied. The real trouble is not so much the want of merit as the amiable admission of a heavy proportion of crude trash not worth the canvas which it covers. Here is the absurdity. Why fill six galleries with nearly six hundred pictures, when three hundred would have attracted more admiration? When we hear that numbers were actually refused a place among the scarecrow canaille of the latter three hundred, we tremble at the audacity which must inspire some of the white-washing candidates for a place in the temple of American art. Hanging Committees should remember that in this country their judgments involve great responsibility -- more than is determined by popular pen ""criticism,"" and inconceivably more than is established by the very fluctuating and unreliable standard of market rates.

The battle was for $100 aside. The seconds, referee and other necessary parties having been chosen, ""Time"" was called, and the men went at it. Upon the start, TOUGHEY, who is the tallest, but the lightest of the two, exhibited extraordinary skill, not only as a sparrer but as a tactician. His hits were well planned and most resolutely delivered. The superior strength and prowess of his adversary was however against him, and in every round TOUGHEY was thrown heavily on the board flooring. After fighting for one hour and a half the seconds of TOUGHEY gave in for him. The fight was what is termed a game one, and both men were badly battered.

There is, beyond all question, a very strong element of rebellion in Maryland and Baltimore. It embraces the whole of that immense body of vagabonds and lawless scoundrels who have kept that city in terror so long. The attack upon the Massachusetts troops was, in our opinion, the act of the mob, -- not the prearranged action of a party. The passions it aroused swept the city like a whirlwind, and the Union sentiment disappeared before it. But we do not consider this by any means decisive of the position which Maryland will finally assume in this great contest. We cannot believe that she will be so blind to her own interest as to plant herself in the path of the mighty North, rushing to the rescue of the Union. At present her attitude is that of rebellion. But she does not in the least diminish the certainty that the Union will be triumphant against rebellion. Her accession to the rebels, while it widens the field, narrows the issue.

All who adhere to the doctrines of JEFFERSON and his compeers, are fanatics with whom the South for the future desire neither part nor lot.

SNYDER, U.S.A., who was a passenger in the Baltic. Soon afterwards he started from the fort, having in his boat a hewitzer, with two boxes of ammunition and 16 boxes of rifle cartridges. The current was so strong that the heavy-laden boat could not make the ship, and was only brought up about five miles away from her by making an anchor of a box of rifle cartridges, and she drifted into shallow water, awaiting either a change of tide or succor from the Baltic. While lying there, two horsemen came down to the beach, and after surveying the boat for a few minutes, retired and retorted to a company of soldiers, who were concealed in the bushes at some distance from the beach. The horsemen returned in about half and hour, and riding into the water, flourishing their swords, hailed the boat and asked who she was and what was her business there. Lieut. SNYDER replied that it was a boat from the Baltic, with a howitzer and ammunition for that vessel. The horsemen rode off without further question, the word howitzer probably conveying the idea of sharper work than they were prepared to encounter, and Lieut. S. was unmolested during the remainder of the night.

""I am killed"" Witness called to Col. SHUTT, whom he recognized, standing on the rear platform of the train, to stop the cars, that there were murderers on board.

It is interesting, therefore, to know in what manner he explains the philosophy of secession, and reconciles the doctrine in any degree with the idea of organized and practical Government.

Sailed on Friday A.M. Has had strong southerly winds to the bar. After the secession of Virginia, the demonstrations of the Secessionists became so apparent that it was deemed of the greatest importance to get her out over the bar. Her crew of 25 men and officers had been at their quarters with shotted guns night and day for four days. Troops were drilling on the shore; signals between them were constantly made; large parties were around the ship to find out her assailable point. She had four anchors and seven chains out, when the order came at 7 A.M. to get her over the bar. The steamer Maryland, in Gen. BUTLER's charge, came alongside, one anchor was hove up, for use, all the other chains were slipped, and the ship started at 9 A.M., drawing 20 1/2 feet. There was then but 19 feet on the bar, and for some time it was doubtful if she would go, but by great exertion -- by lighting and careening her, she was forced over. The captain, pilot and engineers of the Maryland, which had been seized by Gen. BUTLER, were very averse to do their duty, and it was only by putting them under a guard with revolvers, that they would proceed with the vessel. After dragging her over the bar, the vessel grounded on the outer spit. About 10 P.M., information having been brought off shortly after that the channel outside the ship would be obstructed, kedges were laid out, and it was endeavored to warp the ship over the spit, part of the men being at the guns. The Maryland having been run aground by her officers during the warping, a squall came up and drove the ship ashore again. At daylight a steam tug from Havre de Grace came in sight and was taken to tow the ship out. She was then taken in tow by the R.R. Cuyler and brought to this port.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARRIVAL OF THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION.; ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-ONE MIDSHIPMEN ON BOARD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARRIVAL OF THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION.; ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-ONE MIDSHIPMEN ON BOARD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1a04dfdf-dcfd-56f8-84f8-fb3ed210a694,454,nyt://article/1a04dfdf-dcfd-56f8-84f8-fb3ed210a694

HAMILTON delivered, on Saturday, the second lecture of his course on Military Surgery, to a large number of physicians, surgeons and medical students. After describing a number of disqualification for active service, with the reasons for inefficiency in each case, the lecturer stated that from 25 to 50 per cent. of those persons who usually offer themselves as recruits ought to be rejected. An army, to be of use, ought to be composed of picked men. Hence a grave responsibility rested on the medical examiner. For the consequence of want of care and sound judgment on his part, would be to crowd prematurely the ambulances or army hospitals, to overwhelm with labor the Regimental Surgeons, and seriously to impair the effectiveness of the army in the field. Among the disabilities mentioned were hernia, strabismus, loss or maiming of certain fingers, and various injuries of the knee or foot. In regard to the effects of wounds, many interesting facts and principles were stated. Thus, while injury of the knee-joint often caused the loss of the limb, a dislocation of the thigh frequently left the man able to march as well as before. This was sometimes the case even where there was a shortening of the limb. The test was, did the man limp? It was not enough to measure the length of the two limbs. For it was notorious that while some men would limp if a leg was shortened half an inch, it required 1 1/2 inches shortening to produce limping in others. The difference probably arose in part from the ability conferred by nature on certain persons of lowering the pelvis and exercising more perfect control for the coordination of the parts, so as to compensate for the deficiency in the length of the leg; while this faculty of adaptation was not enjoyed to the same extent by others. The custom of the Indians was to turn their toes inward while walking, as experience had taught these children of Nature that swiftness and endurance in war or in hunting were thus obtained with the least expenditure of muscular force. Experience showed that those persons who were splay-footed were unable to walk long distances or to endure forced marches. It was also remarked that those who had the foot well arched, walked better than flat-footed persons; and that while by nature, the two arches of the foot were defective in some persons, there were habits, such for instance as that of dancing, which had a tendency to injure both these arches, and to impair the walking power of men to whom nature has given a well shaped foot. Many other interesting facts were pointed out and illustrated in an extremely lucid and felicitous manner. At the close of the lecture, specimens of shot and shell were exhibited, which had been supplied by Dr. GANESVOORT, of the United States Navy; also, various sedans for carrying the wounded from the field. A miniature model was also shown, of a temporary tent, which could be reared in a few moments, by the union of four knapsacks. Although the sun-shades thus extemporized, were black, and thus absorbed the rays of heat, still, as they were open at the ends, it was stated that they did not become so hot as might have been expected. On the contrary, they had been found, in practice, to afford a refreshing and grateful protection, even under a tropical sun.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY SURGERY AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY SURGERY AT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1861-04-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/75267910-3d38-5e70-8c15-972819e7eb1c,780,nyt://article/75267910-3d38-5e70-8c15-972819e7eb1c

After some appropriate remarks from Rev. A.D. SMITH, D.D., the address was read and purse presented. In course of the Pastor's response, he referred in very eloquent terms to the present important and all-absorbing crisis on the country. He liked the American character, admired the American institutions, loved the Government of the United States, and honored the Star Spangled Banner of the Union. He said that silence now was a crime. He was conscious of the sacredness of the place they met. He felt he was in the immediate presence of the Great Arbiter of all human affairs; that he would take his stand by the sacred altar of his sanctuary-place, his hand on his Divinely-inspired Book, and most solemnly swear unflinching allegiance to the Union, Constitution and flag of the United States.

[Immense applause.] He would now appeal to his Welsh brethren, whether they would defend that flag at the hazard of their life. ""Ah!"" said he, ""it is a thousand shames that men who had been bred and born under the protection of the flag should precipitately insult it, while adopted citizens are willing and ready to lay down their life in its defence.
