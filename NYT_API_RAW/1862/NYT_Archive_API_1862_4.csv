Editorial on US credit standing in London market; Editorial comments on US credit standing in London market,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/01/archives/our-credit-in-london.html,Editorial on US credit standing in London market; Editorial comments on US credit standing in London market,"The mail received on Sunday evening from England to the 19th of March, reports continued firmness in the London market for American Stocks. This fact speaks well for the due appreciation of our recent successes in the field and our financial measures in Congress, by the people of England. Their real opinion ofthe situation on this side appears to be better reflected from their principal Stock Exchange than by their leading journal. The latter continues persistent and most unfair in its representations of both the military and financial news from this side. While the record of what is actually occurring in the field and in the money market of the United States is not suppressed, the practical end to which it points is utterly ignored and the facts themselves perverted. Thus, in the London Times, of March 19, now before us, we have a labored effort to show that the fall in the price of Gold in New-York in exchange for United States Notes is a bad sign for the future of our credit, and the stability of our National Currency. Gold, it is argued, fell on the passage of the Treasury bill, because the United States Notes of the existing issue rose in value on their recognition as a medium for the payment of Customs! Of course, this is a gross perversion of the facts communicated from this side. Gold did not fall in exchange for United States Notes alone, but in exchange for the current bank credits, in the shape of deposits and bank notes of the City of New-York, the very best standard in the whole country, because representing the commercial and financial centre of the country. There was no account taken of what might thereafter be wanted at the Custom-house for the payment of duties. The question was one of the supply and demand of gold at the time; influenced, to be sure, to some extent, by the brilliant successes of the Government in dwarfing the proportions of the Southern rebellion. The fall in gold was not temporary, as we have since been. On the contrary, the price has continued to go down, until a minimum next to a nominal premium over the ordinary currency of New-York, has been reached.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Credit in London.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Credit in London.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0056cdd8-5471-5773-b1c7-5c5295132731,887,nyt://article/0056cdd8-5471-5773-b1c7-5c5295132731

Editorial on Jackson campaign in northern Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/01/archives/jacksons-campaign-in-northern-virginia.html,Editorial on Jackson campaign in northern Virginia," -- The column of the rebel Gen. JACKSON, which has just been routed at Winchester, chased from Strasburgh, and is now probably plodding its weary, way through the mountains, and up the Shenandoah Valley for Stanton, was, as Gen. SHIELDS says, considered the bravest and best-disciplined corps in the rebel army. It was composed of men who had been in the very hardest service ever since the war opened; and, for its supposed invincible qualities was known as the ""Stone Wall Brigade."" The rebel papers have given it credit, too, for a continuous series of quite wonderful victories. At the beginning of lostWinter, JACKSON was put in command of Northern Virginia, and he was ordered to drive the National troops from that part of Virginia between Harper's Ferry and the western line of Maryland, and to destroy whatever had been rebuilt of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was then guarded by the troops of Gen. BANKS. With a force estimated at 6,000 strong, JACKSON set out from Strasburgh last December, advanced rapidly to Winchester, and thence toward Martinsburgh, destroying the Baltimore and Ohio Road, tearing up the rails and using them to finish the line between Winchester and Strasburgh. In the beginning of January he advanced toward Bath, in Morgan County, where were two National regiments and a force of cavalry and artillery, supported by two other regiments at Hancock, ten miles north. Our troops at Bath were driven across the Potomac, and a number of them taken prisoners. Ho then advanced to Hancock, sent notice to the Mayor that he intended to cross at that point, and began shelling the town. He next moved upon Romney, and our troops stationed there retreated north to Cumberland. Having thus cleared that entire section of the National forces, he returned to Strasburgh, but in February again occupied Romney, from which he was driven by Gen. LANDER. From Strasburgh he advanced once more to Winchester, and of late has been flitting between these two points, and occasionally approaching well up to the Potomac. When he saw his best line of retreat cut off by our occupancy of Manassas, and found Gen. BANKS' corps d'armce advancing in force against him, he began to move up the Shenandoah Valley; but, imagining that BANKS' army had nearly all gone to Manassas, he again came up a fortnight ago to his old ground at Winchester, where his forces were suddenly attacked and routed by Gen. SHIELDS, on the 23d ult., and subsequently chased up to and beyond Strasburgh. The official reports indicate that his original force had been more than doubled by reinforcements from the main rebel body. As his column seems to have been terribly cut up, and the remnant has retreated from Northern Virginia, we will not be likely to hear any more of this audacious rebel in this quarter. Gen. JACKSON is a Virginian and a West Point soldier, and his troops are mostly Virginia mountaineers, with regiments from the far Southern States. He has been a terrible scourge to the section over which JEFF. DAVIS gave him command; but his defeat and retreat clears the mountain region of armed rebels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""JACKSON'S CAMPAIGN IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""JACKSON'S CAMPAIGN IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ab7626e-216f-596d-a92c-110c1d6f1fdc,528,nyt://article/2ab7626e-216f-596d-a92c-110c1d6f1fdc

The cold glitter of fashionable life, as reflected in Mr. BOUROICAULT'S comedy of ""Old Heads and Young Hearts,"" may well leave the mind in doubt as to whether civilization has benefitted the upper circles of English society in the same ratio that it has dropped gentleness into the hearts of the ruder classes. Whether, in fact, there is not a limit to the refining process. The characters portrayed by the author are prodigiously polished, but it is by the process of rubbing against something as hard as themselves. Their conversation has the fitful sparkle of the firefly, and it scattered with as little purpose. Politeness becomes not only a duty, but a ceremony; and yet in its stony-heartedness, it is worse than barbaric. Fortunately, for the sake of the emotional interest of an otherwise almost intellectual play, Mr. BOURCICAULT has preserved some freshness of feeling in his female characters, and has been peculiarly happy in the delineation of an aged minister -- Jesse Rural -- whose snowy pow is the warmest and most lovable object in the play. Amid the clash of conversational weapons, words of tenderness and simplicity are dropped by these characters, and hence that happy mixture of dialogue which delights the listener. The plot is one of Mr. BOURCICAULT's best, and the construction almost faultless. The distribution last evening was admirable, and we hardly know on whom to bestow the most praise. Mr. BLAKE merited the call before the curtain, which he received at the end of the second act: his performance of Jesse Rural is, without doubt, his best effort. Mrs. HOEY was delightfully vivacious as the widow. Miss GANNON all that could be desired as Miss Rocket, and Messrs. FISHER, SMITH, YOUNG and FLOYD merited the heartiest approval. The comedy has been finely mounted and was a complete success.

Three weeks ago the gratified oi polloi sat down to its daily battle and victory with the same calm confidence as to its matutinal roll and tea, and grew restive when the morning paper had no narrative of fresh successes, and no fatal catalogue of killed and wounded, So blunted, indeed, had the popular sensibilities become under the influence of a martial satiety, that popular enthusiasm failed utterly of any response to the stirring bulletin, and the stock market sank, as if battles won were National calamities. Such was the law of that particular period. It does not apply at present. For nearly a fortnight there has been recorded no fresh and splendid success. Bulletin-boards have been blanks; the Herald has confined its sensation headings within three-fourths of a column. ""We have grown used to the tranquil aspects of a campaign. Without a victory, the stock market moves steadily upward. The language of the street and the table is cheerful, assured, buoyant. A settled confidence in the result of the war, and a conviction that the end will be reached before the fading of Summer, are in the minds of everybody, and give tone to public feeling.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Public Confidence and the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Public Confidence and the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/42bb681e-53bb-55a3-be97-cc131818edd2,708,nyt://article/42bb681e-53bb-55a3-be97-cc131818edd2
editorial on British interpretation of maritime laws in regard to privateering as debated in Parliament,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/02/archives/england-and-the-law-of-the-seas.html,editorial on British interpretation of maritime laws in regard to privateering as debated in Parliament,"If calmly to bear calumny be one of the most difficult trials which either an individual or a nation can be called upon to undergo, there is a proportionate reward when Time, bringing round his revenges, brushes away the falsehood and blazons the truth. The UnitedStates have long been taunted with having refused to accede to that part of the Treaty of Paris, of 1858. whereby the maritime Power of Europe declared that privateering should be abolished, and that the neutral flag should cover the enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband of war. But it has not been convenient for those who have delighted to cast opprobrium upon us for not giving in our adhesion to these doctrines, to remember the ground on which our Government based its refusal. While lustily charging us with holding on to a remnant of barbarism in maritime war fare, they have been very careful to keep in the extreme background the fact that the United States Government declined giving its adhesion to the doctrines of the Paris Conference, not because they went too far, but because they did not go far enough. We were quite willing in 1856 to agree both that privateering should be abolished, and that neutral goods (with the exception of contraband of war) should be exempt from capture under an enemy's flag, but only on condition that the exemption should be extended to the ship as well as to its cargo. We desired, in fact, to carry the law to its legitimate conclusion by making all private properly free from capture at [???]; and declared that any other doctrine would be but a temporary makeshift, not a permanent and efficacious principle.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and the Law of the Seas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and the Law of the Seas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/45776a8e-9622-5d7c-af50-e098fe112a81,1276,nyt://article/45776a8e-9622-5d7c-af50-e098fe112a81

The praises bestowed upon the Turkish bath by the British soldiers, on their return from the Crimean campaign, have led to the formation of a Turkish Bath Company in London, with a capital of half a million dollars, and the result is said to have been entirely successful, both in a pecuniary, popular and sanitary point of view. We have received the prospectus of a similar Company about being organized here, though with a much smaller capital, and from the names of the parties engaged in the enterprise, we have no doubt that it will meet with equal success. Among the Board of Directors are: Dr. Valentine Mott, Wm. C. Bryant, Ex-Mayor Tiemann, Charles King, C. Godfrey Gunther, A.W. Bradford, and others of not less note.

Legal decision made in dispute over property he gave late granddaughter M A Ward at time of her marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/02/archives/postnuptial-settlement-by-john-jacob-astor-on-his.html,Legal decision made in dispute over property he gave late granddaughter M A Ward at time of her marriage,"Francis Morris vs. Margaret Astor Ward.-- The question in this case (which was stated in the TIMES of Feb. 10, when decision was reserved) was whether Samuel Ward took by descent from his son, William Samuel Ward, an estate in fee simple in certain lots at the foot of Fourteenth-street in this City, or only an estate for life. The property was settled by John Jacob Astor upon his grand-daughter, Emily Astor, (daughter of William B. Astor,) a few days after her marriage with Samuel Ward. The deed of settlement declared the consideration to be one dollar and natural love and affection. The lots in question were settled upon Mrs. Ward for her life, with remainder to her issue, in fee. Mrs. Ward died in 1841, leaving two children, Margaret Astor Ward and William Samuel Ward. The latter died shortly after his mother, and the question was, what estate did his father take in the son's moiety of the lands. It appeared that Samuel Ward, upon the death of his son, assumed only to take an estate for life in the lots. During his absence in California, his daughter brought an action against him, and caused the estate to be sold to pay the father's share of taxes, and other expenses incident to the lots. She was a minor at the time, and her grand-father. Wm. R. Astor, who was her guardian, conducted the suit on her behalf. The title of Mr. Ward appeared to have been vested normally in Mrs. Mary Griffin, who was also made a defendant in the suit. Morris became the purchaser under the judgment, and afterward, for the benefit of Ward, procured a conveyance from Mrs. Griffin of whatever estate she might hold for the life of Samuel Ward, which was sold under the judicial proceedings. Being thus invested with the claim, he asked for a decree that he was certified of the simple, and not merely for the life of Ward.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Post-Nuptial Settlement by John Jacob Astor on His Grand-daughter--Marriage, as a ""Valuable Consideration.""; SUPREME COURT--GENERAL TERM Before Justices Ingraham, Clerke and Leonard.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Post-Nuptial Settlement by John Jacob Astor on His Grand-daughter--Marriage, as a ""Valuable Consideration.""; SUPREME COURT--GENERAL TERM Before Justices Ingraham, Clerke and Leonard.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b9e62e2-e8fa-59a0-8952-9d444df092f3,1226,nyt://article/6b9e62e2-e8fa-59a0-8952-9d444df092f3

Editorial on Yancey speech in New Orleans,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/02/archives/yancey-as-a-union-missionary.html,Editorial on Yancey speech in New Orleans,"If Ms. YANCEY has really been delivering at New Orleans the speech which comes to us through the Southwestern papers, it may well be a subject of congratulation that he was not captured by the way. The sentiments which he is reported to have uttered in a public address in the Crescent City, are at once so true, so little like what an adroit Southern politician would be apt to say, and so much like what might be falsely put into his mouth, that we we were at first disposed, on internal evidence, to doubt that any such speech had been made. The fact of his non-capture, however, and the detailed report of the speech which comes to us through an Alabama paper, would seem fully to credit it; and if YANCEY continues the character in which he has made his first appearance since his return from his diplomatic mission, we may account him a most efficient auxiliary of the Union cause. Mr. YANCEY returns from Europe ""a wiser and a sadder man"" and tells his fellow rebels more wholesome truths that they have probably ever heard before. The ex-Ambassador of Half-Moon-street frankly tells them that it is his deliberate opinion that the South has no friends in Europe; that there is, in fact, a strong prejudice against the South because of its peculiar institution; that there are many persons in Europe who consider the Southern people semi-civilized, and believe that negroes are raised upon the same plan that stock is; and finally, that for any good the rebel commissioners now in England and France can accomplish in the way of obtaining European intervention, they might just as well be immediately recalled.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'YANCEY AS A UNION MISSIONARY.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'YANCEY AS A UNION MISSIONARY.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f1d2d9a2-ff33-5b13-917c-1a5c821657fb,399,nyt://article/f1d2d9a2-ff33-5b13-917c-1a5c821657fb

It is grown only on the sea-coast of the States of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and the line of its growth extends from John's Island, just south of Charleston, to Amelia Island, Florida. John's, Island we do not yet possess, though it is deserted by its civilian inhabitants, both white and black. The island at the other end of the chain, Amelia Island, is that upon which is situated Fernandina and Fort Clinch, which were taken possession of by Commodore DUPONT two or three weeks ago. Thesea islands between these extremes which are not yet occupied by our troops, are all deserted and desolate. From the adjacent shores of the mainland, and on the tide-laved banks of the streams, also, where this valuable species of the cotton plant is grown, the whites have fled, and the slaves have been driven inland. So that the whole of the sea island supply this year from the American market will be what may be raised by the South Carolina negroes, who have now begun the experiment of planting under Government superintendence. The average annual crop of late years is about 50,000 bales (300 pounds to the bale;) but there will probably not be a tithe of that quantity raised upon the whole Southern coast this year.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SEA ISLAND COTTON.

The Circulation is now limited to $150,000,000. The lowest denomination will be five dollars; the highest, one thousand dollars. The Deposits are limited to $50,000,000, and the interest to be allowed thereon to five per cent, per annum. Deposits are authorized at all the Sub-Treasuries, but is in the case of the ordinary negotiations of the Government, the greater portion of the fifty millions will be placed on deposit here. The Associated Banks of New-York alone have resolved to use the office here to the extent of twenty millions, for the convenience of creating an interest-bearing medium wherewith to make their daily settlements with each other at the Clearing-house. When the Government and the Banks, at the end of the war, resume payments in specie, the redemption of United States Notes will no doubt be almost altogether at New-York. The revenues from Customs are already collected to the extent of 70 or 75 per cent. at this point. The collections from the excise and import tax bill now being perfected by Congress, will probably, for the convenience of the Treasury Department, be directed to New-York for disbursement. A liberal additional allowance has been voted by Congress for the support of the New-York Office, in view of its greatly increased business, and the present Custom-house, at the corner of Wall and Nassau streets, has been assigned to the Sub-Treasury after May next, when the Custom-house officers will remove to the Merchants' Exchange building. The alterations of the present Custom-house to suit the new and important purpose, to which it is to be devoted, are now being ordered, and the probability is the interior of the building will be made one of the most commodious, as it will be the largest, banking-room in the country.

One of the pictures is in the Rotunda at Washington; the other, a magnificent historical portrait of the General at Chepultepec, some nine by twelve in size, is at the rooms of the Chamber of Commerce, where it will be seen by the members to-day. It is proposed by the merchants of New-York to purchase this portrait for a purpose that will undoubtedly meet with the enthusiastic cooperation of all our citizens.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

"Editorial on Confederate practice of mounting wooden ""Quaker guns"" in place of real ones to camouflage their retreats from entrenchments",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/03/archives/quaker-guns-much-ado-is-made-about.html,"Editorial on Confederate practice of mounting wooden ""Quaker guns"" in place of real ones to camouflage their retreats from entrenchments","certain Quaker guns which were found in position at Centreville, after its evacuation by the rebels, and which are held up as proof-positive of the cowardice or inefficiency of Gen. MCCLELLAN. This view can be honestly taken only on the assumption that the works at Centreville were never mounted with any other than Quaker guns -- a conclusion which could be arrived at only by those who are entirely ignorant of the arts and practices of war. For this device of Quaker guns is one constantly and successfully used by commanders who intend to retreat from forts or entrenchments. Next to his men, an officer's first care is his artillery. But to remove his guns in sight of the enemy would be to notify him in the quickest and most unmistakable manner of the intended evacuation. So his pickets are strengthened, and even pushed forward, as if for an advance, then in the night the guns are removed, and wooden ones of similar size and appearance, so like as to make detection even with a glass impossible, are substituted for the real Simon Pures. Daylight manifests no change in the apparent strength of the works; the bulk of the troops move off by daylight; and when the next night comes, the pickets withdraw suddenly, and run for it. There is obviously no protection against this trick, except a nightly driving in of pickets, and reconnaissance in force in the dark, which is generally more harrassing to those who undertake it than to the enemy, and in rarely productive of much good. The supposition that, because the rebels left only Quaker guns behind them, they took none of ""the world's"" guns with them, makes it plain that they did not use up all the wood in the world in making sham artillery.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'QUAKER GUNS.

So much did the opening paragraphs of this message yield, that many of our people here were even disposed, on its first publication, to doubt the genuineness of the document.

As this port has no defences but a few carthworks thrown up by its inhabitants, it can offer no very prolonged resistance, and has probably already succumbed to the long ranges of National guns, and fallen into the hands of our soldiers. The capture of this town, in its relation to the supply of cotton, is one of the most important movements which has yet been made upon the Southern Coast. Nothing but the paramount interests of the war could have hitherto closed the eyes of our military leaders to the commercial importance of this port. It was said by travelers returning from Appalachicola early last Fall, that there were more than ten thousand bales of cotton lying upon the wharves of this town, and that in spite of every exertion the stock was constantly increasing. But the significant circumstance connected with this supply, and which is now of especial importance, is that it is not brought, as is the case with both Charleston and Savannah, by the precarious agency of railroads from planting sections situated at great distances in the interior. Here the town is connected with the plantations by water. The Appalachicola River, with its two branches, the Chattahooche and Flint, running far back into the country, unites this port to some of the best cotton lands of Georgia.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Cotton Port Upon the Gulf.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Cotton Port Upon the Gulf.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3972188f-0efb-51c5-9d11-19b7612d7745,702,nyt://article/3972188f-0efb-51c5-9d11-19b7612d7745

"The siege of Island No. Ten looks as though it might last as long as the siege of Troy or of Sebastopol. The correspondents who went there expecting excitement and glory, complain that they suffer horribly from ennui, and that their time is spent in yawning and wishing it was the next day. They can find nothing to write about, and half of them, including our own, are leaving in disgust, in order to find more exciting operations than a bombardment.

To relieve the tedium, and as a reminder to the enemy of what they formerly experienced, and may soon again look for, he has just planned and carried out, and this morning reports, one of the neatest little dashes of the war. He fitted out and armed five small boats, manned them each with twenty river marines, and dispatched them down the river on an expedition to the rebel isle. The work assigned them was to spike the guns of the main rebel battery on the island. At midnight the boats reached the upper fort on No. Ten, and, pulling directly in its face and in the face of the astounded and terrified rebel troops, they gallantly landed and spiked the six guns mounted in the fort, and returned with the boats uninjured. The Commodore characterizes the conduct of his men as cool and determined, but says they are ready to perform still more hazardous service. If the gallant hundred sailors had taken prisoner the whole rebel force on the island, the action would have been complete. We have no doubt they would have done so had they had rope enough to bind them.

"GEORGE W. BLUNT, Esq., whose right to speak on maritime matters will not be called in question, sends us a communication, which we publish elsewhere, defending the Navy Department against the plentious censure it has received for allowing the escape of the Nashville. He is quite correct in claiming that no blockade can be perfect in the absolute meaning of the term, and as the chief maritime Powers have acknowledged that the blockade of the Southern ports is effective in the international sense, there is no need of discussion on that head. We well understand that any blame which can rightly be cast on Secretary WELLES' administrationof the Department committed to his care must be relative; and in regard to the escape of the Nashville, Mr. BLUNT's explanation of the failure to stop her is one that is satisfactory, or not, in proportion as we confine our investigation to the means at the disposal of the Department for the moment, or extend it to the inquiry whether ampler measures should not have been secured in advance. Undoubtedly all that Mr. BLUNT tells us of the activity of the Department on the receipt of the intelligence of the presence of the Nashville at Beaufort is quite correct. Telegrams were sent flying in every direction -- here for a gunboat which is on its trial trip, there for a second which was not quite ready, and elsewhere for vessels that were on the stocks. No doubt there was zeal and energy enough in the specific directions in which they were exercised, but this does not quite cover the case. The truth of the matter is, that the Department had no vessel at its disposal for this extra service.

"History has failed to record the largest ""run"" made by CALIGULA, who is said to have played billiards; or to mention whether CATULLUS ""scratched"" in his nervous anxiety to get the better of his opponent. In an emergency, like the present, it would be gratifying to the reporter to draw a comparison between the ancients and the moderns to the disadvantage of the former, and the glorification of the four-ball game. Under any circumstances we can afford to pooh pooh the Romans, for the four-ball game is certainly an invention of the Western World. The Crusaders -- those tremendous heroes who turn up on every possible occasion, and swagger through the middle ages as if they (the ages) belonged to them -- cut their lances into cues, and became billiard sharpers when all else failed. A billiard-room must have been a pleasing sight in those days, with its suits of armor hanging on pegs, and its overwhelming odor of stable. The conversation of the players dashed with the chivalric oaths, which were then in vogue, must also have added a charm to the entertainment. Well might the proprietor tremble when an rate knight sulkily twisted a link from his chain to pay the shot, and after kicking the marker, stalked into the street seeking whom in the shape of a Jew he might devour. The Jews, as far as we have been able to learn, were never greatly attached to the game, although it is said to have come from the East. The circumstance is remarkable, when it is remembered that there are no fewer than six pockets in a billiard table, and that something is put in all of them during a good game, and frequently with two others that are not attached to the mahogany. The monks and priests, it it said, picked up the game, as they did many other things, and preserved it for the present generation. It is now one of the leading amusements of City life, and may fairly claim to afford more exercise to the young men of New-York than any other recreation. Our forefathers played bowls and smoked long pipes; our sward is as green as theirs but it is made of cloth, and instead of pipes we eat one end of a cigar and burn the other.

"Every glimpse that we get of the movements of rebel troops confirms the likelihood of the theory broached in these columns a fortnight ago -- that the rebels do not propose to seriously defend the many threatened points in the vast territory nominally in their hands, but that their design is to concentrate from all quarters all available troops on a new defensive line, stretching from some point on this side of the mountains across to Chattanooga, and along the line of the railroad, by Decatur and Corinth, to Memphis, and there, in mass, give battle to the National army. This is a line not likely soon to be reached by us from the South; and, if they mean to make a serious effort for success at all, it is the best strategic base upon which they can plant themselves to stop our columns advancing from the North. Not only are the troops whose duty it has been to guard the menaced cities and strongholds of the Gulf Coast, as Pensacola and New-Orleans, hastening forward to the western positions on this line -- not only have the divisions of the rebel Generals, SMITH and EVANS, been moved hither from Eastern Virginia, but the armies of PRICE and VAN DORN have been ordered to the same field from the far-away regions of Northwestern Arkansas; and from the peninsula of Florida, and from Georgia also, every available regiment has been forwarded north to swell the new line.

Editorial on Doctrine's principles; editorial on British intervention and on principles of Monroe Doctrine,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/05/archives/crampton-on-the-monroe-doctrine.html,Editorial on Doctrine's principles; editorial on British intervention and on principles of Monroe Doctrine,"It appears from the British Blue-Book on Mexican affairs, that Sir J. CRAMPTON, of contraband-enlistment notoriety, has again become ambitions of the attentions of the Press. The gentleman, who now represents England at the Court of Madrid, has a second time overstepped the limits of his authority, having assured Marshal O'DONNELL, during one of thier conversations touching intervention in Mexico, that ""Her Majesty's Government could never recognize what was commonly called the 'Monroe Doctrine.'"" This piece of information was, of course, communicated to the Spanish Premier to encourage him in his designs against, the land of MONTEZUMA, though the special business of Sir J. CRAMPTON, at the time, was to impress on the mind of said Minister that the British Government could give no countenance to schemes of aggression or conquest. The distinguished diplomat, however, had an old score to reckon with us, and the opportunity was so favorable that he could not refrain from exhibiting his spleen by having a fling at the doctrine in question. But why had he the audacity to do so in the name of ""Her Majesty's Government""? Most certainly he had no instructions, no authority from Lord RUSSELL, to make any such avowal. The object of the British, Foreign Secretary, then, in fact, was rather to sustain the Monroe Doctrine than to profess enmity to it. Nor, even were that not their object, can we perceive they should proscribe a doctrine really so equitable. The ""Monroe Doctrine"" has been much misunderstood. It is a shield, not a sword. Its aim is protection, not aggression. ""With the existing colonies, or dependencies of any European Power,"" says its author, ""we have not interfered, and shall not interfere. But, with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great consideration, and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European Power, in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States."" There is the ""Monroe Doctrine"" literally, and what is there in it which could prevent its acceptance and recognition by the British Government ? It does not call in question the right of that or any other European Government, to exercise supremacy over its possessions in the Western World, but merely declares that the United States will regard with repugnance the intervention of a transatlantic Power in the internal affairs of any independent American community, with a view to overthrow their liberties, or Republican institutions. This declaration, which has given such needless offence to the Governments of Europe, was in fact elicited by their own acts. One of the avowed objects of the ""Holy Alliance"" was the conversion of the Spanish-Amoricnn Republics into monarchies, and if was against the aggression contemplated by the despois who were parties to that alliance, that the ""Monroe Doctrine"" was originally directed. In a word, if was a protest, on the part of the United States Government, against any such outrage then, or in the future -- a protest which, so far from beingdistasteful to the British Minister of the day, actually embodied his sentiment, and received his support. Now, a doctrine which so illustrious a man and so eminent a statesman as CANNING sustained, neither PALMERSTON nor RUSSELL need blush to sanction. Its open recognition and faithful observance by the British Government are, in truth, the best guarantee for England's secure possession of her American dependencies. As long as the monarchies of Europe manifest a decent respect for the rights and institutions of our American democracies, there is no danger of any attempt being made by the Republics of the Western Hemisphere to capel foreign Powers [???] its shores: but it once a systematic design of aggression on the liberties of the States of this Continent is betrayed by Europeans, and it becomes evident that the toleration of their supremacy over any portion of America is incompatible with the safety of the popular Governments, then it may be predicated that the downfall of that supremacy is at hand. The Monroe doctrine is, therefore, the Magna Charta by which the Powers of Europe hold their cisatlantic possessions, and whether their tenure of said possessions be long or short, must depend altogether on their mode of observing this much vilified doctrine.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Crampton on the Monroe Doctrine.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Crampton on the Monroe Doctrine.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3f868ffb-78b5-5238-a7e7-621a449f6847,731,nyt://article/3f868ffb-78b5-5238-a7e7-621a449f6847

NY Custom House activities described,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/05/archives/customhouse-affairs-business-of-the-month-of-marchactivity-in-all.html,NY Custom House activities described,"The month of March has been an unusually busy one at the New-York Custom-house. In times of peace the monthly receipts rarely exceeded those of the past month. Every department has been overrun with business, and the undivided attention of the clerks employed has been necessary to give satisfaction to importers and others doing business at the Custom-house. The large sum of money received for duties, during the month, has been derived, in great measure, from articles on which Congress has levied very high rates of duties. Notwithstanding the large sums required of importers of certain classes of goods, they have not ceased to import, and, in fact, have scarcely diminished the quantity which they usually bring to this country. The war and the high rates of duty seem to have had but little effect on the consumption of such articles as tea, coffee and sugar, which are imported to an extent that many persons would not suspect. The importation of dry goods, too, which has been for some months past considerably inferior to that of other years, has revived, and every steamer from England, France and Germany brings large cargoes of this kind of merchandise. The number of steamers arriving during the month of March, with cargoes of dry goods and general merchandise, has been large. A change is noticeable in the kind and quality of the dry goods imported, as compared with those imported in other years. They are, to the credit of our people, of a more useful and substantial character than usual. Such articles as laces and embroideries are not imported to near as great an extent as has been customary, and those which have been imported, in almost every case, have been taken from the vessel in which imported immediately on its arrival; but few entries of such goods are made for warehouse. Those which had been placed in bond before the troubles of the nation caused a diminished importation, have been withdrawn and thrown in the market. The same diminution may also be seen in the importation of foreign silks. A greater change is manifest in the importation of this article than in that of any other class of dry goods. The large silk houses which heretofore were enabled, by the demand for their goods, to bring hither very large and valuable invoices, seem to have contracted their business very much in consequence of the state of the country. But few silks now find entry on the warehouse books, the importation being only sufficient to meet the current demand, owners and consignees being unwilling to take the risk of having large invoices left on hand without a demand therefor. When the high and complicated rates of duty now required were first levied on cotton goods, it was thought that the importation of the latter would almost cease; that the rates of duty were, to use a favorite expression of our law-makers, ""prohibitory."" When the act first went into effect, but few cottons, comparatively, were imported, but of late more have been brought to this port. Woolen goods, and those composed partly of wool and cotton, are now imported in considerable quantities. The ladies will have their delaines and worsted goods from abroad whether peace reigns or war rages.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CUSTOM-HOUSE AFFAIRS.; Business of the Month of March?Activity in all Departments?Large Receipts for Duties?Comparative Statements of the Business this Year and in 1860 and 1861?The Quarter's Work?The Importation of Dry Goods?The Amount of Money Realized from Tea, Coffee and Sugar?HeavyExports?Notice from Collector Barney."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""CUSTOM-HOUSE AFFAIRS.; Business of the Month of March?Activity in all Departments?Large Receipts for Duties?Comparative Statements of the Business this Year and in 1860 and 1861?The Quarter's Work?The Importation of Dry Goods?The Amount of Money Realized from Tea, Coffee and Sugar?HeavyExports?Notice from Collector Barney."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9027fa4b-452b-5ebb-927e-2b0e39550808,1872,nyt://article/9027fa4b-452b-5ebb-927e-2b0e39550808

"just a month to-day since the Merrimac made her renowned raid on the fleet in Hampton Roads. Each day has brought its bulletin advising us of the quiescence of the marine monster, and the announcement has grown almost as stereotyped as ""All is quiet on the Potomac."" This delay of a whole month in renewing the attack is only susceptible of two interpretations, either the Merrimac was really so seriously damaged in the encounter as to require all this time to put her in repairs, or else the Norfolk rebels are aware of the ample preparations that have been made to meet and destroy her, and are afraid to venture a renewal of the experiment. We are disposed to think the latter the more likely. These preparations can hardly have been concealed from them, and they are probably far from fancying the outlook of things in the vicinity of Fortress Monroe. Though the nature and extent of the force the Merrimac would have to encounter if she should venture out have been withheld from publication, enough is already known to remove from the public mind all fears of trouble from her, and inspire perfect confidence that her destruction will be accomplished as surely as she appears. And this confidence would be further strengthened should we disclose the additional preparations that have been made since we last made note of this matter. The foreign vessels-of-war which are reported to have ""taken a front seat in the Roads,"" for the purpose of viewing the anticipated spectacle, will, we think, therefore, be disappointed. Unless the rebels are willing to make a desperate throw, and let the Merrimac come out, with the certainty of being sunk, satisfied to let her do what damage she can in the meantime, she will not again venture on the rampage.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/05/archives/the-monitor-and-merrimac-it-is-now.html,,"just a month to-day since the Merrimac made her renowned raid on the fleet in Hampton Roads.

This delay of a whole month in renewing the attack is only susceptible of two interpretations, either the Merrimac was really so seriously damaged in the encounter as to require all this time to put her in repairs, or else the Norfolk rebels are aware of the ample preparations that have been made to meet and destroy her, and are afraid to venture a renewal of the experiment. We are disposed to think the latter the more likely. These preparations can hardly have been concealed from them, and they are probably far from fancying the outlook of things in the vicinity of Fortress Monroe. Though the nature and extent of the force the Merrimac would have to encounter if she should venture out have been withheld from publication, enough is already known to remove from the public mind all fears of trouble from her, and inspire perfect confidence that her destruction will be accomplished as surely as she appears. And this confidence would be further strengthened should we disclose the additional preparations that have been made since we last made note of this matter. The foreign vessels-of-war which are reported to have ""taken a front seat in the Roads,"" for the purpose of viewing the anticipated spectacle, will, we think, therefore, be disappointed. Unless the rebels are willing to make a desperate throw, and let the Merrimac come out, with the certainty of being sunk, satisfied to let her do what damage she can in the meantime, she will not again venture on the rampage.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC.

"On Saturday evening, the 29th of March, a young man called upon the pastor [???] of our principal uptown churches, and represented himself as a thorough Union man, who had recently escaped, with his wife and the small children, from the town of Corinth, Miss. He stated what he and his family had endured hardships and sufferings of the most unheard of nature, and that he was entirely destitute. He alleged that his young wife, who had come on with him to this City, was then laboring under blindness and partial insanity, in consequence of the barbarities practice upon her and her children. The reverend general (Dr. [???]) to whom this army was told, felt that if the case was a genuine one the parties were deserving of aid. Several benevolent people were at once enlisted in the cause. Steps were taken to pay the hotel bill, and the young stranger and his wife were urgently pressed to take up their abode at the residence of one of the wealthy members of the church, which invitation was accepted the same evening. Throughout the next day (Sunday) the guest were treated in the most kindly manner. In the afternoon he delivered an address to the congregation of one of the churches in the City, in which he described his hardships and sufferings during his residence to ""Dixie's land,"" in substantially the following language: His name, he said, was R.C. HALL. He was a native of Mississippi, and has resided in Corinth, in that State, since the war broke out until a few days ago. One day a squad of armed rebels entered his house and demanded his money. He told them he was a minister of the gospel, and that gospel was one of peace. His wife told them they had no money. One of the party, not believing what was told them, then suggested that the money might be hidden in the clothes of the baby, which the nurse held in her arms. ""Let's look,"" said one of them and not finding any such deposit, another said, ""Let's kill the dammed Union brat,"" and with one stroke of the butt and of his musket, dashed its brains out.

"ARREST OF COUNTERFEITERS OF UNITED STATES Coin. -- Sergeant CROFT and Officer Fox of the Second Precinct Police, have succeeded recently in breaking up one of the most formidable gangs of counterfeiters of United States coin that has been known to exist in this city. For months past, New-York and Brooklyn has been flooded with counterfeit fifty cent pieces, quarters and dimes, so well executed that when first issued, even experts, unless their attention was specially called to the coin, were likely to be deceived.The police have for weeks past been on the lookout for the manufacturers of this coin, but it was not until Thursday last that any definite information was obtained as to their whereabouts. On Thursday the officers above named arrested two men, who subsequently gave their names, ANDREAS HENRIQUES and MICHAEL CHEREMANTI, and upon examining the apartments occupied by them at No. 217 Gold-street, they found dies and all other necessary implements and (materials for the successful manufacture of counterfeit United States silver coin, and also a quantity of coin in every stage of its manufacture. When HENRIQUES was arrested,he attempted to throw a way a handful of coin, but was detected in the act and the ""contraband"" was taken from a gutter, where he had throw it. The officers, surmising that these men had associates in their crime, continued their search, and succeeded on Friday night in arresting, in the upper part of New-York, two men supposed to be accomplices. The accused were brought before Justice PERRY yesterday, when, after a partial examination, VALERIO LAZARETTO was dischared upon his own recognizance, there not appearing evidence enough to hold him. FRANCISCO BEDINI, the other accomplice, was committed with the first two named, to await an examination. CHEREMANTI, when arraigned, pleaded guilty to the charge of counterfeiting United States coin.

For months past, New-York and Brooklyn has been flooded with counterfeit fifty cent pieces, quarters and dimes, so well executed that when first issued, even experts, unless their attention was specially called to the coin, were likely to be deceived.The police have for weeks past been on the lookout for the manufacturers of this coin, but it was not until Thursday last that any definite information was obtained as to their whereabouts. On Thursday the officers above named arrested two men, who subsequently gave their names, ANDREAS HENRIQUES and MICHAEL CHEREMANTI, and upon examining the apartments occupied by them at No. 217 Gold-street, they found dies and all other necessary implements and (materials for the successful manufacture of counterfeit United States silver coin, and also a quantity of coin in every stage of its manufacture. When HENRIQUES was arrested,he attempted to throw a way a handful of coin, but was detected in the act and the ""contraband"" was taken from a gutter, where he had throw it. The officers, surmising that these men had associates in their crime, continued their search, and succeeded on Friday night in arresting, in the upper part of New-York, two men supposed to be accomplices. The accused were brought before Justice PERRY yesterday, when, after a partial examination, VALERIO LAZARETTO was dischared upon his own recognizance, there not appearing evidence enough to hold him. FRANCISCO BEDINI, the other accomplice, was committed with the first two named, to await an examination. CHEREMANTI, when arraigned, pleaded guilty to the charge of counterfeiting United States coin. He is a barber by profession, 32 years of age. HENRIQUES is a physician, 51 years of age, and BEDINI is a barber, 30 years of age.

That, on Friday afternoon, he sent him to a broker's in the vicinity with $283, in uncurrent money, for which the boy was to get bankable bills, THEISS obtained $282 from the broker, but did not return to the store of Mr. FANNING. Yesterday morning the latter instituted a search for the boy and money, which resulted in finding $240 75 of it in the possession of the boy HARDEN, at No. 215 Bowery. When THEISS was questioned upon the subject, he stated, at first, that when he was returning from the broker's office with the money, he was attacked by some other boys in the street, and the money was taken from him. The presence of a police officer, however, induced him to confess that his associate, HARDEN, had the money. The boys were then taken to the Station-house, and there searched, when it was ascertained that they had each bought a silver watch, a six-barreled revolver and a ticket for Albany, with Mr. FANNING's money. They told the officer who arrested them, that they would have been on their way to the West at 9 o'clock A. M., if they had not been taken into custody. They were taken before Justice OSBORNE, at the Essex Market Police Court, and committed in default of $500 bail each.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/06/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE ARREST OF TWO BOYS FOR GRAND [???] -- JOHN THEISS and [???] HARDEN, two boys, each about 35 years of age, were arrested yesterday by Officer VAN RANCE, of the Seventeenth Precinct, upon the complaint or Mr. A.

The propositions which had been submitted to the Cabinet by the Company had been to the effect that the Government should give a moderate guarantee on the undertaking, or that it might join with the United States, and also with France, if so decided, in which case the guarantee required from each Government would be smaller. It was understood that the discussion in the Cabinet had not been so satisfactory as could have been desired; but it was believed that if the Government saw that a strong feeling was manifested in favor of proceeding with the enterprise, the proposition of the Company would be complied with.

It will not be forgotten that, in the combat referred to, he met the rebel leader hand to hand. They fired simultaneously, the rebel officer being killed on the spot. The wound of Lieut. O'BRIEN in the shoulder was not at first believed to be fatal. His gallantry in the affair was at once acknowledged, by special dispatch, by Gen. MCCLELLAN. The wound continued to grow worse, and after the amputation of the arm at the shoulder, lock-jaw intervened from the intense irritation of the wound, and no skill of surgery could save him. Lieut. O'BRIEN had but recently received a lieutenancy in the regular service, after volunteering in one of the New-York regiments last Summer. He was an Irishman by birth, and came to New-York about ten years ago, where his good scholarship and fine literary and critical taste gave him varied employment on the Press, in contributions to the leading monthly magazines of the country, as well as to the daily journals.

His establishment was the resort of the fashionable, as it now is of the commercial classes of the metropolis. Since then, we have witnessed the success of an up-town branch, on the corner of Chambers-street and Broadway, and are now called upon to record the establishment of another off-shoot of the parent stem on the corner of Fifth-avenue and Fourteenth-street. The Brothers DELMONICO are determined, it would seem, to keep pace with the rapid up-town strider of society, and to secure once more the patronage of all classes of the community.

In the East, the late Army of the Potomac -- a host greater than that of either of the belligerents at Waterloo -- and under commanders of approved loyalty, skill and courage, -- is moving upon the strong places and key positions of the audacious enemy who, for over a year, has stood before the Capital defying the National power and insulting the flag of the Union. At any hour the telegraphic wire may tremble with news grander and more momentous than it has ever yet borne since - lightning was used as an agency for transmitting thought. When it photographs before us the scenes of the great day and the be great field -- a day and a field upon which will be decided the fate of this Satanic revolt -- we shall see not merely legions of men, and miles of steel, and an hundred parks of artillery in collision, but principles and ideas greater and more enduring than these, contending for the supremacy. Our army is strong, not merely in numbers and equipment, but in courage, and in having a just quarrel. The enemy is inspired only by the lust of Slavery, and stimulated by desperation. We have met him this year already on twenty fields; we have fought him, with the odds in his favor, at Newbern, and at Winchester, and at Pea Ridge; we have conquered him behind intrenchments at Donelson and at Roanoke. In no instance has he stood the onset of our columns, or the contact of the bayonet. In every case he has given way before the invincible men of the North and the great flag of the Republic. With this prestige on our side, our troops now advance to meet him in general battle; and, if he dare to face us at all on either of the lines, East or West, on which he is now showing fight, like results must inevitably, under Providence, crown our arms. There are rumors, however, and they are likely enough to be correct, that, as our various Eastern corps d'armee advance southward, the rebels are preparing to flee from Virginia altogether. They see, not only that their late boasts of conquering the North, are false and futile, but that they are unable, even with all their forces concentrated and planted behind intrenchments, to make a successful resistance to our army. They think that by retiring Westward and Southward, our army will be unable to follow them among the mountains of the West, and into the alligator swamps and under the hot Summer sun of the Gulf States. In making this confession, and in acting upon it, they virtually give up the whole contest; for, with our army advanced to the line of the warm States, and with our seaboard navy and army acting on the coasts of North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and our river navy and our Western army acting on their lines, a residence for the rebels in the everglades and alligator swamps would be as fatal as for us.

The ruler of the new Dahomey, which is striving to erect itself into a nationality at the South, has not yet progressed so far into barbarism as this, but the custom appears not to have been unknown or unpracticed among those of his subjects who whiled away their time for some months back about Manassas and Centreville. The tale was too horrid for belief at first, and though we never exactly agreed with some of the English papers in their opinion that the rebels had carried on the war like a high-minded and civilized people, yet we could hardly believe that any human being, who was not an acknowledged savage, would be guilty of taking the skulls of fallen foes for ornaments, making castinets out of their ribs and spurs out of their jaw-bones -- and there are those in our community to whom the whole story is still only an enormous canard. ""It is not possible,"" they say, ""that such things can be. The rebels were our brothers, living in peace and amity with us little more than a year ago, and is it to be supposed that they should so soon have lost all feelings of kindliness, so soon have degenerated from our boasted American civilization so far as to be guilty of such deeds as these?"" And we see that even Dr. BELLOWS disposed of the matter by saying that there were doubtless barbarians in both armies, and that the Virginians with whom he had conversed expressed the greatest horror at such atrocities. We doubt no that this is so. We know that there are among our lower classes at the ""North men whom vice and crime have brutalized, and who, in the license of war, would show themselves barbarians. And yet, from all the evidence that has come to our knowledge, we protest against any such equalization of the two armies. We believe that when the story of the time comes to be written, the impartial historian will be compelled to admit that in all the elements of civilization, in patient endurance and firm courage on the battle-fields and in kindness and gentleness and true nobility toward those whom the fortune of war placed in their power, the Union troops were immeasurably the superiors of the rebels.

"It will have been noticed that the Commission authorized by Secretary SEWARD to make a proposal on the part of the American Government to cooperate with England in a renewed effort to lay the Atlantic telegraph cable, has been favorably received and is reported to feel confident that the British Cabinet will accept the offer. We are not sure, however, that some recent developments will not dispose Mr. SEWARD to reconsider his proposition. In the course of the late extended debate on Maritime Rights in the House of Commons, a doctrine of international good faith was avowed by Lord PALMERSTON, the Lord Advocate and other speakers, official and non-official, which is certainly far from inspiring the conviction that such a cooperation would be a judicious measure on our part, and which indeed, if taken literally, would in the event of hostilities between the two nations, turn the Atlantic cable into a terrible weapon of war against ourselves. According to this doctrine, which has received the sanction of the leading English Press, war breaks up all treaties, and Lord PALMERSTON, in a series of aphorisms that would not have done discredit to MACHIAVELI, went even so far as to erect bad faith into the dignity of a principle.

A little while ago the Richmond usurpers issued an imperative demand for all firearms; they now go further, and make an appeal for the church-bells, with intent to turn them into cannon. The ""appeal,"" issued from the Ordnance Bureau of the rebel Government at Richmond, urges congregations to send in their bells ""for the purpose of providing light artillery for the public defence."" The special metallurgic reason set forth for this measure is that ""while copper is abundant, the supply of tin is deficient to convert the copper into bronze; and bells contain so much tin that 2,400 pounds of bell-metal, mixed with the proper quantity of copper, will suffice for a field battery of six pieces."" Accordingly, congregations are recommended to send along their bells for this ""patriotic purpose"" to places of deposit provided at Richmond, Fayetteville, Charleston, Savannah, Montgomery, Columbus, Baton Rouge, and other points designated. At the close of the war the clergy are assured, the bells will be paid for or replaced -- that is, things will be restored to the condition ante bellum. It remains to be seen with what degree of alacrity the people will respond to this appeal, which significantly reveals the desperate straits of the rebels. As there is every probability that most of the points indicated as depots will be in our possession before the bells can be sent along and cast into cannon, we need not look with any great trepidation to the anticipated increase of rebel light artillery. The only subject of regret in this connection is that the bells should not remain long enough in their belfries to ring the funeral knell of the secession-rebellion and its nefarious leaders.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN APPEAL FOR CHURCH BELLS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AN APPEAL FOR CHURCH BELLS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Bells', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ffe8479-f800-5259-8e63-55f221cce41c,311,nyt://article/2ffe8479-f800-5259-8e63-55f221cce41c

Editorial on cotton harvests accumulating in South; Editorial on cotton harvests accumulating in South,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/08/archives/the-two-cotton-crops.html,Editorial on cotton harvests accumulating in South; Editorial on cotton harvests accumulating in South,"The Southern planters have not destroyed their last Cotton crop, nor will they give over planting their next crop. The former is safe on hand; not all ready for market to be sure, but in the gin houses ready to be prepared for market. A few thousand bales have successfully run the blockade; a few thousand more have been captured in the attempt to run the blockade. With these trifling exceptions a full average crop of Cotton is now in the country. The war ended, it will soon be seen with what alacrity and certainty this crop will come forward. There has been no application of the torch to it yet, and we venture to say there will be none unless through force of the military rule in particular localites, and then only in the desperation of retreat. Even in the rebel counsels at Richmond a proposition to burn the crop was voted down. The proposition was simply the mad thought of men who have little or nothing of Cotton or any other material wealth to lose. It scarcely rose to the dignity of a self-sacrificing idea, since all the sacrifice would be with the planter and not the politician. The talk of Moscow is worse than moonshine. The conflagration of the whole three million of bales, believed to be on hand in the States in insurrection, would not prevent the National authority from repossessing the places, and territory, and channels of trade which secession is attepmting to deprive it of. The conflagration of Memphis, and Vicksburgb, and New-Orleans would not deter the same authority from restoring the freedom of the navigation of the Mississippi, from its head waters to the Balize. The Government is not after the capture of Southern cotton or Southern cities. With the first it has nothing whatever to do. The latter they will either occupy or restore to their allegiance, not for their own sakes alone, but for the restoration of the commerce of the whole Union to its accustomed channels. The President of the United States could not, if he would, give up the freedom of the Mississippi. Backed by the whole North and East, if such backing were possible, he would not be permitted to do so. The great Northwest would never submit to its surrender. That point is certain. End this war when and where you may, the free navigation of the great Father of Waters is part and parcel of the inalienable heritage of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. As much so, and more, if possible, than the heritage of Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Two Cotton Crops.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Two Cotton Crops.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cotton', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b7f00fb-067b-5373-9266-d7d47271b4de,641,nyt://article/4b7f00fb-067b-5373-9266-d7d47271b4de

"The National Intelligencer, which one would hardly think of calling a sensation journal, has nevertheless on several occasions anticipated the War Department with impunity; and yesterday it again outruns the official utterance by the announcement that the National army advanced on Saturday to Yorktown, with three divisions, and attacked the enemy's position, and that ""the bombardment of MAGRUDER's fortifications was progressing well, with very few casualties on our side."" As this intelligence supplements Gen. WOOL's telegram, that firing was heard in the direction of Yorktown that same morning, if will, doubtless, be accepted as authentic, and will naturally concentrate public attention on the peninsula where operations have been begun that can have but one aim, and a line of march taken up that can have but one goal -- the possession of the rebel capital!

Yorktown marked the close of the Revolutionary struggle, and may be said to mark a new era in the existing contest. It was here that, eighty years ago, CORNWALLIS took up his position, in trenched behind powerful works; here he was nought out and assailed by WASHINGTON, and, after a desperate siege of many days, was finally compelled to surrender his whole army to the American commander. The siege of Yorktown was among the most wisely planned and the most vigorously executed of all WASHINGTON's military operations; and there are many features in which the present siege promises to resemble its illustrious prototype. WASHINGTON was careful to take to this decisive work an overwhelming force -- four or five times that of the enemy -- with abundance of artillery and a powerful cooperating French fleet; we have probably ten times the number of the rebel force, and artillery and fleet to match. WASHINGTON carried the royal stronghold by a flank movement -- a favorite mode of attack with our Union Generals against the rebels. CORNWALLIS had made all his arrangements to escape with his army; MAGRUDER has, doubtless, like his fellow rebel commanders, done the same. But WASHINGTON captured the whole force, and we sincerely hope the example will be emulated by our present General. Finally, the capture of Yorktown was described by a journal of the times as having ""dispelled those nocturnal vapors that hung around us, and put the most pleasing aspect upon our present political affairs that any era of the present war has ever beheld.""

Editorial sees Confederates retreating everywhere,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/08/archives/the-rebels-everywhere-retreating-ac-.html,Editorial sees Confederates retreating everywhere,"tivity pervades the army of Virginia in every Military Department. This morning we have news that Gen. MILROY, who for some time has been holding the pass of Cheat Mountain, Randolph County, in the northern part of the State, has advanced to the rebel position at Camp Alleghany, some twenty miles in a northeasterly direction, and that the rebels there have retreated before him; while the bodies of rebels stationed at Monterey, the capital of Randolph County, and at Huntersville, the capital of Pocahontas County, have also fallen back in the direction of Staunton, from which they will have a railroad escape toward Richmond. It appears, also, by our special dispatch from Wheeling, that a general southeasterly movement of all the main columns in Northwestern Virginia has commenced simultaneously with the retreat of the rebels over the mountains. The rebels have kept these and other bodies of troops in the Western mountains during the Winter to prevent the advance of our army into the Shenandoah Valley, towards the rear of JACKSON's lately defeated force. Their retirement now would seem to be another indication that they have given up all hope of holding any part of Virginia west of the Blue Ridge, if indeed they have not given up hope of retaining any part of the State. If Gen. MILROY is able to advance much further in the direction he is pursuing, he will get in the rear of JACKSON's brigade, which is still annoying our forces at Edenburg. With BANKS in his front and MILROY in his rear, brief work will be made with that insolent rebel. Cheat Mountain and Gen. MILROY are in FREMONT's new Department of the Mountains.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELS EVERYWHERE RETREATING.

Editorial sees complete Union takeover and reconstruction of Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/08/archives/reconstruction-in-virginia.html,Editorial sees complete Union takeover and reconstruction of Virginia,"The reduction of Virginia to the National rule, which now bids fair speedily to happen, will be a most important step, not only in the progress of our arms, but in disclosing the degree of resistance we are to encounter in restoring the status ante bellum. Eastern Virginia is as antagonistical to the spirit of our institutions, and to a true nationality, as South Carolina; while her commanding geographical position, her vast resources in spite of their negligent culture, the important part she played in the drama of the Revolution, and in the formation of the Government, had secured to her such an hereditary prestige that she exerted more influence in National affairs than a half a dozen States of equal population. All this had pampered a pride that brooked no restraint, while she fancied that she possessed a power commensurate with her natural gifts. In these Virginia, more than any other member of the Confederacy, is an imperium in imperio. The fertile imaginations of her people were never weary in looking forward to, and in expatiating upon the wealth, numbers, commercial and manufacturing greatness, that wore to be realized in a future, in which Norfolk was to supplant New-York, and the James River and Kanahwa, the Erio Canal. In South Carolina we had to contend with caste, which Slavery creates in its most perfect form. A few families had come to monopolize both the soil and labor of the State. Their ambition stepped at the ostentatious display of a long roll of serfs and of wide domain. They had the quiet demeanor that belongs to persons conscious of their wealth, and of the secure tenure by which it is held. The State had no harbors -- no coal nor iron -- no elements to which the inductive spirit of modern progress could attach itself, and plant, as in Massachusetts, populous and thriving communities upon sterile plains. Its people were not avaricious of political power, because they had few objects to which it could be directed, and were modest in their demands, for the very good reason of a conscious inability to enforce them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reconstruction in Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reconstruction in Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fee15201-854d-5d27-a76f-62b628c0840b,1014,nyt://article/fee15201-854d-5d27-a76f-62b628c0840b

In its importance, it is second only to the capture of Fort Donelson -- if, indeed, it be second to that achievement. The fall of Fort Donelson opened our way into the States of Alabama and Mississippi, and gave us virtual possession of all of Tennessee, excepting its southwestern corner. The fall of Island No. Ten must soon give us possession of that rebel corner, and will thus open our way through the entire rebel territory to New-Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Fort Donelson was won by terrific fighting, and after the loss of between one and two thousand brave men; Island No. Ten is gained by pure strategy, and without the loss of a single National soldier. At Fort Donelson, we took twice the number of rebels prisoners; but we did not get half the number of siege and other heavy guns that now fall into our hands, which latter are a far greater loss to the rebels than men would be. The artillery and warlike munitions the rebels cannot supplement; and they will soon have to stop the war, if but from the lack of the death-dealing implements. At Forts Henry and Donelson, at New-Madrid, and now at Island No. Ten, we have captured nearly three hundred pieces of ordnance, besides immense quantities of small arms and miscellaneous material. Gen. POPE and Commodore FOOTE have raised themselves even higher than the position they have heretofore achieved; and their persistence and spirit have won for them unmingled admiration.

We do not care to inquire what a Mill or a McCulloch would say of Mr. PEADODY's gift of three-quarters of a million of dollars to the poor of London, satisfied that this munificent largess justifies itself by a higher economy than that of the schools. The distinguished American merchant has made a benevolence which is indeed princely, in the best meaning of that term, and which widens our experience of the generous qualities of human nature. And Mr. PEABODY's gift acquires a peculiar moral interest from the fact that it is to a considerable degree the fruit of a vow made with himself many years ago. We learn from the letter which conveys the offer, and which is addressed to Mr. ADAMS, our Minister at London, that he, at a comparatively early period of his commercial life, resolved in his own mind that, should his labors be blessed with success, he would devote a portion of the property thus acquired to ""promote the intellectual, moral and physical welfare and comfort of his fellow-men, wherever, from circumstances or location, their claims upon him should be the strongest."" He has already carried this resolve into effect in two conspicuous instances in his own country, having founded in 1852 an institute and library for the benefit of the people of his birthplace in Danvers, Mass., and in Baltimore an institute devoted to science and arts, with a free library, which is now completed, though not yet opened. The present gift, accordingly, he devotes to the benefit of the poor of London, where he has resided for the past five and twenty years, and been blessed with great worldly prosperity. Our Minister at London, with Lord STANLEY, Sir JAMES EMERSON TENNENT and Messrs. CURTIS LAMPSON and JUNIOS S. MORGAN, are made trustees of the fund, and to them he transfers the sum of £150,000, (or $750,000,) to be used in such ways as shall ""ameliorate the condition and augment the comforts"" of the poor of the great English capital; and, among other ways, by the construction of such improved dwellings for the poor as may combine in the utmost possible degree the essentials of healthfulness, comfort, social enjoyment and economy. The trustees have certainly a wide field of action before them in descending to benefit that class with which MAYHEW makes us acquainted in his terrible piece of social anatomy, the London Labor and London Poor. Our countryman thus not only does an act of very pure and noble charity, but at the same time teaches a lesson of practical democracy. Such acts put the whole world under contribution, and it can scarcely be that this munificent benefaction of one who, by his sympathies and ties, is, as it were, at once American and Briton, shall not prove a new bond of international amity.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Peaboby's Gift to the London Poor."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Peaboby's Gift to the London Poor."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Philanthropy', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76f10f68-ca17-563c-8c55-3ab406691fd9,522,nyt://article/76f10f68-ca17-563c-8c55-3ab406691fd9

The drainage of sixteen acres of miasmatic swamp land, and clearing away of useless thickets, has enhanced the value of the property, while it has removed a long standing nuisance. A productive addition is thus made to a farm, of some sixty-five acres in extent, which affords the main supply of edibles for the sojourning emigrants. It is estimated that $5,880 are by this means saved to the treasury yearly. In connection with the farm is another acceptable and highly sanitary feature, the Dairy, the establishment of which has heretofore been unsuccessfully attempted, but now is a permanent arrangement, to which the physicians attribute the decrease in mortality among children of tender years. Including the expense of purchasing cows, the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars has, during this, its first year, attested its economy over the contract provision of former years. Sheds and appropriate space are allotted the cows, and they are kept in a healthy condition. Fifteen acres of the Island are appropriated to grass land, and nobly grown Southdown sheep reposed their wealth of wool and flesh upon the rolling mounds.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""WARD'S ISLAND.; Improved Accommodations for Emigrants Economical Results of Home supplies Over Outside Contracts Diary New Lunatic Quarters, & c., & c."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""WARD'S ISLAND.; Improved Accommodations for Emigrants Economical Results of Home supplies Over Outside Contracts Diary New Lunatic Quarters, & c., & c."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Immigration and Emigration', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a18d2369-2d95-5238-aa17-50eed6484c3b,2235,nyt://article/a18d2369-2d95-5238-aa17-50eed6484c3b

Editorial on Union intention of using Negro soldiers for garrison duty,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/09/archives/negroes-for-garrison-duty.html,Editorial on Union intention of using Negro soldiers for garrison duty,"The Secretary of War, with provident eye to the heats of Summer, and the necessity of holding forts and arsenals in places where the yellow fever demon will enlist, for three or four months, on the side of the rebels, has, we are told, conceived the possibility of using negro soldiery for garrison duty. The blacks, thoroughly acclimated, will be saved from the risks of climate; while in the well-defined limit of fortifications they will be restrained from the commission of those revengeful excesses which are the bug-a-boos of the Southern people. And, indeed, we hardly know why so much care should be taken of those same Southern nerves, seeing the merciless readiness of the rebels to turn upon us the Indian savages of the Southwest. But there is an argument for the use of the negro troops sufficient to acquit Mr. STANTON of sympathy with Garrison Abolitionism. Experience proves the blacks to have rare merit in the handling of artillery. Both in the British and American service has this excellence been noted. They are proof to the heat and smoke of the casemate, unendurable by whites in a warm elimate, while the ardor of their labor and courage throws the utmost energy into their gunnery. It is also asserted that their practice is quite as accurate as that of the white artillerists. Other considerations equal, and the expediency of arming the blacks in any circumstances once determined -- a subject we are sure the Secretary will weigh carefully before deciding -- this faculty of the negro as a gunner would would go far to commend his employment.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEGROES FOR GARRISON DUTY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEGROES FOR GARRISON DUTY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a477c8ce-f3ec-5486-b3bc-b85594a4760d,268,nyt://article/a477c8ce-f3ec-5486-b3bc-b85594a4760d

"The Navy Department has doubtless good reasons to give for permitting the disabled Merrimac to be refitted at leisure, and to select her own time and place for another essay of her destructive powers. The Department had good reasons to give for the original loss.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/10/archives/the-coming-of-the-merrimac.html,,"The Navy Department has doubtless good reasons to give for permitting the disabled Merrimac to be refitted at leisure, and to select her own time and place for another essay of her destructive powers. The Department had good reasons to give for the original loss of the vessel, along with the Norfolk Navy-yard, and for the success of its former desperate attempt. It had reasons quite as good for the successive escapes of the Sumter and the Nashville. They all, however, resolve themselves into the very simple formula, that adequate measures are not taken by the Department until the rebels have had ample opportunity to do their worst. Among those in New-York who understand such matters, quite as well as the Secretary himself, it is believed that the means instituted (partly by Government) to destroy the Merrimac, would have done the work far more effectually had they attacked her boldly at the Navy-yard, crippled and without steam, than they can do it, now, when she is repaired, newly armed, and with steam up and abundant sea-room. That these advantages are on her side is unquestionably a source of extreme alarm, not only to the people but to the Government. The latter, for fear of the monster, is unable to harbor the fleet of transports tributary to the army of the Potomac under the guns of Fortress Monroe; and the public, equally fearful, shows none of the enthusiastic satisfaction which the splendid victories on the Mississippi and Tennessee so fully warrant.

RUSSELL, Special Correspondent of the London Times, was among the passengers by the China, which sailed for Liverpool yesterday. Mr. RUSSELL's stay in the United States had extended over more that a year of our eventful times, during which time he has contributed letters of a varying merit to the leading London journal. Some of his earlier descriptive letters were characterized by all his brilliant and unrivaled power in that style of writing; but he was less happy, and sometimes extremely unhappy, in his speculative and philosophical essays, and thus incurred the odium of many who were, perhaps, not always willing to make due allowance for the extreme difficulty and delicacy of his task.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEPARTURE OF MR.

Barley have we noted the tranquil success of the plans, so admirably matured by FOOTE and POPE for the reduction of Island Ten, when we are called upon to chronicle the brave fighting of GRANT and BUELL on the Upper Tennessee. The battle at Pittsburgh is justly described by the reporter, whose account is, thus far, our only source of information and which we assume to be only defective in its exaggeration of the number killed and wounded, as the most formidable and destructive of modern times. What with the numbers engaged on either side, the desperate character of the fighting, the tremendous part played by artillery, and the fatal consequences of the defeat, it certainly lays just claim to this preeminence; for on no other recent battle-field have all these conditions been so thoroughly represented. The conflict sets at rest forever the doubt whether courage is a national trait. On the side of the Union as on that of rebellion, there was exhibited the most obstinate displays of valor; the loyal army resolute to win, the rebel army with the impulse of desperation, determined not to lose. Of generalship there would seem to have been less than there was of personal daring and persistent intrepidity; what, in fact, may be properly termed soldiership. Of such a struggle the fruit could not be other than a frightful sacrifice of life. There was, indeed, reason in Congress receiving the bulletin of victory in silence. On whichever side the dead had fallen, they were our own dead; our brethren and friends, who had gone out loyally to redeem the country, or those other brethren, and sometime friends, who, misguided and untaught, are struggling for the overthrow or prevention of imaginary wrongs. There is no aspect of such a victory, save one, which has not its tinge of melancholy.

"The battle at Pittsburgh, Tenn., a few miles from the rebel position at Corinth, brief dispatches regarding which were published in our first edition yesterday, and fuller details of which appeared in extra editions, proves to have been one of the first magnitude in its progress and results. It was brought on by the rebels themselves, early on Sunday morning, and continued, with an Intermission lasting only through the darkness of Sunday, night, until late in the afternoon of Monday. The collision of the two armies was hurried by the desire of the rebel leadersto engage our Southwestern army in detail instead of in mass -- the necessity, in fact, of defeating Gen. GRANT before he could be joined by Gen. BUELL. Dispatches received from Louisville informs us that BRAUREGARD left Corinth with his command for Purdy, a few miles west of Pittsburgh, on Thursday last, and that JOHNSTON, with his command, left on the same day for the same destination, by a different route -- intending to concentrate their forces at Purdy and make an attack upon Gen. GRANT on Friday or Saturday, should the state of the roads permit. Fortunately they were delayed so that the attack could not be made until Sunday, as before stated, when Gen. BUELL was so near the scene of action that he was able to participate on the second day, and turn the tide of battle in our favor. The brigades of Gens. SHERMAN and PRENTISS were first engaged, and the rebel attack was successful. Our entire force was driven back to the river, when the advance of the enemy was first checked by the fire of two of our gunboats. Gen. GRANT then arrived at the scene of action, with the troops from Savanna, and our men, who had been contending against fearful odds, were inspirited by the news that two Divisions of Gen. BUELL's army had also arrived. The next morning our forces, now out-numbering those of the rebels, assumed the offensive, and, after a hard-fought day, succeeded in routing the enemy at every point. Our losses on the first day were heavy, and beside the killed and wounded, embraced the camp equipage at Pittsburgh and thirty-six field guns. On the second day, however, by two o'clock P.M., we had retaken the camps and batteries, and some forty of the enemy's cannon, beside a number of prisoners. A number of our men were taken prisoners on the first day, including, one report says, Gen. PRENTISS. The reports of our killed, wounded and missing are doubtless much exaggerated, but it is likely the number will approach five thousand, while the enemy's losses must be much heavier, as our artillery was served upon them with terrible effect.

To that end their eye fell upon the Navy-yards at Washington and Norfolk. These yards, located within slave territory, were nurtured and enlarged in every possible way. They intended that when the theft was accomplished the booty should be worth the stealing. As a means to this end, they secured for these yards enlargement and the monopoly of certain species of naval material, so that other parts of the country should be dependent upon them. Immense sums were lavished on these two yards, especially on that at Washington. A man of some talent in supervising mechanical operations, was selected to superintend this yard; hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on his education to make him an adept. In some of his gun improvements and adaptations he was successful; in fact, he has produced the most effective cannon used in any service. It was contrived that a large class of munitions should be manufactured at this yard only. Even the great New-York Yard has to send to the Washington Yard for half of the ordnance fabrications required. The Norfolk Yard was made the great storehouse of ordnance. Large contracts were given to the Tredegar Works, at Richmond, fostering the manufacture there till the result was attained -- that those Works produced the best cannon in the country. Three thousand cannon fell into the hands of the enemy with the Norfolk Yard. These have been distributed all over the ""Confederacy,"" and on every battle-field have they dealt death among the loyal men of the country. But the plan was only half successful. The Washington Yard, when the open rebellion was reached, slipped through their traitor fingers, and remained the property of the Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval Ordnance A Word of Caution.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naval Ordnance A Word of Caution.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SHIPBUILDING', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab2973ca-1fb2-5ae4-b0c4-45e1874baf2e,835,nyt://article/ab2973ca-1fb2-5ae4-b0c4-45e1874baf2e

The general statement cannot be gainsaid, that the more important movements of the National forces, in the early stages of the present war, were made on Sunday; and that they were undeniable failures. PATTERSON's column was constantly notorious for its manoeuvreing on Sundays, -- and for little else. Big Bethel, Bull Run, and Ball's Bluff were the great blunders and defeats of attacking armies on Sunday. All these engagements, excepting Bull's Bluff, under the now imprisoned Gen. STONE, preceded Gen. MCCLELLAN's noble Sabbath order. Thence forward the rebels have made the Sunday assaults, with invariable loss of the battles thus waged. Mill Spring opened their career of Sunday lighting, which closes with Pittsburgh. The battle of Winchester was begun on Sunday morning. The first of these, battles cost the rebels Kentucky; the second, the valley of Virginia; and the third, the Mississippi Valley. The Merrimac, too, after its destructive Saturday's raid, ran a much against the Monitor on Sunday, and has spent a month in repairing damages.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sunday Battles.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sunday Battles.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a94d54d-32a6-549f-8f3a-09f935ec3692,467,nyt://article/0a94d54d-32a6-549f-8f3a-09f935ec3692

From the first he was a staunch loyalist, raising a regiment of cavalry, which was in the engagement at Pittsburgh Landing, and has now offered up his life in defence of the country against which his brother has lifted up a traitor's hand.

She could not live an hour amid such a gale as swept over the Chesapeake on Tuesday and Wednesday, for a wave catching her overlapping, eaves-like sides, would peel off her iron coat like pasteboard. Indeed, Sir HOWARD DOUGLAS, the first authority on iron-clad war ships, in discussing the qualities of a vessel of the form of the Merrimac, (for nothing is more absurd than to suppose that her model is a rebel invention,) proves mathematically that such a ship is wholly unseaworthy. And here is precisely where our plucky little Monitor has the advantage; she can buffet any sea, and is capable of being completely submerged without hurt. And this only disposes one to reiterate the question we have already put, namely: Why are not our mall-clad champions allowed to seek out the enemy, (which is said to be lying off Craney Island,) and strike when she cannot follow?

This kind of work was anticipated in the Senate. It is there, of course, that the enemies of the bill propose to make their last stand, and it is upon this body that they mean to bring to bear all possible influences to defeat it. Members will have to be exceedingly careful of their good names; for there are and have been rumors that corrupt tactics are to be resorted to, and that money and men to use it have gone up to the Capital from this City to defeat a bill which otherwise could have but few opponents. It is to be hoped, nevertheless, that there is virtue and intelligence enough in the Senate to overrule all such attempts. The importance of the bill to the health of the City is undeniable; its necessity may be learned from the mortality statistics.

Editorial speculates on effects of Union victory in war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/11/archives/the-victory-and-the-victors.html,Editorial speculates on effects of Union victory in war,"We print this morning another and most clear and intelligent account of the great battle and Union victory of Sunday and Monday last on the Tennessee River. It is written by an eye-witness, to one of the Cincinnati daily journals, and will command attention for its succinct narrative of the two days' fighting. It leaves no question of the terrific and bloody nature of the engagement, or the completeness of the Union victory. It diminishes the extreme peril in which the first report placed the army of Gen. GRANT on Sunday afternoon, while it adds to the promptness and efficiency with which our gunboats were brought to his assistance. Two other important facts are made manifest. First, that the division of Gen. LEWIS WALLACE, who mistook his way, in the early hours of Sunday, was enabled to cooperate with the remainder of Gen.

The desperate bid has come too late. The measure might possibly have had some weight if made a year, or even six months ago. It would have taken John Bull in a soft place, and might very likely have brought them a certain kind of ""sympathy"" at least. But they have allowed the opportunity to slip by, and now not even poor purblind Bull is likely to be deceived by a measure which, if it had any basis in real intention, would have been announced long ago.

"It is impossible to overrate the importance of the lesson contained in the incidents of the late sea-fight between the Federal and Confederate squadrons. In this unexpected and unparalleled engagement we get the first real glimpse of a new system of naval warfare, and it will be our own fault if we do not profit by the instruction afforded. It is clear, however, that neither the Merrimac nor the Monitor can be exactly measured against our own productions. It does not appear, for instance, that either of these vessels could put to sea, or venture far from land, whereas our own Warrior, as will have been seen from Capt. COCHRANK's report in our impression of yesterday, is fit for active service in any part of the world. Still there are points of great interest involved in the comparison. Both the American vessels have sloping sides, or if the Monitor's sides are not set at an angle they are so low as to offer little mark for shot. The Americans, therefore, seem to rely upon the protection obtained by this expedient, whereas we have not yet adopted it, and, indeed, the ""Iron Plate Committee"" of the Institution of Naval Architects have just declared their conclusion, that ""angulated sides possess no real advantage as compared with the usual upright sides."" Yet one objection which was urged against sloping sides has not been supported by the experience of the late action. It was plausibly said that a ship acting like a ram might run over one of these low vessels with the greatest ease; but the Merrimac did strike the Monitor without any such result. Another notable point is suggested by the armaments of the two vessels. The Monitor had two guns only, but each of these guns was nearly twice as large as one of the Merrimac's, and they were worked from a ""turret."" If, therefore, two guns proved a match for twelve, it must have been owing either to their calibre, or to the new method of working them. One conclusion, however, admits of no doubt whatever, and it happens to be the most important of all. There is an end of wooden ships for ever, and the Americans are now recognizing the fact to some purpose. In addition to what they have lavished on iron-clad vessels during the last twelve months they are now preparing to to vote $26,000,000, or upwards of 5,000,000l., more, for structures of the same class, 'and' will probably spend on this object, without stint or scruple, in the course of a year or two, a sum which no British Minister would venture to demand.

His body was thus crushed and mangled in a shocking manner. He was immediately taken up by a Policeman and some citizens, placed upon a shutter, and carried to the nearest Station house. He died while on the way there. The deceased was 58 years of age, a native of Connecticut. He has left a wife and five or six children.

We hope all the military strength of Virginia is concentrated there. The western portion of the State has for a long time been under our full control. Gen. BANKS, with a strong column, is moving down the Shenandoah Valley, the finest part of the State, and from which the greater portions of the rebel supplies for the war have been drawn. The loss of this fertile productive region, the rebels already admit to be a great calamity. Other movements will doubtless soon threaten Richmond from the Northwest. Two columns are rapidly overrunning the State, while the great bulk of its forces is holding Yorktown in its extreme eastern section. If Gen. MCCLELLAN remains simply on the defensive, the rebels must soon abandon their position, or they will be cut off from retreat to Richmond. But we presume that our forces have already made guild headway in dislodging the enemy. After our glorious successes in the West, the capture of the rebels at Yorktown would end the rebellion, as did the capture of the British forces there end the War of the Revolution.

Our people, more than, perhaps, any other in the world, are accustomed to change. Change, in fact, is rather the rule, the custom of our lives. We are not like the people of the Old World, who have lived for centuries under the same institutions, ruled by the same classes, in whose selection the people have no choice, and dwelling, generation after generation, contentedly under the shadow of the same hills or by the side of the same stream, until the whole course of their life runs in the same direction, and their associations from childhood to the grave all wrap around the same objects, and tend to make change of any kind an object of distaste and abhorrence. Our people are a wandering people. It has become the habit of their minds to seek for new resting-places on very slight provocation. The rich fields of the West have acted as a constant stimulus upon their imagination and their hope, before which homo associations, never too closely knit, were powerless. Especially has this been so at the South, where the exhausting cultivation of the soil under slave-labor, has driven the people continually to seek fresh lands, always to make their homes but a temporary resting-place, to be at once forsaken under the incitement of some fancied richer soil, or more convenient location. So, too, In our political system. We have been accustomed to frequent change of rulers. One dynasty has gone down and another has risen in its place continually. And the people have learned to accept each, when it came, with the same feelings and submission as if it were to abide forever, and with equal readiness to yield to the requirements of the new powers which speedily took its place.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Restoration of the Union.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Restoration of the Union.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/191c4168-968b-5f0b-812e-d35c5aa9664f,1039,nyt://article/191c4168-968b-5f0b-812e-d35c5aa9664f

The death of SYDNEY JOHNSTON is admitted. The dispatches to the Mobile papers are equally modest. They confidently claim an overwhelming victory -- not actually won, as our army had not yet been exterminated, but in near prospect. The night which followed, and the cooperation of BUELL, materially changed the fortunes of the next day, and the final result proved that, if victory had not been claimed in advance, it could not have been boasted of at all. Some of the secession sympathizers in Wall-street, yesterday, were yet incredulous as to the ultimate repulse of the Confederates, for no other reason than that our Generals were not so prompt to announce their positive success as BEAUREGARD, in communicating the first day's work. On this point they had only to recur to the delay of Gen. GRANT, in his official report of what was done at Fort Donelson. The glory of that achievement, it will not be forgotten, was claimed by PILLOW up to a late hour on Saturday, 15th February; yet on the night of that eventful day he and FLOYD escaped from their intrenchments with their favorite regiments, leaving poor BUCKNER to surrender his 18,000 remaining troops unconditionally the next morning.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A REBEL VICTORY NOT WON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A REBEL VICTORY NOT WON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2e054ec1-a696-5318-b493-6c3e3c436a84,279,nyt://article/2e054ec1-a696-5318-b493-6c3e3c436a84

The whole of the troops of Arkansas, with the exception of those in Virginia and in Tennessee, were concentrated under the two leaders named, at the battle of Pea Ridge, and the rebel newspapers had already announced that they were all ordered for the defence of Memphis; so that the statement of their being present at the great battle is not at all unlikely. There have been rumors of the existence of small bodies of rebels at Pocahontas and Jacksonport, an the Big Black river, in the northeastern part of Arkansas; but the probability is that these are only detachments of the Home Guard or local militia. In no other part of the State are there any rebel troops, excepting a small body who are fortifying at Napoleon, at the mouth of the Arkansas river, and the garrison at Fort Smith, five hundred miles up the same stream, and perhaps the savages of the renegade PIKE and of MCINTOSH -- all these bodies being small, detached, widely scattered, and utterly ineffective against a brigade of National troops and a gunboat.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER REBEL STATE OPEN TO OUR ARMY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANOTHER REBEL STATE OPEN TO OUR ARMY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8683df6d-cd16-5a98-9c0e-8ca6f9d5f043,746,nyt://article/8683df6d-cd16-5a98-9c0e-8ca6f9d5f043

Editorial holds Southern States indefensible,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/14/archives/the-indefensibleness-of-the-south.html,Editorial holds Southern States indefensible,"In spite of our best efforts we cannot teach Englishmen geography. The London Times admits that we have gained some successes; but these, it tells us, are upon the exterior lines of the rebel States; and it then goes on to describe the vast and inhospitable wastes and pestiferous swamps to be traversed by our troops -- swamps whose misasmatic vapors will be fatal to them, to say nothing of the impossibility of dragging over them heavy ordnance and trains of supplies. The end is as far off as ever, according to this journal. But the facts are exactly opposed to the arguments and conclusions it draws. There is no country in the world so indefensible as the Southern States, and so easily overrun, taking into consideration the fact that the inhabitants of the mountain districts are, a great majority of them, still loyal to the Union. The greater portion of the Southern States is an open, champaign country, and traversed in any direction by navigable rivers. The battle near Corinth, was fought, the first day at least, under the cover of our steamboats, which had transported our troops to the battle-field hundreds of miles within rebel territory, and rendered them efficient support when assailed. We are not compelled to traverse extensive districts by land to reach the rebel forces; but, having command of the watercourses, or being able to gain command of them by means of our formidable gunboats, to which the rebels can oppose resistance neither by land nor water, the whole country, in fact, lies at our mercy. It requires some time for preparation; but when this is complete, our forces move forward into the heart of the enemy's territory, on vast flotillas, which transports them, with whatever is necessary for active operations in the field. With the command of the Cumberland River, which was secured by the fall of Fort Donelson, the whole of Central Tennessee submitted to our arms without the loss of a man. The army fell back to another line of defence, approachable by the Tennessee River, which enabled us, with the greatest ease, to collect 80,000 men within a day's march of his stronghold. With the Mississippi River under our control, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana will be incapable of any further resistance. By holding this great artery we can literally starve the people of these States into submission. They will be alike incapable of defensive or offensive operations. With the capture of a few more Southern ports we can disband the greater portion of our army, and quietly sit down to the game of endurance. The rebels will be carefully hemmed in, and it may be our wisest course to give them a little experience of entire isolation, in which they will have nothing to do but to prey upon each other. We shall take all their outlets, control all the channels of their commerce, when we can well afford to await their return to common sense, and obedience to laws. We do not desire extirpation; but as we can do very well without them, we propose to put them upon probation for good conduct, the length of which will be for them to determine. But whatever time they take, we shall all the time be growing stronger, and they the weaker.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Indefensibleness of the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Indefensibleness of the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9faa82c-68d8-5abb-818a-1f15783f289a,550,nyt://article/d9faa82c-68d8-5abb-818a-1f15783f289a

"By the arrival of the steamship Norwegian at Portland, last night, we receive advices from Europe, five days later than previously received. Two brigs, the Adelaide and the Mary Wright, had arrived at Liverpool, having run the blockade at Charleston, on the 3d of March. They carried over about 1,400 bales of cotton, and a quantity of tobacco and resin. They reported that the fleet of stone vessels sunk across the harbor was fast breaking up. The proceedings of the British Parliament had been of no special importance.

The grand line of communication between the two extremes of the rebel States has, for the first time, been cut, and their two great armies isolated from and rendered incapable of supporting each other, defeat in either field of operations must be fatal to the army engaged, and so far to the cause. With our success or defeat in either, our Government would still be enabled to consolidate overwhelming forces upon any point menaced, or to be attacked. So that, in a strategic point of view, the capture of Huntsville must be decisive of the contest in the Southwest. The line of railroad we have severed was not only necessary for the maintenance of the rebel communications, but for feeding their army. In the Southwest we had completely driven them out of the food-producing districts. With the line of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in their hands, they still had the best portion of Tennessee and Virginia for supplies of beef and grains. We have, by this success, dealt a more fatal blow at the commissariat of the enemy than at his forces in the field, because an army can be kept together only so long as it can be fed, and well fed.

Editorial on Hunter orders for sanitary precautions in Port Royal to guard against yellow fever,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/15/archives/port-royal-intrenched-against-yellow-fever.html,Editorial on Hunter orders for sanitary precautions in Port Royal to guard against yellow fever,"Gen. HUNTER's first care on assuming command of the Department of the South, is to provide in advance against the worst foe his troops will have to encounter -- namely: the hostile climatic influences of those Southern latitudes. In his admirable General Order No. 5, (published in another column,) he lays down such sanitary precautions as must be observed by the soldiers in his Department during the hot Summer months. They are sensible and practical in the highest degree, and, if rigidly enforced, will enable our men successfully to withstand the malign principalities and powers of the Southern air. Though each direction is simply a necessary precautionagainst some inimical element, several of them produce a rather odd impression, contrasted with the reckless ways on troops are able to indulge in in our healthier upper latitudes. Thus they are to be sure ""not to rise till half an hour after sunrise, when breakfast will be ready for the men as soon as they leave their tents,"" they are to receive, during the hot hours of the day, ""quinine in prophylactic doses, each dose combined with half a gill of whisky;"" the importance of ""good cooking"" is insisted on with a gusto that would have warmed the heart of a Soyer or a Francatelli, and ""fishing during the cool hours of the morning and evening -- not later than 9 A.M. in the morning, and not earlier than 6 P.M. in the evening ""-- is commended as at once a pleasing mental pastime and a source of provender for the culinary department. The General justly observes that, ""with proper care exercised, and certain simple rules of hygiene observed, the hardy soldiers of the Union, inured to toil and fortified by habits of industry, temperance and cleanliness, have nothing to fear from the climate of the Department in which it is their privilege to serve;"" and when he instances in proof the fact that, during our war with Mexico, the soldiers of New-England, the Northwestern and Middle States, suffered far less from the diseases incident to a semi-tropical climate than the soldiers from the Southernand Gulf States, he is completely borne out by established sanitary statistics.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Port Royal Intrenched Against Yellow Fever.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Port Royal Intrenched Against Yellow Fever.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6f113e3-bc9a-5604-806a-8f0087a27e92,479,nyt://article/f6f113e3-bc9a-5604-806a-8f0087a27e92

But the defeat of the rebels, still menaced by a superior force, allowed General MITCHEL to move forward unopposed, and to occupy the line of their communication for an hundred miles in extent, capturing the rolling stock of their most important railroad, with a large number of prisoners, and unquestionably a large amount of munitions and stores.

"A let  ter, published yesterday, from the rebel General JOHNSTON, who uses slain at the battle at Pittsburgh Landing, fully sustains the ground that we have always taken, that the number of the rebel forces have everywhere been greatly exaggerated.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/16/archives/exaggeration-of-the-rebel-forces.html,,"-- A let ter, published yesterday, from the rebel General JOHNSTON, who uses slain at the battle at Pittsburgh Landing, fully sustains the ground that we have always taken, that the number of the rebel forces have everywhere been greatly exaggerated. The army collected at Bowling Green, he tells us, was purposely magnified as to numbers, the object being to avert attack and gain time for foreign interference, for the release of cotton. It is well known that the almost solo dependence of the rebels was upon such aid. Every day gained, consequently, was, in their programme, of the utmost value. The same trick was unquestionably everywhere played, with a similar object. The vast forces at Manassas, which they [???] believe numbered fully 200,000 men, have, upon a careful examination of the ground, dwindled down to some 85,000 or 40,000; or say 60,000, as the maximum at any one time. The stupendous works which the balloon disclosed never had an existence. We always felt assured that the rebels could never bring into the field the vast numbers of which their armies were said to be composed. The South cannot accomplish impossibilities, with all their ardor and devotion, and with all the advantage which they claimed for Slavery. Our people have, from the outset, greatly magnified the effective force of the enemy. We may not have lost much by doing so, as it has only served to increase the extent of our preparation, while it must have correspondingly decreased his. We have learned a lesson, too, which will not be forgotten in the future. We shall no longer take for granted what a wily and cunning foe, interested in deceiving, tells us; nor allow play to our imagination till it has multiplied three or four times every object it sees.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXAGGERATION OF THE REBEL FORCES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EXAGGERATION OF THE REBEL FORCES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8f65b2d-3dd1-52c8-afad-d1aa234533eb,299,nyt://article/d8f65b2d-3dd1-52c8-afad-d1aa234533eb

SIDNEY JORNSTON, who was killed at the battle of Pittsburgh, throws a good deal of light upon late rebel movements and prospects in Kentucky and Tennessee. The failure of that distinguished rebel officer to hold Bowling Green -- his signal failure to defend successfully Forts Henry and Donelson, which were the keys to his Department -- his failure to defend Clarksville -- his flight from Nashville --his retreat from Murfreesboro -- his abandonment of the entire State of Kentucky and nearly the whole of Tennessee -- his decampment into Alabama -- his miserable failure everywhere, had called forth execrations upon his head from every part of rebeldom. He was hooted at by the Tennessee rebels for delivering them up into the hands of HALLECK; he was cursed by the Cotton States for bringing the war within their borders; he was maligned by his own subordinates, and his army was deserting him; he was fiercely assailed in the rebel Congress; he was bitterly criticised in the rebel newspapers -- until finally he is reported to have said despondingly that he had not a friend left in the Confederacy. And yet he was the man who, of all others, had been until lately looked upon in the South as a commander without a peer for active field work -- combining in himself science, skill, daring, coolness, resoluteness, experience, popularity, and whatever other characteristics or elements of success are supposed to belong to a great leader. This was the fourth war in which he had seen and done service; and in each of the previous wars, he had gained only renown and achieved always success. His letter to Gen. JEFF. DAVIS attempts to explain the causes of his present failure. It is apologetic and defensive in statement and tone; and as the rebel disasters in the Southwest all date from the fall of Fort Donelson, he makes that the event upon which to hang his defence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

BEAUREGARD that he had taken eight thousand prisoners and thirty-six pieces of artillery. The doubt is, perhaps, natural; but it is not well founded. The effect produced is just what the wily Louisianian aimed at. He knew that people generally would ask, how could BEAUREGARD carry off so many prisoners if he were finally beaten? But there is no inconsistency whatever between the capturing and the keeping of even 8,000 prisoners, and a final victory over their capturers. For when prisoners are taken they are immediately marched off to the rear, far out of the way both of harm and of rescue. These prisoners being taken on Sunday -- when, Gen. GRANT's force having been surprised by an overwhelming force of the enemy, we suffered severely, and would have been almost hopelessly defeated but for our gunboats, -- were of course sent to the rear of the rebel army; and on the morning of Sunday, were doubtless with their guard nearer Corinth than Pittsburgh Landing. But owing to the arrival of Gen. BUELL and the proceedings consequent thereupon, Monday saw Gen. BEAUREGARD's front rapidly converted into his rear. His rear of course became his front, and the prisoners whom he took on the previous day were soon going off in the van of his retreating army, with his whole force between them and their pursuing friends. There was thus probably no way of releasing these men but by the capture of the whole rebel force. It does not at all diminish the certainty or the importance of our victory to admit that, under the circumstances, our army was not able to follow the flying foe fast enough to get between him and the base of his operations. The true character of BEAUREGARD's position appears clearly in his announcement that he has ""fallen back upon Corinth,"" and that he is ""able"" to maintain himself there. This is the language of a man defeated, though not annihilated.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEAUREGARD AS A WRITER OF BULLETINS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEAUREGARD AS A WRITER OF BULLETINS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b0fe7981-5c0b-5c2b-846c-d5292d1b1587,517,nyt://article/b0fe7981-5c0b-5c2b-846c-d5292d1b1587

It is a declaration  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/17/archives/end-of-slavery-in-the-district-of-columbia.html,,"The act of the President, in signing a bill to put an end to Slavery in the District of Columbia, places the Government of this country in its proper position, in reference to the subject of human bondage. It is a declaration that its sympathies and its action, as far as they can be constitutionally exerted, are henceforth to be in favor of freedom, as better in a moral point of view, and more economic in a material one, than Slavery. Such is the genious of the age, as well as Christianity. This act of Government is but the record of a progress in this country in liberal ideas, common to the whole civilized world. In the United States, the comparative economic value of freedom and Slavery have had a double test, At the adoption of the Constitution, the two sections exactly divided the population between them, but Slavery claimed by far the fairer portion of the country. Seventy years have elapsed, and the Free States, with equal area, number nearly twice the population of the Slave, and ten times their wealth and material strength, to say nothing of the infinitely superior type of civilization of the former. The Slave States denied this superiority, and demanded the arbitrament of the sword. The last decision has been conclusive in favor of freedom. We cannot avoid the effect of the moral if we would, while the action of the slaveholding section has fully warranted Government in affirming a judgment irresistibly sustained by results, and at the same time by the general sense of mankind. Henceforth it will stand as the representative of freedom and progress, although the members of what it is composed may, for an indefinite period, maintain Slavery, which must, for the future, as it should, look to local law for its support. The Constitution of the United States cannot be directed to its overthrow in the States composing the Confederacy, but it must not be used as the instrument of its extension.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'End of Slavery in the District of Columbia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'End of Slavery in the District of Columbia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eca8665b-6dee-597c-beb0-cb1161c6896c,503,nyt://article/eca8665b-6dee-597c-beb0-cb1161c6896c

Benedict & Co., of this City, on the 23d of September, 1857, made their check on the Bank of Commerce for $2,535, which was indorsed by the defendants, in their firm name of Benedict & Colt.

The defendant, Benedict, admitted in his answer the making of the check and note, but claimed that they had both been paid. The defendant, Colt, in a separate answer, set up that he knew nothing of the notes or the indorsement, until the commencement of this action, and that if the notes were indorsed by Benedict it was without his consent, and thus the note and check were accommodation paper, and Benedict had no authority to indorse the firm name. The principal question which arose on the trial was whether the check and note were accommodation paper or not.

editorial on US-Mexico relations,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/18/archives/american-diplomacy-in-mexico.html,editorial on US-Mexico relations,"A few days ago, the TIMES laid before its readers a remarkably thorough and instructive history of the origin of the European coalition against Mexico. It was illustrated with the text of all the more important dispatches which had passed between the British, Spanish and French Governments, and with abstracts of papers of secondary moment. This remarkable chapter of diplomatic history we have now completed. On Tuesday, the President submitted to the House of Representatives a statement of the relations of the American Government with Mexico, accompanied by copies of the correspondence which has taken place between the State Department and Mr. CORWIN, our Minister at the Mexican Capital. These papers, reproduced in our columns yesterday, show with what steadfast loyalty Secretary SEWARD has adhered to the great American principle, adverse to entangling alliances; how tenaciously he has grasped the Monroe doctrine, and with what zeal he has employed all the resources of diplomacy to save Mexico from impending ruin. And in the more detailed intelligence, in another column, of recent events in the adjoining Republic, our readers have made perfect in their favor a summary of the Mexican question, as it stands to-day.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Diplomacy in Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Diplomacy in Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/769b6cd1-ca60-5684-bbe6-4ba2e3d5f0c1,1062,nyt://article/769b6cd1-ca60-5684-bbe6-4ba2e3d5f0c1

Accordingly, Parliament has directed the suspension of operations on the works at Spithead, and promises soon to consider also the subject of a general transfer of the fortification appropriations to build armor-clad ships.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The English Parliament on Our War Developments.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The English Parliament on Our War Developments.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bdd5e56a-e9c9-5123-8b89-38f761bf8062,707,nyt://article/bdd5e56a-e9c9-5123-8b89-38f761bf8062
Editorial on difficulty of press in pinning down exact location of Fort Pillow on Mississippi River,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/18/archives/where-is-fort-pillow.html,Editorial on difficulty of press in pinning down exact location of Fort Pillow on Mississippi River,"-- Next to the question of the identity of JUNIUS, seems to be the difficulty of locating Fort Pillow. It is supposed to be situated somewhere on the banks of the Mississippi River; but no two of our cotemporaries, no couple of intelligent contrabands, no pair of reliable deserters, no brace of rebel captives, no two maps, though in other respects they may be duplicates, can be found to agree as to its definite position. They differ, as to its location, tens and even hundreds of miles from each other; and if Commodore FOOTE, like the rebels, shapes his movements entirely after newspaper statements, he will have some difficulty in discovering Fort Pillow, now that he has set out in search of it. The Herald, with its accustomed versatility and determination to suit every taste, has, in its various descriptions, located the fort along the entire line of the river from Columbus to Memphis, and the last Herald ""map"" we attempted to decipher, planted it almost in the heart of Memphis. The Tribune yesterday gave a remarkable diagram of the fort, which, if the cut be correct, must be a work worthy of the ditch-digging hero after whom it is named, and in the accompanying description said it was located ""just above the city;"" but gave scope to the imagination in the remark that ""there are (sic) in the rear of the fort a line of breastworks five or six miles long,"" and twelve hundred negroes working at it night and day -- who, by this time, must have carried the works up nearly to Columbus. The World yesterday said that the fort was ""situated about thirty-five miles from Memphis, near two villages called Randolph and Fulton ""-- which two villages, by the way, are about seventy miles above Memphis. The TIMES, of yesterday, located the fort at a point different from either of its cotemporaries, -- at which precise spot Commodore FOOTE is now throwing shot and shell. The country editors are, of course, fearfully obfuscated in regard to the situation of the fort; and those who are daring enough to mention the thing at all, conceal their ignorance in the Herald way, by scattering it along the river generally. If the loyal Press (not including the Herald) is thus ""mixed up"" in regard to the situation of Fort Pillow, the rebels who built the work ought to know something about it; and they say (we quote the Memphis appeal) that it is located on the cast bank of the Mississippi, seventy miles above Memphis, near the mouth of the Hatchie River. In order to give the City Press, our country cotemporaries, and our readers generally a correct idea of its situation, we give the map on the first page; and when the news comes -- as it soon will come -- that Fort Pillow is ours, the Herald, Tribune and World can also give their unhappy readers some authentic conception of its geographical bearings.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHERE IS FORT PILLOW?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHERE IS FORT PILLOW?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be1ab779-3fe7-51a9-9359-d36343687020,496,nyt://article/be1ab779-3fe7-51a9-9359-d36343687020
"A lecture upon this theme was delivered before a large audience of ladies and gentlemen, last evening, at the headquarters of the Young Men's Central Republican Committee, by STEUART L. WOODFORD, Esq., the former Chairman of the Committee. After alluding to the attack upon Fort Sumter, a year ago, and the extraordinary uprising of the North which immediately followed, and briefly sketching the history of the struggle thus far between loyalty and treason, Mr. WOODFORD proceeded to discuss the principles involved in the contest, and the questions growing out of the war that now present themselves for solution. The purpose of the rebellion was and is to destroy the Federal Union -- the purpose of the loyal men of the nation to perpetuate it. Is the purpose of preserving the Union and restoring the Federal authority over the entire National domain worth the effort necessary to its achievement? Will the desired end repay the labor and suffering, the treasure and blood at which alone it can be bought? These were questions which we need not fear to ask; rather were they questions to which we should make full and ready answer, for, unless they could be honestly, logically, and convincingly answered in the affirmative, this struggle would even yet be abandoned without achievement. The speaker proceeded to consider these questions at length in all their bearings, and argued with great force that the perpetuation of our liberties as citizens, our dignity, stability and power, as a people, our freedom from internal strife, our interests of every kind, economical, social, moral and intellectual, not only favored, but absolutely demanded that we should continue a united people, in no other way can the great problem of our National existence, which, in the language of WEBSTER, is to ""determine whether Governments can be stable as well as free,"" be successfully solved. The recognition of Southern independence to-day would be but a temporary truce, before a final and more deadly struggle -- a struggle which would mean, not a restoration of a Union, but iron-heeled subjugation. Nor would the new Confederacy remain long at peace among themselves. The doctrine of State secession, on which it is based, would give rise to new rebellions. Once break the charmed circle of the Union, and accustom the people to regard secession as a political right, and you steadily proffer inducements to treason. Intestine struggles would be speedily followed by foreign intervention, and even if they were not, war itself, when long continued and often repeated, as it would be among a number of different Republics, is fatal to liberty. The value of the Union then is the worth of the personal liberty and equality of rights which it secures; the worth of free speech, a free Press, and free worship; the worth of our ballot-boxes, our school-houses and our churches. Its value is the worth of our material and National growth, the worth of our farms, factories and forges, our railroads and telegraphs, our industry and commerce, our history and progress, our army and navy, our flag streaming in every wind and our power behind the flag -- in fine, it is worth all the possible cost, whatever it may be, of its complete restoration.

"-- The battle of Inkermann is known in the British army as ""The Soldiers' battle,"" and that of Pittsburgh Landing, or Shiloh, claims the same honor for the brave fellows who won it. Both battles were brought on by a surprise; both were fought by the victorious party at first against great odds; in both each party was strongly reinforced, and both were won, and hardly won, not by generalship, but by the hard fighting of rank, file and officers. In fact, the officers became soldiers in each, and distinguished themselves, not by tactics, but by personal valor. At Pittsburgh Landing the commanding General of the insurgent force fell while cheering on his men, and the final rout of the rebels was the result of a charge of six regiments of National troops, with the Major-General in command at their head. But this is not generalship. A commander-in-chief at a great battle has (according to all military rule) no business in the van of the army, charging sword in hand. Since war became an art, his place is a stationary one in the rear. Men like RICHARD the Lion-hearted were not great Generals, but great leaders. Their success depended upon their daring, their muscle and their skill in the use of arms. Generals win their way by will and brain. But the more cause for exultation on our part, when we see that shortcomings in generalship can be supplied by the personal bravery and daring of our men. Amid our reasonable dissatisfaction at the surprise and early discomfiture of our army at Pittsburgh Landing, we derive some consolation from the fact that one of the most important victories of the war may be justly called our Soldiers' battle.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/19/archives/the-soldiers-battle.html,,"-- The battle of Inkermann is known in the British army as ""The Soldiers' battle,"" and that of Pittsburgh Landing, or Shiloh, claims the same honor for the brave fellows who won it.

"In the House of Commons, on the 3d inst., Mr. OSBORNE moved that it be expedient to suspend the construction of the proposed forts at Spithead until the value of iron-roofed gunboats for the defence of our ports and roadsteads shall have been fully considered. Having observed that the statement made by Government upon the subject, a few days ago, was most unsatisfactory, the honorable member detailed at some length the steps which had been taken since the time of Mr. PITT to provide for the national defences. He quoted the opinion of the Royal Commissioners on National Defences, in 1859, that no fortification would be sufficient to arrest the progress of an iron-clad steamship, proceeding at a high speed, and read a letter from Admiral Sir R. DUNDAS, in which that gallant officer declared in the most emphatic terms that, for local purposes and the defences of harbors, iron-cased vessels would be necessary instead of permanent fortifications, and suggesting that a fleet of iron-clad gunboats should be at once provided. Mr. OSBORNE urged that our naval armament, as regarded guns, was in a most unsatisfactory condition, and asked Government if it was the fact that although &#163;3,000,000 of money had been spent upon Armstrong guns, the only gun we could use for penetrating armor-plates, was the old 68-pounder. He denied that the fortifications of Spithead would afford the slightest protection to merchant vessels running into the harbor there, in the event of a war. He referred to the recent exploits of the Merrimac and Monitor, observing that Capt. COOPER COLES, an Englishman, and not Mr. ERRICSSON, was the inventor of the principle upon which the Monitor had been constructed. The invention of Capt. COLES had been for some time before the heads of the Admiralty; had been inquired into and reported favorably upon, and then quietly shelved. Now that its value had been tested in the American waters he thought there was some probability that we should hear more of the floating battery invented by the gallant officer. The whole principle of modern warfare consisted of mobility, as against permanence. Our system of artillery was in such a state that it must be entirely reconstituted, and in reconstituting it he thought much greater attention must be paid to our naval armaments than they had hitherto received. In the opinion of Lord DUNDONALD it was little short of National incredulity to expect that, because we erected imposing fortifications, an enemy would come to them when they could operate elsewhere without the slightest risk. He regarded immense fortifications as nothing more than so many National weaknesses, and concluded by expressing a hope that, whatever might be the fate of his motion, Government would not plunge into a reckless expense for the erection of useless fortifications.

He quoted the opinion of the Royal Commissioners on National Defences, in 1859, that no fortification would be sufficient to arrest the progress of an iron-clad steamship, proceeding at a high speed, and read a letter from Admiral Sir R. DUNDAS, in which that gallant officer declared in the most emphatic terms that, for local purposes and the defences of harbors, iron-cased vessels would be necessary instead of permanent fortifications, and suggesting that a fleet of iron-clad gunboats should be at once provided. Mr. OSBORNE urged that our naval armament, as regarded guns, was in a most unsatisfactory condition, and asked Government if it was the fact that although £3,000,000 of money had been spent upon Armstrong guns, the only gun we could use for penetrating armor-plates, was the old 68-pounder. He denied that the fortifications of Spithead would afford the slightest protection to merchant vessels running into the harbor there, in the event of a war. He referred to the recent exploits of the Merrimac and Monitor, observing that Capt. COOPER COLES, an Englishman, and not Mr. ERRICSSON, was the inventor of the principle upon which the Monitor had been constructed. The invention of Capt. COLES had been for some time before the heads of the Admiralty; had been inquired into and reported favorably upon, and then quietly shelved. Now that its value had been tested in the American waters he thought there was some probability that we should hear more of the floating battery invented by the gallant officer. The whole principle of modern warfare consisted of mobility, as against permanence. Our system of artillery was in such a state that it must be entirely reconstituted, and in reconstituting it he thought much greater attention must be paid to our naval armaments than they had hitherto received. In the opinion of Lord DUNDONALD it was little short of National incredulity to expect that, because we erected imposing fortifications, an enemy would come to them when they could operate elsewhere without the slightest risk. He regarded immense fortifications as nothing more than so many National weaknesses, and concluded by expressing a hope that, whatever might be the fate of his motion, Government would not plunge into a reckless expense for the erection of useless fortifications.

It has been the fortune of the present war to inaugurate a revolution in naval warfare; and the likelihood seems to be that it is destined to introduce a similar revolution into one branch of land warfare. Certainly, if it would be rash to say that our experiments on the Southern fortifications show that such works are powerless against modern heavy artillery and improved projectiles, in the same way as the wooden walls were powerless against the resistless shock of the Merrimac, we are at least justified in claiming that these experiments must henceforth introduce fundamental modifications into the theory and practice of land defences. The account of the bombardment of Fort Pulaski, which we publish, will, no doubt, be read throughout Europe with an interest almost equal to that with which the battle of the Monitor and Merrimac was received. That affair has already prompted the British Parliament to order the suspension of operations on the works at Spithead, and they will soon consider the propriety of a general transfer of fortification appropriations to build armor-clad ships. The bombardment of Fort Pulaski will probably clinch their determination to do so, while the illustrations it will afford of the effects of our American ordnance and improved projectiles, will probably visit them with unpleasant suspicions whether even their stoutest ironsides will be able to resist the terrible impact of these new Yankee notions.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Reduction of Fort Pulaski Another Revolution in the Art of War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Reduction of Fort Pulaski Another Revolution in the Art of War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/85d3f5b0-6835-506c-8997-f23461a2c1b7,1223,nyt://article/85d3f5b0-6835-506c-8997-f23461a2c1b7

It appears from our own accounts that the rebel dispatches announcing the fall of the fort were remarkably correct -- only a little exaggerated in regard to the effects of our fire, to afford a better excuse for the surrender after so short a bombardment. A brief dispatch to the War Department states that we opened fire on the morning of the 10th inst. After thirty hours' almost continuous firing, a practicable breach was made, and preparations for storming were about to commence, when the rebel flag was struck. Our captures, beside the fort itself, are forty-seven guns, seven thousand shot 'and shell, forty thousand pounds of powder, three hundred and sixty prisoners, with their small arms and accoutrements, and a good supply of provisions.

C Breckinridge and other traitors,"It is devoutly to be deplored that the report of the capture of the arch-traitor JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE, at the battle of Pittsburgh Landing, has not proved true. The time has now come when their own personal safety will be the chief look-out of the leaders of the rebellion. They will presently seek to escape by flight the righteous vengeance which they feel in their guilty consciousness is prepared for them; but during the short time they still continue to play their sham part, whether in the field or at the rebel capital, their supreme aim will be to secure themselves from capture. This must not be permitted. Our Generals must bear in mind that the nation commits to them, as a special duty, to secure at whatever cost the live bodies of the leaders, civic and military, of the rebellion. If it is necessary, let them detail a posse comitatus for this special and exclusive purpose. It is better that ten thousand ordinary prisoners from the rank and file of the rebel army should be allowed to escape -- they will all be released as it is -- than that one DAVIS, BRECKINRIDGE, STEPHENS, YANCEY, TOOMBS, COBB or FLOYD, should be permitted to cheat the gallows. For them and their mates there is one sure fate -- be hanged by the neck till they are dead. This is the punishment provided for treason, and there is a growing conviction in the public mind that it must be fully meted out to the leaders of the rebellion that has lifted up its hand against the life of the Republic.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Traitor Breckinridge.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Traitor Breckinridge.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/117d2f06-f10f-5c93-b949-789ea4169398,587,nyt://article/117d2f06-f10f-5c93-b949-789ea4169398

The powerful State of Missouri would be a defence for Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas; the populous and warlike States of Kentucky and Tennessee, would form an invulnerable shield for Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina; while Maryland and Western Virginia would prevent the Northerners from crossing the Potomac or piercing the line of the Alleghany Mountains.

Editorial says success of North is due to its technical superiority,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/20/archives/the-success-of-the-north-due-to-its-mechanical-superiority.html,Editorial says success of North is due to its technical superiority,"When it was found, upon the outbreak of the rebellion, that the traitor FLOYD, as Secretary of War, had, in view, of the event, almost completely stripped us of arms and present means of defence or aggression, we predicted that in one short year the inventive genius of the North would devise new ones so superior to the old that the latter would be comparatively worthless in the hands of the rebels, and utterly unable to contend with our new instruments of war. Never was a predictionmore truly fulfilled. Not only are our new creations overwhelming the South, but they constitute for the whole world an era in modern warfare as important as that which followed the invention of gunpowder. The little Monitor, which hardly shows her deck above the water's edge, and which carries but two guns, is, according to English authority, the most powerful and destructive vessel afloat. Assuming that she could not be made fast to, and perhaps captured in this way, she might bid defiance to all the wooden ships composing the British navy. A well-directed shot from one of her guns would send the largest of them to the bottom, while her iron plates would be impenetrable to any metal they could, as now armed, throw. The fight in Hampton Roads has been echoed around the world, and dates the commencement of an entirely new system of naval warfare and fortifications. All nations, as far as their previous armaments, preparations for defence, and naval forces, are concerned, are instantly reduced to a common level. All are equally impotent or equally powerful. Past supremacy and prestige go for nothing; while these in future are again to be contended for, unless by general consent nations, as they must sooner or later at a similar crisis, consent to treat each other as friends, instead of enemies bent on mutual destruction through modes so terrible and expensive that even the successful party may sink under the incredible burden imposed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Success of the North Due to its Mechanical Superiority.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Success of the North Due to its Mechanical Superiority.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80a16fb2-b6bc-5a8e-8391-98c2ee3f670c,1008,nyt://article/80a16fb2-b6bc-5a8e-8391-98c2ee3f670c

" -- The manifestations of loyalty yesterday in Baltimore, indicate the wonderful changes which have taken place in that city within the past year. The 19th day of April, 1861, was one of the gloomiest days for the nation during that whole gloomy year. The first blood spilt in this rebel war was shed on that day; and Baltimore saw the soldiers from Massachusetts, marching for the defence of the National capital, assaulted by a bloodthirsty secession mob, bent on preventing their passage over the only railroad that led to Washington. The city seemed to be possessed of the devil, so mad was it with unreasoning excitement, so furiously was it bent on blood. No man dared say he was for the Union; no one dared display the flag of the Republic; none could lift a voice against the howling fiends who were in the ascendancy. The civil authorities were paralyzed, and, indeed, some of them were instigators and abettors of the rebels; and it seemed at that time as though, before we could get to the Capital, Baltimore would have to be laid in ruins, and our volunteers would have to hew their way through Maryland with the sword. The wrath of the North was raised high against the rebel city, and the people were willing to pay any price for its humiliation.

No man dared say he was for the Union; no one dared display the flag of the Republic; none could lift a voice against the howling fiends who were in the ascendancy. The civil authorities were paralyzed, and, indeed, some of them were instigators and abettors of the rebels; and it seemed at that time as though, before we could get to the Capital, Baltimore would have to be laid in ruins, and our volunteers would have to hew their way through Maryland with the sword. The wrath of the North was raised high against the rebel city, and the people were willing to pay any price for its humiliation. It was hardly possible to keep the citizens of Boston and New-York from rushing there en masse, ready to sell their lives at any price, so that the national honor be redeemed and the national flag avenged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A YEAR'S CHANGES IN BALTIMORE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""A YEAR'S CHANGES IN BALTIMORE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f347562-d842-591f-8742-d7af0c6ebe7b,586,nyt://article/8f347562-d842-591f-8742-d7af0c6ebe7b

They were generally announced with the stereotyped formula, ""The privateers at work again."" It was an unwelcome sound then and it was unwelcome to hear it again brought to us by the late arrival from Europe. But there is a class of people who do more harm than privateers -- and though it is a bad thing to hear that the privateers are again astir, it is worse to know that the croakers are at work again. We would almost rather hear that the Merrimac had come out, than that the croakers had made their appearance. But the dealings of this class have been one of the most troublesome things of all that have harrassed and hindered us in our National work through the past year, and has had its origin in the impatience of the people. That American characteristic which assumes that everything can be done in twenty minutes, was never displayed in more provoking prominence. Nor do we seem to improve in this direction much either. One would say that looking over the past year and calculating the immense amount of work that has been done, and the great results which have been accomplished, every one would feel how causeless has been the impatience which at times during the year could hardly be repressed, and that every one would learn and feel that our leaders, whether in the Cabinet or in the field, have but the interests of the country at heart, and are not men who will sacrifice those great interests selfishly to their own little ones, or who will adopt any course of action but the one which seems to them best adapted to bring about the best results.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Word for the Despondent.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Word for the Despondent.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ecf1b514-ead0-5f38-86cd-0537883a1bca,966,nyt://article/ecf1b514-ead0-5f38-86cd-0537883a1bca

Congress has done well in conferring the honor, for his gallant exploits richly merit it.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/21/archives/commander-foote.html,,"HIGHER GRADES WANTED IN THE NAVY. -- Gen. MITCHEL, the astronomersoldiler has resolved his single Brigadier star into the double star of the Major-General. Congress has done well in conferring the honor, for his gallant exploits richly merit it. His expedition is really one of the most brilliant and interesting episodes of the war; It has penetrated almost to the geographical centre of rebeldom. It ""cuts the great artery"" by which the rebels in the Southeast have communicated with the rebels in the Southwest. It enables us to threaten the rebel position at Corinth on the right, while HALLECK threatens it in front, and POPE, after taking Fort Pillow and Memphis, may threaten it on the left. But while Gen. MITCHEL has fairly won his honor, there is another man whose gallant exploits merit similar promotion, but who, from the imperfect organization of the arm of the service he has adorned, is cut off from receiving the reward which the whole country longs to see bestowed on him. We mean the gallant sailor, FOOTE, the hero of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Island Ten and Fort Pillow, who first organized victory on the Western waters, who cleared the rebellion out of three Western States, and who is now carrying the flag of the Union on its conquering course toward the Gulf. NOW FOOTE only ranks as Commander in the navy, a rank subordinate to that of Captain, which is the highest grade attainable by the American naval officer. Why for his magnificent services he has not been promoted this one possible, step, we are unable to conjecture. The slowness and stupor which seem to reign around Secretary WELLES are perhaps answerable. But having already earned this grade, what is there left for FOOTE and other equally active officers to gain by their future services? Nothing. A higher grade than Captain is the want of our navy; and there can be no better name for it than that known in the naval service of all European countries -- namely, Admiral, Even this grade is subdivided, in the English service, into various classes -- as Admiral of the White, Admiral of the Red, Admiral of the Blue.

It declares that this Court is to have jurisdiction of all claims for which the Government would be liable in law or equity, if it could be sued in a Court of justice, except such claims as Congress may by joint resolution specially declare shall be disposed of by act of Congress or otherwise, and that the judgment of the Court shall be final, subject to the right of appeal.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reconstruction of the Court of Claims.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reconstruction of the Court of Claims.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b0c2fe4-9c90-5549-8591-6e1ff33f07d7,932,nyt://article/5b0c2fe4-9c90-5549-8591-6e1ff33f07d7

Foote for his victories; Editorial holds Great Britain surprised by favorable condition of Union finances,"Private mercantile and banking letters from Europe continue to express the utmost surprise at the steady and comfortable condition of financial affairs in this country, pending a great and costly civil war. The writers could see how the machine of Government, for the conduct of the war, might be kept in motion for a brief season longer by resort to a scheme of paper-money finance, as authorized by the recent act of Congress; but the end of this, they moat assuredly believed, would be early and irremedial ruin, in the great depreciation of United States Notes, and the rise to panic premiums in the market value of gold, in exchange for such paper. Such, to be sure, was not the universal opinion among the English merchants connected with the trade of this country, as many of them are too intimately acquainted with the wonderful elasticity and material resources of our people, to be misled either by the false theories of their own journals, or the over-confident predictions of certain bullionists on this side, who opposed the legal-tender clause of the Loan and Treasury bill. But the burden of apprehension, for weeks pending the discussion of the bill in Congress, and for some time after its final passage and approval by the President, was to the effect that the country was to be ruined by a paper inflation, and the war brought to an inglorious end by a paper-money panic. The contrary was soon apparent here, and already begins to be appreciated on the other side. The wonder indulged in London at the ease in our foreign exchanges, and the nominal premium of only one or two per cent. on gold, continues to grow with each revolving week, and is reflected back by almost every steamer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our War Taxes The British Peace Budget.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our War Taxes The British Peace Budget.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e65cfb3-de42-5669-817b-3e734a5e0d93,1054,nyt://article/6e65cfb3-de42-5669-817b-3e734a5e0d93

In carrying out their plans, they have kept up for two years a boarding-house, where special care has been taken to provide for the refining and elevating influences of a Christian family, in this particular, they have been most successful. From their last report, we learn that fifty young women a have been accommodated during the year. A clergyman and his wife have charge of the house, and every attention is paid to the comforts and religious interests of those who reside there. To young women coming to the City to engage in any of the branches of pursuit open to females, such a provision is of inestimable value. No one knows how many such have been lost to society and to themselves for the want of just such a house. There is not a more interesting and valuable class among us than the young women who are engaged as teachers in our public schools, clerks in stores, seamstresses, engravers, and apprentices in our millinery and mantua establishments; and yet there is no class more unprotected or less cared for. Many of these have to struggle with poverty -- with hardships of every kind -- and it is not surprising that under their manifold discouragements they yield to temptation, and throw themselves away. We are glad to find that the ladies of this Association are devoting themselves particularly to this class. Their boarding-house has been quite successful, and many young women have enjoyed its benefits during the year, and will bless God forever that such a home was provided for them. Instead of one, there should be twenty such boarding-houses in the City.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ladies Christian Association of the City of New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ladies Christian Association of the City of New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b99eb3e-ca34-56cb-850c-d132e9647896,429,nyt://article/9b99eb3e-ca34-56cb-850c-d132e9647896

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/22/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- A Well-known opera at the commencement of a new season, when seasons in opera have been as plentiful and as brief as they have lately been, ordinarily presents but little to notice or to criticise. We may perhaps say that the house was crowded it will generally be so on the first night of a new season, unless the elements render this a matter of impossibility; we may possibly discover that the orchestra and chorus were a trifle stronger or a trifle weaker, better or worse, than they have usually been; and then with a brief compliment to the management and the artists we have previously known, or possibly the reverse, the business is ended. However, in the present instance, it is not in this manner than we can dispose of it. Last night Mr. GRAU, in commencing his thirteenth or fourteenth season, 1861-'62 -- we believe we are right, and apologize to our readers should we have made a computative error -- presented to his patrons a well-known opera; but with it, be gave us our old friend D'ANGRI as Magdalena, for the first time in three years -- the some two years since favorite of New-York, FERRI, in his fine part of Rigoletto -- a new tenore who has never previously appeared in this country, and offered us as conductor an old acquaintance who, however singularly he may conduct German opera, is never at fault with the composers of his own country, and may certainly lay claim to be considered the best Italian conductor we have ever had here; we allude to Signor MUZIO. Such a dish of novelty, actual and comparative, is rarely placed before the musical epicure, and most certainly has never been in so brief a season as the present one -- it is a season only of three nights. We should consequently be induced in any case to award Mr. GRAU the most liberal praise, even if his first night had been a comparative fiasco. It was very far from being so, and we may fairly say that if this was to be the invariable style of commencement for a brief season, we should be disposed to say the briefer the better, and might wish for a new one in every week of the musical year -- that part of it which lies between the commencement of October and the end or May.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/482e4735-5177-52c2-b331-036e120255e8,1451,nyt://article/482e4735-5177-52c2-b331-036e120255e8

Editorial on war in eastern Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/22/archives/the-last-scene-in-eastern-virginia.html,Editorial on war in eastern Virginia,"While the forces of Gen. McCLELLAN and those of JOHNSTON are face to face on the old battle-ground of Yorktown, the principal actors in a stupendous drama, it is worth while to note carefully the secondary characters and the by-play, which throw forward upon the forthcoming denouement much helpful light. There is little doubt that Gen. JOHNSTON opposes to the disciplined force of the Union General a force numerically its equal; and secured behind intrenchments and guns of the hugest magnitude. But there is every reason to believe that a very considerable proportion of Gen. JOHNSTON's army consists of raw recruits, the products of the recent conscription, men more apt at handling the tool of the mechanic or plowman than the weapon of the soldier, and whose reluctant coming to the field, and novice fears will insure their speedy flight when battle is fairly afoot. And to get this unseasoned army, the whole of Eastern Virginia has been drained. Beyond the handful of troops in the valley, the relics of the Western Virginian army on the one hand and of Gen. JACKSON's depleted and retreating army on the other, there is probably no mentionable aggregation of rebel troops anywhere away from the Yorktown peninsula. The enemy has massed his entire strength there, there to decide the fate immediately of Virginia, and, in the event, of the insurgent Government and cause throughout the entire South.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Last Scene in Eastern Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Last Scene in Eastern Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/513fe357-c782-57a4-ba24-5d5e78ec27e5,775,nyt://article/513fe357-c782-57a4-ba24-5d5e78ec27e5

Editorial on negotiations in progress with Great Britain for anti-slavery treaty,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/22/archives/a-new-antislavetrade-treaty.html,Editorial on negotiations in progress with Great Britain for anti-slavery treaty,"The execution of GORDON, last February, was a warning to all engaged in that abominable pursuit, that the man who now occupies the Presidential chair will not allow them, if caught, to escape with impunity. It was a demonstration to Europe that the party now in office have no sympathy for such offenders, and do not fear to enforce the law against any who violate it. But our first Magistrate has not been content with merely giving to the world the foregoing proof of his firmness and sincerity. More recently, in order to evince to Great Britain how earnestly he desires to cooperate with her for the annihilation of the Slave-trade, he authorized Mr. SEWARD to negotiate a new Treaty, to that effect, with Lord LYONS. The response of the British representative to the proposition of the Sacretary of State was prompt and cordial in the extreme. He stated that it was the ardent wish of Her Majesty's Government to act in concert will the President of the United States for the attainment of the object contemplated; assured Mr. S. that the English Government was fully convinced that the cooperation of the American Republic was indispensable to success; and expressed his readiness to enter at once on the negotiation in question. What was a labor of love to both diplomats did not require much time for completion; the new treaty was signed by Lord LYONS and Mr. SEWARD on the 7th inst.; and, immediately after, was submitted to the consideration of the Senate's Committee of Foreign Relations, who have reported favorably upon it. As the text has not yet been published, we cannot judge of the merits of the instrument; but it is said that, if its provisions be faithfully carried out, the odious commerce against which it is directed, will cease to exist within ten years. Should such, however, not be the case, another and more stringent treaty is to be substituted for the present one, and the efforts of the two Governments are not to be relaxed, till the iniquity has been eradicated.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Anti-Slave-Trade Treaty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Anti-Slave-Trade Treaty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/67bcb46d-7cb1-56d5-9494-66b3de1c7a87,484,nyt://article/67bcb46d-7cb1-56d5-9494-66b3de1c7a87

"-- Mr. ASHLEY, from the House Territorial Committee, some time since reported a bill for the organization of Arizona. It is sincerely to be hoped Congress will not adjourn without making the bill an act. Arizona is peculiarly the property of the North. Its mines have been explored and partially developed by northern men, employed by northern capital. Since the war commenced it has been in the possession of the rebels, and the great line of communication between the Atlantic and Pacific has been sundered. Recently it has become the seat of an active immigration. All the rebellious and disaffected, from California and Western Texas, have congregated there upon the Mexican frontier, ready for the execution of extensive fillibuster attempts upon Mexico. The opening of hostilities between the allied European Powers and the Mexicans, will no doubt be the signal of an irresistible invasion of these wretches from the North, who will take possession of the fairest territory along the Gulf of California and the Pacific. Government has duties to perform toward its own subjects, as well as to its allies. It has no right to withhold the exercise of its power in restoring property to its wronged owners; it has no right to leave Mexico exposed to the mischievous effects of our own inactivity or carelessness. Arizona should therefore be cleared of these desperadoes; Union men should be placed in possession of their own; and the cloud which hangs on the northern horizon of Mexico should be dissipated. And the first indispensable step in the fulfillment of these duties is the erection of Arizona into a National Territory. Congress, with a causeless haste, unknown before Congressmen were paid a yearly salary irrespective of the length of the session, is preparing to shove the business of the Spring over to the Winter.

This is a sublime spectacle, and, for that reason, all the more unintelligible to those who have reviled because they hated us, and who desired to chronicle the complete failure of the great experiment of humanity in America, which was in its best days, and is again destined to be a rebuke to the corruptions of the Old World, and be the source of unrest and change until everywhere a perfect harmony shall exist between Government and institutions and the welfare of the people. That a people of our own blood in the Old World should hail with such delight our assumed fall, has been the most striking scene in the grand drama. The impotence of our Government -- the rottenness of our institutions -- the demoralization of our people, and the utter impossibility of restoring the previous political status which promised so much in its inception, but which all enemies of social equality had assumed to be a contemptible failure, was proclaimed far and wide.

A regular weekly meeting of the Board of Aldermen was held last evening, and in the absence of the President of the Board, Alderman WOOD, Alderman O'KEETE of the Twelfth Ward was called to preside. Immediately after approving the minutes, under a special order, the communication of the Board of Water Commissioners, recommending water rates, was taken up for consideration. This matter was under discussion for nearly two hours and was finally adopted as presented, with the single exception of Section 11, under ""special rates,"" the charge for ""cart and other work horses,"" was amended so as to read ""$1 each,"" instead of ""$1 50 each,"" as recommended by the Commissioners. This was reduced because it was deemed unnecessarily high and oppressive to the poorer classes. The general rates for dwellings are arranged upon a basis of three cents for each one hundred gallons of water used.

In countries which is our days were but mere wilderness there are fights and defeats. There are desultory contests even so far off as New-Mexico, and the savages and backwoodsmen are gratifying their natural hatreds under the name of a new cause. But the Federals are fighting their way down the Mississippi just as they are making incuisions from the coast, and the doubtful attack we hear of near Memphis is one in which again their naval supremacy and their superior resources give them a right to victory. The last new land victory, however, startles us rather by its locality than by its magnitude.While we hear of Federal successes in distant States it seems that it has been necessary to resist an attack and to defeat a Confederate army even in the northeast of Virginia and on the banks of the Potomac. There is a great deal of Confederate American soil which does not lie upon the sea-coast, or upon the banks of great navigable rivers, and, if the Southerners are in earnest not to be conquered, the Northerners must do more than keep within reach of their gunboats. This is what the army of the Potomac is now about to attempt. In addition to the vasious expeditions which are creating diversions from the sea upon the east, and from the rivers on the west, Gen. MCCLELLAN is now advancing with an army of 80,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, and 180 guns. This is the result of all the energies of the North, and of all the mountain of debt which has been piled up. To clothe and pay and discipline these troops, and to provide them with the best arms which the world can yield, is the great achievement of the last ten mouths. We are now to see what this army will effect. Nothing in the South ought to be be to withstand it. It ought to march on till it finds an enemy, and to crush him wherever it finds him. All the armories of Europe have been open to the invaders -- every means of supply has been closed to the invaded. If they do not now succeed, they never can. They are a fully armed and disciplined host against an insurgent population. The state of that army, as it is described by our correspondent, represents the advantages of money and credit, and the command of the sea. Yet the contest is not over, not the victory [???] A Washington of a Wellington might [???] give victory to [???] side. Up to time, the [???] has produce no strategic[???] There has been no [???] no aggressive enterprise, no brilliant handling of troops, no prompt improvement of successes on either side.

Mr. BUTLER, upon a charge of treason, in lending aid and comfort to the enemy, was confined in Fort Lafayette by order of the recent Secretary of War. Subsequently released upon swearing the oath of allegiance, he resolved upon obtaining legal redress for the alleged wrongful detention, and taking advantage of Mr. CAMERON's presence in Philadelphia, procured his arrest and afterward instituted an action for damages.

But what is the authority of State tribunals to hold and try officers of the Government for fulfilling the orders of the President, is a question of higher import, and one likely to arise, in an endless variety of forms, before all the outstanding accounts of the rebellion have been audited.

Editorial on difficulties encountered by Foote and Pope in forcing way down Mississippi River to Gulf,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/24/archives/the-western-soldiers-hewing-their-way.html,Editorial on difficulties encountered by Foote and Pope in forcing way down Mississippi River to Gulf,"TO THE GULF -- FOOTE and POPE are finding considerable difficulty in forcing their way down the Mississippi River. But it is not Much over a month since FOOTE left Cairo with his gunboats, and already he is fighting a hundred and seventy-five miles down stream from that point. Between Cairo and Memphis therebels had constructed some half a dozen fortifications at the strongest natural points. The most formidable of these works were at Columbus -- and they were the first which the rebels were forced to abandon. With this position they also abandoned the fortifications at Hickman. Next came the forts and batteries at New-Madrid, which were captured by the gallant and indomitable troops of Gen. POPE. Next came Island No. 10, an invulnerable position selected by BEAUREGARD himself, which was captured by the combined navy and army of FOOTE and POPE. Now they are fighting away at Fort Wright, or, as it was formerly called, Fort Pillow. It took them twenty-three days to reduce Island No. 10, and they have now been at work ten days upon Fort Wright. But we learn that matters are progressing there as finely as could be desired. FOOTE is throwing big shells night and day among the rebels, and POPE is getting things ready to cross the river, and take their works in the rear and by assault. Nobody need doubt of soon hearing that the fort has fallen, and that FOOTE and POPE have bagged some six, eight or ten thousand additional rebels. Ten miles below Fort Wright, and on the same side of the river, there are other formidable works, known as Fort, Randolph. Then comes the real original Fort Pillow, and then Memphis. There are beside those named some minor works before reaching Memphis, both on the eastern and on the Arkansas sides; but none of them would retard our progress more than a day, if at all. When FOOTE and POPE reach Memphis, they will act in conjunction with Gen. HALLECK in a grand assault upon the rebel lines extending from Corinth to Memphis. It will not be long now before both parties are ready for this work, which will decide the fate of that part of the Mississippi and its valley which is yet in rebel hands.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WESTERN SOLDIERS HEWING THEIR WAY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WESTERN SOLDIERS HEWING THEIR WAY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/37c8639c-5d27-53be-9457-9e49956120ba,380,nyt://article/37c8639c-5d27-53be-9457-9e49956120ba

Editorial on prevalence of Confederate guerrillas in western Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/24/archives/rebel-guerrillas-in-western-virginia.html,Editorial on prevalence of Confederate guerrillas in western Virginia,"Rebel marauders and guerrillas are making their appearance, with the green leaves, in quite a number of the counties of Western Virginia. We hear of them suddenly springing up in some unexpected quarter, attacking a hamlet, or a Union camp, or a supply train, or executing vengeance upon some loyal citizen, or in some other way disturbing the peace of the country. Gen. FREMONT is doing his best to put these gangs down; but the work is one which, in the thinly-peopled mountain regions of Western Virginia, can neither be done easily nor quickly, and the consequence is civil turmoil and social insecurity. It is doubtful whether it is possible to destroy effectually these rebel guerrillas before the great rebel army in Eastern Virginia has been defeated. While the fate of the State appears yet doubtful -- while the rebel army is able to hold Richmond, and check our advance at half-a-dozen different points -- while the laws of the rebel Confederacy are in force over three-fourths of Virginia, and nominally over the whole of it -- there will be perpetual attacks on our outposts, and efforts to annoy and harass the ""invaders"" wherever it is possible. But when, by the defeat and expulsion of the rebel army, it is clearly seen that the State is irrevocably in the Union, the resident rebels will learn that nothing can be gained to their cause by the ravages of these robbers, and they end the local magistracy will unite with the National authorities in [???] to put them down. This is the way things have worked in Missouri. Last Fall it appeared as though the whole of that vast State was about to be overrun by rebel guerrillas. They seemed to spring up from the ground in North Missouri as well as in Southern Missouri. They tore up railroad tracks, fired bridges, ravaged towns and slaughtered Unionists, until it looked for a time as though the State were to suffer from a reign of anarchy. But since the rebels were chased southward, since PRICE was driven from Springfield, and he and all his comrades were defeated at Pea Ridge, the State has enjoyed almost entire quiet. Here and there a small gang of marauders is occasionally heard of, but the exercise of a little wholesome severity is disposing of these rapidly enough. So, in all probability, it will be in Virginia. When the rebel army is expelled from the State, a short period of martial law will dispose of the guerrillas. Until that time, it is hardly worth while for Gen. FREMONT to be at any very great trouble or expense in vain attempts to suppress them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL GUERRILLAS IN WESTERN VIRGINIA,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL GUERRILLAS IN WESTERN VIRGINIA,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de0d134b-884b-5a48-a30e-c7be68007326,445,nyt://article/de0d134b-884b-5a48-a30e-c7be68007326

"Gov. CLARK, of North Carolina, was to consult and truly represent the opinion and feeling of the people of that State, we have no doubt that he would do precisely what the telegraph this morning attributes to him -- make proposals to Gen. BURNSIDE for the surrender of the State. The mass of the North Carolinians never were rebellious any more than the mass of the Kentuckians; and was North Carolina geographically located as is Kentucky, she would probably have as many regiments fighting for the Union to-day as has Kentucky. She was engineered out of the Union by a small but powerful and adroit body of secession politicians; she was forced out by the tremendous pressure brought to bear upon her from South Carolina on one side and Virginia on the other; she was compelled to join the new Confederacy on account of her geographical situation, because otherwise she would be politically isolated from all the surrounding States; she was swindled into secession by a fraud as palpable, direct and atrocious as fraud could be. The State Legislature of 1860 provided that no ordinance dissolving the connection of North Carolina with the Union ""should have any force or validity until it should have been submitted to and ratified by a majority of the qualified voters of the State;"" and yet to the present day the secession ordinance has not been submitted to popular vote at all -- so that the State is not legally out of the Union even by its own provisions. It is not much over a year since the North Carolina delegation in the National Congress telegraphed to the then Governor to quell at once all incipient insurrectionary movements, that thus the State might be ""saved from being drawn into the vortex of certain ruin."" The advice was unheeded by the secession Governor; and he himself ordered the seizure of Fort Macon and the other fortifications which are now, one by one, again falling into our hands. The ruin which her Union representatives foresaw, as the consequence of disunion, has now overtaken her. Nearly the whole of her seaboard and the cities thereon are now in our hands; many of her citizens are fugitives from their homes; a great part of her population has been forced to fight the bloody battles of JEFF. DAVIS; her commerce is ruined; and she is threatened with the devastations of a retreating rebel army. If Gov. CLARK was wise, and would save to his native State what yet remains of honor and prosperity, he would at once give up the rebellion, as it is reported he has done, and as is truly the case, proclaim the State to be yet in the Union. But we do not believe that under present circumstances he has done anything of the kind, nor that he will be likely to do so until the rebel army in Virginia is defeated. After that event, such a story as now reaches us would be extremely plausible.

"length of time that has elapsed since we got reliable news from the army and navy supposed to be besieging New-Orleans or its outposts has made a good many people suspect that BUTLER, PORTER and FARRAGUT had some other work on hand than the ostensible work of capturing the Crescent City. It is nearly five weeks since it was semi-officially announced from Washington that the City had actually been captured, and was in possession of our troops; but the announcement was undoubtedly ahead of the fact. Since that time, however, we have had rumors from rebel and other sources, of the capture of Fort Pike, guarding the entrance to Lake Ponchartrain; of the capture of Fort Jackson, same distance above the debouchure of the Mississippi, and of naval movements against other of the City's defences. At the present time those rumors are multiplying; but there are none of them coherent or satisfactory. Yesterday we gave an extract from the private letter of an officer, saying that seven of our bomb-ketches and three gunboats had gone up the river, and passed beyond Fort Jackson, on their way to New-Orleans. We have this morning a statement, by way of Havana, to the effect that the rebels had abandoned both Forts Jackson and St. Philip without removing their cannon, and that there was nothing to prevent our fleet from sailing directly up to New-Orleans. A third statement, from a correspondent at Havana, mentions that Gen. BUTLER's nephew, who had just arrived there, reported that our forces would open fire on the 14th upon the forts guarding the city. It would seem as though these rumors, coming from so many different sources, must have some basis of truth to them, and that an attempt either has been or is to be made to capture the great city of the South. We said, some days ago, that we doubted whether the small military force under Gen. BUTLER would actually occupy a place of the size of New-Orleans; but if our army and navy succeed in seizing all the lake and river defences of the city, and in capturing the railroad running north, and the short line running west, (and by these roads the city's supplies are now mainly brought,) it will not be long before we shall have a capitulation. It is probably because he is slowly and cautiously doing this work, that we do not hear much from him of the operations going on. The city must be now nearly devoid of fighting rebels, as BEAUREGARD has ordered all the troops to Corinth, except, we believe, JOURDAIN's negro regiment. The people who remain are mostly non-combatants, Creoles, Yankees, foreigners, women and slaves. These will not hold out long when Gen. BUTLER has them at his mercy. It is to be hoped he will have this work done, and the Northern Railroad in his possession, and the river completely in his control, before the hordes soon to be defeated by Gen.

"Amelia Yeaton vs. Aaron Clafflin et al. -- The defendants in this action are the well-known firm of Clafflin, Mellen & Co. The plaintiff sues to recover the possession of goods taken to the amount of $2,500. The defence set up is that the defendants obtained judgment against one Thomas S. Brooks, who is the son-in-law of the plaintiff, and that the property for which this action was brought was his property and did not belong to the plaintiff.

The entire business is at a temporary stand-still, awaiting the result of the made case already before the Courts, to test the constitutionality of the new law. As on the previous evening, there was an entire compliance with the law at all the smaller establishments, and the larger ones dropped this or that feature so as to keep within the letter of the statute. But the concert men are only defeated, not conquered. They despond but do not despair. They place a firm reliance upon the skill and ability of the legal talent which they have employed, and, with knowing wink and meaning smile, (both kinds of smile,) predict that, ere another sun sets, one of the highest Courts of the State will have decided that, since liquor-selling, theatrical performances and pretty waiter-girls are separately legal and proper, that when conjoined they cannot be prohibited by any constitutional statute. ""Why,"" they say, ""we can get a license, and the City takes our money, for either the performances or liquor-selling; and some of the most respectable establishments have employed waiter-girls. How is it that, when we combine all three in one business, we can be punished for misdemeanor?""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CONCERT SALOON REFORM.; Prolongation of the Eclipse The Status Quo Maintained Waiting for the Constitutionality of the Law to be Tested Judge Barnard to Decide To-day, & c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CONCERT SALOON REFORM.; Prolongation of the Eclipse The Status Quo Maintained Waiting for the Constitutionality of the Law to be Tested Judge Barnard to Decide To-day, & c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'STREETS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-04-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2cec6269-44a4-58ff-afe3-d3975cdd93ab,843,nyt://article/2cec6269-44a4-58ff-afe3-d3975cdd93ab

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. GRAU closed his season last night at the Academy, and, we regret to say, closed it when there was every prospect of his continuing it highly successfully. But so it is. Just when the ball comes into most of our hands, we neglect to cast it, and why should an operatic manager be expected to do differently from the remainder of the world. ""La Favorita"" was the opera given lastnight, and ELENA D'ANGRI made her debut in New-York in the part of Leonora. It would seem that this opera, originally written for a mezzo soprano, is always a favorite opera with contralti. Why this should be, it is at present scarcely necessary for us to inquire, although it is, perhaps, partially due to the fact that Madame STOLZ originally created so great a sensation in the rule of Leonora, and partly to the chances which it affords the operatic actress. We say the ""actress,"" because it is a noticeable fact that, with but few exceptions, contralti are generally good actresses. It is, therefore, we suppose, upon this account, that Madame D'ANGRI has added the opera to her repertoire, and achieved so thorough a success in it. We, indeed, without any exception, must regard her as the best Leonora that has yet appeared in this City. Her share in the duet with the King, ""In questo solo,"" in the second act, was the first thing which led us to expect this. It was charmingly vocalized, with a tenderness which was scarcely to be expected, and gave us a pleasant hint of the manner in which she would sing the remainder of the opera. ""Omlo Fernando,"" though most ungraciously cut in two by the applause of the indiscriminating portion of the audience, was rendered with consummate taste and feeling, lacking, if anything, in nobility of style, for which she made more than amends by the deep feeling she threw into it. In the last act she was grand, and was magnificently supported by BRIGNOLI, whose ""Spirto Gentil"" was exquisitely rendered. Indeed, after hearing any other tenori, we are always compelled to admit that BRIGNOLI is the best of them we have had for many years in this country. TOMBESI may make a success, as STIGELLI and others have done before him. But they cannot displace our old favorite, who, in spite of his cool laissez-aller mode of strolling upon the stage, and laziness as a vocalist, is indisputably the pleasantest voiced of tenori. We have also to speak very warmly of FEREI, whose King in this Opera is very finely sung. He was in good voice, and somewhat eschewed that constant tremolo, which is one of his most remarkable virtues or vices. SUSINI was unfortunately suffering from a cold -- too ill to appear -- but was replaced, by BARILI, who, although by no means so good as the vocalist whose place he took, managed to get through Balthazzar acceptably. The house was crowded, as may be inferred from what we said at the commencement of our notice, and we were gratified that it should be so, as this is decidedly the best operatic season, musically, which Mr. GRAU has this year given us.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/26/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. GRAU closed his season last night at the Academy, and, we regret to say, closed it when there was every prospect of his continuing it highly successfully.

In the last act she was grand, and was magnificently supported by BRIGNOLI, whose ""Spirto Gentil"" was exquisitely rendered. Indeed, after hearing any other tenori, we are always compelled to admit that BRIGNOLI is the best of them we have had for many years in this country. TOMBESI may make a success, as STIGELLI and others have done before him. But they cannot displace our old favorite, who, in spite of his cool laissez-aller mode of strolling upon the stage, and laziness as a vocalist, is indisputably the pleasantest voiced of tenori. We have also to speak very warmly of FEREI, whose King in this Opera is very finely sung. He was in good voice, and somewhat eschewed that constant tremolo, which is one of his most remarkable virtues or vices. SUSINI was unfortunately suffering from a cold -- too ill to appear -- but was replaced, by BARILI, who, although by no means so good as the vocalist whose place he took, managed to get through Balthazzar acceptably. The house was crowded, as may be inferred from what we said at the commencement of our notice, and we were gratified that it should be so, as this is decidedly the best operatic season, musically, which Mr. GRAU has this year given us.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a01d3c61-c5c8-54d3-81d7-5a9b844da774,819,nyt://article/a01d3c61-c5c8-54d3-81d7-5a9b844da774

At these points they have concentrated all their available forces in the two sections. We certainly ought to be well satisfied with their decision. Upon both battle-fields it is vastly easier for the North to concentrate and mass its forces, than for the rebels. Yorktown is upon the extreme northern verge of the territory held by them. The supplies necessary for the maintenance and equipment of their army there are drown from distant regions, and necessarily at great cost and labor. By having command of the sea, Yorktown is as accessible to the North, as Staten Island or Newport. The rebels consequently offer battle where we are the strongest and they, (not taking into consideration the particular position occupied,) the weakest. If their army is defeated, it is destroyed. We do not have to exhaust our forces by marching hundreds of miles by land, over wretched roads, through almost impenetrable forests and regions traversed by unnavigable but unfordable rivers to attack them, where their defeat might only serve to transfer the contest to a more distant field, but where a reverse to our own army might prove fatal to it, surrounded, as it would be, by a hostile population, and unsupported by reserves. It was by avoiding a general engagement, and constantly retreating, that the Russians drew NAPOLEON so far into the interior of the Empire that, in this end, hardly a man of his vast hosts escaped.

"-- We have at last definite news of the commencement of naval operations against the outposts of New-Orleans. The report has all the usual rebel exaggerations, but there is no doubt of the truth of the main fact which it announces it does not appear yet what day the work was really commenced.

By the news this morning it looks as though the guns and mortars opened if earnest upon Fort Jackson on Tuesday of this week. The fire was kept up all Tuesday night, and was still active on Wednesday, when the dispatch is dated. No casualties are reported to our fleet, and it may be taken as certain that if we had suffered any serious damage it would have been described and magnified in the most fearful manner.

The rebels in the fort, however, are said to be still cheerful, and assert that they can stand it as long as we can. That is certainly a remarkable case of cheerfulness under adverse circumstances, and if the fire-eaters can really swallow 13-inch shell as long and as fast as FARRAGUT and PORTER can furnish them, the reduction of the fort by that means is hopeless. But this is precisely the kind of bluster that in every case has preceded a rebel defeat or surrender.

Editorial says 2 great chains stretched across Mississippi River have not stopped Union gunboats,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/27/archives/the-great-rebel-chains-on-the-mississippi-river-the-rebels.html,Editorial says 2 great chains stretched across Mississippi River have not stopped Union gunboats,"-- actual iron chains, mind you, composed of ordinary links -- across the Mississippi River: one of them sixty miles below New-Orleans, to keep us from ascending the river; and the other at Columbus, a thousand miles above New-Orleans, to prevent our descending the river. The one at Columbus was stretched across by Gen. PILLOW, of immortal memory; but like the other military efforts of that old peacock, it proved a wretched failure -- all that remains of it now being a piece a few yards in length lying on the river bank at Columbus, while the gunboats which it was intended to stop are operating a hundred and fitly miles below. The other chain, that near the mouth of the river, would seem to have proved an equally great failure -- that is, if we may credit the report that comes from the South, and which we publish this morning, that one of our gunboats has passed up the river beyond Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. The chain stretched from shore to shore between these fortifications was composed of cables stolen from the ships in the harbor of New-Orleans, at the time of the breaking out of this rebellion. It was suspended within a few feet of the surface of the river by rafts, which, in turn, were held in their places by guys, running up stream, and fastened to the neighboring trees. This chain was supposed to be formidable, because our boats must approach it from below, and in striking if would have to push it up stream, having both the strength of the chain and the twice of the current to contend with. The rebels do not inform us whether our gunboats pushed the chain up stream, or ""sank it to the depths below,"" as Com. PORTER said he would do, or ran over it, or crept under it. But it was passed, it would seem, in some way. New-Orleans had three great agencies of defence -- the rebel forts, the rebel chain, and the rebel gunboats. Two of them are now virtually disposed of. It only remains to seize or sink the gunboats, lick the regiment of negroes which guard the city, lick the ""Home-guard"" militia, and the city is ours. The New-Orleans papers have often descanted, in grandiose style, upon the impregnability of this chain. They can now keep up their spirits for a short time by descanting upon the impregnability of JOURDAINE's Africans, and of HOLLINS' ram, Manassas.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GREAT REBEL CHAINS ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

Editorial says Texas guerrillas are helping Confederates fight war in other Southern States because theirs is only state not occupied by Union soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/27/archives/the-vagrant-rebels-of-texas.html,Editorial says Texas guerrillas are helping Confederates fight war in other Southern States because theirs is only state not occupied by Union soldiers,"-- Texas is the only State of the rebel Confederacy which has not National soldiers on its soil, and the National flag unfurled somewhere within its limits. In every other State, from Virginia to Arkansas, from Tennessee to Florida, we have gained a military foothold, and are continually widening our borders. Texas, in the meantime, has sent out a large number of rebel soldiers to fight the battles of JEFF DAVIS. We have encountered Texas rebels in Arizona, in New-Mexico, in Missouri, in Arkansas, in Kentucky, in Tennessee, and in Virginia. Their own State having no need for their services, they have wandered off wherever there was the scent of blood, or a prospect of plunder. These Texas troops are mostly organized as cavalry regiments -- if they may be said to be organized at all. They are must accomplished, however -- quite equal to the Tartars -- great fighters, ferocious, wild and savage, and for certain kinds of work unequaled by any men in the country; they are also more experienced in war than any other of the rebels, from the long fightings with Indians, with the Mexicans, and with each other. The only class of men able to cope with them in their own style were the men of the Lane expedition, which is now completely broken up. It may, however, be an advantage to us that we have got the greater part of the Texas fighters outside oftheir own State, and this side of the Mississippi, and are likely to encounter them en masse at Corinth and in Virginia. It will be much easier for us to defeat them there than it would be in Texas. Twenty thousand guerrillas spread over the vast area of that State would be very hard to cope with or to subdue. Guerillaism in the other Gulf States is almost an impossibility, and in the Border States such a mode of war is opposed to the character and interests of the people. But we have now got the Texas guerillas in such a position that they will have to fight in a way most disadvantageous and disagreeable to themselves; and where, instead of hand-to-hand encounters with knife and shot gun, they will encounter rifled cannon and iron-plated gunboats. When this characteristic semi-savage Texas element is disposed of, it will be a comparatively easy matter to deal with the remnant of ordinary rebels now left in the Lone-Star State.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE VAGRANT REBELS OF TEXAS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE VAGRANT REBELS OF TEXAS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2e6450eb-84a4-50c5-b93b-64a6ddeb1b00,406,nyt://article/2e6450eb-84a4-50c5-b93b-64a6ddeb1b00

These things have given place, and with functionaries dethroned abuses have been abolished and vermin taught to feed on less congenial diet, viz.: poison, which has so disgusted them with the present administration that they have left for parts unknown. Other abuses have been overcome, and economical improvements have superseded them, the last year showing up a goodly array of such. Among these is the little printing office, which gets off, ""with skill and dispatch,"" all the small printing, such as labels, cards, permits, &c., pertaining to the different departments of charity and correction under the Commissioners. The labor of the printing office is all done by Workhouse hands, which saves the salaries which would otherwise be required for outside assistants.

SMITH, the melancholy fact of whose death we learn from the West, was on officer of unsurpassed courage and skill; and his loss at the present time will be a great blow to the army of the Southwest, by the men of which he was beloved as was no other commanding officer. Gen. SMITH was a regular army officer, and a Pennsylvanian by birth, being a son of the late Dr. SAMUEL B. SMITH, of Philadelphia. He graduated at West Point in 1825, as brevet Second Lieutenant of Artillery. He had successively several responsible positions in the Military Academy up to the year 1842. At the beginning of the Mexican war he held the rank of Captain. He was distinguished in the battles of Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterey, Contreras, and Cherubusco, being breveled for each, the last brevet being that of Colonel. In 1854 he received regular promotion as Major of the First Artillery, and in 1855 was made Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tenth Infantry, which rank he held up to last year. At the beginning of the war, he received a commission as Brigadier-General, and was assigned to the command of the Forces at Paducah, Ky., where he acted efficiently and with much vigor. He led his splendid command from there to Fort Donelson, where he was fatally wounded; and his conduct on that great occasion saved for us the day. His heroism and his masterly still was then duly chronicled in these columns. When the army moved up the Tennessee, he accompanied it, and for a time was in chief command. His health, however, got low, and at last he sank so low that he was unable to take the field at the battle of Pittsburgh. He died at Savanna, Tenn., on Friday, the 25th inst. from the effects of a contused wound received at the storming of Fort Donelson. The country and the army, as well as his own family, will suffer a great and deplorable loss in the death of this truly gallant and distinguished soldier.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Gen.

The Commissioners appointed by the Governor in relation to iron-clad vessels, in an interview with Capt. ERICSSON, found that from his engagements with the General Government, he could not furnish plans and specifications for the State. It was also ascertained that two of the iron-clad steamers of the Government would be built in Massachusetts, and believing it inexpedient to come into competition with the General Government, it was thought best to plate such vessels partially built as are suited to that purpose, and they have great confidence in a plan of armor covering proposed by Lieut.

"The Southern newspapers are amusing the rebel soldiers' leisure by tales to the effect that Gen.

It is astonishing that, after this feat, the redoubtable HUMPHREY is so liberal and lenient as still to permit Gov. ANDREW JOHNSON to rule in the Capital of Tennessee. It is remarkable that he and SMITH do not at once lead a small expedition to the banks of the Tennessee River, and destroy -- say, by torpedoes -- the gunboats on which HALLECK's army has taken refuge, und thereby rid the State at once of the whole Union army. It is highly probable, however, that the prodigious HUMPHREY is making up for time lost in the gaps and hills of Eastern Kentucky, and is devoting himself entirely to gormandizing in his new quarters. He must have attained to a ghostly leanness during his long Winter's campaign among the barren and dreary Cumberland ridges, aggravated also by the two fearful drubbings given him in January and March by Gen.

"A sermon was preached last Sunday by Rev. N. L. RIOE, D.D., of this City, in which he took occasion to define his position on the great question of the day.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/27/archives/the-clergy-and-the-crisis-rev-dr-rice-on-secessionhe-defines-his.html,,"A sermon was preached last Sunday by Rev. N. L. RIOE, D.D., of this City, in which he took occasion to define his position on the great question of the day. He took as his text, ""Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."" Dr. RICE proposed to depart from his ordinary course and speak upon a subject which he seldom deemed it expedient to introduce into the pulpit, viz.: The state of the country and his own position with reference to it. He did this not for the purpose of stirring up the patriotic feeling of his people. It was wholly unnecessary at such a time as this, when that feeling was just as intense and earnest as it was desirable it should be. Why stir up patriotism when it it is already at the burning point? Patriotism is not a Christian virtue. It is just as natural to love one's country as to love one's home. Multitudes love both who are not Christians. Yet patriotism may be guided and directed by Christian principles. Indeed, it sometimes happen that that which is natural is too strong. Parents sometimes commit a sort of idolatry in the love which they lavish on their children; and men sometimes, in their ardent love of country, forget their country's interest. Christianity serves to moderate those natural feelings when too strong, and make men not only patriots, but, what is nobler philanthropists -- lovers of all mankind. It is remarkable, that there is no command in the Bible to love our country: so that, if one were about to preach upon that subject, he would be perplexed about a text. If patriotism seems not to exist in any instance, it is because depravity has destroyed natural affection. So, if you would restore natural affection, you must elevate the morals; if you would bring back a man's love of country, restore his moral sense. If we have morals and religion, patriotism will not be wanting.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CLERGY AND THE CRISIS.; Rev.

"-- The affair at Elizabeth City has furnished an illustration of what manner of news it is the public gets when left to the War office, unaided by reporters of the Press. The first story furnished by the censorship at Fortress Monroe was a rebel rumor, obtained at Norfolk, that a portion of Gen.

Then, through the same channel, though not from Norfolk, came a statement that the Union force was victorious, and the enemy badly beaten. A series of obscure and contradictory rumors followed, one of which, apparently authentic, represented a number of National soldiers, wounded in the conflict, as having reached Norfolk, and as awaiting exchange. This was not symptomatic of victory. The public knew not what to think. At last we know that the National troops did sustain a repulse. Under Gen.

Some months since the Sub-Treasurer, Mr. CISCO, wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury, calling his attention to the fact that the building at present occupied as the Sub-Treasury, was inadequate to the wants of the Department, and urging that some provision should be speedily made for his better accommodation. The proposition then made was, that the Government should purchase or lease the building at present known as the Merchants' Exchange, to which the business of the Custom-house should be transferred. It was argued that the building was much better adapted for the purpose intended than any in the City, being large, commodious and well located. It was shown that it contained a much greater space than the building now occupied as the Custom-house; in fact, that it was sufficiently large for the accommodation, not only of the Collector and Naval Officer, but also of the Surveyor and Appraisers. It was also proposed that should the Merchants' Exchange be occupied by the Government for the purposes indicated, the present Custom-house should be transformed into the Sub-Treasury. These propositions met with favor with the authorities at Washington, and the result of the deliberations on the subject was that Mr. S.M. CLARK, acting engineer in charge of the Treasury Department, was sent to New-York to examine the building it was proposed to obtain. In course of time the authorities decided to lease the Merchants' Exchange, and the bargain was quickly made with the owners on terms considered advantageous to the Government. By removing the business of the Custom-house to this building, and that of the Sub-Treasury to the present Custom-house, the expenses of the Government are, we believe, by the estimates of Mr. CISCO, diminished instead of increased, as many supposed they would be.

"-- Our last intelligence from Mexico has points of importance beyond those already noticed in our columns. So impatient were the French to set out on their expedition against the Republic, that they could not even wait till after the conferences which were to open on the 15th, but called a meeting of the allied Plenipotentiaries at Orizaba, and announced their determination to commence at once their march toward the capital. To this the English and Spanish objected, and began to make preparations for a return to Vera Cruz, thus terminating the European coalition for the subjugation of Mexico. It appears, however, that, although England and Spain have withdrawn from the enterprise, France is not without an ally. She has found in the very heart of the Commonwealth, confederates more unscrupulous, and merciless, than were the foreigners who have just abandoned her. For the sake of recovering power, the Reactionist Party, with ALMONTE at its head, has thrown itself into the arms of the invaders, and raised the standard of rebellion against the Government -- the Republic. A programme has been also issued by the rebel leader, doubtless, with the sanction of his patrons, which will give us some idea of his audacity, and of the designs of the aggressors.

Of course the man to be thus exalted and trusted is to be no other than ALMONTE himself; but whether he is to be rewarded for his treason by being simply raised to the First Magistracy of the Mexican Union, or by being constituted its Dictator, like SANTA ANA, or by being placed in the throne which was intended for the Austrian, does not as yet clearly appear. It is probable, however, that, while NAPOLEON is about the thing, he may as well transform Mexico into a kingdom, and put its crown upon the head of its protege, as invest him with every attribute of tyranny save the title. Would not that of NEPOMUCENO the First sound as fairly and become the page of history as well as the name of MAXIMILIAN?

"The population of New-Orleans, by the last census, was 168,472. This has, undoubtedly, been largely decreased since the rebellion. The commerce of the city, which was its main support, has been totally ruined, and thousands of the people have fled to the country, or anywhere that they could find a scanty subsistence, while other thousands have been drafted into the rebel army. The city is the emporium of the Mississippi Valley, and is situated on the left bank of the river, about a hundred miles from its mouth. The older portion of the city is built on the convex side of a bend of the river, which here sweeps around in a northeast, east, and southeast course. From this location it derives its familiar soubriquet of the ""Crescent City."" In the progress of its growth up stream, the city has now so extended itself as to fill the hollow of a curve in the opposite direction, so that the river front presents an outline somewhat resembling the letter S. It stretches or straggles along the bank of the liver some six or seven miles, with an average depth of one mile, it only being possible to build on the narrow strip of land lying immediately on the edge of the river, the highest point being in front, and then rapidly sinking in the rear until lost in interminable swamps. In the rear of New-Orleans, a half a male, perhaps, beyond the suburbs, is the Metarie ridge, a narrow strip of high land two or three feet above high water mark, of an average of a half mile in width; then you come again to the swamp, which continues to the shores of the take beyond, almost as dense as any in the surrounding valley, gloomy and peculiar and uninhabited, except by alligators and bitterns. The front of New-Orleans is of course on the river, and from the peculiarity of the country, and the levee which serves to protect the city from being overflowed by the Spring rise, our fleet, when it reached the city, must have been above the ground on which the city is built, and commanded it as from an eminence. This circumstance, with the fact that the breaking of the levee by a cannon-shot, or a few minutes' work with the spade, would submerge the whole place, makes New-Orleans, with its defenceless rear, the weakest and least protected place of any commercial importance in the world. The defences of the city were so fully and, as the event has proved, accurately described in the TIMES of Monday last, that it is not necessary now to rehearse the facts.

"PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY. -- The fifth and last Concert given by this Society came off on Saturday evening at Irving Hall, under the conductorship of THEODORE EISFELD. It was, as usual, crowded by those who love, or pretend that they love classical music, while the dilettanti of the City, whether possessed of a profound critical taste or not, clustered around the entrances to the hall in true dilettante fashion. The programme was sufficiently good, although its arrangement was ill-judged. As an example of this, we may mention that LIPINSKY's ""Concerto Militaire,"" for the violin, (executed cleverly by BRUNO WOLLENHAUPT,) was placed immediately after SCHUBERT's Symphony in C, and lost in effect considerably by the ridiculous contrast enforced between the merit of the two compositions. The Symphony, which is fine in conception, and very delicately treated by the master, is full of coloring and vitality, and was very satisfactorily rendered by Mr. EISFELD, who is one of the best conductors -- if not the best -- that Society has had since it was first instituted. It, however, suffered from the want of sufficient rehearsals, as we should presume. We may point out that the third movement needed a more sedulous attention to its nuances, and was deficient in the requisite amount of light and shade, which SCHUBERT so peremptorily demands from his translators; while portions of the fourth --which is a very difficult study for the stringed instruments -- went rather unsteadily. These two compositions constituted the First Part of the Concert. The Second commenced with ""Orphee,"" a Poeme Symphonique, by LISTZ, which was played for the first time. This pleased us much better than we had expected, and we believe we are right in stating that this was the general impression of the audience. It is a brief study, somewhat slight in general character, and not so pronouncedly personal as most of the master's works ordinarily are. Then came MOZART's ""Concerte No. 8, in D,"" for the piano. This was played by Mr. RICHARD HOFTMANN, who wants largeness of style to render the greater composers as massively as they demand. Probably on this account, it went off somewhat tamely. As a compensation for this, we had a concertino for the trombone, written by FELICIEN DAVID, which took us by surprise, as, from his instrumental writing for the violin, we are free to own that we had by no means anticipated so striking and talented a work. But, if the composer agreeably disappointed us in this, which was given for the first time, we are bound to say that more than one-half of our unexpected pleasure was due to the style in which it was rendered by the artist, F. HERSCH. The adagio in the second movement, which was very charming, was translated by him in a most masterly manner, and deserves the warmest critical recognition.

"A correspondent, in another column, takes us to task for pronouncing the spirit of the various confiscation bills heretofore introduced into Congress to be vindictive. He argues generally against a disposition to deal leniently with rebels and traitors; and advocates the employment of all means tributary to the termination of the war. So far as the leaders of the rebellion are concerned, we presume we are not exposed to the charge of undue clemency, since we have pointed them out as for objects for the extreme visitation of law. It must be in regard to the mass of Southern people that we are in fault, because we advocate an act of general amnesty to these. And here a wide discussion opens. Are we nowhere in the South to find or make friends to the Union! Are we to treat brethren whose ignorance we have pitied, and whom we admit to have been misled into insurrection by a class of men in whose counsels they have been accustomed to confide implicitly, as a subjugated and impoverished people? And against them are we to use any means tributary to the extinction of the rebellion? If so, and we must rob them of property which procures them food, may we not logically bombard and burn down the property that gives them shelter, and strip them of the garments which protect them from the weather? May we not massacre them pitilessly? For all these are instrumentalities which protract the war; and if we make war upon these so much will we shorten the rebellion. The truth is, in trying to make just enough of a case to free all the slaves on the South, our correspondent inevitably proves too much. He opens the door for practices utterly repudiated by civilized warfare. By the law of South Carolina the slave is as much property as the house and land and cattle of his legal owner. The Federal Government professes to admit the property in the one case to be under State law quite as inviolable as the other. But no property can be confiscated for a longer period than the life-time of the owner; and this only after due trial and conviction for treason. What will our correspondent have? Will he hang 8,000,000 of people, one by one, for treason. Will he confiscate all the property, real and personal, of the South, for practically it is the possession of traitors?

Editorial on frauds in Government contracts,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/28/archives/pennsylvania-jobbery.html,Editorial on frauds in Government contracts,"The full length and official report of what occurred in the House of Representatives on Friday, on the matter of Army and Navy con- tracts, is rather a discreditable exhibition of personalities. At the same time some public good may come of it, and certain private reputations will not profit by it. Beyond the circumstance that Mr. DAWES, of Massachusetts, led the discussion, on behalf of his Committee, who had been violently assailed in their absence the previous Monday, the whole affair appears to be a Pennsylvania story. CAMERON, CUMMINGS and STEVENS, all of that old Commonwealth, are arraigned for jobbery; while STEVENS, KELLY and MOREHEAD, of the Pennsylvania delegation, are made counsel for the defence. To be sure, Mr. COLFAX, of Indiana, is brought to their assistance, not so much, perhaps, as the apologist of the Ex-Secretary of War, as the assailant of the Committee for their mode of investigation of the Fremont contracts. It will scarcely be denied that Mr. DAWES makes a strong case against the Pennsylvanians, and in it he is backed by his entire Committee. A couple of errors in the report weakened his position somewhat before the House, and one of these he found it rather embarrassing, in reply to Mr. KELLY, to explain away, the mistake involving a serious injustice to CUMMINGS, which ought, perhaps, to have been acknowledged on the application of CUMMINGS himself, several months ago.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pennsylvania Jobbery.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Pennsylvania Jobbery.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb11af4f-f105-5c1e-a242-4499331f1f2a,915,nyt://article/cb11af4f-f105-5c1e-a242-4499331f1f2a

"The news of the capture of New-Orleans which we received from the South at a late hour last night, clears up gloriously the mystery which for some time has Lung around the movements of our navy and army upon the Lower Mississippi. We had already had intelligence that our bombketches had opened fire upon Fort Jackson, 60 miles below the city, and yesterday morning we published news derived from the rebels that one of our gunboats had run past that work. But the defenders of the fort, it was said, had sent word to their friends that they were confident of their strength, and were able to endure the shelling as long as our fleet was able to keep it up. That news was up to Tuesday last. It appears certain that, notwithstanding the rebel bombast, Fort Jackson, and probably, also, Fort St. Philip, on the opposite side of the river, were reduced that very day; for by the gray dawn of Wednesday morning, our armada had steamed past the fortifications, and by noon it appeared, with power and terror, before the Crescent City. At this point the telegram stops short, and leaves us completely in the dark as to what has been done during the past four days. Whether Gen. BUTLER, as is probable, sent in a demand for the capitulation of the city, and what may have followed -- a compliance with, or refusal of the terms of the demand -- we do not yet know. But it is altogether unlikely that any serious attempt was made to defend the city itself. Indeed, New-Orleans was utterly incapable of defence, when once our fleet got in front of it. With a hundred gun and mortarboats riding high above the city, ready to pour down upon it a torrent of fire and iron, it would be madness for the rebels to dream of any other terms than unconditional surrender. It has been thought that the land force accompanying the expedition was too small to repossess a city, which must still count somewhat like a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. And so it would be if the military contingent had to act alone. But the fact is, that the naval arm when once raised over the city, was of itself sufficient to hold it in complete subjection. And the only work for the troops would be to seize and garrison some few important positions in the city, raise the Stars and Stripes over the United States property and other public places, and act as a repressive police force. The rebels will be disarmed; the Union element, which is known to be strong in New-Orleans, will be organized; and Gen. BUTLER, from his headquarters in the St. Charles Hotel, will put in force whatever other measures are necessary for the securing of public order.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/28/archives/the-capture-of-neworleans.html,,"The news of the capture of New-Orleans which we received from the South at a late hour last night, clears up gloriously the mystery which for some time has Lung around the movements of our navy and army upon the Lower Mississippi.

editorial questions whether Beauregard has evacuated Corinth,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/29/archives/is-beauregard-at-corinth.html,editorial questions whether Beauregard has evacuated Corinth,"-- No one will be surprised at hearing of the evacuation of Corinth. Two or three rumors to the effect that BEAUREGARD has already departed are current, the probable forerunners of the truth. With the seizure of New-Orleans the possession of the Mississippi is transferred to the National forces. The Arkansas and the Red River are at the mercy of our gunboats, and Federal transports can land Federal troops wherever they are wanted. BEAUREGARD is thus hemmed in on the North, the East and the West; his supplies and communications cut off; and he has the alternative of retreating upon Memphis or Mobile, or of fighting under desperate conditions an enemy greatly his superior in strength and discipline. The news that our flotilla had passed Fort Jackson was doubtless carried to him on Thursday last. On Friday he must have known of the immediate proximity to the city of the Union forces, and of the abandonment of all thought of defence on the part of the inhabitants. The significance of this news was distinct. The source upon which he chiefly relied for supplies and reinforcements was lost to him. The enemy, in what force he knew not, might from that direction assail his rear; the river was in hostile hands, and even at Memphis he might find FOOTE and FARRAGUT effecting a junction, in order to bombard that much-fearing city. In these circumstances, we may well imagine the rebel General to be grievously beset, and solicitous to find less crowded quarters. Jackson, Miss., is named as the position selected for another stand. The probabilities, however, are, that when Corinth is left, some point, on the railroad to Mobile will be the next halting-place, the rebel chief naturally desiring to reach the system of railroads by which he may rejoin the rebel army in the Atlantic States. Separated from that, and from his base at New-Orleans, he is certainly lost.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IS BEAUREGARD AT CORINTH?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IS BEAUREGARD AT CORINTH?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/041c8c95-24db-59ba-85b9-27e5e67b34f8,319,nyt://article/041c8c95-24db-59ba-85b9-27e5e67b34f8

"-- There is no naval officer whose services the country can so ill afford to lose as those of the gallant Commander of the Western flotilla, Commodore FOOTE. His exploits on the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers, whether we consider the science with which they were planned, the daring with which they were executed, or the vastness of the consequences flowing from them, rank among the foremost achievements of the campaign, and have justly won for him the gratitude of the nation. On these very grounds, it is to be hoped that the Navy Department will not defer acceding to the request for a temporary relief from the care and responsibility of active service, which the wound received by Commodore FOOTE has compelled him to put in. Of late his ankle, injured in the Donelson fight, has, we hear, become greatly swollen and exceedingly painful, and he ascends the deck of his flagship with extreme difficulty. He is also much worn, and is suffering from general debility, and the surgeon reports that until he has complete rest and freedom from care, he cannot hope for recovery. It is true that Commodore FOOTE does not ask to be relieved on personal grounds. His life, he says, is at the service of his country. But his country needs his service too much to afford to imperil its loss. Already we have lost one officer in another arm of the service from a similar cause. LANDER, the bravest of the brave, fell a victim to a neglected wound. He desired to be recalled, but, like FOOTE, the Government did not see how his services could be spared; and the drain on the vital powers caused by the arduous duties of an active campaign, aggravated his wound, and carried him to his grave. The Navy Department has so far considered the case of Commodore FOOTE as to send him out an efficient assistant in the person of Capt. DAVIS. But this is not enough. He needs entire exemption from duty for a season. And it will he good economy in the Government to allow him this, for there is much yet remaining for the gallant sailor to do; and the whole country will pray that he may soon be restored to perfect health, to push on the good work and lead up the numerous tributaries of the Mississippi the conquering flotilla bofore which rebellion disappears.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/29/archives/rest-for-capt-foote.html,,"-- There is no naval officer whose services the country can so ill afford to lose as those of the gallant Commander of the Western flotilla, Commodore FOOTE.

"-- It would seem that the rumors we bad from the South-west. on Sunday and Monday last, of a great battle having commenced between the armies of HALLECK and BEAUREGARD, was premature. Our advices from the vicinity of Pittsburgh now extend up to Monday night, and no mention is made of anything but a cavalry skirmish, which took place on that day at a place about midway between the position of the main body of the two armies. Rebel prisoners captured, say that BEAUREGARD's army now numbers upwards of eighty thousand men, and that it is still at Corinth fortifying, and will fight there. It may be that the prisoners had no special means of accurate information, but still it is highly probable that these statements were about correct. We have had news lately of BEAUREGARD's receiving reinforcements from as far away as Texas, and even South Carolina has given him a regiment; while the conscription act is now furnishing him with men from Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, with all of which States his communications are yet open. These additions have probably doubled the size of his army since he fought at Shiloh. BEAUREGARD cannot fight at a more advantageous point than Corinth, if he fights anywhere this side of the Mississippi; and his late defeat was not so severe as to destroy his hopes of success with his largely-increased army. On the other hand, our own army is reported to be in capital spirits; and the late skirmishes near BEAUREGARD's lines show that it is not afraid to go out in search of the enemy.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/30/archives/the-rebel-forces-at-corinth.html,,"-- It would seem that the rumors we bad from the South-west. on Sunday and Monday last, of a great battle having commenced between the armies of HALLECK and BEAUREGARD, was premature.

"Since the battle of Pea Ridge the public have almost lost sight of the magnificent National column of Gen. CURTIS. We know that all the rebel forces in Western Arkansas (ALBERT PIKE's cannibals excepted) have been moved down the Arkansas River, and are now with BEAUREGARD's army at Corinth. This left Gen. CURTIS without an enemy in his front; and as it was impossible for him to follow the rebels in the route they took, he began to move his forces eastward for action on another field. We have had from time to time news of his progress from Bentonville, Arkansas, to Cassville, Missouri, and from thence to Forsyth, in Taney County, at which point our latest advices left him, with his whole army. The news we published from the Memphis Avalanche on Monday indicated his subsequent movements. The road from Forsyth leads across the Ozark Mountains in an almost direct line to Doniphan, Ripley County, on the Current River, at which point, says the rebel newspaper, are ""ten thousand Federal troops engaged in building flatboats with which to descend Black and White Rivers."" The troops of Gen.

"We may reckon it not the least of the many important consequences of the capture of New-Orleans, that our fleet will bag the whole of the rebel flotilla of iron-clad vessels and steam-rams that for many months have held undisputed possession of the Lower Mississippi. Indeed, there is already an announcement that one of their iron-clad gunboats was destroyed on the passage up by the United States steamer Pensacola. This is probably the Louisiana, which was only completed ten days ago, and which the Richmond journals have lately described in formidable colors as a second Merrimac. If this craft has really been sunk by one of our wooden gunboats, the exploit will certainly be a most important contribution to our knowledge of the relative capacities of wooden walls and iron sides -- concerning which latter, perhaps, there may have been a tendency to leap to too absolute a judgment. Whether any other iron-clad vessels appeared to dispute the passage of the National fleet up to the city remains also to be seen.

Indeed, there is already an announcement that one of their iron-clad gunboats was destroyed on the passage up by the United States steamer Pensacola. This is probably the Louisiana, which was only completed ten days ago, and which the Richmond journals have lately described in formidable colors as a second Merrimac. If this craft has really been sunk by one of our wooden gunboats, the exploit will certainly be a most important contribution to our knowledge of the relative capacities of wooden walls and iron sides -- concerning which latter, perhaps, there may have been a tendency to leap to too absolute a judgment. Whether any other iron-clad vessels appeared to dispute the passage of the National fleet up to the city remains also to be seen.

Editorial on various means of taxation to help meet increased Government expenditures,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/30/archives/the-revenue-question-how-shall-taxes-be-levied.html,Editorial on various means of taxation to help meet increased Government expenditures,"Among the numerous propositions for a scheme of finance or taxation, which shall produce a revenue equal to the greatly increased expenditures of Government, we have seen none that appears to accomplish this end so fully, and to which so few objections can be urged, as an uniform tax upon transfers, or sales of merchandise. The limit or amount of tax proposed is one per cent. The revenue which this rate would yield is, to a certain extent, conjectural, but it would be very large. If inadequate, the rate has only to be increased to produce a sum equal to any emergency. By the scheme proposed the tax is levied upon consumption, or what is the same thing, upon capital in the form of money. No one payment would ever be felt to be a burden by the consumer. If it amounted to $100, he would pay $1; if $1,000, $10 -- a rate that would subtract in no appreciable degree from a person's comforts or style of living. It is a tax that would be daily paid, bringing with it an increased stimulus to exertion. A person who daily purchases A half-dozen of newspapers does not feel the amount paid to be a drain upon his purse, for the reason that the day's expenditure is met by the proceeds of the day's industry. The former is graduated upon the scale of the latter. But let the bill for the whole run for the year, and the amount would be considered so excessive that the whole of them would probably be discontinued, from a sense of absolute necessity. The money that should, and, if daily demanded, would have been paid for them, has gone for other objects, and the bill has to be charged against the earnings of the coming year.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Revenue Question How Shall Taxes be Levied.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Revenue Question How Shall Taxes be Levied.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-04-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8d53963-4438-50f4-96ca-b918038146cb,1271,nyt://article/e8d53963-4438-50f4-96ca-b918038146cb

"A WEAK INVENTION. -- A statement to the effect that the rebels have called for a cessation of arms, with a view to a peaceful adjustment of the National difficulties, has obtained currency in certain quarters, where it is believed as well that the President has consented to a parley. The story is, in every particular, palpably untrue. While there is everything in the condition of the rebels to suggest; submission and peace, there is no evidence of any such a disposition among their leaders, who, having nothing to hope from the National Government, are wiling to draw down with them, into perdition, the mass of the people. On the side of the Union there is sufficient argument against either armistice or compromise. The latter word will never again be listened to at the North. There can be no further concession or terms with that mutinous spirit of the South, which has cost the country all the blood and the money of this frightful war. The motto of the Government, as it is of our Generals, is unconditional surrender. It is proposed to subjugate the South, not to the yoke of Northern dictation, but to the plain, explicit, sense and requirements of the Constitution; and it will only be when the rebel leaders announce their willingness thus to submit, that the project of a truce will be considered. The war is costing this generation, and perhaps two or three generations to follow it, at the rate of two millions a-day. Not a day therefore can we afford to waste upon negotiations, which must have no beneficial result. The Government will continue to strike until the last armed rebel shall have perished or disappeared.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/30/archives/armistice-and-compromisea-weak-invention.html,,"A WEAK INVENTION. -- A statement to the effect that the rebels have called for a cessation of arms, with a view to a peaceful adjustment of the National difficulties, has obtained currency in certain quarters, where it is believed as well that the President has consented to a parley.

"REBELS. -- We remarked, the other morning, that the kind of intelligence we were receiving now-a-days from New-Mexico indicated that a new element had been thrown into the war on the National side there, in the regiment of pioneers and miners from Colorado; and that the first exploit of these men had shown that they did not go into New-Mexico merely for the purpose of furnishing supplies of arms to the rebels, as some of our Regulars seem to have done, but that they went there to fight, and would be likely to make short work of the small band of rebel fillibusters from Texas, who had overrun the Territory, reduced its forts, seized its capital, and all but completed its subjugation. The work, It seems, has been done even quicker than seemed possible. Not only has the conquering march of the Texans been suddenly arrested, but, since their late defeat at Pigeon Ranche, northeast of Santa Fe, what remains of them has turned tail upon the territory, and is now heading for Arizona. By a telegram of this morning, we learn that on the 12th current, they had reached a point fifty miles south of Santa Fe, and about an equal distance from the Arizona line, and were still in full flight southward. Arizona, it will be remembered, has, since secession times, been almost entirely in the hands of the meanest and most bloodthirsty tribe of savages on the Continent -- the Apache Indians, who have of late kept up a fearful reign of terror and the tomahawk; and if the rebels are not so fortunate as to get captured by our soldiers who are pursuing them, the chances are that they will be all killed and scalped by the Indians.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/04/30/archives/abandonment-of-newmexico-of-the.html,,"REBELS. -- We remarked, the other morning, that the kind of intelligence we were receiving now-a-days from New-Mexico indicated that a new element had been thrown into the war on the National side there, in the regiment of pioneers and miners from Colorado; and that the first exploit of these men had shown that they did not go into New-Mexico merely for the purpose of furnishing supplies of arms to the rebels, as some of our Regulars seem to have done, but that they went there to fight, and would be likely to make short work of the small band of rebel fillibusters from Texas, who had overrun the Territory, reduced its forts, seized its capital, and all but completed its subjugation.
