"The flight of the Rebel army of the Southwest from its fortified position at Corinth, looks like an abandonment of the campaign in the Gulf States, and the Mississippi Valley.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/01/archives/the-dilemma-of-the-southwestern-rebel-army.html,,"The flight of the Rebel army of the Southwest from its fortified position at Corinth, looks like an abandonment of the campaign in the Gulf States, and the Mississippi Valley. There were at Corinth all the fighting rebels from that vast region; they had there a good strategic position, with railroads ramifying from it all through the South; they were in a more favorable location for obtaining supplies than can be found between there and the Gulf of Mexico; and they were not within reach of those terrible gunboats of ours, which have lately furnished an excuse for so many rebel retreats and evacuations. It is very true that time was not increasing these facilities and advantages. The capture of New-Orleans, and the ascent of the Mississippi by our gunboats, cut them off from the supplies they had formerly received from Texas; the advance of Gen. CURTIS to the White and Arkansas Rivers, cut off their supplies from Northeastern Arkansas, while the naval and military operations on the northward and to the eastward of their position, had severed it from the grain-growing regions of Tennessee. All their railroad connections, too, were being destroyed one by one; and if our gunboats could not directly play upon Corinth, they were on the eve of opening upon Memphis -- after the fall of which the continued occupation of Corinth would be a military impossibility. Still, if these various movements weakened the strength of the rebel position at Corinth, they weaken still more the strength of any other position they may choose to take up south of Corinth. If they should attempt, as they have already attempted, to move down over the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, they find that POPE is already operating there; if they move over the only other line running southward, the Mississippi Central Railroad, they will find the terminus of that road in our hands; and if they stop at Jackson, in the centre of the State, as is given forth they will, they will learn, as indeed they already know, that Vicksburgh and the line of the short road running west from Jackson is ours, and that they are then in a worse plight than it would have been possible for the most consummate strategy to have brought them in at Corinth. It is hardly possible that they ever had an intention of stopping at Jackson; for there, even with the points at present in our possession, we could fall upon them in front and rear and on both flanks; and there, too, our gunboats, by ascending the Pearl River, could act upon them with destructive effect. Besides, though in the region between Memphis and Jackson there is cotton enough raised to clothe the whole South, there is not corn or bacon enough to supply a regiment of its troops. There can be little doubt that if, in evacuating Corinth, the rebels have moved southward, as the telegraph affirms, they have abandoned once and forever the Valley of the Mississippi. As to the assertion, made by some, that they will retire into the swamps of Mississippi and Alabama, and draw our army down there to be destroyed by miasma and gallinippers, such a theory can be held only by those who are illy informed about the strategic topography of those States, and of the nature of great military operations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Dilemma of the Southwestern Rebel Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Dilemma of the Southwestern Rebel Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3941face-0cbb-5e8b-9053-32347105d851,1081,nyt://article/3941face-0cbb-5e8b-9053-32347105d851

Sixteen years ago he landed in the streets of San Francisco, and hoisted the American flag in its square. It was Commodore MONTGOMERY who commanded the corvette Portsmouth when the Mexican war broke out. In less than 24 hours after the receipt of the intelligence the Stars and Stripes were, by orders of the gallant officer, flying at San Francisco, Bodiga, Sonora, Sutler's Fort and San Jose. With 200 officers and men a district of over 200 miles square was occupied, and no flag was ever torn down of any hoisted at the above-named places, although at every other point, save Monterey, the Mexicans succeeded in lowering it. It was Commodore MONTGOMERY's promptness that relieved FREMONT, when, fatigued, hungry and penniless, he returned from his tour of Oregon, whither Mr. BUCHANAN sent him almost unprovided for. The Portsmouth, under MONTGOMERY's command, took all the prizes, save one, that were captured in the Pacific during the war.

The country is somewhat familiar with the origin and progress of this noted corps, which was originated in this City by WASHINGTON ALLEN BARTLETT, who, upon the full organization of the same, became its Colonel. That gentleman was formerly a Lieutenant in the Navy, in which service he passed twenty-two years, earning an enviable reputation for efficiency and gallantry, until he was, with a host of other able officers, displaced by the famous ""Examining Board,"" under the Pierce Administration. Lieut. BARTLETT's history was interesting in this connection previous to the outbreak of the existing rebellion, and became doubly so, after the organization of his brigade, whose mishaps and difficulties culminated in an accident at the Rip Raps, by which the Colonel nearly lost his life, and the subsequent transfer of the force to another commander and its final transposition into the ordinary service as the Ninety-ninth Regiment N.Y.S.V. The 31st of May, 1861, saw the brigade set foot as such, for the first time, on the soil of Virginia, and Col. BARTLETT deemed the recurrence of the day, this year, a befitting occasion for a reunion of its friends and ex-members, and all others whom sympathy or curiosity might attract to the scene.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Naval Brigade Anniversary.; STATEMENT OF COL.

Front Royal, the scene of the defeat of Col. KENLY and his brave First Maryland Regiment, has been recaptured, apparently with as much fatality to the rebels as was suffered by us. A brigade of our troops, preceded by four companies of the Rhode Island Cavalry, entered the place on Friday morning, and drove out the enemy, consisting of the Eighth Louisiana, four companies of the Twelfth Georgia and a body of cavalry. The enemy, it appears, were taken completely by surprise, and had no time either to save or to destroy anything. A large amount of transportation fell into our hands, including two engines and eleven cars on the Manassas Gap Railroad. We captured six officers and one hundred and fifty privates, besides killing and wounding a large number of rebels. Our loss in this affair was but eight killed, five wounded and one missing. Several of our men who were taken prisoners at Front Royal a week ago, were recaptured by our forces. In addition to this decided success, we are gratified to announce that Gen. BANKS has once more advanced from Harper's Ferry, the Fifth New-York Cavalry having passed through Martinsburgh, and several miles beyond, yesterday morning.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/01/archives/general-city-news.html,,"MORMONISM IN NEW-YORK -- A MAN WITH THREE WIVES. -- JACOB A. HANSON, alias ADOLPHUS O. W. GRAHAM, was taken into custody yesterday by Officer TAYLOR, of the Essex Market Court, charged with being the husband of three wives, all of whom, it is stated, are now living. In answer to the questions put to him by Justice OSBORNE, the accused said he was born in the West Indies; that he was 19 years of age, and at present a resident of Brooklyn. Two of his reputed wives were in Court yesterday afternoon, and appeared to enjoy the punishment inflicted upon their husband exceedingly. The facts of the case, briefly stated, areas follows: On the 22d of February last, the accused -- whose true name, by the way, is A.O.W. GRAHAM -- married a young lady by the name of HARRIET GLINN, of No. 66 Rivington-street. The acquaintance of the parties was very brief prior to the marriage, but GRAHAM was a man of genteel exterior, very prepossessing in his manners, and made loud professions of wealth and position. He dressed with scrupulous neatness, in the garb of a navy officer, and sometimes represented that be was a surgeon in the navy, at others that he was a passed midshipman. These pretences had the effect to induce Miss GLINN to consent to marry him. For a few days the pair lived happily together, but soon the supposed navy surgeon had occasion, as he said, to leave the City on official business. Instead of taking his departure, however, he left his young wife for the purpose of gaining the affections of another lady of this City, by the name of ROSANNAH LEDDY. After a short courtship he was married to the latter on the 15th of May ult. As soon as the ceremony was performed he took his new wife to the Astor House, where he engaged rooms, and lived in fine style for two weeks. He represented to the proprietors of the Hotel that he was a naval Surgeon, under the pay of the Government, but that he would have no money until the first of the month. He appeared like a gentleman, was dressed as a naval officer, and his story seemed so plausible that he was allowed to run up a large bill before it was ascertained that he was an impostor. Yesterday the character of the man became so evident that it was deemed advisable to take him into custody. When taken before the magistrate, he was confronted by two of his wives, both of whom made affidavits of the facts above mentioned. Another wife of his, it is stated upon good authority, is now living somewhere in the interior of this State. Several parties who have been swindled out of money by him, will make complaints to-morrow. Numerous persons in this City and Brooklyn have trusted him to large amounts, upon the strength of his representations that he was an officer in the navy. The fact is, that he was never connected with the naval department in any manner. Justice OSBORNE committed him to prison to await the action of the Grand Jury.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9dae61e-ed75-5474-b895-4f46c3788894,1580,nyt://article/d9dae61e-ed75-5474-b895-4f46c3788894

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/02/archives/amusements.html,,"Music has had but a spasmodic existence during the past season, but nevertheless appears to be struggling resolutely to prolong it. Even opera is attempting to make another brief effort at life, which we have every reason for thinking maybe successful. In other words, Mr. ULLMANN, who returned from Europe some ten days since, as we believe, is planning a short season, which will in all probability commence this week or the next. When the arrangements are completed, which only the cupidity of a few of our resident artists may probably prevent -- a cupidity which, we must say, is as ill-judged as it is at the present period ungracious -- we believe it will be found that he offers the public a more considerable degree of artistic novelty than any manager during the past musical year has done. Two prime donne, neither of whom have yet been heard in this City on the lyric stage, will probably appear. Although their names have not as yet been announced, we may hint that the one of them was the leading soprano in the opera at New-Orleans before the rebellion rendered that city unable to maintain such a costly amusement. Report speaks in the highest terms of her capabilities as a cantatrice, and although she has only been heard by us in a private drawing-room, we may frankly say -- judging by that occasion -- we believe report has done her no more than justice. The other is the wife of a prominent foreign artist, whose ability in her own profession has reaped a splendid pecuniary harvest during his tour through America. She is young, personally very charming, and has been studying for the operatic stage during the past two years. If the promise of success is borne out by her appearance at the Academy, she ought to be a valuable debutante to Mr. ULLMANN. We understand that D'ANGRI is to be contralto. It will be seen, that in female voices there is every promise of the troop Mr. ULLMANN is about to offer us being very rich. With male voices there is more difficulty, but we scarcely doubt that he will be able to overcome it, and will make another effort to tame that stray bird -- operatic success, -- while he meanwhile keeps the contract with RISTORI carefully buttoned up in the innermost recesses of his breast-pocket.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17c1bf9e-7bd5-51b5-8470-957945ef93eb,1041,nyt://article/17c1bf9e-7bd5-51b5-8470-957945ef93eb

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/02/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"PLYMOUTH CHURCH. -- Mr. BEECHER last evening delivered one of his radical appeals for justice to all men, and in connection therewith a scathing rebuke to all injustice and selfishness -- particularly as affecting the inferior races, and especially that of the negro. He selected as his text the 40th verse of the 11th chapter of Hebrews: ""God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."" Christ, he said, did not suffer on the cross alone to save the Anglo-Saxon race, as some affected to believe, but he suffered that all mankind might have the road of salvation open to them; even including the negroes. He impressed upon the minds of his hearers the important truth that the world could not be elevated unless the inferior races were taken along too; that it was the duty of all men, but especially of Christians, to render justice to the ignorant and depraved of all races. In this connection Mr. BEECHER read an extract from the Newbern, N.C., correspondent of the TIMES, (E.S.,) wherein it is stated that Gov. STANLY had informed Mr. COLYER (who has been teaching the negroes to read since the advent of Gen. BURNSIDE into that State) that his instructions from Washington were to administer the laws of the State as he found them; consequently, under the laws of North Carolina, teaching negroes to read being a penal offence, Mr. COLYER would have to cease his philanthropic work. If, said Mr. BEECHER, the Government at Washington sanctions that decision of Gov. STANLY, the people have been deceived. He did not believe, however, that the Governor, in this respect, would be sustained. If the people of North Carolina had elected a Governor, then there might be some excuse for enforcing this law; but if the Government had the right and the power to force upon the people of that State a Governor, that Government had equally a right to order that the law referred to should not be enforced, and he believed it would be done.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3df15ec2-7ae7-5cc7-84fe-acafddfbbf9a,529,nyt://article/3df15ec2-7ae7-5cc7-84fe-acafddfbbf9a

Another great battle has been fought, and another great victory has been won According to the first brief telegram from Gen. MCCLELLAN, dated at noon yesterday, on the battle-field, the enemy made an attack upon the right of our lines at 1 o'clock P.M., on Saturday, in the midst of a terrible storm, which had flooded the whole valley of the Chickahominy. Gen. CASEY's Division, which was in the first line, gave way before the enemy, ""unaccountably and disunitedly,"" as Gen. MCCLELLAN states. Temporary confusion was thus caused, during which some of our guns and baggage were lost; but the enemy were checked in a handsome manner by Gens. HEINTZELMAN and KEYES, and held at bay until, by great exertion, the divisions of Gens. SEDGWICK and RICHARDSON were brought across the river, when the enemy was driven back at the point of the bayonet, leaving the ground covered with his dead. This ended the conflict on Saturday. Yesterday morning the enemy attempted to renew it, but was everywhere repulsed. Many prisoners were captured by us, including Gen. PETTIGREW, of South Carolina, and Col. LONG. Our losses in killed and wounded are heavy, but nothing to compare with those of the enemy, which, Gen. MCCLELLAN says, must be enormous. During the progress of the fighting, several fine bayonet charges were made -- two by the Second Excelsior Regiment, yesterday.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/02/archives/general-city-news.html,,"NEW CLAIMANTS FOR CITIZENSHIP -- THE CHURCH PROPERTY NOT IN DANGER. -- Judge HILTON, of the Court of Common Pleas, presided in that wellknown and (as we say of a good-hearted, fat and jovial gentleman of ease) highly respected institution one day last week. It seems he had very little to do, for the only attendant awaiting the judicial fiat was a clerk, who, like the ball that the lamented late father-in-law of Col. FREMONT set in motion, was there ""solitary and alone."" The accomplished Judge, it may be readily supposed, was about to do, under the circumstances, what Dean SWIFT is said to have done in a somewhat parallel state of affairs. The Dean, after his debut in Ireland, was sent to take charge of a very flourishing Protestant parish. On the occasion of what is there called ""a visitation,"" which is to some of the clergy of the Established Church a ""visitation"" in more senses than one, the Dean was obliged, from a paucity of reformed brethren in his neighborhood -- there being few petticoats or brogues on hand -- to borrow from a friendly Catholic priest a very numerous congregation, in order to satisfy the Bishop of the Diocese that the Evangelizing trade had been immensely effectual. On the Sunday after, however, the only ""congregation"" was ROGER, the clerk. ""ROGER,"" says the pastor, ""let us pray."" And here we approach the point. Judge HILTON, it may be readily supposed, was just on the point of saying, ""Mr. KENNEDY,"" ask the officer to adjourn the Court,"" when an apparition appeared -- angels escorted by N.J. JARVIS, Esq., the clerk. It was four sisters of the order of the Good Shepherd, clothed in conventual robes, mauve flowing garments, white linen bandages on their fair foreheads, and flowing veils. They came -- three of them, at least -- from Ireland to this City, to found an asylum, not for the reformation only, but for the reformation and restoration to reputable and pious character among decent men and virtuous women of the poor fallen creatures, whose poverty or ignorance, (or, may it be said, innocence,) has contributed to their unhappy fortune. In order to aid in saving these unfortunate girls, these ladies, having arrived here, became possessed of certain property near Yorkville, on which to found an establishment. It is necessary, in order to acquire a legal title to real estate in New-York, that the claimant shall be a naturalized citizen. In compliance with this enactment, it was that these good women presented themselves before His Honor, Judge HILTON, who, with all the suavity and consideration of a gentleman, and all the delicacy, which not only befits but adorns the Bench, yielded to the request at once.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8906fe14-838b-5177-84ba-dc275868d048,619,nyt://article/8906fe14-838b-5177-84ba-dc275868d048

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/02/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"PLYMOUTH CHURCH. -- Mr. BEECHER last evening delivered one of his radical appeals for justice to all men, and in connection therewith a scathing rebuke to all injustice and selfishness -- particularly as affecting the inferior races, and especially that of the negro. He selected as his text the 40th verse of the [???] chapter of Hebrews: ""God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."" Christ, he said, did not suffer on the cross alone to save the Anglo-Saxon race, as some affected to believe, but he suffered that all mankind might have the road of salvation open to them; even including the negroes. He impressed upon the minds of his hearers the important truth that the world could not be elevated unless the inferior races were taken along too; that it was the duty of all men, put especially of Christians, to render justice to the ignorant and depraved of all races. In this connection, Mr. BEECKER read an extract from the [???], N.C., correspondent of the TIMES, (E.S.,) wherein it is stated that Gov. STANLY had informed Mr. COLYER (who has been teaching the negroes to [???] since the advent of Gen. BURNSIDE into that States [???] at his instructions from Washington were to [???] for the laws of the State as he found them; consistently, under the laws of North Carolina, teaching negroes to read being a penal offence, Mr. COLYER would have to cease his philanthropic work. [???] said Mr. PEECKER, the Government at Washington [???] that decision of Gov. STANLY, the people have been deceived. He did not believe, however, that the Governor, in this respect, would be sustained. If the people of North Carolina had elected a Governor, then there might be some excuse for enforcing this law; but if the Government had the right and the power to force upon the people of that State a Governor, that Government had equally a right to order that the law referred to should not be enforced, and he believed it would be done.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8be09bb1-22dc-5777-bc06-56e2280aca83,532,nyt://article/8be09bb1-22dc-5777-bc06-56e2280aca83

During the progress of the yearly meeting a number of distinguished speakers have been moved to unusual eloquence in denunciation, as they declare, of the unchristian strife which now marks our country's history; but for all that, appropriate as such doctrine is to the quiet non-resistant principle. Friends, there beat, and that too, evidently to the less disciplined observer, hearts as loyal under the breast linings of those shad-bellied coats, and precisely platted kerchiefs and three-cornered mantles, as beat in the bosoms of our fighting heroes. It is curious and interesting to see how an occasional touching of the subject by one Friend, will be but an opening for a dissertation upon the shocking consequences of pride and political preferences; how another, disapproving of ""Friends meddling with what is so entirely out of the pale of recognition"" more than as a relic of barbarism, will give the subject a thorough letting alone; and how another, such as RACHEL BARKER MOORE, will denounce the rebellion in no picked terms, and while giving all praise to our President for his long suffering patience, and the Cabinet for their wisdom in supporting him, touches up the consciences of the nation generally, with arrows of eloquence aimed at their torpid remorse as a ""fast people."" There is no manner of doubt that if Friend RACHEL had have had the ear of our ""honest"" Chief Magistrate, she would have labored with his patient spirit, to the end that he might not, heed the call to arms from her more impulsive countrymen; for she says, ""We are a fast people; we do not love to stop and think:"" and now that the mischief, if not played out, is well on to the close of the fifth act, she, in mildest terms, insinuates that bad we been a less rapidly disposed people, if we had indeed emulated the patient bearing of our amiable Chief Magistrate, who, she avers, ""was placed in an exceedingly trying position,"" we might have settled the difficulty with our brethren without resort to deadly weapons.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Progress of the Friends' Yearly Meeting.; PRESENCE OF DISTINGUISHED SPEAKERS LUCRETIA MOTT, OF PHILADELPHIA, AND OTHERS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Progress of the Friends' Yearly Meeting.; PRESENCE OF DISTINGUISHED SPEAKERS LUCRETIA MOTT, OF PHILADELPHIA, AND OTHERS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7df4161-a948-5d56-9c1d-669e7e76dadb,992,nyt://article/c7df4161-a948-5d56-9c1d-669e7e76dadb

MCCLELLAN was expected to know to a hundred how many men the enemy had there, how many guns, how and where mounted, and what intentions their commanders had -- whether they meant to fight or run away.

Editorial on report Arkansas is again in Union hands,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/03/archives/arkansas-back-to-the-union.html,Editorial on report Arkansas is again in Union hands,"-- GOOD NEWS FROM AN UNEXPECTED QUARTER. -- We suppose it may be considered that the ""fine old State of Arkansaw"" is again back into the Union. Gen. CURTIS expelled the rebels from the northwestern part of the State; Gen. STEEL holds control, by means of the great batteaux fleet, of the river system in the northeastern section; FARBAGUT's fleet commands the southeastern line; and in the centre of the State a force under CURTIS has now seized and occupied Little Rock, the capital. Fort Smith on the extreme western verge of the State, is still in the hands of the rebels, but will doubtless surrender as soon as called upon by one of our gunboats. ALBERT PIKE's cannibals also are still hovering somewhere in that vicinity; but they will give us no more trouble. So that it may now be considered that we have absolute military control of the whole State. All that is required now is that the President select some ""fine old Arkansaw gentleman,"" and make him Military Governor of the State, having first provided him with a good-sized Arkansas toothpick.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARKANSAS BACK TO THE UNION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARKANSAS BACK TO THE UNION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15edae82-2279-5f23-b2f3-f6a93c8cfc77,650,nyt://article/15edae82-2279-5f23-b2f3-f6a93c8cfc77

In consequence, however, of the well-known superiority of TALLMAN's team. Panic and Jilt, and the knowledge that their starting for the purse would assuredly have the effect of causing the withdrawal of the other teams, and thus spoil the race, TALLMAN very handsomely withdrew his entry, thus leaving the three other teams to contest for the purse. In consequence, however, of Belle and Alida, the team of HIRAM WOODRUFF, having been purchased by a gentleman for his own driving on the road, the starters were reduced to the teams entered by MCLAUGHLIN and MACE. The former, which comprises two handsome and well matched bay mares, Pug and Pauline, belong to a gentleman holding a high official position in the City; while Hawk and Buzzard, a black and a bay team, belong to Mr. WAYNE, of Hartford, Conn., and were driven in the two first heats by MCQUIVEY, and by HORACE JONES in the two last.

Editorial on Confederate govs. forced to flee their states,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/04/archives/matters-in-north-carolina-gov-stanly-at-home.html,Editorial on Confederate govs. forced to flee their states,"The letter of our correspondent at Newborn, throws a glare of light upon the doings and policy of the new Provisional Government. Gov. STANCY has addressed himself undividedly to the negro question. Not pausing with the closing of the African schools, he has given a large share of attention to the capture and restoration to their alleged owners of negro fugitives, and that, it would seem, with very slight, if any inquiry into the loyalty of the claimants. With the same sturdy devotion to the institutions of his native State, he has established a strict guard over departing vessels, to see that no contrabands effect a passage northward: while legal process awaits the return of certain shippers who are known to have carried away with them the [???] chattels. Having looked somewhat curiously into the transactions of the new State Administration, we are unable to find that any other subject has attracted the notice of the Governor. Questions financial, legislative, and judicial, are all postponed. His civil commission and the entire energies of the army which he indirectly controls, and which was sent to punish treason and restore North Carolina to the Union, are concentrated upon the rendition of fugacious blacks to disloyal proprietors; and in the expulsion from the State of Mr. H.H. [???], for no other crime apparently than his relationship with the author of the Impending Crisis, and his authorship of an advisory note, Gov. STANLY shows that his zeal for the strict administration of local law cools when the rights of non-slaveholding whites are concerned. It would be difficult, we imagine, for Gov. STANLY to lay his finger upon that section and [???] of the North Carolinian statute book which warrants him in banishing from the State the writer of a distasteful letter. In the Constitution of the United States it would be easy to find a passage which precludes the exercise of any such arbitrary authority.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Matters in North Carolina Gov.

"Coroner RANNEY was yesterday engaged in holding an inquest upon the body of an unknown man, who was found under circumstances which warrant the belief that the deceased came to his death by foul means. A post mortem examination made by Dr. GALEN HUNTER, of the Coroner's office, showed a gun-shot wound in his head; the ball having entered the left side of the face, and escaped under the jaw upon opposite side. Deceased was about fifty-five years of age, and five feet six inches in height. The body was discovered by Officer CRAFT, of the Eleventh Precinct, floating in the water at the foot of Houston-Street, East River. When found he was dressed in a black frock coat, brown vest and pantaloons, white muslin shirt, calf-skin gaiters and black silk neck-tie. He had apparently been in the water about two weeks. The Coroner made diligent efforts to ascertain by whom, and under what circumstances, the shot was fired, but no satisfactory evidence could be obtained. It is the general impression, among those who have seen the remains, that the man was murdered and afterward thrown into the river.

He was understood to say that the present Government of the United States had shown great anxiety to adopt stringent measures for the extinction of that nefarious traffic. Their Lordships were aware that for some years past there had been great facilities afforded to persons at New-York to fit out slavers. Those slavers went afterward to Havana, and thence to the coast of Africa. Her Majesty's Government were fully informed of the names of the persons who fitted out those slavers, and they advised our Admiral and cruisers on the African coast on the subject. Owing however, to their using the American flag, those slavers were enabled to escape from search by our cruisers, and their operations consequently could not be checked. But President LINCOLN's Government had given orders for the entire suppression of the slave trade, and had also taken effectual steps to break up the practice of fitting out ships at New-York for the purpose of carrying it on. Besides these, as occasion required, other steps would be adopted for the effectual suppression of the slave trade. The present treaty had been negotiated between Mr. Secretary SEWARD and Lord LYONS; and he might take this opportunity of stating that it afforded the best evidence of the sincerity of feeling and purpose for the suppression of the slave trade, which, since the election of the present President, had characterized the Government of the United States. The treaty gave extensive powers of search to the cruisers of both nations, and he had now the honor to lay it on their lordships' table.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW SLAVE TRADE TREATY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW SLAVE TRADE TREATY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/03eaa4f2-b883-5aec-992e-aa4fa9b100ce,513,nyt://article/03eaa4f2-b883-5aec-992e-aa4fa9b100ce

"House yesterday voted to reconsider the slaves of rebels confiscation bill, which was rejected by a very close vote a fortnight ago. The majority for reconsideration was 21, the total vote being; for, 84; against, 65. It is not likely that the rejected bill will pass the House or become a law in its original form; but the necessity of some action in the premises is admitted on all hands. Probably not less than a hundred thousand slaves have been directly engaged in forwarding this rebellion; and leaving out altogether Slavery as the ultimate inducing cause of the revolt, it is very doubtful whether, in a military point of view, it could have attained anything like its present proportions without the labor and the aid of Southern slaves. It cannot be that this rebel live stock shall be protected and preserved for the future use of the rebels. It cannot be that we should neglect to inflict a just punishment upon the slaveholding traitors and usurpers who have plunged the country into this bloody war. Still, hasty action on a subject of such vast and enduring import is dangerous to all parties: and while justice should be inexorably administered, it should also be administered discreetly, and in such a manner as not to reflect unjustly upon those who may be innocent. There is no doubt of the correctness of the oft-made assertion, that a large part of the Southern people was forced into this rebellion. As things went, it was a virtual impossibility for them to resist it. When, then, the question of confiscation assumes a practical shape, these men should have an opportunity of proving their virtual innocence. Neither their civil rights nor their estates should be interfered with, without trial; and it is to be hoped that the bill which may pass Congress will make ample provision for this. It must not be forgotten that while the people of the South had a duty of fealty to the Government, the Government also had a duty of protection to them; and that the Government is morally as culpable for failing in its imperative duty as the loyal men of the South were for failing to do their whole duty. We do not say that when the protection due the Southern loyalists was for so long a time withheld, the latter were inexcusable for succumbing to the de facto powers. We only say that there was a joint culpability of citizen and Government. And as soon as the Government, by suppressing the rebellion, sets itself right toward the Southern people, the latter also should have an opportunity to set themselves right toward the Government. For convicted traitors -- for those who have willingly furnished slaves to aid the rebel cause, there should be punishment and confiscation severe and exemplary; but, as we already said, in providing for this, care should be taken that the innocent do not suffer with the guilty.

Directly, however, it began to be suspected that the Merrimac was not likely to repeat the achievement of Hampton Roads, there was a strong possibility of a fleet of ships-of-war and transports running by the river forts on the York River and the James River, and landing an army in the rear of the Confederate lines, thus cutting them off from Richmond, and putting them between two fires. NAPOLEON might possibly have been glad of an opportunity to annihilate, in two blows, a thus divided enemy; but it is not in accordance with what we know of Confederate tactics to seek any such dangerous opportunities. The Fabian policy has hitherto been the policy of the South. They have from the first been hoping that something might turn up. Originally they believed Europe would come in a mass to rescue King Cotton. Disappointed in that, they were convinced that the North would be divided, and then that the funds would fail. Now they are probably living partly upon the remnants of all these broken hopes, and partly upon the anticipation that the heats of Summer will melt away the hosts they cannot vanquish. Delay they think to be equal to victory, and to some extent they are doubtless right. But it is a policy which may be carried too far, and, bit by bit, they may give up so much that they may at last have nothing very much worth fighting for. The danger of being surrounded would, however, appear to be a sufficient strategic reason for their last achievement in abandoning their Yorktown lines.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tone of the Press.; A FIGURATIVE FORECASTING.

editorial on Beauregard route,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/05/archives/rout-of-beauregards-army-the-splendid-movement-of-gen-pope.html,editorial on Beauregard route,"The question with everybody for the last four days has been, Where is BEAUREGARD'S army? Swiftly, silently, and under cover, the great host stole away from Corinth; but whither it had gone, no man could tell. The whereabouts of at least a large portion of it is at last satisfactorily settled. Gen. POPE, by one of those brilliant Napoleonic movements which have placed his name first and foremost on the roll of Western Commanders, has taken prisoner ten thousand of its number, has captured fifteen thousand stand of arms, and is still in pursuit of, and scattering to the winds, that fraction of it which holds together. This is the glorious news which will make the eyes of the nation glisten this morning, and which will strike terror and dismay to the hearts of the infernal Southern traitors. The vaunting and insolent chivalry of the Cotton States is routed and disgraced. The General in whom the rebels most trusted is discomfited. An army of men who swore that they would contest every inch of Southern soil till they reached the last ditch, and then and there would fight till the last of them had been hacked to pieces, has ignominiously thrown down its arms, and resigned itself to the clemency of its captors. A General whose bluster has only been equaled by his falsehoods -- who, in his efforts to fire the Southern heart, has stopped at no perfidy, scrupled at no means, however atrocious -- has now fled frantically before the National army, anxious only to save his worthless life, and shouting to his deluded followers as he flees ""to save themselves the best way they could."" It is a fitting finale to the rebel campaign in the Southwest -- a campaign which to the rebels has been but a long series of disgraces and disasters, from the day when this same POPE took prisoner four thousand of them in Missouri last Winter -- down through the days and fields of Pea Ridge, Donelson, Bowling Green, Nashville, Columbus, Island Number Ten, Pittsburgh, Huntsville, New-Orleans, Pensacola, Corinth and other discomfitures too many and too pitiful to be enumerated. All that remains now is that POPS and HALLECK put the finishing stroke to their week's work by breaking up entirely the fleeing host, and clutching its leaders, when the whole military force of the great rebellion will be the shivering fragment of an army now facing death at the rebel capital.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Rout of Beauregard's Army The Splendid Movement of Gen, Pope."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Rout of Beauregard's Army The Splendid Movement of Gen, Pope."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a3e8012-2cb5-5af6-8b61-d3a9cfec856e,885,nyt://article/4a3e8012-2cb5-5af6-8b61-d3a9cfec856e

The chase after Gov. BANKS, the assault upon Gen. CASEY, are specimens of this particular school of courage. An adversary weak in numbers and experience, and free from all apprehension of attack, is fallen upon, routed, and driven for miles, until reinforced and enabled to make a stand; when the pursuit ceases, the victors take to flight, and the net product of the enterprise is defeat and dispersion. There is impulse but no momentum. The moment the force which inspired the movement ceases to act, the movement ceases, and reaction ensues. It is a consciousness of this halt in the valorous gait of their warriors, which persuades the leaders of the insurrection to place small reliance upon the success of their cause if it be left to the arbitrament of arms. They are well assured that ultimate military superiority is out of the question. They have never been able to set foot upon Northern soil; mile by mile they see their own soil restored to the Union. The odds of the contest are all against them.

The afternoon was set apart for the reading of the epistles from corresponding yearly meetings. It appears that the subject of First-day Schools is exciting increased interest throughout all of them. Some highly interesting facts were elicited from JACOB and ELIZABETH HAVILAND, who have lent the most zealous effort in the behalf of Mission Schools along the Western border of this State. They gave instances where the privileges to be met with in these humble educational institutions, directed as they are by the firm yet gentle discipline of Friends, have been seized upon with avidity by the indigent searcher after instruction, and have been seen to produce results the most profitable. Children are not alone the pupils who receive instruction in these schools. The laborer wipes the sweat from his honest brow and repairs to them, as a little child, when working hours are done. The mechanic forgets, at Betting sun, his toil and tools, and hastens to the Mission that is working to cultivate that longing which he feels for nobler effort, for higher ends and intellectual enjoyment. At the business meeting the Tract Society's report was read, and from which some new facts were disclosed which much interested Friends. It is a new thing to see the plain garb of a Quakeress passing to and fro in by-ways of iniquity and distress, or standing at the doors of their residences distributing the little prints so carefully selected to reach the needs of the recipients, yet this rather unusually demonstrative custom is gaining ground; and strange as it may appear, the class who do not as a general thing accept with becoming grace these free offerings at the hands of the pharisaical, eagerly crowd about such distributors.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Final Sitting of the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Final Sitting of the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b4cf8c31-7da7-59b6-9a88-9b354674d9d0,728,nyt://article/b4cf8c31-7da7-59b6-9a88-9b354674d9d0

It is a tardy act -- we will not say of justice -- but of common sense. Liberia has grown to a condition of stability, and has been declared entitled to respect, under the law of nations, by France, Great Britain, Belgium, Prussia, Brazil, Lubec, Bremen, Hamburg, Portugal, and the Kingdom of Italy. Hayti has already had an independent existence of two generations, and has been acknowledged and treated as a nation by every Government in the world except our own. We now send Ministers Plenipotentiary to several nations, whose united intercourse with the United States is not a tithe of the commercial importance of that of either Hayti or Liberia. It is only just to say that this inconsistency has long been lamented, and many of our most enlightened statesmen and merchants have for years urged the measure whenever there appeared to be any prospect of even a hearing from those in authority. Twelve years ago HENRY CLAY wrote: ""I have thought for years that the independence of Liberia ought to be recognized by our Government, and I have frequently urged it upon persons connected with the Administration, and I shall continue to do so if I have suitable opportunities."" The one barrier all along in the way has been that despicable and disgraceful prejudice, which would deny the black race even the poor recognition of humanity. This prejudice was again made to do service in opposing the passage of the bill for the recognition of Hayti and Liberia, by the fag-end of the negrophobists in Congress; and, characteristically enough, the meanest and most malignant speeches against it were made by Northern men. The bugaboo of the equality of blacks with whites (assumed as being contemplated by this measure,) was again trotted out; and poor Mr. Cox, of Ohio, tried his best to terrify the House into a rejection of the measure by the picture of a negro in Court dress. It is not to say very much to say that Congress had common sense enough not to be influenced by such wretched puerilities. At the same time it is gratifying that the spirit of the age has been at length recognized in this act of tardy justice.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RECONGNIZED AT LAST.

It turns out that his name was BERNARD LEWIS, the well-known and skillful artist, who, for a long time past, has been employed as the scene-painter at LAURA KEENE's Theatre. He has been missing since the 20th of May last. On that day he was seen by several of his friends riding around the City in a carriage, in a state of intoxication. When last seen alive, he was at his bankers, in company with three rough-looking men. While at the latter place, he drew the sum of either $70 or $700 -- which of the sums is not known -- and soon after left with his companions; before leaving, however, he gave one of the men an order for a hat. He was identified by his clothes, the body having been previously interred in Potter's Field, as that of an unknown man. It is believed that the wound made by the ball in his head was of itself sufficient to produce death, and the theory of those who have investigated the matter, is that the deceased was induced by others to go to the foot of Houston-street at a late hour of the night; that he was then shot, robbed of his money and other valuables, and then thrown into the water, the murderers hoping in this way to hide all the evidence of their crime. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that no money or other property was found upon his person, although it is known that he carried a heavy gold watch and chain, a diamond pin, and it is also thought a large amount of money. Miss LAURA KEENE is taking a very active part in the endeavor to unravel the mystery, and bring the murderers to punishment, if it be a fact that the man has died by foul means.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Further Particulars of the Supposed Murder at the foot of Houston-street.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Further Particulars of the Supposed Murder at the foot of Houston-street.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e90bc7ad-08e7-5475-acc9-631e1d1b84d6,405,nyt://article/e90bc7ad-08e7-5475-acc9-631e1d1b84d6

editorial speculates on their chances of taking Memphis,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/06/archives/memphis.html,editorial speculates on their chances of taking Memphis,"The chances seem to be ten to one that Memphis is not yet taken. The news of its capture was brought to HALLECK'S headquarters by ""a man"" who asserted that the city surrendered on Friday last. But since the arrival of this solitary individual, ""ten refugees"" have come in, who left Memphis on Monday of this week, and bring with them the local papers of that day, which papers do not mention the surrender of the city The averment of one man must, by the ordinary rules of testimony, be regarded as invalid when directly contradicted by the averment of ten men, particularly when the latter are backed up by a Memphis editor. Moreover, there was a meeting of the citizens of Memphis, held on Sunday last, at which resolutions were adopted that ""the city never should yield to the enemy voluntarily."" Wonder if the citizens of Memphis thought that anybody was going to ask them to surrender ""voluntarily."" That is not the way things are done in war. Cities and armies usually surrender quite involuntarily, and when the alternative of surrender is destruction. The fact, however, that the Memphians adopted the resolution mentioned, is good proof that if the city has not yet surrendered, it is on the eve of doing so. The usual course of the rebel cities and hamlets on the Mississippi River toward our naval officers now ascending that stream, has been to send to our fleet, as soon as it came in sight, a deputation headed by the mayor, who asserted that the place never would surrender; and after this, the next thing we learn is that a small party of our soldiers had gone ashore, taken possession of the place, and administered the oath of allegiance to the recalcitrant municipal functionaries. There is no doubt that this is pretty nearly the programme that will be carried out in Memphis.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MEMPHIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MEMPHIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/34f9c156-741d-5d4a-9b7d-0b8c760a911a,502,nyt://article/34f9c156-741d-5d4a-9b7d-0b8c760a911a

Our European letters and selections, and translations from our files, will be found in their appropriate place. The anxiety relative to news from America was daily becoming more and more intense among the commercial classes of England, and false rumors were in constant circulation. In regard to the capture of the British steamer Bermuda by one of our blockaders, Mr. LAYARD declared in the House of Commons, on the 23d ult., that the case had been referred to the Law Officers of the Crown. The case of the Emily St Pierre was being discussed in the Liverpool papers, and there was evidently little disposition to give her up. The London Times thinks the details of the capture of New-Orleans put the surrender of the city in a light more favorable to the defenders. A similar tone is assumed by that portion of the Paris Press under Secessionist influence; though the importance of the National victories at New-Orleans and Yorktown were generally fully recognized. The Common Council of London resolved to present Mr. PEABODY with the freedom of the City. An interesting discussion on the experiments at Shoeburyness, brought out declarations from several members of Parliament to the effect that the great Armstrong Gun is practically a failure. The Continental news, with the exception of the revelations of French designs in Mexico, is not of marked importance. It is stated that Gen. PRIM will be authorized to return to Mexico as Spanish Ambassador. The sales of Cotton for the week, in the Liverpool market, had been 33,880 bales, at a general decline.

"MARY RILEY, a poor Irish emigrant girl, arrived in this City not long since, on her way to her friends in the State of Ohio. She expected to find, upon her arrival here, either a ticket for a passage to her place of destination, or the money with which to defray her expenses thither -- which her friends at the West had assured her should be here when she arrived from Europe. For a week or more she has been at Castle Garden, under the supervision of Mr. CASSERLY, the well-known agent of the Commissioners of Emigration. Yesterday morning, however, her money failed, and upon being questioned she frankly stated what her expectations were, and that she was only waiting for a letter from her sisters in Ohio, which would contain the necessary means to permit her to proceed onward. At the same time, she produced a letter that she had received about a week before at Castle Garden, and which she said she had been unable to read. Mr. CASSERLY read the letter, and from it he learned that a certificate for MARY's passage from New-York to her friends in Ohio had been sent. The letter was addressed to the care of Messsrs. KNOUTH, NACHOD & KUHNE, No. 28 Broad-street, and from them it had been sent to the girl at Castle Garden soon after her arrival in the City, but it contained no ticket or certificate of passage. Mr. CASSERLY at once dispatched Sergeant MCPHERSON, of the Castle Garden Police, to the store of the above firm. He was referred to their confidential book-keeper. The latter individual, upon being presented with the letter in question, admitted that he had opened it. When asked what he had done with the ticket or certificate of passage that the letter contained, he became very impudent and abusive to the officer. After much delay, however, the certificate was produced from an out-of-the-way place, but the book-keeper would give no satisfaction whatever for having detained the document, or for having broken open the letter. Mr. CASSERLY, upon being informed of these facts, at once made application to the United States authorities to have the party dealt with according to law. The story was related at the United States District Attorney's office, and Mr. ANDREWS, the Assistant District-Attorney, immediately sent Deputy Marshals PLEL and HUNT in pursuit of the bookkeeper. The latter was brought up, and after hearing the statement of the accused, the Assistant District-Attorney concluded it was not a case wherein he had jurisdiction to act; he was also of the opinion that it was no violation of the United States law for a person to break open a letter addressed to his care for another. Mr. CASSERLY thought otherwise, and says he is determined to break up the system of swindling emigrants, that is at present practice [???] by various parties in this city, who, when an emigrant arrives in here bound to the Western States, will take every means in their power to sell them tickets, for which they get from 30 to 40 per cent. commission.

The two ladies had retired to bed a few minutes before the approach of the storm, and it is supposed that they had not gone to sleep when the fatal accident occurred. The head of the bed, in which they were lying together, stood near a gable window. The lightning struck the house between two chimnics, and the fluid appeared to have divided into three different forks, and to pass in different directions. The fork which killed the ladies passed in at the window near the bed. There was a feather mattress upon a straw one, and the flued passed under the feathers and set the straw on tire. A right cup worn by one of the ladies was torn into shreds, and the face and neck of the wearer somewhat marked. The other fork or division of the fluid passed down a wooden water conductor, which was completely shattered. The third passed down a chimney-flue to the lower story, and, coming out near the fire-place, shot diagonally across the room, breaking a looking-glass into a hundred pieces. The shock was, of course, distinctly felt by all in the house, and some member of Mr. PILLSBURY's family opening the door of the room occupied by the girls, the fire in the bed was discovered and immediately extinguished.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f10eb1f6-66ff-5148-b1f6-4e8b51bd48eb,337,nyt://article/f10eb1f6-66ff-5148-b1f6-4e8b51bd48eb

"GARD's army will have a very important bearing on the great question of cotton supply. Had that army retreated slowly, fighting its way foot by foot through Mississippi. Alabama and Georgia, or westward through Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, there is no doubt that the military authorities would have destroyed all the cotton, tobacco and sugar on the line of retreat. But if the rebel army is broken up, the fragments of it will have quite enough to do to save themselves without running from county to county and from plantation to plantation applying the torch to the little stores of cotton. The great bulk of the cotton in the rebel States is still on the plantations, in accordance with the act of the rebel Congress forbidding its accumulation in the cities or at the usual shipping points. Very little of this has as yet been burnt: and if the rebel forces really are defeated, and if our armies occupy the railroad lines and our navy commands the rivers, and if martial law is, as it will be, declared over the repossessed States, it will be a dangerous thing for rebel marauders or planters to attempt to burn cotton anywhere within their bounds. If after these events happen, the rebel planters do not promptly send forward their cotton to market, it will, doubtless, he promptly sent forward for them.

"The ladies of the New-York Educational Union have established, at No. 334 Sixth-avenue, a resort (it would be well to say home, were not the word so hackneyed) for children whose fathers have been killed in battle, or are prostrated by camp-contracted disease. The institution is intended to meet many wants. First, that of the care-worn, war-made widow, who is thankful to leave her little one under the kind auspices of Mr. and Mrs. DAVIS, the Superintendents, while she seeks perhaps for the first time a day's employment. Again, it is a refuge for the young girl of intelligence and capacity, who would fain accept instruction to fit her to combat unwonted trials in a commercial sphere; and a home for the little girls and boys, some of whom wear garments of mourning that should be looked reverently upon by every loyal American, especially those who in tranquility of luxurious homes, entertain but faint visions of the battle-field. The enterprise is of late conception, and has been scarcely two weeks in operation. The moving spirits at work in it are nerved on by the knowledge that sixteen thousand families of our New-York soldiers are reduced to the extremity of applying to the relief fund of the City for aid, and that their multitude of little children must feel the heaviest pressure of poverty. They must either be left to the chance and often demoralizing associations of the street, or have a place provided for their accommodation, while their care-takers are necessarily absent. The ladies who have visited these families have discovered that in many cases the heads of them have returned from the war debilitated and suffering, so that they are confined to their beds a home, thus increasing the weight of care upon the household, while they are unable to relieve any necessity. Such cases the ladies are especially mindful of, and supply with whatever their resources may afford in the way of food or clothing. The main feature of the organization, however, is to edicate the children whose early career of peaceful acquirement has been interrupted by the breaking up of their family circle; so that, after they have completed a certain course of study, they may be of use to society and to those they hold most dear. It is nut at all a design of the institution to separate the little ones from their natural guardians, and it is the privilege of parents to take them home every night, or to leave them one week and have them spend the Sabbath at homo to be welcomed again by their adopted guardians on Monday morning. This is certainly a considerate plan, when it is remembered that the children of our volunteers are quite a different class, far more hopeful and full of character than the habitual dependers upon charitable assistance.

The refined, the intellectual, the beautiful are here, not only in the first promising loveliness of childhood, but in the full bloom of youth and inspiration of usefulness. Donations of articles both useful and attractive have been received, to swell the little stock that is displayed for safe in aid of the general fund. Ladies will find it repaying to step out of their usual shopping routes to purchase some of these pretty concerts, which are held at prices proportionate to the economist's purse.

The Bible is read, its teachings explained,and a copy of it given or sold to the family. This enterprise has now progressed for one year, and promises well for the future. One of the visitors reported the condition of one thousand families, whose spiritual necessities she had tried to relieve in the short space of three months. She had also exerted much influence in getting the children sent to the public and to the Sunday Schools. It is a cherished feature of the Society to appeal directly to the wife and mother, and through her to the husband, by teaching her how she can make her house attractive to him; to elevate the tastes of the children, and instruct them in their share of household unity and peace. These younger members are often make the most powerful instruments of reform, for the rude nature may listen unawares to good lessons in the innocent prattle of a beloved child when it would treat with scorn a remonstrance from an older and less pure source. These welders of the missing link in homes made desolate by absence of moral law, are exposed to every disgusting contact, having nothing to protect them but the mantle of purity which their mission throws about them.

"We observe that BEAUREGARD, amid the multiplicity of his business during the last days of his stay at Corinth, found time to consider the future a little, for it is said that he sent dispatches to the officer commanding at Mobile, directing him to hold that place at all hazards, ""as it would be the base of important operations in prospective.""

HALLECK, perhaps, could conjecture with more probability than we, who are not military men, and are so far off. But what seems to us the most ""important operation"" for BEAUREGARD, as he and his scattered forces flee before POPE, the rebel-catcher, who does not seem at all to resemble that Pope of whom BUNYAN spoke, as being stiff in his sinews and rusty in his joints, is for him and the other ringleaders to get out of the country; and for this ""important operation in prospective,"" Mobile seems to us as available a ""base"" as is to be found along the Southern coast. It is one of the few ports still remaining to the rebels where they have any vessels left, and those are necessary to such an important operation. But unless this operation is speedily put in execution, we fear it will be too late. If FARRAGUT gets ready to bring his gunboats and mortar vessels around there, the operation will prove a difficult one. If BEAUREGARD can get to Mobile before him, he had better undertake it at once, for it will be much easier performed while only our blockading squadron lie off the port. We hope our Secretary of the Navy will instruct, the officers of our blockading squadron to be especially careful not only to catch all the vessels, but also as to whom they allow to depart. And it any peaceful passengers are discovered upon the vessels which may be caught making their escape from rebeldom, to have them carefully examined by those who can defect a military bearing under civilians' clothes. The captured of some of those fleeing traitors might not bring the navy so much prize money, unless, indeed, some one could be found who would buy them at their own valuation, but it would afford a satisfaction to the country which would be better than prize money to whoever should have the good fortune to accomplish it.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/07/archives/the-base-of-an-important-operation.html,,"We observe that BEAUREGARD, amid the multiplicity of his business during the last days of his stay at Corinth, found time to consider the future a little, for it is said that he sent dispatches to the officer commanding at Mobile, directing him to hold that place at all hazards, ""as it would be the base of important operations in prospective.""

But unless this operation is speedily put in execution, we fear it will be too late. If FARRAGUT gets ready to bring his gunboats and mortar vessels around there, the operation will prove a difficult one. If BEAUREGARD can get to Mobile before him, he had better undertake it at once, for it will be much easier performed while only our blockading squadron lie off the port. We hope our Secretary of the Navy will instruct, the officers of our blockading squadron to be especially careful not only to catch all the vessels, but also as to whom they allow to depart. And it any peaceful passengers are discovered upon the vessels which may be caught making their escape from rebeldom, to have them carefully examined by those who can defect a military bearing under civilians' clothes. The captured of some of those fleeing traitors might not bring the navy so much prize money, unless, indeed, some one could be found who would buy them at their own valuation, but it would afford a satisfaction to the country which would be better than prize money to whoever should have the good fortune to accomplish it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BASE OF AN IMPORTANT OPERATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BASE OF AN IMPORTANT OPERATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/95c0c436-f897-5496-8f1b-c81aebb73d23,407,nyt://article/95c0c436-f897-5496-8f1b-c81aebb73d23

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/07/archives/personal.html,,"-- A spirited scrimmage occurred in Huntsville, Ala., a few days since, between Col. LEW. HARRIS, of one of the Ohio regiments, and Col. DAVIS, a law partner of JERE CLEMENS, and formerly an earnest Union man, but more recently an officer in the rebel army. The meeting took place at the quarters of Major MCCOOK. Some champagne was opened and the discussion of the state of the country presently grew warm. The Alabama Colonel told the Ohio Colonel he was a liar, with the customary qualifying epithet, and Ohio told him that if he were not the guest of Major MCCOOK, he would knock him down, Alabama begged Ohio not to have any scruples of that Sort, and repeated the epithet. So at it they went. Fair play was shown, and Ohio soon made his word good, knocking Alabama down and giving him a severe belting when he was down. Ohio's damage consisted chiefly in a badly-torn shirt. Alabama received a pair of black eyes and enlarged rose and mouth. JERE CLEMENS met the Ohio officer a few days afterward and told him he had inquired into the particulars of the affray, and that his partner (DAVIS,) had been served exactly right. DAVIS afterward acknowledged that he had got no more than he deserved. This little circumstance has contributed largely to the popularity of the Ohioan in Huntsville.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Personal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Personal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8cfdd54-efa6-5119-b987-6e3648004b4a,654,nyt://article/a8cfdd54-efa6-5119-b987-6e3648004b4a

editorial speculates on capture of Memphis; Editorial on possibility of getting cotton now that Beauregard has been routed,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/07/archives/the-mississippi-unlocked.html,editorial speculates on capture of Memphis; Editorial on possibility of getting cotton now that Beauregard has been routed,"When BEAUREGARD had started southward from Corinth, the immediate fall of Memphis was seen to be inevitable. When Memphis was ours, the whole line of the Mississippi River, and the whole of the Great Valley, was in our military possession. Above that place our descending gunboat fleet had reduced every stronghold from New-Madrid to Fort Pillow. Below it, our ascending fleet had battered down or brought to terms every rebel fort and city from the Delta and from New-Orleans to the mouth of the Arkansas River. And both of these fleets were pressing hard upon the city. Beside our upper and lower river fleets, there was advancing upon it an overwhelming military force from Gen. HALLECK's army. Either of these naval or military detachments was capable of capturing the city; -- acting together, resistance on its part was useless. The most convenient National force to Memphis of late, has been the upper naval flotilla. The only obstacles to its southern advance were two or three unreduced rebel earthworks, some distance above the city on the left bank of the river; and into the principal one of these our mortar-boats have been showering bombshells for the past two months. We have news this morning that this work (Fort Pillow, or Wright) has been reduced, and that both it and Fort Randolph, ten miles below, are in possession of our troops. These were the only defences of any moment, unreduced, known to exist above Memphis. So that there is little doubt that yesterday afternoon or this morning, our fleet appeared before the great rebel city of the Southwest, and demanded, and probably received, its capitulation. It was understood that our upper fleet was not to advance upon it until our fleet below was ready to cooperate. So that it is not unlikely that the citizens of the last rebel city on the Mississippi, on looking up the stream this morning behold the Stars and Stripes floating in the breeze, and, on looking down the stream, behold the same resistless banner approaching from that direction. We have already had abundance of threats that the inhabitants would burn the city before they would surrender; and here, as elsewhere, we have heard plenty of gammon about dying in last ditches. But a hundred rebel towns, -- and one of them the capital of Tennessee, -- which had vociferated the same nonsense until they were hoarse, -- have capitulated when they saw they could not help themselves; and the fact that Memphis has roared louder, if possible, than any other place, is only a sign that it is prepared the quicker to devour its own words.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mississippi Unlocked.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mississippi Unlocked.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c767addd-4c03-59c7-99f7-18db30f9838d,815,nyt://article/c767addd-4c03-59c7-99f7-18db30f9838d

Even the London Times is mournfully compelled to admit the strength and resolution of the National Government, and to perceive the inadequacy of the means wherewith traitors have sought its destruction. For a long time did that ingenuous journal entertain the conviction that we could never raise an army, but if we unfortunately did so, there was consolation in the certainty that it would never fight, and whether it fought or not, there remained a cheering reflection in the impossibility of its ever being paid.

"THE PETROLEUM OIL ORDINANCE. -- The Common Council, it will be remembered, at the meeting held on Monday evening last, adopted a stringent ordinance, almost prohibiting the traffic or distillation of Petroleum Oil within the city limits. At the same time the subject matter of the ordinance was referred to the Joint Fire Department Committee to investigate the nature of this kind of oil, and recommend such changes in the ordinance as they might deem best for the interest of all parties. A meeting of the Committee was called for Friday evening, at the City Hall; but, notwithstanding the large amount of capital invested in the business in this city and a direct invitation for all interested in the business to appear before the Committee at that time, when their side of the case would be heard, only one member of the Committee, Alderman BELKNAP, made his appearance during the whole evening. At 9 o'clock the gentlemen interested in the oil trade, who had met at the Committee room by invitation, as above stated, resolved, so long as they had got together, to do something toward giving a fair expression of their grievances. A meeting was therefore organized by electing Mr. J.G. WILLIAMS Chairman, and Mr. J. WALES Secretary. After some desultory conversation as to the importance of united action in an effort to secure a remodeling of the ordinance, so that the right of all might be conserved, Mr. PAGE moved that a Committee of five be appointed to draft petitions, obtain signatures, and present the case of the oil-dealers in a succinct manner to the Common Council Committee on the first opportunity offered. This motion was adopted, and the Chairman appointed the following named gentlemen on the Committee: Messrs. Richardson, Wales, Stearns, Irvine and Ketchum. The meeting then adjourned until 3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon next, at No. 34 Pine-street, New-York, at which time it is expected there will be a large attendance of oil-dealers.

Editorial discusses terms Puritans and Cavaliers in describing settlers of Massachusetts and Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/08/archives/puritans-and-cavaliers.html,Editorial discusses terms Puritans and Cavaliers in describing settlers of Massachusetts and Virginia,"A favorite device with the Secessionists and their sympathizers is that which seeks to identify loyal men and rebels, respectively, with the Roundheads and Cavaliers of the time of the STUARTS. The object of insisting upon this analogy is quite obvious, but consideration will show that it must fall far short of logical demonstration,. It is highly desirable for the traitors to hold Unionists up to the world as gloomy ascetics who hate innocent pleasure, and try to oppose all who disagree with their fanatical dogmas; and equally so to represent themselves as gay, dashing, high-spirited fellows, overflowing with honor and redolent of chivalrous sensibility. Such are the ideas suggested to most people, now-a-days, by the terms Puritan and Cavalier.

The arrests were made at thattime upon the complaint of three or four brokers, who have offices in the vicinity. They alleged that it was the daily habit of large numbers of men, who claim to be street brokers, to gather in crowds, upon the side-walk, and in front of their offices, thereby obstructing the way, and preventing customers from entering their places of business. When complaint was made to Mr. KENNEDY, Superintendent of the Police, he immediately determined to put a stop to the nuisance, and for this purpose he directed that a patrolman should be stationed at that place during business hours, with instructions to arrest all parties who were found obstructing the sidewalk, or in any way interfering with the rights of those engaged in a legitimate business. Pursuant to these directions the officer upon that post, yesterday, arrested Mr. THOS. DENNY, a very respectable and inoffensive gentleman, and a member of the Stock Exchange. The policeman showed very little regard for Mr. DENNY's position or feelings; but on the contrary, dragged him through the crowded streets to the Tombs, in a very rude way. When the magistrate had heard the com-plaint, and Mr. DENNY's reply thereto, he instantly released the accused party, and reproved the officer for the ungentlemanly course that he had pursued.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f9e03cc-ea01-571e-964f-218ec5990f14,1423,nyt://article/4f9e03cc-ea01-571e-964f-218ec5990f14

The issue involved in the contest is the grandest, -- the old issue of Freedom which has been ""bequeathed from bleeding sire to son"" all through the long ages -- which our grandsires and their children fought for, and which has been given to us to do battle for once again, and then, as a sacred gift, hand down to our posterity. A fiercer or bloodier foe never entered the lists for mortal combat than that now fronting our army, and ranged under the black banner of Slavery and rebellion. This is his last desperate chance, and he knows it.

Editorial on military strength of North and South,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/08/archives/resources-of-north-and-south.html,Editorial on military strength of North and South,"The recent flurry occasioned by the bold dash of the rebels upon Gen. BANKS has been the occasion of a movement of troops which displays in a most striking manner the difference between our situation and that of the rebels. After a year of war carried on upon a scale of unprecedented magnitude, in which we had put mightier armies on foot than this continent has ever seen before, the Government had given orders to receive no more volunteers, and thus alone had checked the rush of our people to the camps. But now, at the call of a sudden emergency, on every hand spring up new hosts of armed men, where all was quiet but a few days since, and the roads again begin to shake beneath their tread as they pour forward, showing that the ""frozen loins"" of the ""populous North"" have not yet lost their fruitfulness, and that a year of the privations and burdens of war has but whetted their zeal and fired the patriotism of those who are proud to be the sons of the North. And yet we are that people whom taunting Southrons so loudly proclaimed to be an unmilitary people, who thought of nothing but material things, and took more naturally to peddling and to the petty cheats of small traffic than to anything else. They have learned by this time that when ""the lawful tap of the drum"" resounds through our valleys and over our plains, it summons to the ranks fighting men, of whom any General might be proud, and whom any foe must respect.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Resources of North and South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Resources of North and South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bee8d0a2-5d6e-553b-8547-a38197349a9a,783,nyt://article/bee8d0a2-5d6e-553b-8547-a38197349a9a

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/general-city-news-dedication-of-a-new-presbyterian-church.html,,"PICKPOCKETS IN STAGES. -- The stages in NewYork, and especially those running principally upon Broadway, have recently been made the resort of a well organized and skillful set of pickpocket, who ply their trade with impunity, upon passengers of all grades, if the victims do not happen to be well informed in regard to the habits and practices of the numerous thieves who infest the City. Not a day passes, but that we hear of some person who has been unfortunate enough to lose money in this way. In most cases, however, the guilty parties escape, for the simple reason that there cannot be sufficient evidence brought against them to secure a conviction. The operators in this business, are of both sexes, and apparently of all ages and conditions in life. Some are exceedingly well dressed, and appear like well-bred ladies and gentlemen; others are poorly clad, and pretend to be proper objects of charity. The Police authorities assert that there is a thoroughly organized gang of these pickpockets in the City, the leaders of which, have, by dint of much pains and labor, reduced the business to a system, and that some of the most adroit pocket-robbers in the country are connected with this band. Each one has his particular branch of business to attend to. Some of them exhibit the most skill in taking a person's pocket-book in a crowd, while others can more successfully operate in a stage or car. They much prefer a stage to a car however, from the fact that in the latter vehicle they are liable to be observed by the conductor, and, if caught in the act, their escape is more likely to be prevented. On Saturday afternoon last one of this gang was caught by Officer BODINE, of the Fifteenth Precinct, and yesterday morning the accused was taken before Justice KELLY, where, after examination, she was committed to prison. The prisoner gave her name as ADELAIDE IRWIN; she says she is a native of this State and nineteen years of age. She and the complainant, HELEN MCNAUGHT, were the only persons in the stage at the time. The accused very adroitly picked the pocket of her victim of a porte-monnaie containing $7, and soon after left the stage. Mrs. MCNAUGHT, who, by the way, has been recently victimized twice in the same manner, at once missed her money, and gave chase. After running about a block the thief was caught, while in the act of throwing away the porte-monnaie, the money having already been abstracted. Several persons are now in the City Prison upon the charge of picking pockets in stages, and the Police are daily adding to the list of offenders. It is thought that the authorities have obtained sufficient information to enable them to break up this systematic nuisance.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; DEDICATION OF A NEW PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; DEDICATION OF A NEW PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/522c87a6-b57e-581b-9afc-cb6ff7ab479a,936,nyt://article/522c87a6-b57e-581b-9afc-cb6ff7ab479a

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/the-surrender-of-memphis.html,,"The capitulation of Memphis, which was seen to be inevitable after the evacuation of Corinth and the fall of Fort Pillow, is now authentically announced. The city surrendered on Friday morning last to our naval fleet, after the latter had destroyed or captured, in a brisk fight, the whole of the rebel gun-boats which had remained as its last defence. It was surrendered to our forces by the very man, the Mayor of the city, who, only five days before, had presided over a meeting, at which the speakers breathed forth fire and vengeance against the Union army; and at which, among others, that notable resolution was passed: ""That we will never yield while we can defend, and will never voluntarily surrender this city into the hands of the enemy."" The city does not appear to have been given to the flames, as the howling rebel dervishes of that locality have asseverated every day for the last eighteen months that it should be, if our forces ever managed to reach it. The cotton-bale barricades, which were originally erected in the streets by the immortal Gen. PILLOW, and behind which every man, woman and slave was to fight, and to fight until the last armed inhabitant expired, had long ago been removed; and the other terrible devices for our destruction, which the local Press have conjured up, do not seem to have been brought into requisition. A small military force -- for we believe there were only two regiments of troops accompanied the fleet -- quietly took possession of a city which, by last census, had a population of twenty-five thousand, -- the largest city in Tennessee, the largest between St. Louis and New-Orleans, the last rebel stronghold on the Mississippi River, and a point to resign which was to give up not only the whole of the territory beyond the Father of Waters, but was virtually to close the campaign in the Southwest. Not a gun was fired in its defence -- not a rebel life was laid down to save it. The rebel troops, we suppose, must have decamped; for they did not fight. The rebel Generals, and among them Peacock PILLOW, who ""would rather die a thousand deaths than see Memphis in the hands of the enemy,"" all took to their heels, we imagine; for not a General, dead or alive, is mentioned as a captive. The rebel Governor and Legislature, who, when chased from Nashville, took up their quarters in Memphis, have fled to some other place of temporary safety; and to find it they must have absconded from Tennessee. The rebel newspapers of Memphis, which seemed to be printed with sulphur instead of ink, doubtless now exhibit that discretion which for them is the safer part of valor. If rebel brag has not already become so ridiculous that nothing could add to its absurdity, this denouement at Memphis would cap the climax. Nashville had spoken strongly, and had blustered fiercely as to what it would do: New-Orleans had boasted of its power and impregnability, and had warned us what tearful things we might expect if ever we came there; 'Norfolk, and a score of other rebel cities now in our possession, had previously declaimed loudly enough as to their determination to fight the invader to the last; Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond, even now, while we are thundering at their gates, keep up a show of spirit. But of all the cities of rebeldom, captured or to be captured, not one has approached to Memphis in the ferocity of its threats against us, in its ear-splitting screams of defiance, in the uproarious, obstreperous shrieks, yells, and whoops of murder and madness, in case the Yankees should dare to set foot within its sacred streets. If it can be that Memphis has surrendered to a few gunboats and a few hundred Union soldiers, peacefully and without firing a shot, it would not now surprise us to see Charleston succumb as soon as Gen. HUNTER, from his headquarters at Port Royal, bids it do so; or to behold the South Carolina fire-eaters transformed into lambs, and hailing with shouts of rapture the Star Spangled Banner.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Surrender of Memphis.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Surrender of Memphis.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2df43d9-3a4c-58c7-ac40-0e9fbb236d25,939,nyt://article/d2df43d9-3a4c-58c7-ac40-0e9fbb236d25

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/discourse-of-rev-dr-williams-on-the-condition-of-the-country.html,,"Rev. Dr. WILLIAMS repeated yesterday morning, in his Church in Amity-street, the discourse recently delivered by him at Providence, before the Home Missionary Society of the Baptist Church. It was a very able, interesting and instructive sermon Its leading purpose was to urge the fact that all great national changes, all wars, rebellions and social transformations, however dreadful they may seem to us, are really the means by which Providence works out His own purposes, and that those purposes always involve the advancement and upbuilding of His Church, and the establishment and diffusion of His truth. He illustrated this principle by copious and learned references to history, both ancient and modern, and then urged its application to the war in which we are now engaged for the maintenance of the Government against rebellion. Whether we can see the successive steps of His Providence in this war, or not, it is nevertheless certain that God presides over every event which marks its progress, and will, by its agency, accomplish his own righteous designs. Dr. W. specified several respects in which the beneficial effects of the war upon the National character can already be traced. It has rebuked and checked the prevalent overweening fondness for lucre, by showing that there are aims and objects infinitely more worthy of labor and sacrifice than more wealth It has fastened the attention of the nation upon foundation principles -- upon the precepts of justice and of right, which are indispensable to all national prosperity. It has deepened and quickened the public sense of the real sacredness and obligation of an oath, by holding up to reprobation the infusions perjury of which the South has been guilty. The doctrine of the old Jesuits, that an oath might be taken with a mental reservation, which should annul its obligations whenever they came in conflict with the Order, has worked their ruin and exposed their organization to the scorn and contumely of the world forever. But it has been fairly paralleled and fully equaled in guilt by those who, year after year, in high places of public trust, have sworn allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, with the mental reservation that they would disregard the oath whenever it came in conflict with the minor claims of the several States. This infamous perjury is working out its proper fruits. It has covered the rebellion with curses as with a garment, and they will cling to it and its authors forever The war is developing and strengthening the spirit of National unity, by showing all parts and all the people of the Nation how essential they are to each other -- by leading them all to common toils, common sufferings and common sacrifices for the common good. Men of all races -- men from the Scheldt and the Shannon -- meet together on the battle-field and shed their blood under the same flag, and fight for the same blessings common to them all of order, of liberty, of law; and so they come to have a stronger and a more pervading sentiment of the identity of their national interests, and the unity of their public duties. Dr. WILLIAMS dwelt upon each of these points with great force and eloquence, and spoke also at some length of the bearings of the war upon Slavery, which has always been our reproach abroad and at home. Our fathers regarded it as an evil, and by studied circumlocution shunned its recognition in the Constitution, hoping and believing that it would prove ephemeral. But the South, misled by sophistry and a false view of their own interest, have sought to make it permanent, and, according to the avowal of their own Vice-President, have made it the cornerstone -- the very basis and foundation -- of their new Confederacy. To recognize a nation with such a basis -- resting upon an open and ostentatious denial of God's own declaration that of one blood He has made all the nations of the earth, on a flagrant and blasphemous denial of the rights and humanity of any class of men, said Dr. W., would be an infamy not to be thought of for a moment in this age of civilization and Christianity. The North could better afford to wage war upon it for a century -- to see every one of her cities and towns laid in ashes, and her people driven to the mountains for refuge, than assent to the incorporation of such a principle into the Constitution of the nation. But the progress of events proves that they are not called to make any such sacrifice. Every day indicates that this great question is to be solved much more speedily and with much less suffering than we could have predicted. Without any violent or sudden uprooting, the advance of our armies loosens the bonds of Slavery, and the longer the war continues, the greater the number of the slaves set free: -- and for the nation to return men, thus enfranchised, to bondage again, would be an infamy not to be for a moment thought of. The apostolic precept to slaves, not to despise their masters, but, it they may have freedom without violence or wrong, to ""use it rather,"" -- to prefer freedom to Slavery if they can secure it without violence or sin of their own, must be the guide of our conduct now. We should shun the violent and sudden changes which would involve society in anarchy and ruin: -- but we can never wisely or justly regard Slavery as equally desirable with freedom, nor fail to ""use"" the latter ""rather"" than the former, if the providence of God shall open the way. These views were enforced with characteristic fervor and force by the preacher, who took occasion in passing to question seriously the wisdom of deporting the enfranchised slaves, saying that Spain did herself most serious wrong in expelling the Moors, and to urge the duty of raising them, by culture, by the influence's of education and of Christianity, to a fitness for their new responsibilities and duties. He referred, also, to the fears that our armies would become our masters, and that, as the result of this war, our Republic would degenerate into a despotism, and said the intelligence, the principle, the home attachments and religious character of the great body of our troops, afforded a sufficient protection, under God, against this peril.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Discourse of Rev.

Editorial on British opinion of US public debt; Editorial on British opinion of public debt,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/the-public-debt-british-opinion.html,Editorial on British opinion of US public debt; Editorial on British opinion of public debt,"The market for the Government Funds, it will be observed from our Stock and Money review, made a further advance last week of one per cent., partly on the general buoyancy of the Stock Exchange, but mainly from the increasing public confidence in and favor toward this leading class of securities. They have also been strengthened by the official contradiction of the various exaggerations through partizan speeches in Congress and otherwise as to the present magnitude of the Public Debt. This contradiction derives the more importance from the fact that the precise figures and classification of the Debt are published in answer to a formal resolution for such a report passed by the House of Representatives a few days ago. It was not volunteered for effect by the Secretary. The resulting average rate of interest paid by the Government is not less gratifying than the comparatively moderate cost at which this great War has been conducted. Both are alike creditable to the Administration of the Government and the prompt and generous confidence of our loyal people who have taken up the whole of the War loans, without the slightest reference, to or reliance upon the foreign markets. Indeed, while this process has been going on, our own market has taken back from England a large share of the old 5 and 6 per cents of the United States, heretofore held abroad; especially the 5 per cents of 1874, upon which heavy profits have been made by American parties in London, like Messrs.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/mistaken-kindness.html,,"-- We observe that Commodore FOOTE continues to be pestered with invitations to celebrations in his honor. These are, no doubt, weil meant -- but the movers must surely be altogether forgetful of the condition of the gallant sailor that has necessitated his temporary retiracy. Commodore FOOTE was severely wounded at the taking of Fort Donelson, and the wound was much aggravated by his long refusal to take rest from the arduous duties of the campaign on the Western waters. Finally, however, it became obvious that if he was ever again to be able to serve his country as he wished to, the one imperative condition was that he should allow himself sufficient repose for his wound to heal and his physique to regain its strength. Accordingly he retired to Cleveland, where he has a brother, under whose care he is now recuperating. It is said that he weighs but one-half what he did previous to the fight at Fort Donelson, so reduced is his system. The heart of the gallant sailor is, however, firmly set on resuming the work he so nobly began on the rivors of the West; and the whole country wishes to see him again on board his flag-ship, leading his victorious gunboats up the waters where rebellion shows itself. But in order that he shall ever be able to do so, the first condition is that he shall have the undisturbed benefit of his present repose. We hope, therefore, that those who are disposed to disturb it by intentions of Iionizing Commodore FOOTE will reflect that their kindness, though well meant, is untimely and calculated to defeat the object they, in common with the whole country, have in view.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISTAKEN KINDNESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISTAKEN KINDNESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f8118953-00cd-5fa1-8769-6382dda439f0,284,nyt://article/f8118953-00cd-5fa1-8769-6382dda439f0
Editorial sees omen of doom for Confederate leaders whose namesake ships have been destroyed by Union,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/09/archives/the-fearful-doom-of-the-rebel-leaders-foreshadowed.html,Editorial sees omen of doom for Confederate leaders whose namesake ships have been destroyed by Union,"-- In the early days of the war, the rebels used to put great stress upon omens, auspices and portents. Like the ancient Romans, they drew auguries from historic coincidences, the identity of names, places, dates, and what not; and from every sign in the heavens, on the earth, or in the news of the day, they prognosticated the success of the rebellion. Curiously enough, at that time, the omens were nearly always favorable to them, as were also the events which followed or preceded the omens. The first auspice adverse to the rebels was when the pirate ship Jeff. Davis was dashed against the rocks, and went to the bottom of the sea. That clearly foreshadowed the coming doom of the arch-usurper JEFF. DAVIS; and though, prior to this event, everything had gone in his favor, immediately after it the tide turned against him, his kingdom began to break up, and now his ship of State is dashing among the breakers, and will inevitably soon sink to the bottom of the bloody sea on which he launched it. The word ""Sumter"" at first was a name to conjure with; for at Fort Sumter the first success of the rebellion was achieved; but the vessel which the rebels soon after baptized by that name, has been driven in disgrace from the high seas by our cruisers, and is now skulking in the harbor of Gibraltar, under the protection of British guns -- indicating that through some of the knaves may save their necks, it can only be by skulking from their own country and seeking the protection of foreign Powers. Manassas was their next great success, and after it they named their tremendous iron ram, but in the naval engagement below New-Orleans the ram was shivered to atoms and consumed by the fire of the Union guns -- the augury from which occurrence is too palpable to require a priest to set forth. And so it has been with every sign, as well as every event, for the last half year. Every wind has been adverse to the rebels; every rebel cloud has been densely black; every fowl and frog has croaked dolefully; and the entrails of every rebel beast have smelt only of decay. The latest sign of the fate awaiting the prominent rebels of the Southwest, comes in the news of the great naval battle on the Mississippi River, which we give this morning. In that engagement, the General Beauregard was blown up and burned -- auguring a fearful doom for the little Creole. Already he, as well as the gunboat of his name, has been pretty well and pretty highly blown up; and he is now only awaiting the cremation which is sure to come; after which he will float down the stream of time a charred and contemptible wreak. The Gen. Sterling Price had ""one wheel carried away."" Poor Gen. PRICE! He was a good vessel originally, built of sound timber, and designed by nature for most excellent uses. We hope that the rebellion will still leave him one wheel with which to propel himself through this devious world; and if he is of no other service, he can be laid upon the shores of the Republic, high and dry, a melancholy warning to others. The Jeff. Thompson was set on fire and blown up -- a fit fate for the cutthroat and marauder of the Missouri swamps. The Gen. Van Dorn escaped; but, at last advices, two rams were in hot pursuit of him, who will doubtless ere long get their horn into his heart. Thus nearly every prominent rebel has had his doom foreshadowed; and in every case the event is following close upon the heels of the sign. Will not the deluded rebels see that even the gods are against them?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FEARFUL DOOM OF THE REBEL LEADERS; FORESHADOWED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FEARFUL DOOM OF THE REBEL LEADERS; FORESHADOWED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ffa168d3-0685-55d2-b8de-9336ae153b99,638,nyt://article/ffa168d3-0685-55d2-b8de-9336ae153b99

Editorial on loss of Mississippi River possibly annihilating Confederacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/10/archives/the-southern-confederacy-annihilated-by-the-loss-of-the-mississippi.html,Editorial on loss of Mississippi River possibly annihilating Confederacy,"If we were to concede all that the obstinate Secessionists assert, and all that their sympathizers of the British Press claim in their behalf, to wit: that ""the South can never be subjugated,"" there are still certain conclusions reached in the progress of the Union arms, that destroy all hope of the ""South"" ever existing as an independent nation. One conclusion reached is, that the Mississippi River can never be closed against the free commerce of the Northwest. For a brief season it has been thus closed. A hostile local population for a while held that river from New-Orleans to the Belize, with a gunboat force of no contemptible number of bottoms and weight of metal. They held two of the best built forts on its banks that the abundant resources of the National Union constructed; and these defences were supported by an army more numerous and formidable than that with which Gen. JACKSON, 50 years ago, annihilated an attempted invasion of the British, under PAKENHAM. From New-Orleans to Cairo, equally formidable preparations were made to control the navigation of the river. Every bluff was crowned with earth works and columbiads, and islands became as floating batteries to command the approach from North to South. Vast armies garrisoned these positions, as at Columbus, Island No. 10, and Memphis. Looking at these facts from an English stand-point, and remembering the experience of the English in their essay upon the Mississippi River, it is, perhaps, not surprising that the English Government, and its allies here, regarded the dislodgment of such naval forces, batteries and armies, as impossible, especially when sustained by a unanimous local population, possessing resources, courage and will.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Southern Confederacy Annihilated by the Loss of the Mississippi River.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Southern Confederacy Annihilated by the Loss of the Mississippi River.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49837544-1cc5-58a3-9af9-c4cbe0e7fdf7,1016,nyt://article/49837544-1cc5-58a3-9af9-c4cbe0e7fdf7

MCCLELLAN through Virginia; the other was to hold the Mississippi Valley and the Mississippi River, and bar the progress of Gen. HALLECK into the Cotton States of the Gulf. To defeat or disperse either of these armies was to change entirely the aspect of the campaign. If the army of the Southwest was defeated, the area of the Confederacy would be reduced to about one-fifth of its original size, and the number of States which the rebels controlled, even partially, would be reduced to four or five. If the army of Virginia was defeated, the whole of that State, inclusive of the rebel Capital, would fall into our hands; and if the military leaders chose to continue the war any longer, it would be seen by the world and by themselves to be a hopeless struggle for an impossible object.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Features of the Campaign.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Features of the Campaign.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/70009a72-7200-55a1-80af-c89f58c26d2b,931,nyt://article/70009a72-7200-55a1-80af-c89f58c26d2b

"A regular meeting of the Board of Aldermen was held last evening, Alderman VAN BRUNT in the chair. A communication was received from the Mayor, returning without his approval the resolution adopted on the 26th ult., declaring the contract made with HENRY W. PARSONS, for repairing the lamps in the Western District, null and vold, and directing the Board of Contracts to advertise for proposals for repairing the same until the 1st of June, 1863. The Mayor thinks to release a contractor simply because he secured an unremunerated job, would be setting a bad precedent. Also a resolution, adopted at the same meeting appointing a Committee of five to proceed to Albany to collect money from the State to refund the city for advances made, amounting to $75,000, to equip volunteers at the commencement of the war, and to distribute the same, when collected, to the wives, &c., of the volunteers in the field. The Mayor makes no objection to the object for which it is sought to appropriate the money, but he thinks that sending a Committee to proceed to Albany, would involve an unnecessary expense, and that it is a duty properly pertaining to the Comptroller, who, when the money has been appropriated by the State, can obtain the same at the expense of a few post-age-stamp; also the resolution deciding that the streets of the city shall be repaired by contract, and that proposals for each Ward be advertised for separately, such a method, in the opinion of the Mayor, would be impracticable, while to advertise for each district of the city separately would be perfectly practicable. The communication was laid on the table and ordered printed. The Corporation Counsellor communicated the following recent decisions at a General Term of the Supreme Court, affecting interests of the city: The case of the People ex rel.

That portion of the Counsellor's communication referring to Gowanus Bridge was referred to the Assessment Committee and the balance to the Law Committee. The Special Committee, composed of the Eastern District Aldermen, to whom was referred the subject of an Armory for the Eastern District, reported in favor of purchasing the building at the corner of Fifth and South Fourth streets, known as the Odean.

ACADEMY OF MUSIC.--Mr. ULLMAN is about to step into the ring of musical management once again. His career as an operatic manager has been extraordinary enough.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/10/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. ULLMAN is about to step into the ring of musical management once again. His career as an operatic manager has been extraordinary enough. Here he has culminated, and there his pecuniary affairs have been in decadence. Now, he has made money, and immediately after he has failed to pay both his artists and outside employes. At one moment up, and at another moment down, he has been the veritable JACK in the box of musical speculators. If we are not mistaken, his last speculation was an unsuccessful one. Consequently, we should not be astonished if his present attempt was to make a veritable hit. In the first place, his prices are reduced to the same popular sum which we had opera for at Castle Garden many seasons since -- so many, indeed, that, being youthful, we prefer being excused from remembering the exact period. In the next place, be offers to us a plethora of attraction. There are two new prima donnas besides Miss KELLOGG and Mme. D'ANGRI -- the last of whom is, with the exception of ALBONI, the greatest contralto that has ever visited this country. These novelties are Madame COMTE BORCHAID and Madame HERMANN. The first of these was the leading soprano at New-Orleans, and we should judge, from her success when she song at Boston last year, and our personal knowledge of her vocalism, will prove a decidedly profitable engagement. Madame HERMANN, although announced to make her first appearance ""upon any stage"" in our Academy, is not altogether a novice to the operatic scenes. She has recently appeared at Cincinnati and other of our Western cities, and we argue from what we have heard of her, will confirm the reputation she acquired there. In addition we have BRIGNOLI, SUSINI, -- whose recent concert tour has not proved a success, demonstrating the fact that individuals may be very excellent vocalists and at the same time very unsuccessful musical managers -- with Signor AMODIO, the brother of the late baritone. Signor ABELLA is to be the conductor, and we understand that THEODORE THOMAS once more will assume the position of leader in the orchestra. But opera is not the only thing which Mr. ULLMANN offers to the public for the limited price he announces in his advertisement. He also gives us GOTTSCHALK. This alone ought to make the six operatic evenings which he announces for such a minimum admission indisputably attractive, inasmuch as the public have heretofore paid twice as much to hear GOTTSCHALK without opera. The last attraction is HERRMANN, the Prestidigitateur, who will prestidigitate at the conclusion of the opera. The sale of tickets commences to-day.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/afee0641-5f93-52d9-a61f-bb709c4e469f,1222,nyt://article/afee0641-5f93-52d9-a61f-bb709c4e469f

We suppose it must be allowed that he had at least a hundred thousand men at Corinth. Now, suppose Gen. POPE captured ten thousand of these rebels; suppose ten thousand deserted and fled to their homes, or to the woods; suppose thirty thousand have gone to Richmond, (and, if any were sent there, the single circuitous line of railroad could hardly have carried more than that since the day Corinth was evacuated,) and there are still sixty thousand men of BEAUREGARD's army unaccounted for. It is unlikely that the regiments of Gen. PRICE's command disbanded, or that the men deserted; for the bulk of his troops belonged in Missouri, and it would have been impossible for any number of them to have retraced their steps in that direction, without our immediately knowing it. The troops of Gen. VAN DORN were mostly from Arkansas, and they could not have crossed the river to get to their homes. POLK's troops were from Louisiana and Mississippi; and those from Louisiana, at least, could not have got into their State without first taking the oath of allegiance. BRAGG's troops were from Alabama and Florida; HARDEE's mostly from Georgia, with a few from South Carolina; and, unless those from the latter-mentioned States have been sent eastward toward Virginia, it is hardly conceivable that any very great part of BEAUREGARD's army can have deserted. It is easy to talk about an army a hundred thousand strong breaking up, and the men flying in confusion everywhere; but rarely, if ever, in the military history of the world has an army broken up in such a way, and there is not a shadow of proof that the rebel army of the Southwest has done so. If such a host were disbanded in Mississippi at present the men would be fighting, if not feasting upon, each other before a week.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INFORMATION WANTED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INFORMATION WANTED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d068e6bb-eeec-53ca-8195-071db1077e02,661,nyt://article/d068e6bb-eeec-53ca-8195-071db1077e02

ASHBY, was killed at the late fight near Harrisonburgh. ASHBY has figured very prominently during the whole war in the Shenandoah Valley, and in Gen. BANKS' campaign he was specially conspicuous. Every day, almost, we heard of a new skirmish with ""ASHBY's Cavalry,"" and if half the number of his troop reported at different times to be killed were really and truly slain, he must either have had an immense force under him, or the continually thinned ranks of his regiment must have been very promptly recruited. Every day he was routed; twice a day his men scattered in confusion; and three or four times a day he and they again appeared in full feather. ASHBY's Cavalry formed JACKSON's rear guard in his various retreats; they constituted his advance guard in his different forward movements; they turned up on each flank, and they appeared everywhere. It is to be hoped that now that the force seems to he pretty well broken up, and its commander killed, we will hear no more of them or him.

The whole history of the war consists of a series of practical contradictions to-day of what the rebels had asserted yesterday. Did they build at any point a formidable series of fortifications, plant a prodigious army behind them, and then swear before heaven and earth that they would never leave these works while there was a live rebel left to defend them: -- the next thing generally heard was that they had fled to some other point, where the same Chinese motions would be gone through with. Did the rebels in any city proclaim, in terms of uncommon ferocity, that, rather than surrender, they would give the place to the flames and themselves to the sword: -- the usual corollary has been that our troops or gunboats would advance upon the city, and, after a little mouthing, it would surrender. So frequent have been the exhibitions of this kind of thing on the part of rebel armies, rebel States, rebel cities, and military and civil rebel functionaries of all sorts, that we have come to regard rebel bluster and bullying as something to be received only with contempt. In the beginning of the war, a prominent South Carolina official said that the whole Yankee character might be summed up in three words: ""bluster and backdown;"" but it would seem from the military history of the past year, that he was exactly describing the character of his own people.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Summer Campaign.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Summer Campaign.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abc07d67-9345-5973-bc4e-a6663487cd64,1110,nyt://article/abc07d67-9345-5973-bc4e-a6663487cd64

That Convention was in many respects the most important event that had occupied during the period of his sixty years' warfare against the American Slave-trade, in as much as [???] the right of search. Since the Slave-trade had been made a crime of great atrocity by an act which he had had the happiness of passing through Parliament fifty-one years since, nothing had happened that was more gratifying to him than the recent Convention, whereby the Northern States of America, to their great honor, yielded the right of search, without which the former laws were almost nullities. That concession would, he hoped, speedily put an end to the atrocious traffic. The right of search was conceded within so many leagues of the coast of Africa, and within 30 leagues of the coast of Cuba, but the Island of Porto Rico was more than thirty leagues distant from Cuba, and the consequence would be, if the right of search remained limited to a space of thirty leagues from the Cuban coast, that slavers would land their cargoes at Porto Rico, and send the slaves over to Cuban at their leisure. He must say that nothing could be more fair than the conduct of the American Government since the present unhappy disruption took place, and he would ask the noble Earl whether he thought in would be possible to arrange some modification of the Convention which should include Porto Rico within the limits of the right of search. He also wished to know whether the Government intended to take any action with respect to a vessel recently fitted out at Liverpool, and afterward captured with 600 slaves on board.

CORCORAN, have been simply ex- permenting with the Government. They have annexed half a dozen different conditions for his release -- each of which has been acceded to at Washington, and each of which, when granted, they have perfidiously shuffled off. Their last condition was that the privateersmen should be given up. This was an exacting demand. These men, are, under our laws, pirates and felons and not a fair exchange for prisoners of war. Our Government was, however, exceedingly anxious to secure the liberation of the gallant soldier, strained a point of law and acceded to the demand. The privateersmen, accordingly, were sent up to City Point, where our flag of truce and accompanying officers waited some days, till finally it became evident that there was really no serious intention of releasing Col. CORCORAN, and they returned to Fortress Monroe.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL PERFIDY AND COL.

The valuable part of Mr. ROST's disclosure is the Spanish Minister's distinct conviction and assurance to him that the Emperor NAPOLEON ""considered the disruption of the Union and of its rising navy as a great misfortune to France."" The relations between the Governments of France and of Spain are believed to be of a most confidential character. And so clear and unreserved a declaration of the Emperor NAPOLEON's sentiments in regard to American affairs as the above, made by Mr. CALDERON COLLANTES, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, is entitled to serious attention. Standing alone, the fact might not have much weight. But when there is so much in French history and so much in French policy to make reasonable the Emperor's aspiration for the preservation of the American Union, so remarkable a speech as that of the Spanish Minister must receive credence. If there was in the mind of the Spanish Government a shadow of doubt as to the Emperor's views, the Minister would have given utterance to no such language; for the interview, as reported by Mr. ROST, gives evidence of the courtly kindness with which the rebel Commissioner was treated, and the manifest effort of the Spanish Minister to make his communications to Mr. ROST as agreeable as possible.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""L'Enfant Perdu."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""L'Enfant Perdu."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b8805a2-1e5c-573b-aaeb-2eedc8e63274,1287,nyt://article/3b8805a2-1e5c-573b-aaeb-2eedc8e63274

Editorial sees eventual Confederate retreat to Atlantic cotton states,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/12/archives/rebel-movements-toward-the-far-south.html,Editorial sees eventual Confederate retreat to Atlantic cotton states,"There is an inconsistency in rebel military movements which, at first glance, is puzzling. Their army of Virginia, and their late army of the West, evidently were not governed by the same controlling considerations. Indeed, the inconsistency of their respective operations would seem to indicate that the rebel leaders have no policy, or that, if they have one, they are without the courage to maintain it at all points alike. Some weeks ago JEFF. DAVIS evidently was disposed to retire gracefully from Virginia for some more Southern field of defensive operations. The Confederate Congress, already struck with panic, made good its retreat before the rebel army had begun to retire. The Virginia rebels took alarm at this, and remonstrated fiercely against the retrograde movement, which they had clearly reason to anticipate. Their complaints, naturally enough, were tinged with the States' Rights heresy on which secession rests its foundation-stone, and it was broadly hinted that, if the war was to be carried to the Gulf States, and Virginia abandoned to the Union army, her sons would remain at home. They were willing to fight and starve on the ""sacred soil;"" but upon a transfer of the struggle to a new and more Southern field, they would have no part or lot in the matter. The ""right of secession,"" destroying all unity in Government, was held to mean the right of the troops of each State to abandon the common cause whenever its management fails to suit individual State policy; and secession was in danger of destroying itself by a general mutiny in the rebel camp, if the Jeff, Davis policy of retiring to the Cotton States should be attempted.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Movements Toward the Far South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Movements Toward the Far South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5a51f2f-4623-5053-9dc7-97ac6b81218e,956,nyt://article/c5a51f2f-4623-5053-9dc7-97ac6b81218e

DRAKE of the Tenth Connecticut, cried at his home in South Windsor, Ct., on Thursday noon. He was a graduate of Yale College, and at the breaking out of the rebellion was practicing law in Hartford. He volunteered in Company A, (Rifles.) First Connecticut Volunteers, and was appointed First Lieutenant of the Company, in which office he exhibited all the qualities of a soldier and gentleman. On the return of the three months' volunteers his health was somewhat impaired, and the wishes of a widowed mother prevented him from immediately reenlisting. Subsequently he was able to accept the Lieutenant-Coloneley of the Tenth, and fought with it at Roanoke Island, where its Colonel, RUSSELL, was killed. He was promoted to the Coloneley, but his constitution could not stand the hardships which he was called upon to endure, and he was compelled to return home, hoping soon to be able to join his command, though his fellow-officers saw that he had settled consumption. His age was 27 years. In 1858 he represented South Windsor in the Legislature.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f49b13b-34a6-5eb6-8890-c297a32c9a1d,253,nyt://article/4f49b13b-34a6-5eb6-8890-c297a32c9a1d

In place of the vast armadas such as humbled Port Royal or New-Orleans, a single United States frigate quietly enters that far-off Texan port, drops anchor, and requests the surrender of the town. It is what the French would call a ""purely moral demonstration,"" pointed, however, by the significant announcement that the Santee was but the avant courrier. ""In a few days,"" said Capt. EAGLE, ""the naval and land forces of the United States will appear off the town of Galveston to enforce its surrender."" Do as you please; surrender now or surrender then, when it will be worse for you. In the meantime, twenty-four hours are given for reflection. The Southern rebels would not be what we so well know them to be if the first reply had not been a blustering message that they ""would not give up on a mere paper bombardment."" The next step was a delicate feeler adroitly put through their friends, the foreign Consuls, who wanted to know of the Captain if he would not ""fix upon some point that might be respected in the bombardment, as a place of refuge for foreign subjects?"" The Captain could not comply with the little request -- ""impossible to tell what direction the shot and shell will take!""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A GAGE FOR GALVESTON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A GAGE FOR GALVESTON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/802465cc-fbc5-58a5-b8d5-76186bef6d47,301,nyt://article/802465cc-fbc5-58a5-b8d5-76186bef6d47

Editorial notes rise in immigration from Europe despite war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/13/archives/briskness-in-immigration.html,Editorial notes rise in immigration from Europe despite war,"Immigration to this port from Europe is quite brisk at present. Within the last week over three thousand immigrants have been registered, and the total number for the year, so far, is in round numbers twenty-five thousand. Up to the same time last year the figures were about a third higher than this year; but, curiously enough, last year the immigration opened brisk in the early Spring, when Europe did not believe there was going to be war here, and fizzled out in Summer when a great war was inevitable; while this year immigration opened very dull in the Spring, when our military prospects looked comparatively dull, but since the news of our victories and of the prospective termination of the war have had time to react and influence Europe, it is going on quite briskly. When the war is over, it is believed we will see such a rush from Europe, and particularly from Germany, as was never seen before. The Germans, as well as other Europeans, have learned a great deal about our affairs and our institutions during the past year. They have learned of our civil freedom, notwithstanding the outcries of the tory Press; they have learned of the immense extent of our country and its limitless resources; they hare seen the prosperity of these Free States, even in time of a war almost without parallel for its magnitude -- a phenomena unknown in any other country since wars were fought. They have also begun, or soon will begin, to learn of the Homestead law, and the provisions for securing to every man -- not only life, liberty and the freedom to pursue happiness -- but also the means of gaining an independent livelihood. The common people of Europe do not suffer from the ignorant prejudices that affect the aristocratic and snobocratic classes. They do not rejoice over the collapse of democracy; they do not think any the less of this Government because it is fighting for unity, for the rights of the majority, and for its own existence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BRISKNESS IN IMMIGRATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BRISKNESS IN IMMIGRATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97e01705-5aa0-57c6-9580-2ace475b7f94,563,nyt://article/97e01705-5aa0-57c6-9580-2ace475b7f94

"A Sub-Committee of the Joint Fire Department Committee, consisting of Aldermen STRONG, BELKNAP and GREENE, yesterday visited, officially, all of the oil establishments in the Western District of the city, and to-day the same Committee will visit the similar establishments in the Eastern District. Nothing especially new or interesting was added to the stock of knowledge already obtained by the Committee by the investigation yesterday, except as to the extent of the petroleum oil business. The Committee visited the different places in the order as annexed. Mr. KETCHAM's establishment is on Smith-street, near Ninth-street. Here there are about five stills, of the capacity of about twenty barrels each, and kerosene, naptha and lubricating oils are manufactured. The works are of large capacity, but there is only a small stock at present on hand, and but little doing. The Empire Works, on Smith-street, adjoining the above, is a similar establishment, but no oil is being turned out here at present. There are five stills, and the buildings are large and airy. Proceeding to Red Hook Point, the Committee first visited the storage-sheds of SETH ROBBINS, on Van Brunt-street. Here are six open sheds, each 20 feet wide by 100 feet, in which are now stored between two and three thousand barrels of petroleum. There is a storage capacity here for about 20,000 barrels, but the yard is not kept in very good condition. STEARNS' yard, on Van Brunt-street, was next visited. Here are three large one-story well-ventilated brick buildings, each about 200 feet square, with a storage capacity of about 15,000 barrels. Between six and eight thousand barrels of petroleum and kerosene are now on storage. NEWCOMB's American Kerosene Oil Works, corner of Ferry and Sullivan streets, were next visited. Here are five stills, and kerosene, naptha and lubricating oils are manufactured. The stock is light at present, and no manufacturing is going on, except to till orders. At the Phenix Oil Sheds, foot of Sedgwick-street, the Committee found 3,000 barrels of kerosene on storage, and 15,000 barrels of pork in sheds one story high. Adjoining the above, is another range of storage sheds, occupied by SETH ROBBINS, in which are stored at present several hundred barrels of petroleum. The yard is in a filthy condition, and petroleum was found on the ground in puddles. The next and last place visited was the Shin-bone Stores, at the foot of Little-street, near the Navy-yard, and owned by Mr. RUGGLES, and the place complained of to the Common Council by the Commandant of the Navy-yard. These are brick storehouses, 30 feet high, and about 150 feet square, containing at present about 3,000 bales of hay, and a large quantity of staves. Directly on the opposite side of the street, and near the water, Mr. RUGGLES has two storage sheds, each 20 by 100 feet, in which are stored at present 200 barrels of petroleum. With the exception of the last place, the manufactories and store-sheds are in isolated positions, so that in case of fire no damage, under ordinary circumstances, would be likely to occur to property in the vicinity. And the only danger to be apprehended is from burning oil floating off upon the water, and communicating fire to the shipping and buildings along the docks in the vicinity. The Committee make a tour of inspection through the eastern section of the city, to-day; and to-morrow the Joint Committee will hold a meeting, receive a report from Mr. CHILTON, the chemist, as to the character of petroleum oil, compare notes, and, if possible, report to the Common Council, on Monday evening next, the result of their investigations.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/13/archives/the-petroleum-oil-excitement.html,,"A Sub-Committee of the Joint Fire Department Committee, consisting of Aldermen STRONG, BELKNAP and GREENE, yesterday visited, officially, all of the oil establishments in the Western District of the city, and to-day the same Committee will visit the similar establishments in the Eastern District.

The war in the Southwest, and throughout the Cotton States, is now so far advanced that the public expects the whole rebellion will be brought to a close by the capture or destruction of the rebel army at Richmond, without its being permitted to effect its escape to any point further South. It is known that something like this was the programme of Gen. MCCLELLAN when he first moved the National forces down to the Peninsula: by a series of military and naval movements to encircle and circumvent the rebel army at Yorktown, and bring the rebels and the rebellion to a speedy end on that narrow neck of land. That programme is, of course, now impossible. The rebels made good their retreat from Yorktown; they effected their retreat from Williamsburgh; and now, before the gates of their Capitol, though they vow that from there they never will retreat, there are not wanting indications that their leaders are already preparing for it. We have seen lately too many of the most solemn asseverations of the rebels falsified, to lay much practical stress upon any that they may now make. Where they may retreat to -- whether toward Lynchburgh, to the mountains of North or South Carolina, or to the States of the far South -- is a question of comparatively little moment. Wherever they may go -- if they succeed in going anywhere -- the fact will tend to prolong greatly the war, and to embarrass operations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Movements on the Rebel Flank.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Movements on the Rebel Flank.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bf7fabc9-105d-55fd-82c8-dfcdc8b6414a,894,nyt://article/bf7fabc9-105d-55fd-82c8-dfcdc8b6414a

He is said to have been the means, intentional or otherwise, of furnishing the enemy with important information. It is not asserted that he did so directly; but that some female members of his family wormed valuable secrets out of him, and made them known to the rebels. The immediate cause of his suspension, however, arises from his having dismissed some officers in Gen. HALLECK's command without the authority of the President.

The mail was quite a heavy one -- letters from our soldiers to their Northern relatives, letters from citizens to friends from whom they have long been cut off, letters on business and on the subject of renewing commercial relations, beside newspaper files in abundance. For over a year the great commercial city of the South has been isolated from the world -- excepting what little intercourse it was able to keep up through privateers, through vessels running the blockade, and by way of Texas and Mexico. The tens of thousands of letters and newspapers that used to be conveyed weekly from that city to this, and back again from this City to that, ceased coming and going when the blockade was declared. During all that time, also, the foreign commerce of New-Orleans has had no existence, and its inland traffic has been almost extinct. The hundreds of steamboats that from there traversed the Upper Mississippi, the Missouri, the Tennessee, the Ohio and the Cumberland -- as well as the hundreds of ships that carried the products of the Mississippi Valley to the world, were all transferred to more profitable waters, or were laid up; and the formerly crowded harbor of the Crescent City has been desolate. Now that the Southern Metropolis is again under the old flag of its prosperity -- now that ships are again beginning to go in and produce to come out -- now that the prospect is bright for an immediate resumption of internal commerce with all the cities on the banks of all the tributaries of the Mississippi -- now that there is intercommunication of thought with the city and the world -- we hope soon to see New-Orleans arise from its ashes and become again, what it was of old, the Queen City of the South.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bright Prospects in the Far South', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bright Prospects in the Far South', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/031c836b-5333-5af3-baf1-5c149e42b061,831,nyt://article/031c836b-5333-5af3-baf1-5c149e42b061

"For the second time, a first appearance in Italian opera came off on the present season. It was a veritable debut, inasmuch as Mme. HERRMANN has not previously made her appearance in a regular opera, although we understand she has occasionally sung in public during her husband's recent tour in the States. The opera selected for the occasion was DONIZETTI's ""Figlia del Reggimento,"" and Mme. HERRMANN, of course, took the part of Maria. She is a petite person, with a charming face and a winning style of acting, which struck us as being unusual in one so new to the footlights. Her voice has a compass of about two octaves, and is a light mezzo soprano -- French in its class. It is, however, remarkably sympathetic, and would, but for the nervousness she very evidently displayed, at once have made her a favorite. In the Duo with Tonio in the first act, she sang very agreeably, although we cannot but object to Tonio's style of conduct towards a new soprano on her first appearance on the stage of the Academy. If he had been so treated when he first appeared by an established soprano, we very seriously question whether the operatic world would have ever been blessed by the knowledge of a BRIGNOLI. On the other hand, we have to compliment SUSINI on the natural kindness his displayed, which makes us the more pleased to record the fact that he was in excellent voice, and sang even better than he has done on the two preceding nights of the season.

"About 3  o'clock yesterday afternoon, Mr. PETER C. REAL, of No. 256 Broadway, was shot by a woman named MARY STEWART, alias Mrs. Mary Real, with a pistol, and almost instantly killed.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/14/archives/local-intelligence-a-startling-murder-in-broadway-a-man-shot-by-a.html,,"About 3 1/2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, Mr. PETER C. REAL, of No. 256 Broadway, was shot by a woman named MARY STEWART, alias Mrs. Mary Real, with a pistol, and almost instantly killed. The affair occurredjust outside of Mr. REAL's place of business, upon the landing of the second flight of stairs. The particulars of the murder, so far as we have been able to gather them, amid the great excitement cousequent upon the affray, which existed in and around the premises, are as follows: For a long time past, Mr. REAL, the deceased, has been paying his addresses to MARY. She and her friends allege that they were married several months ago. He, and those who know him best, on the contrary, assert that such is not the fact, but insist that there was never any intimacy exiting between them, except a brief and in every respect honorable courtship, which was finally terminated by the mutual consent of the parties. The friends of the deceased allege that a short time since she approached him with a dagger which she had secreted about her person, and with which she attempted to stab him to the heart, and would have done so but for the timely interference of some friends. The difficulty between them, it seems, grew more and more serious, until yesterday afternoon, when the woman stated to several of her friends that affairs between herself and REAL had become so grievous that she could no longer bear up under the great grief and misery which he had brought upon her. Fired with the passions of disappointed love, jealousy, and revenge, she went to a gunshop on Broadway, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, bought a pistol, had it loaded by a friend, and, thus armed, she repaired to the store of the deceased, situated on third floor of No. 256 Broadway. She found him lying upon a sofa in a room where, at the time of her entrance, there were several other persons. A some what lengthy interview took place between them, which terminated in loud and angry words upon both sides. At last he was induced to go with her outside the glass door, to the landing at the top of the stairs. Immediately thereafter, a scuffle ensued on the stairs, and the report of a pistol brought several persons who were in the vicinity to the scene of the conflict. After the shot was fired the wounded man was at once aided by the woman, and one or two others, to get back to the sofa in the store, where he expired in about ten minutes afterward. The only words he uttered were, ""I'm killed -- I'm dead."" The woman, MARY, was at once taken into custody by a Policeman, and conveyed to the Fifth Precinct Station-house, where she was confined in a close cell to await the result of the Coroner's inquest. Deputy Coroner Dr. ROBINSON last evening made a post-mortem examination of the body of deceased, of which the following is the result:",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; A STARTLING MURDER IN BROADWAY.

The present extent of the advance in dividend share and first mortgage values is equal, on the average, to fifteen per cent. on the prevailing rates in February last, when the financial policy of the Government was defined by the establishment of the National currency. That the improvement will not stop at this point seems quite clear, from the course of affairs in Wall-street for a day or two past.

Editorial on reported Confederate offer of purse for assassination of Union Gen. Butler,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/14/archives/a-new-mode-of-rebel-war-the-rebels-.html,Editorial on reported Confederate offer of purse for assassination of Union Gen. Butler,"having failed in the great field operations of war -- having failed almost totally in their efforts at guerrilla warfare -- are now publicly advocating secret assassination as a last resort in their struggle for Slavery and independence. The open combat on the field of battle between the chivalry and mudsill, which the chivalry sometime so hotly panted for -- the assault on the highway, by the skulking chivalry, upon the wayfarer or quiet settler -- both these are now to give way to the stiletto, the cup of poison, or the bloody razor, in the hands of the chivalry. They have been for some time advertising their purposes in this matter, and singling out persons for the stab in the dark. The individual whom the chivalry are at present stimulating each other to assassinate, is Gen. BEN. BUTLER, of New-Orleans. A proposition has been made in a journal published at the Capital of Mississippi, the organ of the State Government, that a purse of $10,000 (probably Confederate shinplasters) ""be made up and offered for the head of the modern Nero -- the brutal, beastly and sanguinary savage, Gen. B.F. BUTLER -- or to any one who will take his life by any means whatsoever;"" and, not tired of piling on epithets, the would-be rebel thug goes on to say that ""it is our plain duty to rid our country and the world of this horrid, hideous monster, by any means that can be commanded."" The Charleston Mercury, in writing of the same General, urges: ""let no quarter to BUTLER be the sworn resolve of every Southern man;"" and adds, ""if he venture not upon the field of battle, (by the way, he has met the chivalry there once or twice already,) let poison or the knife do its secret but deadly work."" If the rebels do really mean to immolate Gen. BUTLER, or any of the other persons whom they name in that connection, they certainly have a curious way of going about it. They advertise the fact in all the papers, proclaim it to the prospective victim and to the whole world; and, what is noticeable, the urgent parties do not, in any case, propose to do the deed themselves, but wildly implore some one else to do it in their behoof. Political assassinations arc usually concocted and done secretly, and by persons, who, themselves, have smarted under wrongs until they became unendurable. But the rebels, in this, as other matters, have quite an original mode of procedure. We do not believe that the thing will be done. It will all end in threatening, as so many other rebel heroics have ended.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NEW MODE OF REBEL WAR.

"By the arrival at this port of the steamer British Queen, we have received our Mexican and Havana correspondence, containing details of the recent important events in Mexico, including the battle of Amazoc, near Puebla, in which the French were defeated and forced to retreat to Orizaba. Gens. [???] and BERRIOZABEL commanded the Mexican troops in this affair. Two battalions of French Zouaves skirmishing as light infantry began the attack. These covered two strong colums of infantry supported by rifled cannon. The Mexicans waited till their enemies were within 50 yards, and then fired. The French fled whilst the Mexicans charged; but other French columns renewed the attack, and a second time they fled, leaving a number of dead who were shot in the back. Again the Mexicans charged, and had they had cavalry would have destroyed the invading army. The French did not renew the attack on the front, but sent a strong column against the fortifications of Guadalupe. They were here also repulsed, and a reinforcement of Mexicans coming up, an attack was made on their right flank. The French at once fell back upon Orizaba. Their loss is estimated by a friendly authority at 600 or 800 soldiers in the fight and by sickness. Another fight subsequently took place near Orizaba, between the Reactionists, supported by the French, and the Liberal forces, the result of which is claimed by both sides as a victory. It may, therefore, be regarded as a drawn battle. The French forces, it is understood, were to remain at Orizaba until they could receive instructions from their Government.

"-- Mr. EDWARD C. HERRICK, for many years Librarian of Yale College, died at New-Haven, Conn., on June 11. Mr. HERRICK was the son of Rev. CLAUDIUS HERRICK, of New-Haven, and was born in the year 1811. After receiving a thorough preliminary education, he engaged in mercantile pursuits in New-Haven, and in 1843 was elected Librarian of the College, and, until 1852 continued to discharge the duties of that position as well as those of Treasurer. Mr. D.C. GILMAN, in 1852, relieved him of the librarianship, and since that time Mr. HERRICK has given himself up entirely to the responsibilities of the treasurership.

In entomology, practical astronomy, history and bibliography, he was thoroughly and accurately versed, as the numerous communications on all these subjects, which have been published from time to time in the American Journal of Science, prove.

Mr. YANCEY accepts the horse with gratitude; and to the categorical statement of the beast's height, age and cost, made by those whe presented it, Mr. YANCEY poetically adds, that it ""has the eye of the hawk, the spirit of the king eagle, the chest of the Iion, is swifter than the roebuck and stronger than the buffalo,"" and must consequently be a horse altogether without a peer, and quite worth the $450 (we should like to know if the money was Confederate shinplasters) which it cost. As the letter accompanying the charger was dated on the 19th of May, and Mr. YANCEY's reply thereto was dated the next day, the 20th, it looks from the minute description of the animal's qualities and characteristics given by Mr. YANCEY, that it had hardly come into his possession before he committed the grievous fault of ""looking his gift horse in the mouth.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. Yancy on a Black Horse.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mr. Yancy on a Black Horse.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7035e2b3-fdf7-56e4-83e6-734c93d9e83a,1178,nyt://article/7035e2b3-fdf7-56e4-83e6-734c93d9e83a

"IMPORTANT ARRESTS A NEW SYSTEM OF THIEVING. For several weeks past, the various Express Companies of this City, and also numerous private parties in the upper Wards, have been extensively victimized by a trio of thieves who rode about in a butcher's cart.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/15/archives/general-city-news.html,,"IMPORTANT ARRESTS -- A NEW SYSTEM OF THIEVING. -- For several weeks past, the various Express Companies of this City, and also numerous private parties in the upper Wards, have been extensively victimized by a trio of thieves who rode about in a butcher's cart. Their plan was to follow up the Express wagons, as they went their rounds through the City, for the purpose of delivering parcels, and when the messenger left the wagon, one of the thieves would hastily seize a bundle therefrom, toss it into his cart, and drive rapidly off with his plunder and confederates before the Express messenger had time to discover his loss. The several Express Companies have, they say, been defrauded of a large amount of property, by means of this system. On this account, they have been compelled to employ an extra man to each wagon, for the purpose of guarding the packages left in the vehicle. This was something the thieves were quite unprepared for, and they were necessarily compelled to change their tactics. In many instances, since the expressmen have taken this precaution, the thieves have entered private residences immediately after the departure of the real messenger, and under pretence of having left the wrong bundle, 'hey have claimed and carried away the property. When too late, the owners discovered that the packages were surrendered to thieves. Several policemen in the up-town wards made ineffectual attempts to arrest these swindlers, and at last the matter was placed in the hands of Officer IRVING, of the Twentieth Precinct, who for several days has been upon their track. Early on Friday evening, the three culprits were seen in their butcher's cart, on the corner of Thirty-third-street and Eighth-avenue by Officer IRVING, who cautiously approached them, and jumping into the vehicle, seized two of the occupants and held them fast. The third one speedily ran away, but was soon caught by Policemen ANDERSON and HOPKINS. They were all taken before Justice QUACKENBUSH, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, where after an examination they were held to await the action of the Grand Jury. The names of the accused are WASHINGTON SMITH, JOHN DRUMGOLD and JOHN SHERIDAN.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73f10fcd-3216-5a58-9af3-a975cfa05ee8,1815,nyt://article/73f10fcd-3216-5a58-9af3-a975cfa05ee8

The intense, interest with which the public formerly looked toward South Carolina, has for a long time been fixed upon other regions where stupendous operations have been going on; hut there is now again a prospect of action in Charleston Harbor, and in the vicinity of Fort Sumter, and public attention is eagerly turned in that direction. The recent reconnoissance as far as Pocotaligo, in the southeastern part of the State -- the naval reconnoissance up to and beyond Georgetown on the northeastern coast of the State, and the movements of our land and naval forces at James Island, in the immediate vicinity of Charleston, seem to indicate that Gen. HUNTER is preparing for decisive work. The point aimed at appears to be Charleston, and the other movements may be only to distract the enemy's attention. If Gen. HUNTER is able to approach the city in the direction he is now pursuing, be will thus avoid all the forts and other formidable rebel defences in Charleston harbor. At latest accounts he had advanced on the island, till he approached almost within rifled cannon shot of Gov. PICKENS' head -- that is to say, if that ""insensible-to-fear"" functionary still resides at the executive mansion in which he took up his residence for the war. Whether Gen. HUNTER really means to take the city or not, we do not know. We think it doubtful whether he has troops enough to hold it. We believe that there is quite a large rebel military force in and around Charleston. The rebels know the anxiety with which the nation looks for the capture of Charleston; they know the preparations HUNTER is making for its capture; they have had ample time to concentrate all available troops there; and Charleston we believe to be one of the few rebel cities the possession of which will be fiercely contested. The fact that they have been so quiet about what troops they have there, is a hint not without significance. If our gunboats could get up to the city, it would be easily enough held and controlled; but they would first have to pass Forts Sumter, Moultrie, Pinckney, long lines of land batteries, and other defences. We hardly think that this will be attempted until one or more of our iron-clad vessels can be sent down to operate in that quarter. But Gen. HUNTER is bold and daring; and may very likely take the country and the rebels by surprise by some movement that will place the city and all its defenders entirely at his mercy.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CAMPAIGN IN SOUTH CAROLINA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d675a5f5-bd51-59c4-8e8d-21ac0f0cfd26,455,nyt://article/d675a5f5-bd51-59c4-8e8d-21ac0f0cfd26

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/15/archives/naval-rams.html,,"Blackwood's Magazine, for June, contains a letter addressed to Capt. COLES, R.N., by a gentleman at Baltimore. Capt. COLES lately addresed a letter to the London Times, in which he spoke of his ""mortification at finding that America, instead of England, should have the palm of floating the Monitor, which is to dictate the reconstruction of navies to the world."" The Baltimore correspondent of the eminent Captain thereupon consoles him with an attempt to prove that the mortification should be ours, as we were hoaxed in the matter by Capt. ERICSSON. The proof given is, that Blackwood, for December, 1860, in an article on iron-clad ships, contained three diagrams of Capt. COLES' ""shield,"" with a broadside view of a shield-frigate; and it is taken for granted that Capt. ERICSSON must have seen these diagrams, and thereupon conceived the idea of the Monitor. Why, asks the writer, (forgetting that the same question might just as fairly be put to Capt. COLES,) why did not Capt.

Witness then lost sight of the parties, and supposed they had gone down stairs. Soon after he saw a flash and heard the report of a pistol; the prisoner and the deceased then came to the door together, and with the aid of two other persons the deceased was helped to a sofa in the room, where he died in a few minutes after; witness saw the prisoner on Friday morning, at nine o'clock, at the store, and he heard the deceased speak of the prisoner, but not as his wife; the deceased also stated to witness that he had met a lady on the cars in New-Jersey that morning, and was with her when he was accosted by the prisoner, who suggested to the lady that he, Real, was her lawful husband.

"PRIVATE WATCHMAN DANGEROUSLY STABBED -- ARREST OF THE OFFENDERS. -- About 2 o'clock yesterday morning a serious affray occurred in William-street, during which a private watchman named ISADORE -- alias Izzy -- FELLEMAN, was dangerously, and is believed fatally, stabbed. The statements as to the origin of the difficulty are conflicting, and in the present stage of the affair, is quite impossible to ascertain the precise facts. The version which is given by the wounded man and Police Officer DONNELLY is, that the two were [???] their beats between Pearl and Duane streets, in William-street, when they discovered a cellar door open. The policeman called to [???] for matches, in order to procure a light, to [???] them to see to fasten the door. The [???] had to matches, but proposed to go into [???] in the neighborhood, and obtain some. [???] accordingly went to a place Kept by EDWARD ULRICK, in the basement of No. [???] William-street. FELLEMAN States that as, [???] as [???] entered the saloon he was fiercely [???] by [???] Germans, named PHILIP DENNIG, THOMAS LEPENCHE and ULRICK, the proprietor, who beat [???] and during the scufile he was stabbed with a knife in the hands of one of his [???], but [???] of the three inflicted the wounds with the [???] is unable to say. He received several [???] in the [???] and three or four upon other [???] his person. Those in the abdomen are very serious. The three were immediately taken into custody by officers DONNELLY and MOORE, and yesterday they were brought before Justice OSBORN, at the Tombs, and [???] to await the result of FELLEMAN's injuries.

Large bodies of men had been moved down from the neighborhood of Mechanicsville Bridge and Richmond, and were apparently being concentrated in the vicinity of the late battlefield. Our pickets, on Friday, were driven in from Old Church by a large force of rebel cavalry, and on the same day the rebels made a demonstration on the right [???] of our army at Tunstall's Station, apparently with the intention of interrupting our railroad communication. They were forced to retreat, however, without effecting their object.

This is the first naval fight in which ram met ram; and though there are no absolutely new principles in the science of naval warfare illustrated by it, it is important as initiating a kind of fighting which is not unlikely to be largely practiced in the future; and it is interesting as showing the great practical utility of aquatic rams. Prior to the arrival of ELLET's ram fleet, the battle of the gunboats was an affair which promised to be of dubious result. The swift craft of the rebels dodged the shot of our ponderous and clumsy ironclad scows, and poured in an occasional fire with damaging effect. If, finally, they had been repulsed, they would have steamed off to some other point, (for they were swifter than our vessels,) and given us more trouble and further fight elsewhere.

Editorial on possibility of British-French intervention,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/17/archives/intervention-the-position-of-france-and-england.html,Editorial on possibility of British-French intervention,"A judicious sifting of the public and private advices received from Europe during ten days past, presents, in an unpleasant light, the possibility of European intervention in the American question. So obstinately is the progress of the National arms ignored, and the value of National victories disputed; so steadily, in spite of evidence plain as sunlight, is the opinion of the irrepressibility of the South adhered to; so captiously is the entire military, civil and financial policy of the North discussed, as to render it plain, beyond demonstration, that France and England are busily arguing themselves into a meddlesome, and even belligerent temper toward the American Government. And this is not the impulse, as we very well know, of mere unfriendly prepossessions. The British and the French people have been severe sufferers because of the American war. Every day of its prolongation has added a new pang to the existence of the laboring classes, and a new peril to the existence of government and civil order; until it has become a question of capital moment, whether or not it is incumbent upon Europe to perish passively in deference to a vague and perhaps Quixotic principle of international law. The discussion of this thesis has recently, more urgently than ever before, engaged the attention of the French and British Cabinets. And the impression conveyed by the sources of information to which we have referred, tends strongly to encourage the conviction that interference, looking to the pacification of our difficulties, has been favorably considered by both Governments, and might at any moment have been propounded. And if the homeward mission of Lord LYONS have any diplomatic significance, it may not be extravagant to accept the popular interpretation, which ascribes it to the friendly desire of his Lordship to prevent any precipitate action of his Government upon the subject.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Intervention The Position of France and England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Intervention The Position of France and England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dfc501f5-2ff4-5f99-9e18-1d24fcc75bb2,1089,nyt://article/dfc501f5-2ff4-5f99-9e18-1d24fcc75bb2

ALEX. H. VINTON, D.D., who took for his text the following, from the First Epistle of John: ""I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong."" The aim of the discourse was to point out how the strength of young manhood could be so employed and directed as to secure the happiness of the individual, and confer the greatest blessings upon the world. Youth was the period of the passions -- pride, self-will, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eye -- and according as those passions obtained the mastery or were kept in subjection, would the individual become a drivelling slave or a rational man. Some compensating power was needed to control the energies and passions of youth, and turn them to good. That compensating power was conscience, and hence the need of constant enlightenment of conscience. This enlightenment came not from within, but from without -- it came from above -- it was revelation. The peculiar influences that surrounded young men in this country, where everything is precocious, where the child is the man, where the tendencies are to encourage rather than to check the pride and self-will of young manhood, where the spirit of independence is instilled into the individual from childhood, made it especially necessary that the compensating power of conscience should receive a full development and enlightenment. In political life, above all, was there a need of this power. Every American was born a politician, and every fierce politician had two consciences -- one for himself and one for his party -- which, being mutually destructive of each other, were equivalent to no conscience at all. Political ambition, without the compensating power of conscience, tempted a man to huckster away his country's liberties and union, for his own advancement. Our politicians had need to learn that ""God ruleth: let the nations tremble."" They must learn that a nation, no more than an individual, could disregard moral law with impunity. The indispensable necessity of an enlightened conscience, as a guide and restraint to the individual in all the avocations of life, was forcibly urged by argument and illustration, and the speaker closed his discourse by picturing to the minds of his hearers the various stages in life and the calm and peaceful death of a man whose career had been guided by an enlightened conscience and the precepts of Christianity.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4a5edc0-6c19-5cbf-aedb-75e165e1a51c,1409,nyt://article/e4a5edc0-6c19-5cbf-aedb-75e165e1a51c

Subsequent evidence, however, revealed the fact that the horse was very kind and gentle, and entirely safe for any person to drive, except upon occasions when he became frightened. The deceased was about 50 years of age.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0dd49f70-70f1-59b8-8b84-15411c04ea48,439,nyt://article/0dd49f70-70f1-59b8-8b84-15411c04ea48

Taking all the circumstances into account, there never was, in the military history of the world, an army of such magnitude concerning whose movements and whereabouts the opposing commanders were so completely in the dark. Although such a host could not have been removed from Gorinth in a day nor in a week, Gen. HALLECK knew not it had evacuated until, by accident, Gen. POPE discovered that the rebel bird had flown, and that a few rebel pickets were keeping our mighty army at bay; and, though twenty days have elapsed since that event, we have yet nothing clearer than a lot of disjointed statements locating it here, there and everywhere. The 10,000 men said to have been captured by POPE is ascertained to have been a highly exaggerated statement of that dashing General's achievement, and though our cavalry were reported to be everywhere ""in hot pursuit,"" and though POPE is now announced to be forty miles south of Corinth, it has not yet been ascertained where a single one of the rebel divisions has gone to. The possible lines of retreat for them were very few, and we know that they must have gone southward, and then probably east. But how far south, and to what point or points in the east? Information on this subject is awaited for by the public with the greatest anxiety.

The opera ""Il Trovatore"" was comparatively new; that is to say, it has not been offered to the public during the last twelve months. It was the first appearance of Madame BORCHARD in Leonora, and her third appearance in New-York. Signor AMODIO made his first appearance in this City as the Conde di Luna, and another tenore replaced Signor BRIGNOLI. The audience, which was the largest of the present season, was very good natured. It evidently came to enjoy itself. When the opera could not begin, it accepted Prestidigitation in its place. As BRIGNOLI did not sing, they took SBRIGLIA with the most polite indifference -- they relished la BORCHARD, and they applauded AMODIO, while they gossiped and chatted between the acts in a way that GOTTSCHALK alone could still for a time. Seriously, Signor SBRIGLIA proved a very acceptable Manrico, and, we may remark, sang his recitatives with something approaching to care and taste -- qualities which we had began to forget the existence of in Italian recitative -- at any rate, among Italian tenori. Mme. BORCHARD, in our opinion, was much finer in the role of Leonora than she had been in that of Lucretia Borgia. Whether it is that the character of her voice weds VERDI's music better than it does DONIZETTI's, or whether it was that we had become better acquainted with it, it seems to us younger and fuller than it had previously done, and we must candidly rank her amongst the best Leonoras we have had in New-York. And now we have to speak of the real debutant of the night, the brother of AMODIO. His voice is younger and nobler in its timbre than his brother's, but is certainly not yet so full, round and large in its volume, while he very evidently sings with more care, and in some instances with more judgment. ""Il Balen,"" in the second act, was well rendered by him and at once sealed his success. We ought not to omit all allusion to the Azucena of Madame D'ANGRI. She was not in such good voice as usual, but sang her music with passion and feeling -- a virtue for which we ought ever to be thankful.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78d5ad8a-6a68-50cc-a3c8-9125bf3970b3,693,nyt://article/78d5ad8a-6a68-50cc-a3c8-9125bf3970b3

Editorial on ways to capture Charleston,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/18/archives/how-we-would-have-charleston-taken.html,Editorial on ways to capture Charleston,"-- The late operations in the rear of Charleston, by way of Stono Inlet and James Island, are without doubt designed to secure important results against the time when the grand assault on the original home of secession treason comes off. We hardly presume, however, that it is expected in this way to capture Charleston; and indeed we hardly know that it is the way in which the country would have it captured. When the time comes for the assault on Charleston, we trust that it will not be by any back-door passage. We trust the invading and avenging force will take the self-same route by which the Star of the West attempted to carry food to ANDERSON's starving band, and was assailed and driven back in the attempt. We trust it will pass up directly under Fort Sumter -- if need be, laying it in ruins, and, at whatever cost, restoring the Stars and Stripes over the citadel where first they were lowered to traitors fifteen months ago. Not till these acts of justice have been performed, would we have the naval and military force of the Union pass up to take possession of that wretched and half-ruined town.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOW WE WOULD HAVE CHARLESTON TAKEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOW WE WOULD HAVE CHARLESTON TAKEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8abfd290-5c6c-556e-b871-d6c2e348a37f,330,nyt://article/8abfd290-5c6c-556e-b871-d6c2e348a37f
Commencement,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/18/archives/rutgers-college-newjersey-commencement-exercisesaddress-of-prof.html,Commencement,"The regular Commencement exercises of this sterling old College at New-Brunswick, N.J., were held, yesterday, in the Second Dutch Reformed Church, Rev. Dr. FORSYTH presiding. The exercises were opened with prayer, the church being crowded with an assemblage composed of the friends of the students, and many from Princeton, (Nassau Hall,) the Commencement of which takes place next week. Although the address before the Alumni, which precedes the regular Commencement, was not to be delivered until 4 P.M., the streets were thronged, at an early hour, with the friends and relatives of the graduates, and, before the doors were opened, admission, except by favor, was almost impossible. The church, one of the largest in the City, the Second Reformed Dutch Church, was crowded to its utmost capacity. Soon after 4 o'clock, the procession of the students was formed on the campus, moving toward the church to the music of a fine band. At the church, Rev. Dr. FORSYTH presided, the societies of the College, the ""Peithessophian"", and ""Philoclean"" being fully represented, as they were the recipients of the honor paid them in the address by Prof. J.A. HART, of the Girard College in Philadelphia. The large and elegant church was crowded with a gay and interested throng, who were well repaid for the endurance they had exhibited in passing many hours of patient waiting, by the address of the learned and eloquent orator. The speaker took as his text, or rather as the subject of his theme, ""The Bible as an Educating Power among the Nations."" Prof. HART was introduced in a few but pertinent remarks, by Rev.

The subject has not been neglected at the present session.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/18/archives/the-admission-of-western-virginia.html,,"Among several measures destined to engage the attention of the Thirty-seventh Congress at its second session, is the bill providing for the admission of Western Virginia into the Union. The subject has not been neglected at the present session. In the House, the Territorial Committee reported a bill defining the Blue Ridge as the eastern boundary, and requiring the immediate abolition of Slavery. The Senate Committee recommended an acquiescence in the boundaries fixed by the Wheeling convention, namely, the Alleghanies on the east, and the New River at the south; and instead of immediate, proposed gradual emancipation. Why the House bill should be unpalatable we can very well understand. While convinced of the necessity of abrogating Slavery, the Western Virginians are wise enough to recognize the policy of making the change very slowly and with every possible security to the interests of both blacks and whites, and they are not at all indisposed to accept that splendid douceur which Congress has promised to any Slave State initiating a system of gradual manumission. Nor is the easterly boundary selected to the liking of the new State. It takes in the Valley of Virginia, separated geographically as well as by every interest and institution, from the Trans-Alleghany region; the people having no community of feeling or sentiment, and cherishing old jealousies, and bestowing upon each other opprobrious nick-names as the expression of inveterate dislike. The social antagonisms which prohibit any marriage of the valley region with the west, are too well appreciated by the representatives of Western Virginia to encourage a support of the House measure, which we are not at all surprised to learn has been dismissed as impolitic by the Senate Committee upon Territories.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Admission of Western Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Admission of Western Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aecb8c05-a1b9-5ce7-92e5-4bd2b909cf9c,1086,nyt://article/aecb8c05-a1b9-5ce7-92e5-4bd2b909cf9c

Yesterday, however, was an exception. At an early hour in the morning, counterfeit $5 bills upon ""The Manufacturers' Bank of Troy,"" this State, were put into circulation simultaneously in all parts of this City and Brooklyn. The fact that the spurious notes are excellent imitations of the genuine, in every respect except one, aided the members of the gang very materially in their efforts to swindle the public. The only difference which could be discovered between the good and bad $5, notes of this bank, even by brokers and others who are adepts in the business, is, that in the genuine, the red ink, with which the word ""Five"" is printed, is of a darker color than that which is put into the counterfeits. But this difference is so slight that no person would ever be able to detect it unless experienced in the business, or unless his attention were particularly called to it. It is believed that a large amount of this money was put off in different parts of the City before any suspicion was raised against the bills; indeed, they were taken without objection for several hours after the gang commenced to operate.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Look out for Counterfeits.; A BOLD ATTEMPT TO FLOOD THE CITY WITH COUNTERFEIT MONEY.

It seems that ZULOAGA insists that he is the true President of Mexico, and is not inclined to abdicate in favor of ALMONTE, an act which would involve the trampling under foot of all legitimacy in Government, a principle upon which is based his power, and which is the principal support of his banner. This line of conduct will deprive the French of a great number of supporters, and serves to show how unpopular is their intervention when these leaders deem it necessary to exhibit to all the world their repudiation of the alliance. The conduct of the Spanish Government also makes another complication, for the last intelligence from Madrid informs us that O'DONNELL not only eschewed the idea of withdrawing the Spanish troops from Mexico, but intimated his intention of sending reinforcements; this was said at the very time when nearly all the expedition had returned to Havana.

Was it one of the ""solid and profound"" lies, or was it some light and airy statement just tripping off the tongue or the pen employed on weightier themes? From whose mouth did it emanate? From JEFF. DAVIS, or FLOYD, or BEAUREGARD? Are we to look for it in State papers or military bulletins, or editorial rhapsodies?

In the Senate only two votes -- those of the Senators from California -- were cast against it. Mr. MCDOUGALL, on behalf of himself and colleague, explained that their objections to the measure rested solely on the ground of its impolicy at the present time. That the purpose of the bill is entirely right, and commends itself to every true friend of morality and civilization, will scarcely be questioned anywhere outside the circles of Mormondom. This subject has been fully discussed in our columns heretofore, and the necessity of some legislation to remove the foul blot of Polygamy repeatedly urged. A National Republican Convention has also declared war against the institution, as one of the ""twin relics of barbarism."" The duty of the Government to exert its power for the extermination of this great social evil is almost universally recognized, and we may consider that question to have passed beyond the field of discussion.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Polygamy and a New Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Polygamy and a New Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Polygamy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-06-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea42948d-cd58-5210-834e-fbb4d174ef74,1273,nyt://article/ea42948d-cd58-5210-834e-fbb4d174ef74

"JUNE EXHIBITION OF THE BROOKLYN HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The annual June exhibition of the Brooklyn Horticultural Society was opened yesterday afternoon, with a larger and better display of fruits, plants and flowers, than ever before presented to the public for inspection by this Society.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/19/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"JUNE EXHIBITION OF THE BROOKLYN HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. -- The annual June exhibition of the Brooklyn Horticultural Society was opened yesterday afternoon, with a larger and better display of fruits, plants and flowers, than ever before presented to the public for inspection by this Society. The florists and horticulturists from different parts of this and the neighboring States have been largely drawn upon to render the exhibition as attractive and interesting as possible. The Society, to meet the increasing wants, of the public, has, with commendable liberality, engaged the whole of the Academy of Music for this exhibition, and the articles on exhibition are placed upon the floor that covers the stage and parquet. When balls are given in this house Dodworth's Band furnisties the music. There are on the different tables over ore hundred varieties of the strawberry alone, of all shades and colors, from which fact some idea of the extent of the exhibition can be inferred by the reader. The strawberries vary in size from the small meadow sweet to those so large that one would almost be enough to satisfy the appetite of the most voracious berry eater. The special premium of $10 for the best quart has been awarded to FRANCIS DRILL, of Newark. Mr. BURGESS, of Glen Cove, FULLER and others, of Brooklyn, have tables of this delicious fruit. Messrs. [???] & TELLER, A.G. BURGESS, of Brooklyn, and P. BREMIERS, of New-Jersey, as usual, have on exhibition a splendid display of cut flowers and flowers in pots, A. BRIDGMAN, of Broadway, New-York, has a table, containing twenty varieties of the gloxania; G.A. MESSELBERG, a fine lot of fuschias; Mrs. A. HENDERSON, a monster Scotch thistle, five feet high: D. FOULIS has a large and beautiful assortment of pelargoniums; Mr. PARSONS, OF Flushing, L.I., has a table of small and rare oak planks with leaves of variegated color, among which is particularly noticeable the Quercus Loretti. Mr. PARSONS also has altheas and a Japan gingko tree on his table; a mammoth squash preserved front the Boston Exhibition of 1861, and a Canada crooked-neck squash are to be seen on one of the tables. Mrs. JAMES HUMPHREY, as usual, makes an imposing display with some very beautiful variegated fuschias, wild and hot-house flowers. Mr. BURGESS, of Brooklyn, contributes a lot of sweet-williams and cut roses. Messrs. E. & G. MARSHALL, of Poughkeepsie, some luscious grapes; also, DAVID FOWLIS and JAMES [???], of Brooklyn, make contributions of the same kind of fruit; JOHN YOUNG, a fine lot of cherries; G. MARC, of Astoria, a plate of peaches; S.N. SIBBELL has the best single dish of strawberries; G. M. BALDWIN the second best; Mrs PACKER contributes a tree upon which both oranges and lemons are growing finely; J.A. MESSELBERG receives a premium for the best exhibition of cut flowers, P. BRUME, of Lewellyn Park, a premium for the second best lot of cut flowers. PHILIP ZEN exhibits [???] splendid baskets and boquets of flowers, also a lot of Gloxanias; J. [???], hand [???]; A.C. [???], of Brooklyn, two tables [???] with moss basket plants, and has been awarded the [???] premium of $10. There are rustic [???], apparatus for hosting green-houses, [???] on horticulture, names for preserving flowers -- a Boston not on, and last, but not least, a ""What is it,"" which all should see. The attendance last evening, we are gratified in being able to say, was large.

We thought it unworthyof a great nation to allow our view of international law, and the duties it involves, to be warped and distorted by the pleading of a merely material interest The fact that the cotton of the South was very needful to us made the war more distressing, but furnished, in our view, no valid ground for intervention. Past injuries, if we did not think fit to resent them when the Union was strong and united, we thought it below our dignity to resent in the moment of its weakness and adversity. Future security we preferred to look for rather in the good feeling which our conduct seemed to us peculiarly calculated to produce than in availing ourselves of the temporary weakness and heavy misfortune of a kindred people. In this point only we confess we see some reason to believe that we may have been mistaken. We do not believe that, had we pushed to the utmost the advantages circumstances threw in our way, we could have been the objects of more bitter hostility, not only among the ignorant and misguided but among many of those whose education and information should have taught them better. We may possibly live to repent our generosity. We may possibly live to find that our moderation has been displayed toward those who have no power to appreciate it. It might have been wiser to take security for ourselves, instead of putting so much confidence in the fairness and good feeling of others. If this fact be established, the error is still reparable. The North cannot see that we have done anything to entitle us, we do not say to gratitude or good will, but to abstinence from hatred and reviling. A change of policy on the part of this country would very speedily alter their opinion and convince them of that which they seem now unable to conceive, that they have been treated by England as they never have treated her, and as, if she had thought more of her own interest, and less of their misfortune, she never would have located them.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""England's Attitude Toward America; The Steamer Circassino"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""England's Attitude Toward America; The Steamer Circassino"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe78d6f2-45f6-5d7a-be59-25ee5aaef1e1,612,nyt://article/fe78d6f2-45f6-5d7a-be59-25ee5aaef1e1

Mr. SOULE was quite ill on Wednesday night, suffering severely from an attack of neuralgia in the head, but he was much better yesterday morning, and called for all the newspapers, including the New-York Tribune. He expressed great indignation at an editorial article in the Herald censuring Gen. BUTLER for not hanging him instead of sending him North, and was anxious to learn the author, not appearing to be aware that a man named JAMES GORDON BENNETT claims to be the sole editor and proprietor of that sheet. Mr. SOULE says that he opposed the secession of Louisiana up to the last moment, and was Corporation candidate of New-Orleans for a seat in the Convention -- the Corporation being at that time opposed to secession. He was beaten, however, by 65 votes. After the secession ordinance passed, he says he submitted to the will of the people and went with his State. As to the part he has taken in the rebellion since that time he volunteers little information. He thinks it will be a long time before the rebellion will be subdued. His fellow prisoner, MAZUREAU, formerly High Sheriff of New-Orleans, is an open, bold, and somewhat blustering and bravado rebel, who seems to glory in the insignificant part he has played in the farce. He is not a man of very dangerous parts, physical or mental, and is probably as high up in the world now as he will ever get, unless the Government should by and by stoop to elevate him a little higher by means of a pully and weight.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b4b9958-f829-5bf7-8006-e6ffdf1a39d4,1303,nyt://article/4b4b9958-f829-5bf7-8006-e6ffdf1a39d4

The result is, that the Grand Jury have been induced, as I understand, upon an unsworn and informal communication, without any complaint or charge before a Magistrate, to investigate those matters, and as these proceedings are secret, and they receive only testimony from the prosecution, and no accused party can be heard before them, it is not impossible that on the imperfect, or misrepresented state of facts presented to them, they may find an indictment against those to whose hands the alleged illegal Bonds have come, and thus attempt to implicate me.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Indiana State Bonds.; TO THE PUBLIC.

A steamboat chartered by the Yacht Club for the use of their invited friends, and hundreds of smaller craft accompanied the boats in their movements, and at times the most intense interest was manifested by the spectators, as the contest between different boats became sharp.

editorial sees Missouri enacting emancipation policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/21/archives/emancipation-in-missouri.html,editorial sees Missouri enacting emancipation policy,"It is evident that Slavery cannot exist for any length of time in the State of Missouri. The mere fact that the question is being agitated all over the State seals the doom of the institution. Slavery can neither continue to exist in the midst of protracted war, nor of hostile agitation. The State Convention of Missouri last week gave reluctant consideration to the President's compensated-emancipation message; and responded that practical action on the proposition was at present uncalled for. But this week an ""Emancipation Convention"" has sat at the State Capital, at which 195 delegates were present, who represented twenty-five counties, or nearly one-fourth of the area of the State. By this Convention, resolutions were adopted recommending the gradual emancipation of the slaves in the State, and the acceptance of the aid tendered by the general Government. The mere fact that such a Convention could be held in Missouri, indicates the marvelous change that has taken place in the condition of that State since two years ago -- at which time such a meeting, at such a place, would probably have cost the life of every man who attended it. The growth of public opinion in a State like Missouri, is extremely rapid; and opinion hardly gets formed on any topic, ere it is overtaken by public action upon it. If twenty-five counties were represented in the Convention now, we may expect that all the counties in the State will be represented next year, and that the same year will see the question authoritatively submitted to the vote of the people.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Emancipation in Missouri.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Emancipation in Missouri.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1935555d-6e71-5178-875f-85a39a79d371,569,nyt://article/1935555d-6e71-5178-875f-85a39a79d371

Editorial on Union's iron-clad navy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/21/archives/editorial-article-3-no-title.html,Editorial on Union's iron-clad navy,"OUR IRON-CLAD NAVY. -- The European journals exhibit great anxiety to learn the progress of our new iron-clad navy. This curiosity, though natural, is hardly fair; for both France and England take the utmost pains to envelop all their iron naval constructions in the densest secresy. We shall not enlighten them, except so far as to tell them that, such is the present activity of the Government, we shall, before the end of the present year, and probably before the rebellion is completely crushed, have a larger and more powerful iron-clad navy than either France or England, or than France and England combined. Since the passage through Congress of the Appropriation bill for this purpose, every muscle has been strained at our Navy-yards and foundries, both public and private. Mailed warships, of every form -- gunboats, batteries, monitors and rams, fitted, some for sea service, and others for harbor defence -- are now being constructed at New-York, Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Philadelphia, Troy, and in Connecticut. The revelations contained in the intercepted private letter of Mr. Rebel Roving Commissioner ROST, show conclusively that NAPOLEON, in his own words, ""fears the rising navy of the United States."" If he knew with what rapid strides it is ""rising,"" his fear would probably amount to a panic. As for England, while Parliament clatters and their old-fogy Admiralty wrangles with Capt. COLES, our foundries and dock-yards resound with the lusty music of a hundred trip-hammers and riveting-tools. How the wefts of the Future are woven in with those iron strands! Who knows to what service they will be put? One thing we know -- the Power possessing the strongest iron navy holds the empire of the seas, and seizes the hegemony of the nations. With the end of this war the United States passes from the gristle state into the man, and our iron ships are the Thor's hammer in our hands.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 3 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 3 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b9277b2-f7a0-5adb-b27e-fe7a1265ea51,316,nyt://article/2b9277b2-f7a0-5adb-b27e-fe7a1265ea51

In a Government like that of the Empire, where the military element takes the first rank, and where the freedom of the Press and of speech is not understood as in the United States, these indelicate criminations and recriminations must indeed provoke a feeling very near akin to disgust. So thorough is the esprit de corps of the French army, that such a thing as cowardice does not rank among the possible things, and when a regiment yields from over-pressure, their brothers-in-arms in neighboring regiments would think it a crime to take advantage of the fact to fix upon them the cruel and indelible stain of cowardice. Their brothers-in-arms accept, as a matter of course, that when a regiment yields, it does so either to secure a better position for accomplishing the end in view, or because it is so punished as to render the holding of the position impossible.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/21/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE WATER-STREET CASE. -- The ""terrible Water-street murder"" will be very apt to prove but another instance of the certain results following a life of degradation and dissipation. HONNORA, upon being questioned, gave the following explanation of the affair, for the truth of which we, of course, do not vouch: The deceased and her comrades were of the lowest rank in life; their surroundings were filthy, their lives debauched, and their constant beverage ""forty-yard whisky"" and ""poor-man's gin."" The man, JAMES WINTHROP, formerly kept the deceased as a housekeeper and ""boss"" over several girls, from whose life of shame he reaped a reward. CATHERINE, the deceased, was a confirmed drunkard, and for gin would do anything or go anywhere. Her constant inebrity rendered her unprofitable to WINTHROP, and after a row they separated, and he took to his arms and her place the girl HONNORA MORRISON. After a little CATHARINE returned to her old haunt, but in a lower position, that is she became simply one of the girls. Her old habits were strong upon her however, and she again became a burden upon the hands of the establishment. During one of her [???] she went home and to bed, the proprietor and HONNORA being at the time away from the house. Returning they learned from another girl, (also under arrest,) that CATHERINE was sick and in the depths of the ""horrors."" [???] this girl HONNORA entered the room, when CATHERINE begged for some gin, which she would have given her, but WINTHROP objected. That night she continued to rave and cry terribly. In the morning HONNORA visited her, took her from one bed to another, while she made up the one in which she had slept, and finding that her clothing was in a most filthy state, went to the shop where CATHERINE had pawned her breastpin for a pint of gin, and her only other chemise for a sixpence worth of the same article, and redeemed the garment, that she might have something decent to wear. HONNORA says that CATHERINE died undoubtedly with the horrors. She gave her not only no fluid or camphene, but she gave her absolutely nothing.HONNORA is young Irishwoman, uneducated and friendless. That she is a bad woman there is no doubt, but that she committed this particular offence is really a matter of grave question. When she was arrested she was not permitted to take her clothing or her shawl, and when our reporter saw her, she was barefooted and illy-clad, at the Tombs. Mrs. FOSTER, upon a representation of these facts, sent a messenger for her things, and will do what she can to make her comfortable.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9dc4a320-3cb7-5a04-9616-18426dbb308e,3169,nyt://article/9dc4a320-3cb7-5a04-9616-18426dbb308e

First, a proposition is proven by us, and the French accept it as definitive; then the next battle disproves it, and reverses the decision. First, it is shown to the satisfaction of France, that one iron ship is immeasurably and overwhelmingly superior in battle to all wooden ones. Frenchman sees the proofs, and admits that the thing is indisputable. That very moment we are quite ready to prove that wooden ships, (or, as the gallant Capt. BOGGS phrased it, ""iron hearts in wooden ships"") are superior to even iron-cased batteries. We show that stone forts are worthless in a contest with iron ships, and, we also prove, that no iron ship, or fleet of iron ships, can stand against the fearful weight of metal we throw from the enormous guns we have mounted on forts. We demonstrate the superiority of rams, and we show how they can be dodged or destroyed. In fact, we no sooner prove any given point than we demonstrate its opposite; till finally the only thing that seems certain is, that whatever is isn't.

For he always distinguishes himself by the profundity and solemnity of his platitudes upon American topics; and therefore on the breaking out of the rebellion he was immediately engaged, at any price, to write for all the London papers. For all, with one or two exceptions; and we expected, may we venture to say that we hoped, that the London Examiner was one of these. But we were doomed to disappointment.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/22/archives/brooklyn-news-a-panic-among-the-medical-fraternity.html,,"""A NEGRO IN THE FENCE."" -- The Kings County Medical Society, among whose members are to be found some of the most conservative, learned and dignified of the disciples of Esculapius, was recently thrown into as much commotion as if one of Commodore FARRAGUT's 13-inch bombs had been dropped suddenly into their midst. At a recent meeting of the Society,Dr. NORTH, a member in good standing, practicing in the Eastern District, gravely proposed Dr. REA for membership. The proposition took the usual course, and was referred to the Censors, who, in due course of time, put a few questions to Dr. NORTH as to the character and standing of Dr. REA, and the questions all having been answered satisfactorily, they reported in favor of admitting the outside brother in the profession to all the honors to be conferred by a close communion with so distinguished an organization as the Society aforesaid. At the last monthly meeting, just as the members present were about going through with the stereotyped form of balloting on the proposition to admit ""Dr. REA,"" the worthy Health-officer of the city, Dr. J.B. JONES, who, by reason of his official position, has a more extended knowledge of the practicing physicians in the city than ""any other man,"" thought he ""smelt a rat,"" and springing to his feet, stated, much to the astonishment of some, at least, of the members present, that he knew of but one practicing physician in the city, bearing the name of the candidate, and that was a negro! He put the question to Dr. NORTH, to know if that Dr. REA was the candidate he had proposed, and was promptly answered in the affirmative. The scene that followed, it is impossible to describe, because there was no impartial reporter present to record what was said and done, and those who were present are not inclined to say much about what did transpire; but one thing is certain, Dr. JONES made a motion to lay all the proceedings, so far as had, upon the table, and it was carried. The question is a new one for the Society to handle, and may result as disastrously to the organization as it has before in other organizations -- religious, political, and scientific. What adds to the embarrassment of those who oppose the admission of the candidate is, that they cannot discover any clause in the Constitution or by-laws of the Society which prevents a negro from being recognized as a man and a brother, and under the enforcement of which, any applicant who comes up to the standard of qualifications required, can be kept out. At the next meeting Dr. NORTH may possibly propose the following as a motto for the Society: ""Nulli ugabimus, nulli differemus, Justitiam."" If adopted, the whole question is at once settled.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; A PANIC AMONG THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; A PANIC AMONG THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3c8d9ae-0608-57c6-8eb2-9700420368c4,1032,nyt://article/c3c8d9ae-0608-57c6-8eb2-9700420368c4

The anxiety springs chiefly out of the fear that it may turn up at Richmond suddenly, to increase still further the numerical superiority of the enemy over the forces under Gen. MCCLELLAN. This anxiety would be relieved at once, if we knew that the Union army of the West was being employed in any way to operate as reinforcements to MCCLELLAN, by taking a part in the general programme of movements against Richmond.

By Sunday next cars will run the whole length of the road to Coney Island, a distance of eleven miles from the place of starting. The route of this road is as follows: Leaving Fulton Ferry, on Water-street to Main, on Main to York, York to Jay, through Jay, Smith, Mill, Ninth-streets, Tenth-avenue and Fifteenth-street. The track is one of the best that has yet been laid for horse cars, and the equipments of the road throughout are new and after the most approved plans. There are at present eleven cars on the road, light, airy and pleasant, and as soon as the road is open to Coney Island twenty cars will be operated, and during the warm weather, four large double-decked excursion cars, with four horses each, will be run, in addition to the regular number, to accommodate the public. Cars were first placed upon this road in May, since which time the trade has increased fifty per cent. This road will in time be one of the best, in a pecuniary point of view, in the city. A portion of it now passes through a densely populated section of the city, and opens up for improvement some of the most healthy and pleasant localities for residences in the suburbs. As a route for pleasure riding it is equaled by none. For the most part it is free from dust, and passes through streets in the outskirts of the city studded with pleasant villas and grass plots and meadows on either hand, the whole distance to Coney Island, the attractions of which for sea bathing are too well known to render it necessary to describe at this time. The Company will commence to erect to-day extensive and permanent staples on Fifteenth-street, between Eleventh-avenue and the city line. One building alone will be 140 by 200 feet, capable of accommodating two hundred horses. The fare on the road will be regulated according to the distance traveled -- to Coney Island, 11 miles, 20 cents for adults; children half price; five cents and three cents to the city line, and proportionate rates for intermediate distances between the city line and Coney Island. The officers of the Company are: President -- JAMES A. VAN BRUNT, the present popular Alderman of the Eighth Ward; Secretary -- FRANCIS, G.

The indifference and the opposition must alike result from an imperfect appreciation of the enterprise. The project is neither sectional or local. As a development of the national defences, it looks as directly to the protection of New-England and Pennsylvania as it does to the protection of New-York. As a commercial measure, it serves no one State or district in preference to another; while its advantage to the National resources in its enlargement of trade and in the augmented tribute it will bring to the National treasury, give it unquestional claims to the support and approval of the entire nation. These considerations have been strikingly presented in the memorial which Mr. S.B. RUGGLES, as agent of New-York, has submitted to the President. From that important paper we presented several highly interesting extracts several days ago. In another column will be found others, stating with much clearness the close commercial intimacy between the East and the West, and the political value of the active interchange between the grain of the prairie and the fabric of the New-England factory. Mr. RUGGLES asserts that while New-York raises enough wheat to last its population four months out of the twelve, New-England grows only enough for three weeks' consumption of its population. The deficit in either case has to be supplied by the West, and the West has to be paid in the productions of Eastern manufacturing industry. The circulation thus established is the secret of that political unity which cordially subsists between the two sections. And to encourage that tendency to unity, nothing is so efficacious as the development of those means of intercourse which shall bring the shop of Massachusetts nearer to the corn-field of Illinois.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Canal Lock Improvement A New National Guarantee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Canal Lock Improvement A New National Guarantee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b75cef7-ca9e-54cc-aa21-2291a10df72e,1207,nyt://article/9b75cef7-ca9e-54cc-aa21-2291a10df72e

There is no part of all her repertory in which Miss RICHINGS appears to so much advantage as in Marie. She acts in it with archness and piquancy, where archness and piquancy are required, and with a very natural shade of pathos in such scenes as border on the sentimental. She sings the music with the most finished grace and brilliancy, and she looks handsome enough to be the pet of any regiment in the world.

In other words, deserting the party which raised him to office, and ignoring the common sentiment of the loyal North, Mr. LINCOLN has now filed a declaration of principles which distinctly identifies him with the Pro-Slavery reconstructionists.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The President and Slavery.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The President and Slavery.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ae7c616-b418-5759-9c3d-77a83b6682e2,618,nyt://article/5ae7c616-b418-5759-9c3d-77a83b6682e2

editorial calls Vicksburg only obstacle in navigation of Mississippi River,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/24/archives/the-snag-in-the-mississippi-the-only.html,editorial calls Vicksburg only obstacle in navigation of Mississippi River,"rebel snag interfering now with the free navigation of the Mississippi River is the town of Vicksburgh. Our boats struck against it very unexpectedly, when they were dashing up the Father of Waters in the most triumphant style. The invincible fleet of Commodore FARRAGUT, which had blown to pieces all the rebel gunboats, fireships and forts near the mouth of the stream, and captured all the towns on the river as far up as Vicksburgh, was stopped short, and turned tail and went down the river again, after taking a look at this Mississippi town. The gun and mortarboats of Commodores FOOTE and DAVIS, which did such brave work at Island No. 10, at Fort Pillow, and above Memphis, and which, we were given to understand after the capture of Memphis, were not to pause in their victorious course down stream until they hailed the up-coming fleet from New-Orleans -- even they, it seems, have not thought it best to go to Vicksburgh. And so, from the mouth of the Arkansas to Vicksburgh, a distance of two hundred miles, the Mississippi River, which we all thought weeks ago was entirely ours, is still controlled by the rebels. We do not think, however, that Vicksburgh will be a very difficult snag to root out or to break down, and we do not imagine that the country will need to wait very long now for its reduction, and the consequent opening of the river. Our New-Orleans fleet only turned back from Vicksburgh that it might return to it again in such force as to compel it to succumb without making any ado about the matter; and of our up-river fleet, we learn that ELLET's rams have passed down to see if there is any butting needed near Vicksburgh. We suppose that some of FOOTE's old mortarboats have also gone down; and as part of PURTER's mortar fleet, lately at Mobile, has gone up, we shall doubtless soon see warm work at Vicksburgh, or else we shall behold, what the military commandant there said we never should behold, the surrender of another Mississippi town. Vicksburgh is the most important point in the State of Mississippi for us to hold. The possession of it will not only give us a clear sweep of the river, but will also put us within short railroad distance of Jackson, which is the Capital of the State, and the key to the very simple system of Mississippi railroads. It was wise not to attack it when the attack might cost us a good deal, if in a short time we could capture it at a cost probably of nothing.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SNAG IN THE MISSISSIPPI.

From all that could be learned at the Eleventh Precinct Station-house, and from persons in the immediate vicinity of the place where the outrage was committed, it appears that the deceased was standing quietly upon the sidewalk in front of the oyster-saloon of P. KELLAR, No. 252 Third-street, between 3 and 4 o'clock on Sunday morning, when three or four men came rushing out of the saloon. One of them was without a hat, and he, seeing the deceased standing on the walk, went up to him, and in a threatening manner demanded his hat. To this demand GIEB paid no attention, whereupon one of the parties struck him a violent blow on the forehead or temple, which, is not at present known. He was knocked down, and in falling, the buck and side of his head struck upon the sharp edge of the curbstone. It is also said that GIEB was beaten by one or two of the parties after he had fallen, but as to this we cannot speak positively. The unfortunate man man was soon after taken to his residence, No. 127 Willet-street, by the Eleventh Ward Police, and a physician called to attend him. An examination of the wounds showed that his skull was fractured in several places and that he was otherwise seriously injured; so much so, that his physicians, from the first, pronounced his case a hopeless one. He lingered in an insensible state, most of the time, until yesterday afternoon. His neighbors say that he was a quiet, inoffensive man, and was never known to be in difficulty with any one.

Desperate men might still be found who would put their lives in their hands for gain, and who would incur the hazards to themselves as long as others could be found who would furnish the money and run the risk of the loss of property. The vessels and their outfits had been generally furnished by parties who remained safely on shore themselves, and whom it was accordingly more difficult to connect with the enterprises. The outfits of vessels for the legal traffic to Africa differed so little from those of vessels bound for the slave markets, that unless a vessel actually took on board a cargo of negroes, it was very difficult to convict her, or the parties who fitted her out, of an illegal intent. But this very difficulty made it all the more important that the law should be able to reach some of these owners of slavers; and it is a fitting sequence to the trial and execution of GORDON, the slaver captain, that the owner of a slaver should in his turn expiate his offence by five years' imprisonment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Stroke at the Slave Traffic.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Stroke at the Slave Traffic.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0325611-58bc-50ca-acdf-a242bdd3eb70,564,nyt://article/a0325611-58bc-50ca-acdf-a242bdd3eb70

From this the flames extended each way to the adjoining buildings, until all of the houses, from No. 631 to No. 645, both inclusive, were burned to the ground. The houses were principally of wood, and owing to the combustible nature of the contents there was no staying the progress of the fire, notwithstanding the fact that a large number of firemen were early on the ground. Nos. 635, 637, and 639 were owned by GEORGE HERRICK, as a grocery store and dwelling. His loss is about $1,500. He is insured for $2,000 in the New Amsterdam Insurance Company. CATHARINE HOGAN occupied a portion of No. 635 as a millinery store. Her estimated loss is from $300 to $460. She is insured for $1,200 in the Brevoort and Brooklyn Insurance Companies. Nos. 631 and 633 were occupied by A.P. SMITH. His damage is, perhaps, $300. He is insured for $1,000 in the Brevoort Insurance Company. Buildings No. 641, 643, and 645 were owned by Alderman IRA E. ALLEN. One of the occupants of the latter building, named GEORGE MCCORD, was much damaged -- to what extent could not be ascertained. He is insured in the Fireman's Insurance Company for about $6,000. Mr. N.W. GUINNEVAN occupied No. 639 as a furniture store. His damage to stock was about $800. He is insured for $1,000 in the Rutger's Insurance Company. Mr. LOUIS EADENBECKER occupied No. 641 as a confectionery store. His loss on stock and furniture will amount $600, upon which he has no insurance. HENRY BEHEMANN occupied No. 643 1/2. His goods were very much damaged. He has an insurance of $300. Mr. WILLET MCCORD, of No. 645, had his stock of clothing damaged to the extent of about $300. He is insured for $800 in the Gebhard Insurance Company. DANIEL DEMPREY occupied the upper part of several of the buildings. He lost considerable of his stock and furniture, upon which he has an insurance for $260 in the Rutger's insurance Company. There are quite a number of other tradesmen, whose names we could not obtain, who suffered considerably by this fire. The second floors, of nearly all the burned buildings, where occupied by poor families who lost the most of their little property, and barely escaped with their lives, from the fact that the fire occurred at a time when all were in their beds. Owing to the efforts of the firemen, and the vigilance of the Twenty-second Precinct Police, a large amount of valuable property was saved, though some of it in a damaged condition, both from fire and water.

Ingenuity was utterly defeated in the effort to interpret the object of the sudden journey -- a general impression that it was to borrow the military counsel of Gen. SCOTT that the President seized this moment to leave Washington, affording the only probable solution of the mystery. Gen. SCOTT is rusticating in the shadow of the Highlands. His health is too seriously shaken to admit of a trip to the Capital, there to afford the Government the results of his invaluable experience and calm sagacity; and the obvious alternative is for the Government to wait upon the veteran.

Strawberries here, strawberries there, strawberries everywhere.

The [???] looked on in despair, while their meats were spoiling on the hooks for the want of purchasers. There was nobody to eat, nobody to buy meat. It was all strawberry -- strawberries in the mouth, strawberries in the eye, strawberries in the ear, strawberries to the smell, touch and to handle.

Editorial compares material condition of North and South,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/25/archives/material-condition-of-the-combatants.html,Editorial compares material condition of North and South,"There is hardly any point in which a comparison between the North and the South is devoid of interest, or where the results of a comparison do not show abundantly how utterly foolish was this rebellion. If we look at the number of soldiers only, this will be so; but even numbers are not of the first importance. In the sinews of war, in munitions, in artillery, in supplies of every kind, there is hardly any comparison to be instituted between the two sections. So, too, in the effects which the war has produced. One traveling through the North finds but little token of an impaired prosperity. He finds the laborer in the fields and the cities, as bustling and noisy with trade as ever. Some signs of war he sees in the number of uniforms which he meets everywhere, and the columns of the newspapers show that the war is the paramount object of interest. But the people are cheerful and happy; they bear the burdens and the anxieties which the war brings upon them lightly. The feeling of public calamity necessarily connected with war is swallowed up in love of country and of the cause. How is it at tho South? Universal testimony tells us that the case is exactly reversed. Through large tracts of country the lands are going to waste for lack of labor. A National Captain who was taken at Bull Run and sent South, than brought back to Richmond, and then sent to Salisbury, N.C., writes, that on this trip the crowds at the stations ""were dull and silent. Every one that spoke said 'I wish the war was over.' It begins to look dark to them.""

That part of it stationed at Memphis will be in a fine, high, healthy region, which our troops in the deadly swamps of Cairo last Summer greatly longed to occupy. The column which has gone to East Tennessee will be in the very healthiest region of America -- among the hills and life-giving breezes of that romantic section; and if it pushes forward into Southwestern Virginia, it will find much the same conditions and climate. The troops required to Summer along the line of Northern Alabama and Mississippi, can now select positions with good sanitary conditions -- and there are plenty of such -- where the health of the men will be maintained and improved. The rebels fled from Corinth at a most opportune moment, in this point of view, for our army. Since it encamped in Southern Tennessee, five months ago, it lost five by disease to one by the enemy.

A man named TRACY then stepped up to the Judge and said that the German who was struck had open in Court that morning. The Justice immediately sent an officer of the Court around to see if the man was seriously injured. When the Court officer returned, he reported to the Justice that he had seen the man said to be injured, and also the doctor who was attending him. The Court officer further stated to Justice STEERS that the doctor said the blow might have been caused by a club, or a fall, but that he did not think it anything more than a flesh wound. The justice then discharged my man, Dr. FREDERICK ROESLER. The physician who attended the deceased from the time of the occurrence till his death, then testified, among other things, that the man was insensible all the time; that his skull was seriously fractured, and that he took out a part of it. The Doctor further testified: ""No one spoke to me about the condition of the man; at least, no officer of a Court."" The inquest, not being concluded at a late hour last evening, it was further adjourned over till to-day, at the same place.

The Republic is not in danger, Washington is safe, Gen. MCCLELLAN is neither dead or defeated, JACKSON has not gobbled up FREMONT. There is no apprehension of any of these calamities occurring within the next forty-eight hours. The whole secret is that the President, entertaining, with becoming modesty, doubts as to certain knotty points in the ""strategy"" of the campaign he is directing with so much military skill and success, naturally desired to consult an authority wiser than himself, and therefore thrust a clean shirt and his map of Virginia into a carpet-bag, and repaired to the Summer quarters of the late General-in-Chief. What points were presented, discussed and solved at this kindly and cordial interview, who shall tell? Let it suffice that it ended with entire satisfaction on both sides, each interlocutor expressing his confidence in the success of the army and the cause; and Gen.

"We suppose that, by an attentive perusal of our daily budget of correspondence and telegrams from our army in front of Richmond, the reader will obtain as correct an idea of the situation and prospects there as it is in the power of words to give.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/26/archives/in-front-of-richmond.html,,"We suppose that, by an attentive perusal of our daily budget of correspondence and telegrams from our army in front of Richmond, the reader will obtain as correct an idea of the situation and prospects there as it is in the power of words to give. It is briefly this: -- that affairs are in an exceedingly critical condition; that any hour may bring on a conflict which will rage along the entire line, and that that conflict is very likely to decide the fate of Richmond; that our army is in fine condition, morally, physically, and militarily, for the battle; that it is prepared, and quite ready for it; that it has been largely reinforced; that daily, though slowly yet surely, it is planting itself in more favorable positions, and making headway, ceaselessly, toward the rebel capital; and an official dispatch from Gen. MCCLELLAN, published this morning, announces that yesterday, after a brisk skirmish, he gained a point on the enemy's right, whose importance, though we cannot here precisely indicate it, is such that it will enable him to operate directly upon the rebel works whenever it may suit his convenience. On the other hand, it is seen that, as in many another critical case, so here, the crisis may for sometime be delayed; that while the breaking of a cloud and the consequent shower of rain may be the means of bringing on a battle, (as in the recent instance of the engagements at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks,) so a hundred circumstances, as little under mortal control as this, may be means of indefinitely postponing it; and that though it is not in the power of Gen. MCCLELLAN to prevent a general engagement, it may not be his plan to precipitate it at the present moment. The public are apt to become so excited by the daily rumors, canards, bulletins and signs of battle, that they think it impossible each morning that another twenty-four hours can pass away without witnessing the decisive combat; while to suggest that a week or a fortnight may transpire before such an event, is considered the height of absurdity. Yet, from day to day, under just suck a flock of rumors, did Gen. HALLECK work his way toward the rebel stronghold at Corinth, till finally he produced what, we now know from the rebels themselves, was little less than a rout of their army, and its virtual dissolution, without a battle having been fought at all. It is not likely -- nor, for that matter, is it unlikely either -- that the rebel army at Richmond will come to as disgraceful an end; and that the great rebellion will fizzle out as meanly and contemptibly as it opened. But at the same time, in speculating upon the present and future, it is well not to lose sight of the events of the recent past.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'In Front of Richmond.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'In Front of Richmond.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f7b52084-bda1-55c5-bdc9-3c627f6a6a40,944,nyt://article/f7b52084-bda1-55c5-bdc9-3c627f6a6a40

Parliament discusses war; Observations from France,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/06/27/archives/our-affairs-in-england-gen-butlers-proclamation-in-the-house-of.html,Parliament discusses war; Observations from France,"In the House of Lords, on the 13th inst., the Earl of Carnavon said: I wish to put a question to the noble Earl, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs in reference to the proclamation said to have been issued by Gen. BUTLER, the commander of the Federal forces at New-Orleans. That proclamation states that any woman who shall by word, look or gesture, insult any officer or soldier, shall be treated as a woman of the town and dealt with accordingly. I will not insult the House by commenting upon such a proclamation as this, but it must be perfectly obvious to your Lordships that one of two things must be meant. Either it is intended as a reality or a menace. If it was a menace it was one of the grossest, most brutal, and most unmanly insults to every woman in New-Orleans, since it was notorious that there was not a woman in the city who was not devoted to the Confederate cause. On the other hand, if the proclamation be intended to have a practical effect, I beg your Lordships to observe that, by the terms in which it is couched, it gives more unlimited powers to the Federal soldiers than have ever been given to any soldiers upon the earth. The proclamation is absolutely without precedent. We have heard of towns taken by storm, and subjected to all the violence of the troops who have taken them, but that such a proclamation as this should be issued in a large and prosperous commercial town which has capitulated, and of which they have been for some time in peaceful occupation, has never before come to my knowledge. I will do the Northern States the justice to say that I do not believe they are in any sense identified with this proclamation of Gen. BUTLER's, and I trust that they will repudiate it. It, however, this is to be the principle upon which the war in America is to be carried on, it will be a war of extermination. The question I wish to ask is, whether Her Majesty's Government have received any information as to the authenticity of this proclamation. I wishalso to put another question to the noble Lord. There has been for sonic days a report current of the proposal made by the Government of France to Her Majesty's Government for concerting jointly terms of mediation between the belligerents in this war. It is quite obvious that the value of any such mediation must depend on the terms in which it is concerted, on its general character, and on the spirit in which it is received. But assuming that the mediation is such as is consistent with our self-respect and with the material interests of this country, I trust that Her Majesty's Government will give the propositions their most earnest and most favorable consideration.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""OUR AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND.; GEN.

The readiness of England to take advantage of their troubles, and her baseness in drawing France with her into an interference with American affairs, would be the theme of every tongue and pen in the United States. Something would, indeed, be gained by such a course, inasmuch as we should place on record our willingness to join in preventing the further shedding of blood. But, considering the jealousy of our every action which prevails through the States, it is, perhaps, better that England should not take the initiative even in tendering good offices. If the Emperor of the French thinks the moment opportune for telling the Northern people that in his opinion the subjugation of several millions of their own race is an enterprise beyond their strength, and that the attempt is causing intolerable suffering to Europe, he is at perfect liberty to do so, and Englishmen will be glad to sec good advice offered by a personage who is far more likely to be listened to than any of our statesmen. We should desire nothing better than that NAPOLEON or the Czar, who are two most popular Sovereigns across the Atlantic, should, either separately or conjointly, press on the Americans the counsels which would be indignantly rejected if offered by us. European mediation had better begin on the Continent. All that we can say now has already been said by our politicians and by the Press. The speeches of two or three Cabinet Ministers and the well-known opinions of almost every man of note in either House are equivalent to anything that the French Emperor can disclose to the Americans by a formal offer of mediation. The North knows well the opinions of this country, and, without further official communication, will feel assured that we give a tacit assent to any recommendations which other Powers may make in the interests of peace.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE QUESTION OF MEDIATION.

The bill to carry into effect the treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the Slave-trade was passed, with only four dissenting votes. The bill for the admission of Western Virginia was taken up, but pending its consideration the Senate resolved itself into a High Court of Impeachment, for the trial of WEST H. HUMPHREYS, of Tennessee. The galleries of the Senate were densely crowded to witness the proceedings. The members of the House of Representatives came in and filled the seats of the Senators, who were arranged upon a platform specially constructed for the purpose. The witnesses, including Col. POLK, PARSON BROWNLOW and BAILIE PEYTON, occupied settees on the outer circle. Two tables were placed in the area fronting the Secretary's desk, one of which was surrounded by the managers on the part of the House to prosecute the case, while the other was unused -- the accused with his counsel not being present. The proceedings were conducted with all the dignity becoming a High Court of Impeachment. The accused was found guilty on the first article of impeachment by a unanimous vote of the thirty-eight Senators present. He was also found guilty on all the other articles but one -- that which charged a confiscation of the property of citizens of the United States. The judgment of the Court was, that Judge HUMPHREYS be removed from his office, and forever disqualified from holding or enjoying any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.

The flag of the Republic has already been victoriously borne over more than one-half of the rebellious South, whose very vastness was urged as a main reason why it could never be conquered. The arms of the Union have already triumphed over at least a half of the great host, which a year ago, or half a year ago, the rebels had in the field, though that rebel army was declared to be too powerful to be overthrown. The so-called Confederacy, as a military Power, is seen to be already on its last legs, though it was thought that its vitality would be coexistent with that of the Union; and foreign observers cannot help seeing that after the pending battle -- and, we may say, our pending victory -- at Richmond, the Confederacy, as a political Power, will be numbered among the shadows of the past -- the shortest-lived Empire of all time.

With one modification, this remark is perfectly true. This patronizing air has been assumed almost wholly toward the North, toward the United States. The rebels have generally been treated as not only full grown, but even as prodigies of wisdom and virtue.

The story, as told by our own fellows, is pretty much to the same purpose. There were intrenched rebels, with batteries heavy and light, rifle-pits in abundance, flanked by woods filled with sharpshooters. There were swamps to protect them, and embarrass the enemy. Upon these formidable defences the Union troops were flung without preparation, half of them with leadless muskets, the rest with guns uncapped; there was some unequal artillery play, wherein our boys, completely unsheltered, came by the worse; and a charge or two marked by the exhibition of reckless gallantly, which extracted praise even from the enemy. The assault was desperate, but it failed. All the men could do was done. They actually forced their way into the enemy's works; struck down the artillerists at their guns; and only retired when the lack of support proved the hopelessness of the conflict, and then with the steadiness of men retiring from a parade-ground rather than from a battlefield. No want of pluck and nerve was chargeable to officers or men. They did their part; but through some blunder, only 2,000 of our forces were brought into action against 10,000 intrenched and secure rebels, and the odds were too tremendous.

"THE DEATH OF COL. JAMES H. PERRY. -- The sudden announcement yesterday, of the death of Col. JAMES H. PERRY, of the Forty-eighth (Brooklyn) Regiment, who died at Fort Pulaski on the 18th inst. of apoplexy, caused a gloom to hang over the whole people, such as has not been felt before since the war began. The deceased was not only an accomplished officer, but he was a Christain gentleman and a patriot in the broadest sense. Having for many years, as a minister of the Gospel, occupied the pulpits of several of the most prominent churches of the Methodist persuasion, in this city, he had endeared himself to a very large circle of friends who now deeply feel his loss. When the slaveholders first sounded the tocsin of war, Col. PERRY was among the first to offer his services to the Government. He was at that time pastor of the Pacific-street Methodist Episcopal Church, and in announcing the determination he had arrived at to his congregation, he feelingly said that he owed his services to the country, for ""I received my education from her, and I owe her all my education will enable me to do."" He received authority to enlist a regiment, and raised the ""Continental Guard,"" or Forty-eighth Regiment New-York Volunteers, and proceeded to the seat of war on the 17th of September last. His command was at the taking of Port Royal, took an active part, in the battle on Daufuskie Island, and rendered important service in the preliminary arrangements made to reduce Fort Pulaski. Col. PERRY was about fifty-two years old at the time of his death, having been born in Ulster County, New-York, in 1811. He graduated at West Point in 1836 with high honors, and there being no active service for him, he resigned his position in the army soon after. About this time, the young Republic of Texas needed military assistance, and Col. PERRY accepted a position under Gen. HOUSTON -- then at the zenith of his glory. Under that distinguished man, be acted as aid at the bloody battle of San Jacinto, and participated in many of the subsequent struggles of the Taxans in establishing their independence. The object for which he entered the service of the ""Lone Star State"" having been accomplished -- its independence -- he resigned the commission he held and [???] his way northward. We next hour of him preparing for the ministry, and soon afterward he was ordained as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. His first charge was at Newfield, Conn.; and after that he was stationed at Madison, Conn.; Milburn, N.Y.; Sag Harbor, N.Y.; Bridgeport and Southport, Conn.; Mariner's Church, Cherry-street, New-York; Carleton-avenue Church, Brooklyn; Fleet-street Church, Waterbury, Conn.; Hansom-place, Brooklyn, and lastly the Pacific-street Church, Brooklyn. Seven years of his ministerial life were passed in this City. Two sons of deceased early gave their advices to their country. One perished at Bull Run, and the other is now an officer in the Forty-eighth Regiment. Col. PERRY was a man of fine presence and not only deserved but commanded respect. The members of his own regiment almost idolized him and yet he was one of the strictest disciplinarians in the whole army. His remains will be brought to this city for interment at an early day.

Ward School No. 48, under the charge of JAS. H. PARTRIDGE, Esq., recently made its first contribution to the wounded soldiers. The sufferers in the hospital corner of Fifty-first-street and Lexington-avenue were the glad recipients of this donation. Three large wagons were required to forward the packages of hospital shirts, linen lint, garments of every description, liniments, tea, coffee, larina, sugar, jellies, &c., &c., which were so generously supplied by the patriotic teachers and the boys and girls of this school. A large sum of money was also collected from the same source, and placed in the hands of the kind managers of the hospital. When the children visited the sufferers -- saw some of the terrible realities of war, and received the thanks of those noble sons of Union -- they exclaimed, with tearful eyes, truly, ""it is more blessed to give than to receive.""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/050b2b6f-fa96-5205-b552-03c5b095fbd3,1077,nyt://article/050b2b6f-fa96-5205-b552-03c5b095fbd3

The prospects are, that, whether or not cotton comes forward from the South this Summer, we are likely to get a respectable supply of sugar and molasses. A good part of the sugar raising region of Louisiana is already under control of our army and navy, and the planters are said to be not averse to exchanging for gold, their supplies of the saccharine staple -- though it is true that nearly all we have yet received was from stores on hand in New-Orleans. From the mouth of the Mississippi to Baton Rouge, there are many thousands of hogsheads of last year's [???] still on hand, and but very little of it has been destroyed; while the crops this year have been planted and cultivated, and will be gathered and undoubtedly sent to market as usual. Trade generally in the city, as we learn from our files received yesterday, is looking up. Quite a number of vessels were in port; nearly all the closed stores are reopened; and the curious fact is mentioned --it is a fact, not a joke -- that the laborers employed by Gen. BUTLER have succeeded in rooting out all the grass growing in the principal business streets.

GEORGE ROBERTS. So far as known, but two who were present at the time are now living. The occasion was celebrated with appropriate exercises in the church yesterday -- Methodists from all parts of the City flocking to participate. The church is the only edifice now standing erected by the Methodists in this City during the last century. The Society was the third of that denomination -- the John-street and Forsyth-street having preceded it. The morning services yesterday were conducted by Rev. Bishop JANES, the afternoon by Rev. J.B. WAKELY, and the evening by some of the old pastors, Rev. Mr. VAN DUZEN, Rev. Mr. DE VINNE, Rev. Mr. BATES and others. The afternoon and evening services were mainly a reunion of the old members and pastors. The entire exercises of the day were highly interesting, and the contributions realized over $500 in aid of the church, which is somewhat in debt, although its property is estimated to be worth about $100,000. The present pastor is Rev. Mr. LEWIS, who officiated in that capacity seven years since. He was last year located in Dutchess County. The present number of communicants is 240. The list has been as high as 800, but owing to the up-town exodus, many of the members and congregation have been obliged to connect themselves with other churches. Among the oldest communicants are Mrs. GEO. SHOTWELL, who joined in 1812, and J.B. OAKLEY, who joined in 1807. The latter gentleman -- the oldest male communicant -- was present yesterday.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; DUANE-STREET METHODIST CHURCH?SIXTYFIFTHS ANNIVERSARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; DUANE-STREET METHODIST CHURCH?SIXTYFIFTHS ANNIVERSARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ff87c12-bf96-5dc3-b9a2-960d91a58778,726,nyt://article/0ff87c12-bf96-5dc3-b9a2-960d91a58778

The work of burning began in South Carolina at the time of the possession of the Sea Islands by the United States forces; it has been continued since at every point in the cotton region penetrated by the National armies, and almost every day we have reports of new acts of incremation. An extract from a private letter from New-Orleans, published in our columns yesterday, stated that ""almost every bale of cotton in Louisiana and Mississippi is so placed that the torch can be and will be applied, if found necessary to save it from the hands of the 'enemy.'"" ""You may calculate safely,"" adds the writer, ""that if no more is destroyed, the growing crop will hardly more than equal the amount already burnt; and if hostilities cease, the coming Fall would find cotton only equal to one crop.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cotton Burning.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cotton Burning.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-06-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1758790e-c409-59d3-bbee-43c2adc67d27,888,nyt://article/1758790e-c409-59d3-bbee-43c2adc67d27

We have heretofore at various times described the Reservoir and appurtenances, but, in view of the near completion of the work, may recapitulate a few details. Our new Reservoir is one of the largest (if not the largest) natural ponds in the world. It is estimated to hold a thousand millions, or a billion, gallons of water -- enough to supply the entire City, at the present rate of consumption, for about a month. The amount of ground covered is about 106 acres, and the water surface 96 acres. It will vary in depth from 32 to 38 feet -- the shallowest part being the rock bottom. The lake extends from Eighty-5fth to Ninety-seventh streets, and from Fifth to Eighth avenues, the distance round it being over a mile and a half. The entire time of construction will be about three years, and the cost, including ground, (at an unprofessional guess) bill approximate $2,000,000. The Reservoir is divided into two equal portions by a stupendous wall traversing the entire length, so that either half may be used independent of the other -- when the greatest depth is attained, however, the centre wall will be covered, so that the lake will present an unbroken expanse. Even the empty bed, as it may at present be seen, affords a sight of really imposing grandeur.

Sharp skirmishing is of daily occurrence on our extreme left, but the results have not yet been fully developed. Several wounded in these affairs have arrived in the city, and report the enemy unwontedly pugnacious in that direction, although, from every indication, we are led to believe that their increasing appetite for slaughter will be more than fully satisfied ere many hours shall have passed over us. A few prisoners were brought into our lines yesterday and Monday, and from their reports it would seem that no preparations are yet perfected by the Federals for any ""onward to Richmond"" movement. It is possible LIBBY's warehouse will soon be honored by the arrival of a few hundred of the blue-coated gentry, and their greeting be far otherwise than as conquerors. From the interior of the enemy's lines we learn from recent arrivals that the depredations of the foe have been frequent, their bearing remarkably imperious and overbearing -- violent hands being laid upon every species of property, while aged inhabitants are daily subjected to harsh language and ill manners. Since Gen. STUART's visit to their rear the rancor and ill-breeding of LINCOLN's hirelings have been more than usually oppressive, their threats and taunts are increasing as to blackguardism, while the unprotected have no resort but patience and silent endurance. Indeed, Federal cavalry have been particularly active in and around Charles City, we hear; squads are patroling all the country in search of rebels and the disloyal; but up to the present their anxiety and industry have been of no avail, for the mounted rebels have thus far cleverly eluded all traps and search.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LATE NEWS FROM THE SOUTH.; Rebel Reports of Affairs near Richmond.
