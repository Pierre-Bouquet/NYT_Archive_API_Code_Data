We have submitted to us two sets of resolutions which are intended to express the sentiments of the people of the Slate of New-York for the guidance of Congress and the Federal Government as to the financial policy to be adopted in carrying on the war during the present year. One of these series of resolutions comes to us with the high prestige of a report from the Committee on Ways and Means; the other is offered as a substitute by an individual member of this House. I can easily understand that it is the disposition of every member to acquiesce in the form given to this expression of opinion by the Committee without hesitation. And if any one on this floor has a special reason for wishing to sustain that Committee and adopt, without hesitation, whatever it may report, certainly I am in that position. But yet reasons may present themselves to my mind strong enough to convince me that, either through haste or misconception, the Committee may not at all times adopt the best mode of expressing the sentiments of the people of this State. That happens to be my conviction in reference to the resolutions that have been offered by the Committee on the subject of our national finances. I prefer the resolutions offered by the gentleman from Tioga (Mr. TRACKY) and shall endeavor to give the grounds of that preference.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NATIONAL FINANCES.; Remarks of Mr. Raymond, in the New-York Assembly, on the 28th inst., upon the FinancialResolutions reported by the Committee ofWays and Means, and in Reply to Mr. Hulburd,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NATIONAL FINANCES.; Remarks of Mr. Raymond, in the New-York Assembly, on the 28th inst., upon the FinancialResolutions reported by the Committee ofWays and Means, and in Reply to Mr. Hulburd,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/03a04dd7-a300-5d16-b236-6258a45f0b7f,8941,nyt://article/03a04dd7-a300-5d16-b236-6258a45f0b7f

England, it is claimed, has ""by a salutary display of firmness and force brought us to our senses!"" There is something provokingly comic in the pompous, irresistible, jubilant air of these writers, which is all the more piquant from their own serene unconsciousness of the buffoonery of their intemperate carnival. The British people, or at least a fragmentary dominant section of them, are, it seems, so ecstatic with triumph, so intoxicated with self-complacency at their marvelous success in ""teaching the Yankees a lesson,"" as to forget that England has herself received one. We have no wish to disturb Mr. Bull in any of his exuberant little excesses. They can do no harm except to himself; while they undoubtedly afford amusement to his neighbors. But if he will now, as inevitably he must, make up his mind peacefully to forego the absurd and unrighteous belligerent powers over neutral merchant vessels on the high seas, against which we have just given the most emphatic reclamation which any people ever had it in their power to pronounce, he may, without the slightest umbrage to us, allow the frantic war chiefs of his venal Press to sound imaginary alarms, and dream of impossible victories; sow the seeds of discord, revel in mad visions of bloodshed, and inflate the childish bubbles of national vanity to their heart's content. The public opinion of Europe and of this country will, however, refuse to judge the intelligent masses of the English people by the hired ravings of a corrupt insensate Press. And, as for ourselves, we have the gratification of knowing that, in our solution of the Trent difficulty, wo have not only acted in conformity with our national honor, and given a new force and a wider range to the principles of international law, advocated by FRANKLIN, JEFFERSON, MADISON, CLAY, and all out leading statesmen, but have found ourselves, without a war, able to obtain for this country and for Europe just and honorable concessions, such as no war, however costly, has ever yet been able to wrest from Great Britain. In this object we have the sympathy of France. Russia, also, with Austria, Prussia and Belgium, have espoused the same good cause; and the present temper of the great Powers of Europe is such, that either by special treaties, or preferably by an international Congress, the diplomatic victory we have won will certainly be made so decisive, that hereafter, in time of war, the interests of commerce will receive more complete protection, and the exclusive privileges of an arrogant naval Power, over neutral vessels at sea, will be for ever exploded.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LESSONS FROM THE SURRENDER', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LESSONS FROM THE SURRENDER', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12cbc561-4b11-544d-8b42-4556851e3930,463,nyt://article/12cbc561-4b11-544d-8b42-4556851e3930

The case of the British vessel Eugenia Smith was referred to in the response of the British Secretary to Mr. SEWARD's answer in the Trent business, as naturally to be governed by the precedent thus established. But it appears that the intimation had not been awaited at the State Department. Simultaneously with the release of SLIDELL and MASON, Mr. SEWARD intimated to Lord LYONS that Messrs. ZACHARIE and ROGERS, American citizens removed from the Eugenia Smith, under suspicions similar to those which prompted the act of Capt. WILKES, would be at once discharged from Fort Lafayette, and permitted to return to their homes in the South. With equal readiness, and without delaying for a formal application for redress, one or two minor irregularities arising from the blockade, were arranged to the satisfaction of Lord LYONS; so that on the last day of 1861 every international question pending between this Government and that of England was fully and perfectly settled.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SQUARING ACCOUNTS WITH ENGLAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SQUARING ACCOUNTS WITH ENGLAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73fcf8f3-0761-5d4c-9812-c8e6a62b506f,288,nyt://article/73fcf8f3-0761-5d4c-9812-c8e6a62b506f

Editorial proposes future strategy for war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/01/archives/an-important-strategical-plan.html,Editorial proposes future strategy for war,"An eminent military authority of this country, has recently prepared some carefully considered strategical views of the campaign, which have been laid before members of Congress, and, we believe, also before the War Department. This gentleman, in opposition to the received opinion, takes the ground, not only that no ""Advance from Washington"" is intended; but that none ought to be made, if it were practicable. The only results, he states, of Gen. McCELLAN's forcing the rebels from their intrenchmenls, would be the occupation of Richmond -- a barren and unimportant triumph -- and the retreat of the Confederate forces by various roads to the South and Southwest; they at the same time, destroying bridges and railroads behind them and sweeping the country clear of forage and supplies. All that the South would lose by the retreat would be the ground of Virginia, while our armies could not pursue the retreating enemy. Their military power would be unimpraired, and they could soon collect a new army from the heart of their territory. Washington, therefore, he considers the worst feasible base of military operations against the South. ""The true military principle,"" he says, "" requires that a base of operations be selected as near as possible to the heart of the enemy's country, and from which the lines of movements upon the decisive points shall be as short as possible."" Our object should be to advance immediately, and on such a line as to conduct to the heart of the rebellious States, gaining a position where, with a large army, we can prevent the enemy's forces from concentrating, and can strike them in detail, at the same time cutting the Confederacy in two.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Important Strategical Plan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Important Strategical Plan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4b2932e-0cf7-5b01-b14f-79b996cc9b7b,1089,nyt://article/e4b2932e-0cf7-5b01-b14f-79b996cc9b7b

The resentment and jealousy of the British people had been aroused by the indignity offered their flag. There was a valid ground of war. It was impossible, without a powerful and indeed extraordinary reason, to take part with the Pro-Slavery South against the free North. It would never answer for the champions of civilization to become the champions of Slavery. But the Trent business was a direct question with which no difficulty about the odiousness of alliances had to do. Practically, England would be aiding the South; in form, it would be vindicating its own honor, intolerably outraged, against an insolent and an impenitent offender. But the opportunity, thanks to the good sense of the American ""mob,"" and the prudence of the American Government, was destroyed by Mr. SEWARD's dispatch of Dec. 26, and the subsequent redress of other minor complaints of Her Majesty's Government; and, armed to the teeth and ready to strike the blow that should end the American controversy, the British Ministry was suddenly bound over to keep the peace.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/02/archives/gradation-of-the-animal-kingdom.html,,"The second lecture of the series was given at the Brooklyn Institute on Sunday evening, Jan. 26. The subject of the relative standing or gradation of the animal kingdom, said Prof. A., is one which has long engaged the attention of naturalists, and the favorite idea has been that there is an unbroken natural chain from the lowest to the highest -- ""from the Monad to Man,"" as the phrase is. This theoretical view, upon severe and careful scrutiny, has been found to be not true, as stated, but yet the investigation has led to the discovery of an actual gradation within certain limits in different classes of animals. The discovery of the existence of four great plans of structure gave this theory a check, but it has since revived again under the question of the origin of species. Prior to the knowledge of the four plans it was evident to naturalists and philosophers that man was superior to the rest of the animal creation especially in the development of the brain. It was shown by KAEMPFER that the ourang-outang came nearest to man, and the natural conclusion was that there was a gradual descent from air-breathing to aquatic animals, such as whales (erroneously supposed to be fishes,) and thence to gill-breathing fishes. With reference to the lower orders of creation, it seemed unnecessary to pursue the theory which appeared to be so plain among the higher beings; but it was supposed that the same gradation would be found below, and then the bulk of the lower animals were reduced in this view to a few types. Worms were supposed to form some connecting link with snails, eels, and elongated vertebrates; and then shell-fish were erroneously associated with worms, and microscopical animals were considered as mere animal globules capable of sustaining existence. Thus the series was supposed to be established of one unique series from the Monad to Man. But, in attempting to campelt this series, difficulties began to arise, until at lenght the conviction prevailed, that instead of one there were many series; and the question was, what are the limits of those series? It was necessary to consider some of the facts bearing upon the question before proceeding to consider the order and succession in which beings have been introduced upon the earth, For of the two theories now entertained, viz.: Either that all animal species have been developed from the lowest to the highest, one from the other, or that they have all been created as they are. One or the other must be false. And if we have no unique series from the lower to the higher, then the first theory becomes less probable than it otherwise would appear. But the consideration of this question necesarily involves the consideration of the classification of animals, and I will begin with the Vertebrates. Before I proceed at once, however to the question, I may, perhaps, make the nature of the investigation more clear by introducing a comparison from the study of language. Take the common word ""father."" In the Latin and Greek it is ""pater;"" in the Italian ""padre;"" in the German ""vater,"" and in the French ""pere."" Now a law has been detected by the German philologists, in the gradual transformation of letters, which is as unerring as any other law of nature. It is found that the hard letters have, in the course of time, softened. Thus b, p and ph, which are equal to for v in pronunciation, have succeeded each other very much in the same manner as d, t and th, or as g, k and ch. Thus the Greek and Latin ""pater"" becomes, in the Gothic, ""phthar;"" in the Italian ""padre;"" in the German, ""vater,"" in the French, ""pore,"" and in the English ""father."" So it is impossible to mistake the genitive connection of these words. And you may carry the investigation still further into the study of animals.

The thieves sat beside Mrs. SIDNEY in one of the Dry Dock stages, and when they arrived in the neighborhood of Chatham-square, she discovered her loss, and at once gave the alarm. Both of the accused parties pulled the strap and sprang toward the door of the stage, but the lady was too quick for them. She closed the door and held it fast, at the same time crying loudly for the Police. Fortunately, there were a couple of those officials in the immediate vicinity, who came to her relief. In the meantime the culprits alighted from the vehicle, and ran in different directions. Then began a chase of a very exciting character, and to those who witnessed it considerably amusing. RADIHAN threw the lady's purse into an area, as he was running, doubtless hoping thereby to divert the attention of his pursuer for a few moments. They were both soon taken into custody, however, and upon searching them, there were found upon the person of RADIHAN, the sum of $98 folded in small pieces of paper, and concealed in different parts of his clothing.

Our late London files contain communications from correspondents of an antiquarian turn of mind, detailing various cases of the kind they have turned up in the course of their reading, and proving that England has repeatedly practiced the sinking of stone-laden vessels as a means of obstructing an enemy's ports. We have already cited in these columns several of the instances mentioned by the London correspondents, but there are two now cases quoted that are new and particularly pat. The first is the case of Alexandria. On the evacuation of the city and port, and the embarkation of the British troops, in 1807 five vessels laden with stone were sunk in the narrow passage by which the English squadron, under command of Admiral LEWIS had entered, and then sailed, concluding that it would be the last exit of any vessel from the port -- erroneously, however, as has subsequently appeared. The other instance is the choking up of the entrance of Doulogne harbor in 1804, and the following piece of diplomatic correspondence in the matter has a great historic interest. It is the official letter of instructions from Lord HOBART to ""Sir A.S.

FRY was in the act of leading his regiment into a charge upon the Mississippians, when Gen. ZOLLICOFFER, accompanied by his aid, rode up to him and said, ""You are not going to fight your friends, are you? These men (pointing to the Mississippians) are all your friends."" In the meantime ZOLLICOFFER's aid fired upon Col. FRY, wounding his horse, from which wound the animal died. Col. FRY then turned and fired upon ZOLLICOFFER with fatal effect. Gen. Z. evidently labored under the impression that Col. FRY was a rebel officer. The stories about the old intimacy of the two officers are all untrue. They had never met before, nor did Col. FRY know the rank of the officer upon whom he fired, as the evidences of his rank were covered by a cloak which Gen. ZOLLICOFFER wore in battle.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LETTER FROM COL.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/03/archives/the-army-and-navy.html,,"There were a few applicants at the General Service recruiting offices last week, of whom four were enlisted, and the rest rejected, on examination by the Surgeon, who, very property, will not pass any man who does not appear likely to stand the fatigue and hardship incident to active service. About fourteen men were enlisted for the Fifth Artillery, the Corps of Engineers, and the Eighth, Eleventh and Twelfth Infantry. Several boys were sent to Governor's Island on trial, to learn the fife and drum. The company of music boys, who are quartered in the South Battery, now numbers about one hundred and twelve enlisted, and fifteen on trial. Twenty-eight more will have to be enlisted before the company reaches the strength fixed by the War Department. During the whole of the Winter the sleeping accommodations provided for the citizen boys on trial, have been of the worst description. The South Battery was not large enough for the number of boys on the Island, and the ten-pin-alley, a long, low, wooden structure, was set apart as a dormitory for the boys on trial, and such of the enlisted boys as could not find room in the battery. The citizen boys were not provided with even one blanket, and those who were not fortunate enough to obtain a share of the other boys' blankets, had to sleep without any other covering than their ordinary clothes. There was only one serviceable stove in the ten-pin-alley, and the place was infested with rats; the comfort of sleeping there may therefore be easily imagined. It is only right to say, that the Sergeant in charge of the boys -- an old soldier of thirty-five years' experience -- is not responsible for this state of things; but it is also only right that attention should be called to it, and that boys who are sent on trial should be treated with some little consideration.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ARMY AND NAVY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ARMY AND NAVY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78fd1926-a3f9-5c78-afdf-673d607fdbef,577,nyt://article/78fd1926-a3f9-5c78-afdf-673d607fdbef

"-- There can be no doubt that the object of the naval movements and operations at the mouth of the Savannah River, reported to us by the rebels, is to prepare the way for the capture of the City of Savannah. There are two ways of reaching the city by water -- one by going directly up the Savannah River, which route is strongly defended by Fort Pulaski, and the other by threading round the waterway, between the islands in the rear of Fort Pulaski, and emerging into the river above the fort, or else by landing at the hamlet of Bonaventure, and marching thence to the city without entering the Savannah River at all -- the latter of which routes would be quite impracticable from the fact that the road passes through a swampy country, and might be easily defended by a few guns.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/03/archives/the-president-on-the-war.html,,"-- The Hon. Mr. DIVEN, a member of Congress from this State, in a letter written for publication, and which will be found in another column, says that the President stated the other day in his presence that there was probably but one man in the country more anxious for a battle than himself, and that man was McClellan. ""The President repudiated, in words of withering rebuke, the charge that he, or Mr. SEWARD, or Gen. MCCLELLAN, were tampering or delaying, out of any consideration for rebels or rebel institutions, or that they indulged any thought of ending the war by any means other than conquest on the battle-field."" The first of these statements is particularly gratifying at this moment, when the nation feels somewhat impatient and disheartened at the long inaction of our mighty army on the Potomac; and in his theory of the means and mode of ending the war, also, the President shows that his convictions are in accord with those of the entire country. The masterly inactivity which some have represented as the fixed policy of the General Commanding, is thus authentically repudiated; and the charge of trifling or playing with so monstrous a thing as this rebellion, on the part of the responsible conservatives of the Government, is put at rest by the President himself. He knows, as well as any one else, that nothing but hard, sharp, quick, overwhelming blows against this rebellion will ever restore unity or peace to the nation; and with him in this opinion the Cabinet and the Generals whom he has appointed entirely agree. Having this belief, there can be no doubt that the blows will be dealt as soon as it is possible to deal them. Those semi-Secessionists who abuse Congress, and the Press, and the army, and the great body of the people, for their strong desire for active operations, should turn their criticism upon the President and the General-in-Chief command; for there is but one man in the country more anxious for a battle than the President, and that man is Gen.

But accident has prevented any such rashness, and necessity, if nothing else, has led the Senator to profess the most fervent fidelity to Law and Constitution, and his fellow-committeemen attest the zeal with which he promotes every measure tributary to the suppression of the rebellion. The case may therefore be treated, so far as the simple question of loyalty is concerned, as admirably balanced.

DAVIS' Government will be put to a severe strain this month during which the term of enlistment of a considerable proportion of the men now in the Confederate camps will expire. The rebel leaders, accordingly, are looking with some trepidation to the chances of inducing them to reenlist, or, failing in that, to the means of raising another levy for their army as numerous as that which they have had in the field for some months past. It is a somewhat complex question, and depends in great measure on our own action what solution it shall receive. We are very far from sharing the illusion of some that the Southern army is destined to ""melt like snow"" at the expiration of the term of enlistment, and yet there is not the smallest doubt that we can give things such a turn as to make the raising of another Southern army an impossibility. The rebel leaders themselves are not without serious apprehensions. ""It were foolhardy and unwise,"" says the Memphis Appeal of the 16th of January ""to conceal the fact that the profoundest statesmen in the Confederacy entertain great apprehensions on the subject of reenlistment, involving, as we believe, results pregnant with weal or woe to the Confederacy."" It seems, however, that, to begin with, they are going to try the persuasive power of eloquence -- in which the South has always had immense faith. Accordingly, the Southern journals are just now filled with eloquent ""Appeals,"" a number of which we published yesterday, calling on the troops to reenlist, and couched in the extraordinary language which Southern journals are fond of employing. ""When the necessities of the Government become known,"" exclaims a Richmond journal, ""and the fact is understood that their country now appeals to them for their services as sole conservators of the national ark that has been rescued from the polluting hands of a Vandal enemy, will our volunteer soldiers [???] to respond? ""Twere a base calumny [???] patriotism, if it is not high treason, to [???] the suspicion that they would not."" And yet it is perfectly obvious that the suspicion is ""harbored."" It is in the same spirit that the Virginia Legislature has lately passed a resolution stating that they ""do not doubt the readiness of the Virginia volunteers to continue their present organization, when assured that this further sacrifice for their country is earnestly desired by the General Assembly to aid in repulsing our insolent invader,"" &c., &c.; but, at the same time, prudently adding a clause demanding that they shall reenlist. The seductive power of eloquence is also tried directly on the army, and the Southern camps resound with clangorous appeals from the commanders to their soldiers, couched in such ludicrous terms as to give one a strange impression of the men to whom such hortations can be seriously addressed. Judging from the fortune of Gen. BRAGG, however, the success of these martial monitions is not very promising. His ""appeal"" was of the very highest pressure, and yet he has been compelled to give up the best of his troops from their disinclination to reenlist.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Army--Re-enlistments, and How to Prevent Them.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Army--Re-enlistments, and How to Prevent Them.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ec235bd8-cc08-5c3b-94b9-d502c80d35c5,948,nyt://article/ec235bd8-cc08-5c3b-94b9-d502c80d35c5

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/04/archives/the-transit-of-british-troopsmaine-versus-the-united-states.html,,"The announcement, made last month, that the Cabinet at Washington had telegraphed permission for the British troops, then on their way to Canada, to land at Portland, Maine, and go forward by the Grand Trunk Railroad, seems to have been specially distasteful to the Senate of Maine. Accordingly that body instructed Gov. WASHBURNE to open a correspondence with Secretary SEWARD, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact truth in the matter. This correspondence, though relating to a question which has itself grown obsolete, has yet an intrinsic historical interest, and it will be found in full elsewhere. To the inquiry of Gov. WASHBURNE, Mr. SEWARD answers in the affirmative, and states that, he was influenced in the matter by the consideration that much suffering and risk, through the snow and ice of a Northerly Canadian voyage, might he spared the troops by allowing them to pass through the territory of the United States by that line of railway communication which British enterprise has extended to the fine seaport of Portland. The principle upon which this concession was made to Great Britain is, that ""when humanity, or even convenience, renders it desirable for one nation to have a passage of its troops and munitions through the territory of another, it is a customary act of comity to grant it, if it can be done consistently with its own safety and welfare."" And he cites as a parallel instance the privilege which the United States continually enjoy of transporting troops upon the Panama Railroad, across the territory of the Republic of New-Granada. To have withheld, at this time, an act of comity which would have been cheerfully granted at any other, would, Mr. SEWARD forcibly argues, have been simply to show that our Government mistrusted the assurances of friendship and respect it was then receiving from the Government of Great Britain.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Transit of British Troops-Maine versus the United States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Transit of British Troops-Maine versus the United States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e407017-3aa2-5914-b1c8-83f097d3a245,542,nyt://article/3e407017-3aa2-5914-b1c8-83f097d3a245

Of those who rank among thesecond and third classes, there have been some extremelyfavorable specimens; and it would not be libelous,perhaps, to say that we have done better thanmost countries, with baritones of the fourth class.Our thrift, indeed, with this voice, has rather annoyedthe public, and to this circumstance may be ascribedthe addition to Mr. GRAU's company effected in theperson of Signor YPOLITO. It is something, decidedlyin this gentleman's favor that he belonged to Mr. MAXMARETZEK's opera troupe, for the irrepressible MAXwas never known to engage a singer who did not possessat least an abundant voice.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/04/archives/englands-cotton-prospectsdistress-of-her-operatives.html,,"We published yesterday a valuable letter, from an esteemed Manchester correspondent, which gives a luminous view of the state of things in the cotton districts of England, and of her prospects touching an adequate supply of the indispensable staple. After all, the Calcutta Englishman has proved a better prophet than the London Times. It has at last become evident that the British mill- owners have no chance of obtaining a sufficiency of cotton from India for the present season. Whether the contrary will be the case in the remote future, remains to he seen; but for the supply of immediate wants, the British manufacturer need not look to England's Oriental dependency. Nor does India's failure to meet the pressing demands of the Liverpool market arise so much from inability as from indisposition. The Hindoo planter will not enter extensively into the cultivation of cotton, unless a monopoly of the British custom and remunerative prices be guaranteed to him. These, however, are conditions which the British dealer is not inclined to accept. He still prefers the American article whenever he can get it, and objects to paying the Indian merchant the same price for a commodity containing twenty-five per cent. of dirt, that he pays for the well- prepared and superior product of the South. ""Handle and clean your crop properly,"" says Mr. Bull to the Hindoo, ""and you shall receive its full value."" But the Hindoo thinks that a person in Mr. B.'s circumstances should not be over nice, and therefore insists on having dirt and all purchased from him! Now, great as are Brother John's necessities, he will not submit to be thus imposed on, and so cotton cultivation languishes in India, and the home market has no chance of an adequate supply thence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""England's Cotton Prospects--Distress of Her Operatives."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""England's Cotton Prospects--Distress of Her Operatives."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc8eac34-ff19-59f3-b6b0-3a9c9a263f86,650,nyt://article/dc8eac34-ff19-59f3-b6b0-3a9c9a263f86
"We re ceive this morning, by way of Hampton Roads and Washington, an echo from the cannonading at the point, or points, at which Gen. BURNSIDE seems to have commenced operations. The Captain of a vessel, ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/04/archives/from-the-burnside-expedition.html,,"We re ceive this morning, by way of Hampton Roads and Washington, an echo from the cannonading at the point, or points, at which Gen. BURNSIDE seems to have commenced operations. The Captain of a vessel, which has arrived from the coast of North Carolina, reports that on Tuesday - a week ago to-day - he heard heavy firing in the rear of Beaufort, N C.. and again, two days after, as he proceeded northward, he heard heavy firing in the direction of Roanoke Island. If this firing was from our fleet, as it certainly must have been, it would seem that Gen. BURNSIDE after getting his vessels safely within Hatteras Inlet, had divided his fleet into two bodies, one of which was dispatched southward and the other northward, and operations had been begun in both directions at the points indicated in the dispatch. We may have to wait a day or two yet to learn what success attended our action; for it is unlikely we will receive any definite or reliable information until a dispatch boat arrives from our fleet. Appearances indicate, however, that the action was unfavorable to the rebels, for the last passenger who arrived at Fortress Monroe (on Friday last, two days after the last mentioned firing) from the South by flag of of truce was accompanied from Richmond by a detective, who was instructed not to allow him to carry any papers with him, or to hold any communication with anybody on his way. It was the man's belief, from what he saw, that something had occurred which it was not desirable should be known here.

"A gentleman, living twenty-two miles south of the late battle-field at Mill Spring, on the main road leading South, gave me quite an interesting account of the flight of the rebels, and the manner in which they conducted themselves while in Wayne and Clinton counties, which I now furnish you. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/04/archives/the-victory-in-kentucky-rout-of-the-rebels.html,,"A gentleman, living twenty-two miles south of the late battle-field at Mill Spring, on the main road leading South, gave me quite an interesting account of the flight of the rebels, and the manner in which they conducted themselves while in Wayne and Clinton counties, which I now furnish you. My informant resides in Wayne County, and remained at [???] during the time the rebels occupied that part of the State. He is a reliable gentleman of good sense. He says the Confederates had about 10,000 infantry, well provided with guns, but of an indifferent quality -- squirrel rifles and flint-lock muskets principally; 2,000 cavalry, well drilled and well armed, and quite efficient, all of them being armed with guns and pistols, 18 pieces of cannon, 16 brass pieces, and two Parrot guns. The rebels admitted that they were completely routed, and that Gen. ZOLLICOFFER was killed. On their way back to Tennessee, there were fractional parts of brigades, going in a body, and with some order, but the remainder were going in squads of from one to twenty-five or more. They passed informant's house with about 125 two-horse wagons, and four pieces of artillery, under Gen. G.B. CRITTENDEN, and he was said to be [???]. They were throwing, away everything that impeded their flight, and were selling blankets at $1 25 apiece, and pistols (navy revolvers) at $6 and $7, in Tennessee or Georgia money. He says that about 500 cavalry went back on horses, the remainder were either captured, killed, or lost -- at least one-third of the men who went back were without guns or anything else, the other two-thirds had their guns, and some of them other articles; all of them were in great haste to get along, and committed no depredations on their return, other than to take horses, or mules, or something to eat. So hungry were they, that they actually eat the soap grease that his mother had laid aside to make soap. The rebels say that they lost in killed, drowned and missing, from 700 to 1,500. A large number were drowned in crossing the Cumberland River, and this is attested by other persons seeing their bodies below Mill Spring in the river. BALLIE PEYTON, Jr., was also killed in the fight, and is now at Somerset. JAS. S. CRISMAN was a candidate for the rebel Congress, and had his handbills out a few days before the fight. He left with the rebels, his family being at Sparta, in Tennessee. The flight of the rebels was so precipitate, that no election was held in Wayne County, on the 22d inst., (the time fixed for electing rebel Congressmen.) SHELBY [???], Jr., late member of the Legislature from Wayne County, was wounded in a skirmish a few days before the battle and is now lying dangerously, [???] not fatally, wounded at Dr. LONG's in Clinton County; the general opinion is that he has ""his Tights"" to his heart's content. He was making up a company of cavalry at the time he was wounded. The rebels lost from 6 to 10 a day with sickness, during their stay in Kentucky. A large number of those who were in the fight said they were going home to stay there, and none of them would reenlist at the expiratioa of their term of service -- all, or nearly all of them being twelve months recruits, their time will expire in February, March and April, 1862. They took large quantities of corn, wheat, &c., while in Wayne and Clinton, but generally paid for it in Tennessee, Virginia or Georgia money, or Confederate scrip. Quite a number of the leading Secessionists left with them from Monticello and other parts of Wayne County. They left perhaps, 100 troops in Wayne and Clinton, who are, or have been, sick or wounded. Clinton and Wayne Counties are now clear of Confederate soldiers, who are able to do mischief, and great is the rejoicing of the Union men of those counties.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE VICTORY IN KENTUCKY.; ROUT OF THE REBELS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE VICTORY IN KENTUCKY.; ROUT OF THE REBELS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df669c9c-c38b-53a5-be12-9af85dc514c2,776,nyt://article/df669c9c-c38b-53a5-be12-9af85dc514c2

Editorial on Gen. Halleck reguiring oath of allegiance from citizens of Missouri,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/05/archives/swearing-the-rebels.html,Editorial on Gen. Halleck reguiring oath of allegiance from citizens of Missouri,"Gen. HALLECK is evidently determined to ""swear"" every rebe in Missouri. A short time ago the Secessionists in the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce thought they had achieved a triumph over the Union members by electing officers of their own ilk for the year; but no sooner had the rebels and semi-rebels been elected to their places, than the whole of them president, secretary, directors and all the other officers -- were peremptorily required to take the most stringent oath of allegiance, under penalty -- if they attempted to exercise their functions -- of being arrested for contempt, and punished according to the laws of war. At the same time, the president, secretary, librarian, directors, and other officers of the Mercantile Association, were required to follow the same course, or be punished in the same penalties. In our last issue again we published another order from the same source, dated at St. Louis, requiring the President, Professors and Curators of the University of Missouri to subscribe to the oath of allegiance, and if any one failed to do so, and yet attempted to exercise his official functions' he should be tried and punished as for a military offence. �The institution,� says Gen HALLECK, �having been endowed by the Government of the United States, its funds should not be used to teach treason or to instruct traitors.� And the authorities of the University are advised to expel from its walls all persons who, by word or deed, favor, assist or abet the rebellion. The Presidents and Directors of all Railroad Companies, are also required, under penalty, to take the oath. Neither must they employ any conductor, engineer, station-master, agent, or any other employe, who has not taken the oath. No contract will be made by Quartermasters with any man until he shall have taken the oath. All clerks, agents and employes in the service in that Department, must take the oath; and any officer who shall keep in employ any man who has not been sworn, shall be arrested and tried. All clergymen, professors, teachers, and, indeed, all the white men in Missouri, are requested by Gen. HALLECK to come forward at once, and attest their allegiance to the Government, so that they may be known and recognized, and distinguished from rebels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SWEARING THE REBELS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SWEARING THE REBELS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ed2f031-5e0a-5497-be40-1eb4e5c372ed,611,nyt://article/5ed2f031-5e0a-5497-be40-1eb4e5c372ed

The alarm was given, and upon the boat being stopped, the ferry hands succeeded in rescuing the man in an insensible condition, who proved to be GEORGE R. BRETTELL, an English locksmith doing business at No. 114 1/2 Newark-avenue, Jersey City. BRETTELL was taken home by Chief of Police MARINUS, and Dr. ZABRISEIE was called in and finally succeeded in saving his life. A few evenings since BRETTELL was found lying insensible in the street by Officer BRADLEY, and upon being taken home it was discovered that he had swallowed laudanum. Some time since BRETTELL cut his throat, but the skill of a surgeon saved his life.

His speech of Mon day excites the warmest commendation. It not only grasps the whole emergency of the Treasury, but points out the sufficient reasons why the United States Notes and Funded Loans of the Government should not be left unguarded by the authority of a legal tender, or unprotected by the most ample taxation. The distinction between the use of plain Treasury paper for the prosecution of a foreign war and a struggle against domestic rebellion, is forcibly drawn, and the presence among us of an indifferent or disloyal feeling to defeat the healthy and vigorous exercise of the public credit, more than hinted at. In this he is backed by the declaration of the Secretary of the Treasury, that but for the already developed inclination of some of our bank people to discredit the United States Notes, now in use, without the stamp of legal tender, thereby creating an unjust and most damaging discrimination against others who give this currency a generous and public-spirited support, the authority of the Government need not have been exercised to give the additional issue of $100,000,000 a uniform validity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title; The Ways and Means.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title; The Ways and Means.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Currency', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dda6afbc-737c-5cdc-a80e-cdaa0eb1151a,1261,nyt://article/dda6afbc-737c-5cdc-a80e-cdaa0eb1151a

Fragments of the report and of the testimony have already been given to the public; but as these were evidently published so as to expose the crimes of some men and to conceal those of others, and as, because they were but fragments of the evidence given they were necessarily unjust, we have refrained from giving any of it publicity until the whole of the report and the testimony was before us. In this volume we have all the evidence so far as it has yet been taken. The Committee, however, announce that they have a large amount of material still on hand, which will be made the subject of a further report; and as the work of the Committee in investigating contracts is still going on, and is likely to be kept up as long as the war lasts, or until contractors and agents become indisputably honest, it is likely that we will be furnished with a library of corrupt reading, which, next to the history of this bloody rebellion itself, will strike posterity with horror at the awful wickedness of the present generation. The document, and the exposures contained in it might have a certain kind of speculative and anatomical interest if the rebellion were crushed out and victory had perched upon our banner; but at the present crisis of the Republic, such disclosures are painful and dreadful, and produce a feeling of public indignation which would justify the most summary measures against the knaves whose villany is here dragged into daylight.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS; THE FRAUDS OF THE CONTRACTORS, Full and Authentic Digest of the Report of the Van Wyek Investigating Committee.

"The West Indian, a vessel belonging to a Southern planter merchant, has arrived at Liverpool direct from Charleston, having, successfully run the blockade. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/06/archives/american-topics-at-large-arrival-of-another-confederate-vessel-the.html,,"The West Indian, a vessel belonging to a Southern planter merchant, has arrived at Liverpool direct from Charleston, having, successfully run the blockade. The owner of the West Indian and her cargo, (who came from Charleston with the vessel,) and Capt. FOOTE, informed our Liverpool correspondent that the blockade of the port of Charleston is anything but effectual, and that the ""granite blockade,"" so far from stopping the entrance to the port, will eventually deepen the shallow channels. On this point the Charlestonians are confident, and therefore the sinking of the granite fleet gives them but little uneasiness. The West Indian is 241 tons burthen, and has a full cargo of spirits of turpentine. She left Charleston in the evening of the 24th December. It was a fine starlight night, and with a favorable wind, the blockade was run, without meeting with any of the blockading squadron. The West Indian left Charleston after the stone fleet had been sunk, and ran down to the sea through one of the channels left open by the Federals. Mr. PHINIZEY, the owner of the vessel and freight, is a resident of Savannah; and as he frequently traveled between that port and Charleston, states that he himself saw the plantations on fire. It is the fixed determination, he says, of the planters to burn their cotton sooner than it should fall into the hands of the Yankees. All the plantations about Port Royal have been destroyed; and with the exception of a few hundred bales of cotton which have been gathered by the Unionists, and which is uncleaned, there is scarcely a bale of good cotton about the place. Charleston was well defended, and the number of troops between that city and Savannah was about forty thousand men, under the command of Gen. LEE. Reinforcements also continued to arrive at the different points of defence. Savannah is in the best possible state of defence. The blockade of Mobile is said to be a regular farce. Vessels run regularly between that port and Havana. From Mobile the vessels engaged in the trade carry Southern produce, and on their arrival at Havana their cargoes are transhipped on board neutral vessels, and forwarded to England. The Southern vessels then take on board arms, ammunition, and other necessaries for the Southern army, and run back to Mobile. This trade is carried on with impunity, and one commercial house in Havana, which is also connected with a well-known Liverpool firm, has three vessels engaged in this trade. Coffee, tea, sugar, salt, boots, and shoes, &c. -- indeed all the common luxuries of life -- are exceedingly scarce and dear in nearly all the Southern cities.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN TOPICS AT LARGE; ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER CONFEDERATE VESSEL.

Editorial on Southern blockade effects on France,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/06/archives/foreign-intervention-france-and-the-blockade.html,Editorial on Southern blockade effects on France,"The settlement of the little account opened by Capt. WILKES unhappily left an unadjusted balance. The blockade is an international question. It is regulated by principles of maritime law, which, vague and unsatisfactory as they are, constitute the only code to which nations are at liberty to appeal, and which, if administered by a combination of the leading Powers of the world, must control the will and action of any individual State. There is no doubt that the blockade of the Southern ports has been a cause of serious damage to the two leading commercial nations of Europe. What evils it has really inflicted upon them they estimate at the full value; but the real source of complaint and indignation springs from an absurd exaggeration of the value of the rebel States as a market for their commodities; and this, in turn, arises from the mistake of supposing that all the demand for the products of French and English workshops, which the war has suspended, came from Southern customers; whereas nothing is better understood here than that it is to Northern economy, not to the Southern blockade, this diminution of traffic is attributable. In France, and especially in provincial France, there is an imperfect understanding of the American question; and an erroneous impression that the idleness and prostration of French industry is due to the perseverance of the American Government in a policy which cannot and ought not to succeed, and which only threatens to block the wheels of the world's progress for an indefinite period. We have alluded now and again to the representations of this character addressed to the Imperial Government by the various local Chambers of Commerce. They all invoke the interference of the Emperor to stop the conflict, dwelling pathetically upon the sufferings of the population heretofore dependent upon their several centres of industry, owing to the blockade. To such addresses the Emperor cannot be insensible. These are the most influential bodies in the Empire. They speak the sentiments of millions. They guide the opinions of the Legislative Chamber. They typify that middle class, which in France holds the balance of power between Legitimacy and Red Republicanism. It would be most impolitic for NAPOLEON III. to treat the wishes of these people with disregard; and we cannot doubt that in permitting the Corps Legislatif to discuss the question at the opening of their annual session, the Emperor has shrewdly yielded to a current of public feeling which it would be dangerous to encounter.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Foreign Intervention France and the Blockade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Foreign Intervention France and the Blockade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d73c5a7d-36d5-5fa4-93b3-dd610ec03a62,872,nyt://article/d73c5a7d-36d5-5fa4-93b3-dd610ec03a62

HOWELL COBB was selected to preside over its sessions. A year ago, and after the experiment of a twelvemonth, we have a report of HOWELL COBB, in conjunction with ROBERT TOOMBS, THOMAS COBB and MARTIN CRAWFORD, as to the progress made by the rebellion, and the degree of encouragement these leaders of Georgian sentiment are enabled to hold out as to the prospects of final success. The document belongs to the category of spasmodic literature. There is a dogged iteration of confidence in the eventual result of the conflict to which they invite the people; but this generalization is marred by the sturdy irreconcilability of the particulars. The financial prostration of the South is confessed; the success of the North in converting a mob of volunteers into a regular army, is admitted; the certainty that, in the Spring, the cordon already placed about the rebel States will be drawn irresistibly closer and closer, until the struggle for existence will be mortal, is recognized; and the people is exhorted to the use of those frightful alternatives, which are only considered by a race obstinately resolved to prefer extermination to submission.

The Sumter, as we learned with a thrill of indignation some weeks ago, has transferred the scene of her piratical exploits to the European shores of the Atlantic, and was known to have sought asylum, after burning three American vessels, in the Spanish port of Cadiz. We expressed our fears at the time, that we had little guarantee in the public morality or good faith of Spain against her affording every hospitality to the buccaneer, but it is now due to say that her conduct in the case has been entirely just -- we may even say, generous; for an act of justice conspicuously done in the face of repeated wrongs, becomes something more than bare justice. It appears that the Spanish authorities, on learning the character of the Sumter, forthwith ordered her to leave Cadiz. The representations of the United States Consul at the port were cheerfully and faithfully followed -- no supplies for the furtherance of her piratical designs being granted, and the right of asylum being rigorously limited to the legal period of twenty-four hours. We are further told, in a London letter, that at Cadiz the officers of the Sumter were looked upon as buccaneers by the inhabitants of the town, and there were none so mean as to do them reverence save the correspondent of a leading London journal, who accompanied them to the play.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Sumter at Cadiz and at Gibraltar.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Sumter at Cadiz and at Gibraltar.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d074d12-72ce-5a1b-849a-72e4dea47109,908,nyt://article/0d074d12-72ce-5a1b-849a-72e4dea47109

editorial on Union movements up Tennessee River,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/07/archives/movement-up-the-tennessee-river-an-important-expedition.html,editorial on Union movements up Tennessee River,"Active though quiet preparations have been going on for some time at Cairo and Paducah, for a pretty strong military and naval expedition against some point which its planners had the good sense to conceal both from us and from the rebels. The expedition was not strong enough to make the grand assault on Columbus, much less to descend the Mississippi on the long projected tour to Memphis and New-Orleans; so it has been generally conjectured that it was bound to operate against some of the rebel works or camps on the Tennessee or Cumberland Rivers. It was necessary that the detached rebel forces in Western Kentucky should be dispersed, as those in the Eastern part of the State have just been dispersed, before any general forward movement be attempted. It seems now that the conjecture was correct A force declared by the telegraph to consist of ten thousand men and eleven gunboats, have entered the Tennessee River, and, at latest accounts, had got up in the vicinity of the rebel fort Henry, some fifty miles above the river's mouth. The only works or camps known to exist in this vicinity, are two -- one on each of the rivers, the Tennessee and the Cumberland, which here flow not far apart, in a parallel direction northward. Fort Henry, on the Tennessee, is an earthwork thrown up along the river, and constructed mainly to prevent our advance in the rear of Columbus, while both this and Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland, were intended, also, to prevent our operating so as to turn the left flank of the main rebel body at Bowling Green. Fort Hay, which, according to the telegraph, is to be at once assailed by the very respectable force we have mentioned, has an armament of some ten or twelve guns, of heavy calibre, and has been manned by a garrison of three thousand men. It is very probable, however, as this same point was threatened in the reconnoissance in force, made from Cairo a fortnight ago, that the rebels have sent additional forces up from Tennessee for its defence. On the opposide (or western) side of the river, the rebels have a battery placed on rising ground, which commands the fort, so that it will be necessary for our forces to operate on both sides of the river. The gunboats, however, which are those strong iron-plated craft built for service in the Mississippi Expedition, can, if their qualities are anything like what is supposed, ascend within striking distance of the rebel guns, and bombard the position, while the troops, acting from a direction north-easterly of the fort, will meet the rebels in case they evacuate the fort. But if any action has taken place, or is intended at this point, we will at once have news of its result, and speculation thereon is unnecessary.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Movement up the Tennessee River An Important Expedition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Movement up the Tennessee River An Important Expedition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1b576ddc-605a-55c7-b9fe-66eb64a10a24,807,nyt://article/1b576ddc-605a-55c7-b9fe-66eb64a10a24
Editorial on military strategy of flank movements,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/07/archives/flank-movements.html,Editorial on military strategy of flank movements,"The importance of flank movements is likely to receive more attention and deserves more in connection with the present, than with any previous struggle on record. The reason is that, besides being of greater necessity strategically, these movements are extraordinarily facilitated by the open frontier separating the loyal from the rebellious States, and still more by the easy accessibility of every point on the Southern coast. Plainly, too, these facilities are wholly to the advantage of the North. Our power to outflank the enemy through naval expeditions is overwhelming; and by land, given an unfortified frontier, the same power evidently rests with the side that can muster the greatest force and confine its enemy to a defensive attitude, securing its own territory from invasion and keeping intact its vast systems of communication, while it reserves to itself alone the power to menace and to strike. It may seem that time, giving the rebels opportunity for fortification, has, in some degrees neutralized our advantage; but on the contrary, it has increased our relative superiority, as it has matured our strength of attack.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FLANK MOVEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FLANK MOVEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ffb44c0-340f-51e6-9be5-24d4c40f9893,552,nyt://article/2ffb44c0-340f-51e6-9be5-24d4c40f9893

editorial on reported battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/07/archives/the-reported-battle-in-mexico.html,editorial on reported battle,"News as gratifying as that we receive from Mexico may be pardoned for taking a roundabout way. Through San Francisco, we learn that the army of Spain has met with its first serious reverse. Leaving Vera Cruz, seven thousand strong, it had advanced thirty miles on the road to the capital, to a point of much strategic importance, known as the National Bridge, where the Rio Antigua is crossed, and where the Mexicans seem to have posted themselves to dispute the passage. No point is more disputable. The bridge is surrounded by a throng of hills, and the westward road, upon leaving it, ascends gradually over ground exposed for some distance to the fire of an opposing force, who may shelter themselves behind intrenchments, and pour death upon the advancing enemy. It would require only a small body of troops to withstand at this place an army of thrice its strength. Gen. URAGA, the Mexican commander, has doubtless availed himself of these advantages. The arrogant and confident Castilians despising their foe, and eager to forestall their allies in the harvest of glory, rushed upon this danger, and have been defeated. It may be long before we learn how signal this reverse has been. The neglect of Government to provide means of communication with Mexico, leaves us at the mercy of the Havana Press for news of the allied army; and the Spanish Press is not likely to report Spanish disasters otherwise than as victories.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Reported Battle in Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Reported Battle in Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e1c4a6b-eabe-579d-af53-f36249c7f83a,526,nyt://article/7e1c4a6b-eabe-579d-af53-f36249c7f83a

Children of a larger growth, too, of both sexes, have made the most of the snow and the frost.

The omnibus lines, too, have followed suit of private parties, and the unfortunates who have no sleighs of their own, for the small sum of sixpence get a ride of one, two or three miles, and are as happy as anybody. These sleighing parties have run deep into the nights of late, and as the gay parties glide over the smooth street at 11 or 12 o'clock, singing some gay snatch of a song, or repeating some brisk chorus, it sounds wondrously romantic and fine. A dozen of each sex, well packed in an old sixpenny omnibus on runners dashing down Printing House-square under the stars, and their clear voices ringing through the air the Hallelujah Chorus -- nothing can seem or sound more cheery.

A young woman of respectable appearance, went into STEWART'S, on Wednesday afternoon, and conducted herself in such a manner, that suspicions against her honesty were aroused. When she left the establishment, a policeman of the Broadway Squad was called, and told to follow and arrest her as a pickpocket. He did so, and as soon as he took hold of her, she threw away a porte-monnais, which was afterwards identified as belonging to one of the ladies who had been shopping when the prisoner was in the store. Two bank bills were also found in her possession, both of which had been stolen from Mr. STEWART's customers. Yesterday, the accused was committed to answer. She says her name is ELIZABETH MARSHALL.... On Wednesday evening, Detective DUSENBERRY saw a lad, named MICHARL KENNY, pick a lady's pocket in Parkrow. He caught hold of the rogue, who twisted from his grasp, and ran through Ann-street, first throwing away the pocket-book which he had just stolen.

The $150,000,000 of currency will be practically a loan of that amount by the people to the Government. Until it is funded, it will be a loan without interest. As soon as the people find that they cannot use it in the market in such a manner as to realize six per cent. for it, they will convert it into Government stock, and it will then bear interest. To my mind, it makes but little difference whether the interest is paid in coin or paper, as, in my opinion, by the time the first installment of interest is due, the issue now proposed will have given place to the new bank currency, which will be convertible into specie at the banks, unless a general suspension, such as now exists, should then take place, in which case the interest could not be paid in specie, for the very obvious reason that the country would not have the specie to pay it.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. Morrie Ketchum on Finance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mr. Morrie Ketchum on Finance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10a02bbc-d497-5c2d-8679-73772a993495,1537,nyt://article/10a02bbc-d497-5c2d-8679-73772a993495

The bill providing for iron-clad steam gunboats was reported back from the Naval Committee by Mr. HALE, who proceeded to make a speech advocating its passage. It was amended so as to limit the number of boats to twenty, and then passed. Mr. HALE also explained at considerable length the investigations of the Naval Committee regarding the Morgan and other contracts.

This dazzling outburst of the major and minor lights, from what might be termed the subterranean universe, was caused by an announcement in the TIMES that the case of PAT. MATHEWS, who is a star of the first magnitude, would be investigated by Coroner RANNEY. MATHEWS was stabbed on Thursday morning, and so severly, that it is not probable he will live. His acquaintance demonstrated their interest in his misfortune by assembling to learn the circumstances by which it was attended. For the most part, they were gratified. Shortly-cropped hair, a nose retrousse, and garments of the swell pattern, were sufficient to pass all of whom they were characteristic into the private room where the Coroner held sway. For others, and especially for the representatives of the Press, there was no admittance. No questions were put until the Coroner was assured, by a careful glance around the apartment, that persons were not surreptitiously taking notes. He afterward explained his reasons for this unprecedented privacy. The proceedings, he said, were simply to ascertain whether JOHN REYNOLDS, WILLIAM WHISTON and JAMES SKEILY, the persons accused of assaulting MATHEWS, might be admitted to bail, and at this stage of the case, justice would be injured by a publication of the facts. In his opinion, the evidence taken in Coroners' cases, of a criminal character, should not be made public. This opinion was of course concurred in by Mr. MATHEWS' friends, especially by Mr. HENRY FELTER, who was present during the affray.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PAT.

editorial on French and British intervention,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/08/archives/france-and-england-in-mexico.html,editorial on French and British intervention,"It is with feelings far from indifferent that the progress of European intervention in Mexico is watched by the people of the United States. The avowed purpose of two out of the three nations engaged in the business was to refute the Monroe doctrine, by extending to the New World the idea of a balance of power, and placing some barrier to that march of manifest destiny, which would otherwise be resumed by an elastic and restless people at the close of our civil war. To Europeanize Mexico, to write its laws in Paris and London, and surround it with a military force strong enough to resist the encroachments of fillibusterism, and that form of colonization which wrested Texas from New-Spain -- these were the objects which lay immediately behind the pretence of debts unpaid, and European residents endangered. Further back there was reason to apprehend the existence of other motives still more nearly concerning the welfare of this country. The right to interfere in the internal affairs of Mexico at the moment when faction had for the first time in the life of a generation been quieted, implies, with stronger reason, a right to interfere in the United States, where the presence of a war which Europe has resolved to regard as needless, malignant, barbarous, apparently robs France and England of industrial prosperity, and threatens the former with the hazards of revolution. Nor has such apprehensions been simply a matter of inference. It has been more than hinted that the demonstration against Mexico was really directed against this country. The disproportioned squadron, and armament apparently in excess of any occasion Mexico was likely to give for their employment, have been regarded, not only in the United States but in Europe, as the supplement of preparations for interventions in our own troubles; preparations otherwise partially completed by the large body of British troops thrown into Canada; by the powerful reinforcements added to the squadron of Admiral MILNE, and by the numerous French men-of-war haunting at this moment the waters of America. The friends of the American cause in Europe have repeatedly warned us of the danger to be feared in this quarter. We have been bidden to watch the Mexican campaign with more than the jealousy that its remoter reference to our future might seem to authorize. And had the task undertaken by the allies been as trifling as they reckoned it; had they landed at Vera Cruz to be hailed by the great body of the Mexican people as deliverers, and to march, as at a triumph, to the capital, there to prescribe laws, erect a Government, and from the pinnacle of success proceed to the next act of the preconcerted drama, it is quite possible that intervention in the United States would have followed hard upon the [???] of intervention in Mexico.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and England in Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and England in Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e54e104-3103-5885-97af-c6a41019d361,1157,nyt://article/7e54e104-3103-5885-97af-c6a41019d361

The writer in the now exceedingly Toryfied-Whig Edinburgh, argues strongly for the abolition of the right of search altogether, and of course is highly indignant at the stoppage of the Trent, more especially as, being a mail steamer, and proceeding toward a neutral port, he holds her to have been exempt from search, according to modern usage. He points out that in all recent maritime wars, even in the blockades of Buenos Ayres, Mexico, and Dalmatia, packets have been treated as privileged vessels; and that it is essential to the constitution of a contraband character that the vessel stopped should be proceeding toward the enemy's coast. England, we are told, carried this principle so far, even in the beginning of the present century, as to liberate a Dutch vessel bound to the Cape of Good Hope, on the ground that, during the period between her departure and the seizure, the colony had become a British possession. Cases illustrative of maritime belligerent rights have, however, been cited so profusely of late, that we are glad to turn from them to the views of the writer in the Edinburgh, on the expediency and utility of the right of visitation and search. The effect of the Declaration of Paris has been to limit the maritime rights of belligerents to blockade, and the seizure of articles contraband of war, including dispatches and persons in the naval or military service of the enemy; and the writer asks:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Two British Quarterlies on Our Relations with England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Two British Quarterlies on Our Relations with England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cotton', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3f238cba-fb3b-5ca3-a1e5-2a92ca256c90,1935,nyt://article/3f238cba-fb3b-5ca3-a1e5-2a92ca256c90

"Harrisburgh Telegraph feels called upon to print the correspondence connected with the retirement of Mr. CAMERON from the Cabinet. It is marked ""private,"" but there is no such thing in these days as epistolary privacy, and indeed we cannot discover a reason why these letters, which might be expected to throw light on a transaction not as perspicuous as it might be, should not have been published earlier. The reader will be the judge of the measure of light they really afford. We have every reason to believe that Secretary CAMERON was removed for incapacity, or something very much worse. Nothing of this sort appears in the correspondence - how could it? It is not the way of the political world to tell one's friend in so many words he is a thief, or an idiot; that he is unfitted for a position in which one has placed him, and must even take one of minor responsibility where knavery has no chance. We give him courtly phrases; consult his wishes; lavish upon him our God-speed, and look after him tenderly as he goes his way. Thus has the President dismissed CAMERON. But there is an abruptness in the business, which detracts from the effect of the courtesy. The letter of the President, dated on January 11, is evidently the first announcement the Secretary received of his discharge. In his reply dated the same day, the Secretary alludes to his wish to be relieved, formerly expressed, as a recollection the President had ""revived,"" and pays a panegyric to his successor, whose name was not referred to by Mr. LINCOLN, and whose intended appointment must have been brought to his ear by rumor.

The popular idea in England and France - shown recently by the very considerable fall in cotton during the Trent imbroglio - is that as soon as war was declared with the United States, and a French and English squadron had opened the Southern ports, a fleet of merchantmen would at once enter those harbors, bringing cargoes of manufactured goods, and then having laden themselves in return with vast quantities of cotton, they would sail quietly back over the ocean and supply the hungry manufacturers of England and the ouvriers of France, and prosperity and plenty would again return to those unfortunate classes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Profits of a War for Cotton.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Profits of a War for Cotton.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a25d81f5-41bc-5d34-8a9c-22ea745773f2,951,nyt://article/a25d81f5-41bc-5d34-8a9c-22ea745773f2

Editorial on British press views on US finances,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/11/archives/the-english-press-on-american-finance.html,Editorial on British press views on US finances,"We have had sauce enough from England of late; but of that particular kind of sauce which is suited both to the goose and the gander, we have received none at all. This sort of unevenhanded justice is flagrantly manifested in regard to our recent financial measures consequent upon the insurrection. The suspension of specie payments is pronounced ""very like an act of national bankruptcy."" ""When,"" adds the Morning Herald, ""a private individual or public company does this,we say that they are bankrupt."" But in that case very often ""we"" say what the event proves to be untrue. For in how many instances in this country and in some, as we know, in England, is suspension of payment followed by relief to all parties concerned and prosperity to one, and in case of a winding up of a concern with a payment in full and a handsome surplus, when an opposite course would have insured a loss to all parties, and the ruin of one. But our Secretary of the Treasury is said, by his English censor, to have only followed ""truly national example."" The old Confederation, it is said, ""contracted debts and refused to pay them. Pennsylvania contracted debts, and in a like fashton swindled her creditors."" Notice here the ignoring of the absolute impossibility of the payment of its debts by the old Confederation; but chiefly the untruthful statement with regard to Pennsylvania, all of whose bonds were finally paid in full, and the studious neglect to bring to mind the absolute repudiation of the State, Mississippi, which has furnished the insurrection with a leader, a leader who is the very apostle and archpriest of repudiation. Not more religiously or distinctly does the sponsor in baptism renounce the devil and all his works, on behalf of his god-child, than Mr. DAVIS renounced her debts and all her liabilities in behalf of Mississippi, adding thereunto a denunciation of her creditors. But, although Pennsylvania, who assumed her debt, is held up to the scorn of the British nation, the flagrant sins of the faith-breaking Slave States are passed over in utter silence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The English Press on American Finance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The English Press on American Finance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Finances', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4309a47a-a370-5ff2-918b-f44d637e570d,800,nyt://article/4309a47a-a370-5ff2-918b-f44d637e570d

"Winter has its own delights -- many, indeed' which, in the estimation of the wholesome Northern temperament, Summer, with all her splendors, cannot rival. It is not the fireside spell alone which Winter wields. To those who love him, and fear him not, he is beneficent as well as kindly. From the caves of Aurora he gathers the bloom he scatters on the lips and cheeks of his votaries; and the sparkle of the Polar star is not brighter than the light he freshens in their eyes. Health and jovial pleasure attend the coming of the Icy King when hailed aright. So seemed to think the gay and fair of Brooklyn yesterday, and the occasion offered them by the Washington Skating Club to hold a carnival in costume on the Fifth avenue pond, in the southern suburb of the city. The pond, which was beautifully hardened by the sharp cold of Sunday night and Monday morning, was, notwithstanding the full sunshine of the forenoon, in fine condition yesterday at 3 P.M., the hour fixed for the commencement of the festival. Unfortunately, some misunderstanding had arisen in respect to the admission of guests, the advertisement fixing the admission fee, for any and all, at twenty-five cents per head, while many members of the Club vehemently contended that the price stated was merely an extra contribution to be levied upon the members of the Club, who, only, could be admitted, with their families, according to the bye laws of the organization. This disagreement led to an uncertainty, which prevented the attendance from being, at an early hour, what had been expected. DODWORTH's Band, of twenty-five pieces, was, however, promptly present and in fine tune. The bright sky, the exhilarating atmosphere, and the excellent condition of the ice, which covers a superficies of some acres in extent, proved temptations too strong for even discontent to resist, and by sundown the up-cars were, thronged with eager crowds of both sexes, and nearly all ages from the toddling ""3-year-old"" to venerable age.

The broad plateau of ice, powdered with the snowy scurf tossed up by a thousand steel runners, presented an ever-changing, ever brilliant scene of kaleidoscopic oddity and picturesqueness, the ring of merry voices and the rush of iron-shod feet, chiming in quaintly with the beat of dancing music But let us not be carried too far from the recollection of individual features in the survey of the general scene, gay as it was.

It is not the fireside spell alone which Winter wields. To those who love him, and fear him not, he is beneficent as well as kindly. From the caves of Aurora he gathers the bloom he scatters on the lips and cheeks of his votaries; and the sparkle of the Polar star is not brighter than the light he freshens in their eyes. Health and jovial pleasure attend the coming of the Icy King when hailed aright. So seemed to think the gay and fair of Brooklyn yesterday, and the occasion offered them by the Washington Skating Club to hold a carnival in costume on the Fifth avenue pond, in the southern suburb of the city. The pond, which was beautifully hardened by the sharp cold of Sunday night and Monday morning, was, notwithstanding the full sunshine of the forenoon, in fine condition yesterday at 3 P.M., the hour fixed for the commencement of the festival. Unfortunately, some misunderstanding had arisen in respect to the admission of guests, the advertisement fixing the admission fee, for any and all, at twenty-five cents per head, while many members of the Club vehemently contended that the price stated was merely an extra contribution to be levied upon the members of the Club, who, only, could be admitted, with their families, according to the bye laws of the organization. This disagreement led to an uncertainty, which prevented the attendance from being, at an early hour, what had been expected.

From our Washington correspondent we receive a resume of the charges upon which this action is founded. Government, we learn, has reason to believe the slaughter at Ball's Bluff to have been less the result of military incompetency than of a preconcerted plan to deliver our troops into the hands of the enemy. Of the character and strength of the evidence relied upon to sustain this fearful inculpation, we are, of course, unapprised. It must indeed, be cogent: for, to fix upon an officer the guilt of deliberately exposing his troops to be slaughtered pitilessly and helplessly by traitors, only less culpable than himself, no testimony that is not entirely conclusive should be received. Other charges -- one of holding treasonable communication with the enemy, and two of recent treachery -- are also made. They are probably more easily capable of proof than the first-mentioned; but they are none the less infamous and shocking than it though, fortunately, they have not been permitted to go on to as fatal an issue.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Arrest of Gen.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/11/archives/the-brooklyn-skating-carnival-5000-persons-on-the-ice-characters-in.html,,"Winter has its own delight many, indeed, which, in the estimation of the wholesome Northern temperament, Summer, with all her splendors, cannot rival. It is not the fireside spell alone which Winter wields. To those who love him, and fear him not, he is beneficent as well as kindly. From the caves of Aurora he gathers the bloom he scatters on the lips and cheeks of his votaries; and the sparkle of the Polar star is not brighter than the light he freshens in their eyes. Health and jovial pleasure attend the coming of the Icy King when hailed aright. So seemed to think the gay and fair of Brooklyn yesterday, and the occasion offered them by the Washington Skating Club to hold a carnival in costume on the Fifth avenue pond, in the southern suburb of the city. The pond, which was beautifully hardened by the sharp cold of Sunday night and Monday morning, was, notwithstanding the full sunshine of the forenoon, in fine condition yesterday at 3 P.M., the hour fixed for the commencement of the festival. Unfortunately, some misunderstanding had arisen in respect to the admission of guests, the advertisement fixing the admission fee, for any and all, at twenty-five cents per head, while many members of the Club vehemently contended that the price stated was merely an extra contribution to be levied upon the members of the Club, who, only, could be admitted, with their families, according to the bye-laws of the organization. This disagreement led to an uncertainty, which prevented the attendance from being, at an early hour, what had been expected. DODWORTH's Band, of twenty-five pieces, was, however, promptly present and in fine tune. The bright sky, the exhilarating atmosphere, and the excellent condition of the ice, which covers a superficios of some acres in extent, proved temptations too strong for even discontent to resist, and by sundown the up-cars were thronged with eager crowds of both sexes, and nearly all ages from the toddling ""3-year-old"" to venerable age. On the way along Fifth-avenue, too, there were processions of pedestrians hurrying toward the same point, and every here and there were large pounds covered with the overplus of the skating fraternity, who had not the patience, inclination or cash to visit the Washington ice-field. By dusk, the Club house on the edge of the grand pond was uncomfortably filled with ladies and their escort and many hundred pairs of skates were ringing a merry chorus of the ice. The frigid rule of the Club was abandoned, and all well behaved persons paying the needful ""quarter,"" were at once admitted within the gateway. From 7 o'clock, the throng rapidly increased until at 8, a fair estimate could be formed of the success of the festival. Passing from the Club house with its dense mass of occupants struggling every inmate with his or her neighbor, for even standing room, the coup d'ail was very fine. The ice, unfortunately, was not well illuminated, only a few reflector-lamps on eight fool posts here and there, contending with the shades of evening; but the moon was unusually fair for the season, and the sky pure as a crystal dome. The pond rests in a cavity of the soil surrounded and overlooked on three sides by high embankments, upon and beyond which run the streetways which inclose those portions of the square. These banks were lined with multitudes of spectators, standing compactly and silently together like regiments seen at night drawn up in line of battle, an Illusion which, from time to time, the flash of the irons flung over the arm of some departing skater who yet lingered for another glimpse at the scene, helped to convey. The broad plateau of ice, powdered with the snowy scarf tossed up by a thousand steel runners, presented an ever-changing, ever brilliant scene of kaleidoscopic oddity and picturesqueness, the ring of merry voices and the rush of [???] feet, chiming in quaintly with the beat of dancing music But let us not be carried too far from the recollection of individual features in the survey of the general scene, gay as it was. The costumes were not very numerous, but were in many instances good, and the characters assumed by those who wore them well sustained.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BROOKLYN SKATING CARNIVAL.; 5,000 PERSONS ON THE ICE.

Those who expected he would use the occasion of opening the Legislative Chamber to announce his resolution to acknowledge the Southern Confederacy, and declare the blockade invalid have now had their disappointment; for his speech, taking a contrary direction, sustains the propriety of preserving neutrality, until neutral rights shall be infringed by the belligerents. The blockade, therefore, is not at present a violation of neutral rights. Some fresh accident or incident, or a maintenance of the blockade until its existence threatens to be interminable, must furnish the groundwork of that policy of intervention, which is just now wanting. A London paper, the Morning Advertiser, attributes this extreme moderation of tone to a remonstrance of Lord RUSSEL, who is said to have begged a longer probation for our Government.

For the information that we have, we, in common with other journals, are indebted to the enterprise of the Fortress Monroe correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer, and it establishes, beyond a doubt, that Roanoke Island is in the possession of our forces, after a three days' combat, naval and military, which brilliantly illustrated the resources, the pluck and the valor of both arms of the Nation a service. For, in this victory, the cooperation of the land and sea forces seems to have attained a completeness not reached in any of our former expeditions. Port Royal and Hatteras were exclusively naval victories, but Roanoke called forth and combined the effective qualities of both arms of the service. We have as yet no details of the work done on the island after landing, and only know it was triumphantly done, and that the National Standard was planted over the enemy's fortifications.

What determines them? for North and South are mere relative terms, and South Carolina is north of Georgia. Is it parallels of latitude? Missouri, the local Government of which is, or was, under disloyal rule, is far north of Kentucky, which is and ever has been under loyal rule, and which furnishes troops by the thousand to the National armies. Does Slavery determine these frontiers, and are the ""Northern"" boundaries coterminous with Freedom? Maryland and Kentucky, whom no threats have been able to force, no intrigue to juggle from their loyalty, are both Slave States. Do State lines and State rights mark out these lines?

"The British Admiralty illustrate curiously the national addiction to the rites of hospitality.

The James Adger was for a time understood to be awaiting her appearance outside of neutral waters, and the Nashville lingered. Then came the Tuscarora, and again, the Nashville delayed, Capt.

The new building was taken possession of and thrown open to the inspection of the public for the first time, yesterday, and will be open for the same purpose throughout to-day, and up to 10 o'clock in the evening. The building is eligibly located in Butler-street, near Flatbush-avenue, on a plot of land containing about eight city lots, of the usual size, with a frontage on Butler-street of 75 feet, and extending back to Baltic-street. The building fronts on Butler-street, and is of the Domestic Gothic style of architecture, constructed of brick, with stone facings, five stories high, with an extreme depth of 80 feet, and extreme width of 50 feet. Rising from the roof is a tower 40 feet high. The basement story is divided into dining-room, laundry, kitchen, lavatory, matron's dining-room and school-room. On the second floor there is a reception room, teachers' bed-room, family parlor, matron's room, two large wardrobe closets, committee room and library. Third floor -- the whole of this floor is arranged as a chapel. The fourth floor has two large domitories for the inmates of the ""Home,"" extending the whole length of the building, and opening from these are several rooms set apart as nurseries. The fifth floor is set apart as a play-room for the children in unpleasant weather. The building is heated by means of hot air; there are abundant accommodations for bathing, and the entire building is thoroughly ventilated. The ground upon which the Home stands cost $4,800; building, $16,000; fixtures, $1,400; total, $22,200. There is a mortgage upon the property of $5,000, and a floating debt of $1,000 -- the latter amount the managers hope to receive from visitors during the opening exercises.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Opening of the Home for Destitute Children.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Opening of the Home for Destitute Children.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4862f51d-f569-5c2e-a8f4-c2ba16d9bdbb,562,nyt://article/4862f51d-f569-5c2e-a8f4-c2ba16d9bdbb

BURNSIDE, are at last happily relieved by the news which we receive from rebel sources. The first work of our forces was to be the seizure of Roanoke Island, the key of the North Carolina Sounds, and the attainment of a basis on the mainland from which operations might be undertaken against more vital points. That Island has been captured after a sharp conflict, in which the killed and wounded count up to many hundreds, and the prisoners in our hands to thousands; the armed rebel vessels cruising in the Sounds have all been captured or destroyed; Elizabeth City, some forty miles north of Roanoke, and on the inland water-route to Norfolk, has been captured; and, at latest advices, our gallant troops were pushing on to Edenton, on the Chowan River, apparently with the object of ascending that stream, and seizing the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, connecting Norfolk with the South, or, perhaps, pushing inland even as far as Weldon, and obtaining possession of the Wilmington and Weldon, and the Raleigh and Gaston roads, the most important lines of railway communication in the Southern States. It hardly seems possible, however, that after leaving a force sufficient to guard his prisoners on the island and hold the position, and leaving another body to hold and defend Elizabeth City against approaches from Norfolk, BURNSIDE would have dared to venture thus far into the enemy's country with his remaining troops. But, on the other hand, it may be remembered that the fleet under his command, as might be seen by the list and armament of his vessels which we published yesterday, was a very large and imposing one; that one or two armed steamers could without difficulty guard thousands of beaten and disarmed prisoners; that a single gunboat could guard the Pasquotank River, on which is Elizabeth City; and that thus there would still be at least forty gunboats, of various kinds, and -- putting our loss of men at the highest figure given by the rebels -- twelve or fifteen thousand troopst, flushed with victory, ready for operations in any other quarter.

During last Winter and Spring, when the Capital was in imminent danger at the hands of the conspirators against the Government, and the hero, SCOTT, was laboring with wise and patriotic zea[???] to unravel and counteract the machinations of the secret plotters, the Lieutenant-General called STONE to his aid. STONE was not then in the service, having resigned years ago, and been engaged in civil engineering. Happening to be in Washington however, when it was discovered that plots were rife to prevent the counting of the Electoral vote, and failing in that, to defeat the Inauguration of Presides LINCOLN and seize the Government, he promptly re sponded to the call of his old commander, and, with out asking or waiting for rank or pay, devoted his days and nights to the service of his country, with an assiduity, skill, prudence and self-sacrificing disinter estedness that would be expected of few men.

The rebel earthworks, which were strong, were thrown up about the centre of the island, and our troops had to debark on its southern end, and march up a distance of between two and three miles, to the rebel position. On the mainland opposite, there were also defences; and on the narrow strip of beach to the east, at the point marked as Nag's Head, there was lately a rebel force stationed; but as we have no account of fighting there, it may have been that the whole of the rebel forces were concentrated on the island.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/13/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"Judging from the reports which reach us from the rebels, the success of the Burnside Expedition has thus far been greater than its most sanguine friends have dared to hope for. Not only has Roanoke Island, with its formidable batteries, been captured; not only has the rebel gunboat fleet, under ""Commodore"" LYNCH, been almost totally destroyed; but our forces, not satisfied with these important advantages, have pushed on to Elizabeth City and captured it, and at last accounts were approaching Edenton, with a view, probably, of ascending the Chowan River to cut off communication with Norfolk by railroad. The Chowan River is navigable for large vessels as high up as Murfreesboro, near the Virginia State line, and at this season, when the waters are high, our light-draught gunboats would probably find little difficulty in ascending still higher. The first news of the rebel defeat at Roanoke Island reached Norfolk on Sunday, and was soon followed by the announcement that Elizabeth City had fallen into our hands. The city was fired, but whether by our shells or by the inhabitants, is not yet certain -- the rebels say the latter. There was a rebel force of three thousand effective fighting-men on the Island, and of these, the Norfolk papers say, not more than seventy escaped; the rest being killed, wounded and taken prisoners. Their estimated loss in killed and wounded is three hundred of the former and one thousand of the latter. Among the wounded is O. JENNINGS WISE, son of the Ex-Governor and now General. The General himself, it appears, found it convenient to be sick about the time the fighting was to commence, and remained at Nag's Head, on the sand-spit opposite the island, until the rebels began to get the worst of it, when he started for Norfolk; but, as he had not arrived there at last accounts, there is a possibility that he has been captured. The rebels are very disheartened at their defeat, and admit it to be a very serious one.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7edd4a6b-ca49-56c2-a3cb-f53508e5f6eb,832,nyt://article/7edd4a6b-ca49-56c2-a3cb-f53508e5f6eb

He was disposed to vote for the measure, though he would prefer it without the legal tender clause. He was followed by Mr. COLLAMER, of Vermont, who opposed making the notes a legal tender.

"BLOCKADE. -- The note of Lord LYONS to Earl RUSSELL, reporting, in a tone evidently friendly to the United States, a conversation he had with Secretary SEWARD touching the stone blockade, puts that act in its true fight. It must be confessed that the stone blockade was not ill-calculated for dramatic effects, and the rebel agents and rebel sympathizers in Europe, by working its capabilities to the utmost, succeeded in making a good deal of capital out of it. Mr. SEWARD clearly shows that it was altogether a mistake to suppose that this plan had been devised to injure the harbors permanently. It is, as we ourselves said some time ago, simply a temporary military expedient, adopted to aid the blockade.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/13/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. The comedy of the ""Serious Family"" has been revived at this theatre, to houses full to overflowing. As Mr. CLARKE seems, by universal consent, to have occupied the comic chair made vacant by the death of Mr. BURTON, and the public look naturally for his appearance in those parts with which the fame of that great artist was associated, we presume that the ""Serious Family"" was produced mainly with the object of presenting Mr. CLARKE in the character of Aminadab Sleck, which, as the companion picture to Toodles, stirred fur so many seasons the galety of the town, and under the most lachrymose ribs awoke laughter. It could hardly be with other object, for in itself the piece has but few elements of success. In London it was a comparative failure when first produced, though the part of Capt. Mu phy Maguire was filled by Mr. WALLACK, then in the zenith of his vigor, and that of Sleck by Mr. BUCKSTONE. It mainly owes the position of almost unparalleled success it holds on the stage to the combined genius of Mr. BURTON and Mr. BROUGHAM, who almost created these roles, or, at all events, covered them wiih such a mixture of merriment as to virtually make of them new parts. As in the case of Toodles, Mr. CLARKE does not, even in the smallest details, call up a memory of BURTON. The personation is purely and entirely his own. As might be expected from his individual nature, it lacks the breadth and unctuousness which gave to BURTON's personation so olly a richness; but whatever deficiency it finds in this respect, is more than compensated for by the unique quaintness and fresh, hearty fun he throws into the part. Of the two, perhaps Mr. CLARKE's personation excites the most genuine merriment. Certain it is, the piece never rode to its close on so full a tide of laughter as that which bore it to its termination on Monday night. The piece was produced evidently with much care, and many new effects. Among the latter we may mention a comic dance of hypocrites, in which Mr. DAVIDGE figured most humorously, and which received a most merry encore. The brilliant CUBAS, on whom all the expressions of Terpsichorean admiration seems to be exhausted, followed in two of her exquisite dances, and brought the evening's entertainment to a delightful close.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a9e5d963-c169-5b18-8cf6-b475b81a32fb,398,nyt://article/a9e5d963-c169-5b18-8cf6-b475b81a32fb

The speaker occupied the attention of the audience for over an hour, with a long, well-written, and well-read narrative of the incidents connected with the Battle of Bull Run: his capture, and his treatment at Manassas, and the journey to Richmond, with their subsequent incarceration. As Mr. GILLETTE was not permitted to bring away any of his notes or diary, the whole narrative was written from memory. Of the treatment of the prisoners, especially the wounded at Manassas, he spoke, as all others have spoken, condemning the inhumanity of the rebels, and paying a merited tribute of gratification on behalf of all to Surgeon STUART, of the First Minnesota Volunteers; PEUGNET, of the Seventy-first N.Y.S.M.; SWIFT, DEGRAW and WINSTON, of the Eighth New-York, who not only were unremitting in their attentions, but freely expended their own money to purchase little comforts for the wounded. They arrived at Richmond on the 4th of August, and were quartered (1,466 in number) in four tobacco houses, two of which were used as hospitals. And after the arrival of 600 prisoners from Leesburgh, three more warehouses were filled, one being occupied as a hospital. Of their treatment there he gave detailed and interesting statements, not forgetting the tyrannical and traitorous conduct of Lieut. TODD, who seemed to be possessed of the spirit of a fiend in his treatment of them. He used to go through the prisons sword in hand, and twice he cut down two men for the most trivial causes, Sergeant WHITCOMB and T.D. SMITH, of the First Michigan Volunteers. Three prisoners were shot at the windows, for looking out, viz.: N.C. BUCK, of the New-York Seventy-ninth; C.W. TIBBETTS, of the New-York Twenty-seventh, and R. GLEASON, of the New-York Eleventh. Capt. GEO. C. GIBBS, who took charge after the removal of Lieut. TODD, was a humane man, and allowed the prisoners every privilege, and did all he could to contribute to their comfort, consistently with his orders. A ""United States Prisoners' Court for the District of Richmond"" was established in November for the trial of offenders, which resulted in checking many petty larcenies -- Hon. H.B. HALL, of the Eighteenth New-York, being elected Chief-Justice. They also organized a company of ""Prison Invincibles,"" and drilled daily, thus whiling away time. They also established the ""Prisoners of War Olio,"" and, with the aid of blankets, flannels, tin foil, &c., got up quite a theatrical wardrobe. The lecturer read ""the Prison Bill of Fare,"" a humorous narrative in rhyme, by JAMES BANKS, of Massachusetts, which caused much laughter. In December, the prisoners, who had suffered very much for want of proper clothing, received some warm clothes from the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Indiana; but nothing from the State of New-York, except two boxes of clothing from the ""Ladies' Aid Society,"" of this church, the largest of which was sent to their friends at Tuscaloosa, and the other distributed among the hospitals at Richmond.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/14/archives/five-months-with-the-rebels-lecture-by-james-gillette-of-the.html,,"A leisure was delivered, Wednesday evening, in Calvary Baptist Church, in Twenty-third-street, by Mr. JAMES GILLETTE, of the Rev.

True, like many other of the grandest convictions, it has for months been little more than an article of faith -- and as we have hitherto been able to point to few manifestations of its existence, it has not been difficult for the rebel agents in Europe to make it a matter of general European belief that there is absolute unanimity in the rebellion cause at the South. There is a fictitious sense in which they are, perhaps, right in the assertion; and as the certificates of Southern loyalty which we in the North have are of an incommunicable nature, springing from deep-rooted instincts and long affiliations, and not to be conveyed to those abroad, it is not in the least wonderful that the Secessionists and their journalistic friends in England and France have been successful in their endeavors to mold public opinion in this respect. It has not been enough to point to the practical demonstrations of Unionism that have attended the presence of the liberating National army in the shore counties of Eastern Virginia, at Hatteras, and in the Western Border States; the vast interior spaces of the revolted States have been confidently pointed to as permeated with but one sentiment, and that unanimous hostility to the National Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebellion Tapped at the CoreProofs of Southern Unionism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebellion Tapped at the CoreProofs of Southern Unionism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d4b553c-c0f7-5047-801b-375519cf1363,590,nyt://article/7d4b553c-c0f7-5047-801b-375519cf1363

It may have been, and it may not; it is as likely to be one way as the other. We certainly know that the black-flag gentry of South Carolina were not slow in fleeing from the Hilton Head forts when DUPONT's guns began to play about their ears; and, according to a Charleston paper we quoted from the other day, a good many of them did not stop running (possibly trailing a black flag behind them) till they ""reached the mountains,"" some two hundred miles north. According to that journal, they are only now venturing down to Charleston again. The commander at Roanoke Island, again, according to one of the deserters from there who came into our lines, had given his soldiers two orders: First, that the Yankees should be shown no quarter; and, second, (a genuine Hibernianism,) that, if it should be necessary to retreat, they should destroy all property by fire. The event proves, however, that two or three thousand of these heroes were, like their brethren at Fort Henry, quite willing to accept quarter or anything else. The fact is that this whole thing of rebel black flags, cross-bones and no quarter, is an exploded humbug.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'No QUARTER!

Of these, fifty-three were rebel successes, and but eight National successes. We published,the other day, a curious table given by a Richmond paper, and collected from official (rebel) sources, showing the dates and localities of all these battles, with a list of the killed, wounded and captured on both sides. Some of the battles we had never heard of before, and others it was odd enough to see designated as rebel triumphs. To make the list longer, apparently, there were scattered through it a number of names of battles and rebel victories in which the subsequent column showed that there had been neither killed, wounded nor prisoners on either side! What kind of victories these could be, it were hard enough to say. Possibly they belonged to the grand category of moral victories (rebel morals) of which philosophers love so much to discourse. In other cases they had picket fights entered in the list of battles, which undoubtedly they were, in one sense, though hardly reaching that dignity in a national point of view. The losses on our side, too, were fearful, while on theirs the whole loss amounted to a mere bagatelle. It is thus that the rebels flatter themselves, and whistle to keep their courage up. We who know the facts in each of the cases mentioned -- and they, also, who, in some cases, knew the facts as well as we -- of course regard the whole thing as a bit of harmless bluster; but we expect that as soon as the tabular statement gets across the sea, it will be published in the London Times and Galignani, and the former journal will doubtless have a solemn and very heavy leader upon it, showing the miserable imbecility of the North and the unconquerable herolism of the rebels.

Even the small strip of territory occupied by the allies outside the walls of Vera Cruz, they had obtained by application made to Gen. URAGA, the Mexican leader, who had given his consent. And there was no sound reason for withholding it.

The advices are intersting and important. Gen. MIRAMON, who left Havana for Vera Cruz on board the English mail steamer, arrived at that place on Jan. 24. By order of Commodore DUNLOP he was at once arrested and taken on board H.B.M. frig te Challenger, for having violated his pledge not to leave Havana. It was rumored that he was subsequently transferred to the Jason for attempting to effect his escape to the mainland. The affair had created much excitement among MIRAMON's partisans, who had been anxiously anticipating his arrival. The Commissioners representing the allied Powers, who left Vera Cruz for the City of Mexico on Jan. 14, returned on the 19th. Senor ZAMACONA, a Plenipotentiary commissioned by JUAREZ, accompanied them. The Allied Commission represent that they were everywhere received with cordiality. JUAREZ treated them with great consideration. He attempted to exact as a condition of future negotiations, that all of the allied forces which had been landed at Vera Cruz, with the exception of a guard of 2,000 men, should be reembarked. This preliminary was at once declined, but as the Plenipotentiary of JUAREZ returned with the Commission, it was taken for granted that negotiations would proceed. Where the conferences would take place was uncertain, although it was generally believed that Jalapa would be agreed upon. JUAREZ, it is said, had acknowledged that his Government had not fulfilled its obligations to foreigners, and expressed his willingness to extend any additional guarantees. The allied forces at Tejeria had advanced three leagues toward Santa Fe, in order to be removed from the unhealthy localities where they had at first encamped, and measures were in progress to advance immediately upon the capital, should a disposition be manifested to resist the demands of the allies. All reports of conflicts between the opposing forces are contradicted. On the contrary, it is alleged that the pickets of the Mexican and allied armies maintained the most friendly relations, and that the price of provisions in Vera Cruz had fallen materially, H.B.M. gunboat Plover had gone ashore near the bar of Alvarado, and it was thought would prove a total less.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM MEXICO.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM MEXICO.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d9c5b15-cd41-54dc-9126-1f3807c17d4d,375,nyt://article/9d9c5b15-cd41-54dc-9126-1f3807c17d4d

The proposition of the Finance Committee, to allow temporary deposits with the Treasury at an interest of five per cent., was disagreed to.

For all other payments and debts, public and private, the United States Notes are created lawful money and made a legal tender, as in the original bill. In lieu of the alternative privilege of converting the United States Notes into a five-year 7 per cent. stock, in place of twenty-year 6 per cent. stock, when preferred, the Senate substituted the alternative of 7:30 per cent. two-year Treasury Bonds. A specific pledge of the Customs and Land revenues is added to the House bill for the further security of the interest and the support of a sinking fund for the Public Debt.

The Superintendent of the Five Points' House of Industry gave a teaparty last evening to the parents of the children of the schools of the institution. There were gathered about one hundred men and women, to whom a bountiful and elegant repast was given, greatly to their enjoyment. There were three hundred children present, and their delight in seeing their parents enjoy the good things was real and irrepressible. After supper, the old people listened, well pleased, to the beautiful music of their own sons and daughters. The parents seemed astonished and delighted with the proficiency of their children. Messrs. HART, THORNE, PHELPS and MESSER made short addresses, and the whole was a decided success. They are to be continued from time to time. The following is the work of the year 1861: 285,305 meals furnished gratuitously; 1,076 children enrolled in day-school; 326 average daily attendance in day-school; 12,000 articles of clothing given; 1,200 pairs of shoes given away; 975 have been inmates during the year; 150 is the average daily inmates; school children get three meals daily; annual expense from $12,010 to $16,000.

McCLELLAN. It was there stated that the details of the campaign were thoroughly arranged, and on the eve of realization; or to employ the overtasked metaphor of the writer, ""the folds of, the constrictor were tightening around the rebellion, and the coming month (of February,) would see it crushed out completely and forever."" February is just half gone, and this engagement is more than half verified. The rout of HUMPHREY MARSHALL and the defeat and death of ZOLLICOFFER at Mill Spring have cleared Eastern Kentucky of rebels. In Western Kentucky the reduction of Fort Henry, and the seizure of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad, have struck a fatal blow at the insurrection in that quarter, followed as it will be by the capture of Fort Donelson, and the advance of Gens. BUELL and THOMAS into the heart of Tennessee, where the reinspirited loyalists await their coming impatiently. It is safe to predict that the month will not close until, the back of rebellion has been broken by the National army gaining possession of Tennessee and its all-important lines of railroad communication. In Missouri, PRICE has commenced another of those retreats for which he must always be memorable, the pursuers, in this instance, being CURTIS and SIGEL, directed by Gen. HALLECK, whose strong hand grasps surely all he regains from the rebels. Who can doubt that Missouri will be cleared of armed rebels before March? Gen. HUNTER, at the far West, is already moving the expedition which is to proceed from Kansas upon Memphis. He will hardly need more than a fortnight to reach his destination.

This is certainly a different story from the sanguinary bulletin of a thousand killed, which the panic-stricken people of Norfolk sent to us as an offset to the corresponding reports of fearful slaughter on their own side. The rebel loss is probably even smaller than our own, as might be expected from the circumstance that they were protected by their earthworks; but the fact that the whole force, numbering close on three thousand men, surrendered themselves prisoners, make the battle of Roanoke the most illustrious victory, of the war, and, perhaps the severest blow the rebel cause has yet received.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Battle of Roanoke.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Battle of Roanoke.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7187c23a-6168-57a6-8e98-244a9f20914a,759,nyt://article/7187c23a-6168-57a6-8e98-244a9f20914a

Fort Donelson was invested, and the attack upon it begun, on the morning of Thursday, at 7 A.M. The cannonade was kept up with great fury on both sides for the whole day. Gen. MCCLERNAND's Division operated on the right wing and Gen. SMITH's on the left. There was but one gunboat -- the Carondelet -- to play on the Fort, but the others were said to be coming up. It is believed that the left redoubt had fallen into our hands. Three of the rebel guns were dismounted, and our sharpshooters were picking off the cannoniers as fast as they appeared. A considerable number had been killed and wounded on both sides. There were said to be 15,000 rebels within the works, commanded by PILLOW, FLOYD, JOHNSTON and BUCKNER.

"It is hard to say whether the intelligence of Gen. PRICE having again evacuated Springfield, and retreated southward, is to be regarded as good or bad news. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/15/archives/the-rebel-retreat-from-missouri.html,,"It is hard to say whether the intelligence of Gen. PRICE having again evacuated Springfield, and retreated southward, is to be regarded as good or bad news. That rebel chieftain has such a facility, on being pursued, of retreating to where pursuit is said to be impossible, and such a fatal facility of advancing again as soon as our forces have given up the chase and retired to their base of operations, that we have come now to look upon a retreat of PRICE and his army as only the prelude to their subsequent advance. It would certainly have been much better for us if he could now have been induced to make a stand, and at once try the issue, and, if possible, settle it for Missouri, upon the battlefield. We were in hope that our troops were moving upon him in such a way, or ways, as to force a decisive fight upon him at or near Springfield. It may indeed be that that will yet take place before he gets out of the State. There are two roads leading south from Springfield -- one in a southeasterly direction, by Ozark, and the other in a southwesterly direction. Of the two accounts publish, one says that he retreated by the former route, and the other by the latter. If he has taken the southeasterly route, it is possible that he may make a stand at the scene of his old triumph, at the strongly fortified position of Wilson's Creek, or, if he does not, that he may be overtaken by our pursuing columns before he reaches the crossing of the White River. If he has taken the road toward Fayetteville, in Arkansas, it is not likely he will pause in his retreat until he reaches the wild and desolate region of the Boston Mountains, in the Indian Territory, when his forces, if pursued, will scatter, and every man seek safety as best he may. As, however, one of the columns of our army was moving southwardly on a road some distance west of where the Fayetteville road leaves Springfield, it is to be hoped it may come up in time to intercept his fleeing troops. In case he does not make a stand anywhere in Missouri, and our troops do not succeed in intercepting him at any point, there is little doubt, whichever road he may have started upon, that he will pass through Southwestern Missouri, and the northwestern corner of Arkansas into the Indian Territory, where he will join his forces and his fortunes with those of the red rebels. What, in that case, our troops will then do, so far away from their supplies, and from any practicable basis for operations, remains to be seen.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Retreat from Missouri.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Retreat from Missouri.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d20daf78-b3a3-5522-aa8a-6176341509a1,793,nyt://article/d20daf78-b3a3-5522-aa8a-6176341509a1

But for the stolen arms with which FLOYD filled the Southern arsenals, thus arming the South ""in spite of herself,"" as the Richmond Enquirer says, the lack of arms would have almost of itself been enough to have prevented the rebellion; and but for the amounts due their Northern creditors, which they evinced such an alacrity in first refusing to pay and then in confiscating, the sinews of war would have been unstrung. And the truism, that ""He who steals will lie,"" was never more thoroughly illustrated. One would almost think that they had carried into all departments of morals, the same startling boldness and independence of thought, as they would call it -- the same lack of sense and incapacity to reason, as it seems to us, which led them to assume, as the fundamental principle of government, that Slavery is the true foundation of freedom, and that they had thus arrived, also, at the belief of two other similar paradoxes, viz.: That stealing is the best foundation for honesty, and that ying is the corner-stone of truth.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Terminology.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Terminology.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/44eaf6a8-88a1-59ce-95a7-d6286f22d808,660,nyt://article/44eaf6a8-88a1-59ce-95a7-d6286f22d808

"As the army and navy of the Union pierce the interior of the Southern Border States, we are afforded an insight into the real condition of suffering and smothered sentiment among the masses of these misguided people. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/16/archives/loyalty-at-the-south-signs-of-the-approaching-end.html,,"As the army and navy of the Union pierce the interior of the Southern Border States, we are afforded an insight into the real condition of suffering and smothered sentiment among the masses of these misguided people. The official and informal reports of the gunboat expedition up the Tennessee River, after the capture of Fort Henry, have already been published. They are too significant and well authenticated for reasonable doubt as to the state of popular feeling through the Western District of Tennessee and the contiguous counties of North Alabama. The people are heartily tired of a rebellion into which they were precipitated last Spring by mad and unprincipled politicians. They long to welcome back the good old flag under which their fathers established a Constitutional Government, and bequeathed to their sons a prosperous and happy independence. They were more than reluctant to have their State even attempt to sever its connection with the Federal Union. They protested against it, voted against, refusing to commit to a Convention of delegates of their own choosing the discussion of the sacrilegious proposition. But the year before they had elected a Legislature for other and more legitimate duties, and this body, under the false guidance of the traitorous Governor HARRIS, who made himself the pliant and miserable tool of the Montgomery usurpation, passed the ordinance of separation, and entered into the so-called compact of confederation with the Gulf States. A majority of the people, frensied by the grossest misrepresentations, and in numerous counties literally threatened and overborne by the military which had been called into the field against the Union, without waiting the popular consent of the ballot-box, had no choice left to them but to go with their rulers. It was a bitter pill to reverse in June, what they had declared to be their honest and untrammeled sentiment in February. Thousands and tens of thousands of their more independent fellow-citizens refused to the end to vote with them. In some of the Western counties through which the Tennessee River runs, after passing from East Tennessee, through North Alabama, to the Western District, the majority continued against separation. It is these good people who welcomed our River Navy and the glorious old flag which it bore in triumph from Fort Henry, last week, and the same demonstrations were made at Eastport and Florence, in Northern Alabama, where the friends of Mr. DOUGLAS, in 1860, were in the ascendant over Southern radicalism.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Loyalty at the South Signs of the Approaching End.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Loyalty at the South Signs of the Approaching End.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7793c45e-ba4f-598f-ac5a-cb68ded8bf52,1000,nyt://article/7793c45e-ba4f-598f-ac5a-cb68ded8bf52

Prof. A. briefly adverted to the evidence of the great length of the present geological period, as shown by the manner in which the Niagara River had worn a channel below the Falls; also, by the accumulations at the mouths of great rivers. The Delta of the Nile, which has been solid land since the dawn of human history, and which is the work of that river, shows that it has been flowing when there were no men on earth. Our own Mississippi tells the same story. We have no tradition which accounts for the accumulation around the prominent forks below New-Orleans; and yet what is that space compared with the whole distance from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico, all of which has become dry land by the deposit of mud brought down by that river? For there is evidence that the Gulf of Mexico once extended even to the upper bend of the Missouri. In those accumulations of mud we find the remains of the same plants which grow on the adjacent hills, the same shells, and the bones of the same fishes that now exist, just as we find the same corals in the reefs inside of the Florida coast and those outside. But there is one feature in regard to corals that I beg leave here to advert to. There is a gradation in these animals; those that are more compact in form are inferior to those which radiate in elegant branches, and that same gradation is observable in the various levels at which they grow. Those that are found deepest are lowest in structure; while those that grow at the surface of the water are highest in structure. Thus the thought of gradation in the mind of the Creator is manifested even in the coral walls of the depths of the sea. Prof. AGASSIZ here gave a brief account of the physical history of the earth. He explained the theory of the formation of the solar system, from experiments of PLATEAU with a revolving globule of oil in a liquid of the same specific gravity. By means of a rod, the globule was made to rotate with accelerated velocity, until the extreme equatorial portions were thrown off in the form of a ring like Salturus; and as this ring lost its rotation, the tendency was to flow to-gether in a spherical form, constituting a body revolving around the central mass. Thus was exemplified, no doubt, the way in which our solar system was formed, assuming the nebular hypothesis to be true, which was generally conceded. But there is no means of ascertaining what lapse of time it has required for this process; and yet we have to take this part of the history into account in the chronology of the world. The earth being once set off from its primary has thenceforth a history of its own, and here is a field of investigation to be explored. The history, as presented by the astronomer, is not yet taken up by the geologist and followed up. There is a middle ground that requires both astronomical and geological knowledge, which we must wait for another generation of scientific men, educated for that purpose, to explore. When geologists take up the subject it is with our earth as a distinct body, already solidified at its surface, and presenting two kinds of rocks -- of different origin -- the unstratified and the stratified. The first are of igneous origin, and the second are produced by the agency of water. The lavas which flow from volcanoes, when cold, present a structure similar to the unstratified rocks. The stratified rocks must have been deposited in horizontal layers. Our proof of this is the fact that the remains of animals and plants, which form an integral part of these rocks, are found in a position which shows that they must have been deposited horizontally. The bivalve shells, for instance, are always found lying parallel to the surface of stratification -- just as we would find an oyster shell in the mud at the bottom of a river, lying on its flat surface. And yet we find stratified rocks in slanting positions, but the conclusion is inevitable that they were originally formed horizontally, and were subsequently tilted by upheaval. We frequently find stratified rocks sloping in opposite directions on the two sides of a mountain, the interior of the mountain being of granite. Though the granite rises higher at the summit than the stratified rocks, it is evident that the mass of granite is inferior, for these stratified beds can be easily ascertained to correspondent to one another, the lowest stratus on one side corresponding to the lowest on the other, and so on through the successive layers to the highest. In some cases these strata are found to close over the top of the granite mountain. It is a matter of demonstration that the want of continuity of the stratified rocks is the result of breaks which have taken place in these beds when they were removed from their primitive horizontal position into that which they now occupy, in consequence of an upheaval causing the masses beneath to protrude through the strata. Thus we have mountain chains, the center of which consists of masses upheaved from below, flanke by superficial strata thus displaced. And when we consider the fact that in these beds on the opposite sides of the mountain remains of animals and plants are found in the same slanting position assumed by the beds themselves, and in the same relative position and order on the two sides, the evidence is overwhelming that those beds must have been originally formed in a horizontal position, where they remained till they hardened into rock. Now, whatever be the age of these beds, we find everywhere below them unstratified masses, showing that rocks of igneous origin are the foundation crust of our earth. Taking now into consideration another fact, that the stratified beds must have been deposited one after the other, the lowest first and the uppermost last, we must conclude that there was a time when there was nothing above the unstratified masses, and that they alone constituted the solid portion of the earth. That these unstratified rocks are of igneous origin is further proved by the fact that most of the great mountain chains there are found cavities where the unstratified masses have flowed in, soldering the sides of those cavities together. These unstratified rocks contain no remains either of animals or plants, and therefore furnish evidence that at the time of their formation the earth was uninhabited, for there are hardly any animals so soft that none of their parts could not be preserved. The solid parts of animals when once deposited in sand or mud and covered, are there preserved and treasured up for all future time in the solid rock that is formed out of the deposit. In exploring the strata of the earth and examining their contents it is ascertained from the immense number and variety of animals and plants, there found, that at all times since the stratified rocks have been forming, the earth has teemed with inhabitants as numerous and diversified as they are now. Within the limits of this State there are beds of rock so full of remains of animals and plants that the mass of strata consists of almost nothing else. And yet these limestone rocks are among the oldest of the stratified beds on the surface of the earth. Here then we may begin to trace through the successive stata the history of the development and progress of life. We may consider these beds or layers as the leaves of a great book in which is recorded the history of all the various plants and animals that have existed since creation, and the order of their succession. In order to read this book, it is only necessary to study living animals and plants to such an extent as to be able to recognize them when they are not quite perfect. It is not difficult to be able to recognize each tooth of any common animal, and not only to tell to what species it belonged, but to assign it its proper place in the mouth. And this study may be extended so as to be able to distinguish any separate bone, and even a single scale of a fish; and not only tell to what particular animal it belonged, but assign it to its proper place. Having acquired that knowledge, it may be applied to remains of animals which have existed only in former ages, as they are found in the rocks, so that even when fragments of those animals are discovered, a comparison between them and animals now living will be sufficient to ascertain how far they are related to one another, and whether they belong to the same or a different species. In this way geologists are able to refer these remains at once to their different groups, and the result of their investigation is this, that all animals which live now upon the earth, to whatever class they belong, differ from all the animals which have existed before, and that those which have existed in the earlier periods are not the same at different depths of the earth's crust, but each successive bed contains remains entirely different from those above it. So that we may consider the whole stratified crust of our earth as an immense cemetery made up of large leaves and sheets of rocks, within which are buried all the inhabitants that have lived on the globe, and to such an extent preserved that their true character can be identified. And naturalists have already proceeded so far in their explorations, that it is no exaggeration to say that the remains of some of these ancient animals are better known than some that now exist, as for instance, in the interior of Australia, Africa and America. Fossil remains are everywhere found in such quantities that we may make collections of them as complete as of butterflies in Summer. Knowing now the order of stratification and of succession, we find evidences of certain breaks and interruptions of that order, indicating great commotions on the globe. At the beginning of the Christian era Mount Nueva, in the Bay of Naples, rose above the level of the sea some 400 feet, causing the destruction of immense quantities of fishes and marine animals for a great distance around. Before that event everything was going on quietly, animals were dying in the course of nature, and sinking in the mud in regular order. But those beds were disturbed in the same manner, probably, as in former ages, on a grander scale, immense portions of the earth's strata were upheaved and erected into mountain chains. It is these gigantic upheavals, no doubt, which have changed the configuration of the earth's surface, and produced those interruptions in the regular order of succession which we observe in the strata of rocks. Prof. A. here named, and illustrated on the black-board, the various systems or divisions of rocks which marked the successive epochs. Each of these is characterized by peculiar animal and vegetable remains. Thus, Geology furnishes the most direct evidence against the favorite theory of some, that there has been no gradual transformation of animals, but that each successive epoch has been characterized by the same diversity that we now observe, and that the animals of one epoch are not identical with those of another, and we find that all the different types of animals existed in the most ancient times. Radiates, molluses, articulates and vertebrates have always existed side by side. These, therefore, could not have been derived from one another -- for cotemporaries cannot be each other's descendants. On the lowest layer we find various kinds of radiates, mulluses and articulates: and though we do not there find mammals, birds or reptiles, yet we find fishes, so that at least the type of the vertebrates, is represented, indicating the intention of introducing man as the highest representative of that class. So these principal divisions of the animal kingdom have had a common start. But there is evidence that animals have at certain periods ceased to exist, and have been replaced by the representatives of another period. Let me give you the nature of that evidence, derived from the fact that there have been successive upheavals of stratified rocks. In the Jura Mountains, for instance, we find the lowest beds having a certain slant; upon these are deposited other beds that slant at a different angle; and upon [???] we have still other beds which are horizontal. It is evident that here there have been two successive upheavals, for each bed must have been deposited horizontally. And now if we ascertain that the first set of beds is jurassic, the second cretaceous, and the third miocene, we know that that mountain chain was raised earlier than the cretaceous period, and that before the miocene period it underwent a second elevation. It is by such facts that we ascertain the relative ages of all the mountain chains on the globe, and the result of the investigation is, that the higher mountains are the younger, and the lower the older -- all of course prior to the present epoch. It is found, for instance, that the Alps were upheaved subsequent to the cretaceous period, and therefore that the Alps are younger than the Jura. The lofty mountains were once considered as the back-bone of the earth, around which the waves of the ocean had been heaping up loose materials. But if the internal structures had been known as it now is, it would have at once appeared that when the earth's crust was thinner the resistance would be less, and, consequently, only small hills would be found. It is only where the resistance is great that the result is gigantic. The Rocky Mountains are higher than the Apalachians on the sea-board of the Atlantic, and are therefore younger. And this is in accordance with other facts. We find the sand stone of the Connecticut valley standing everywhere, and the cretaceous, and other more recent deposits forming the low lands along the shore horizontal; whereas, in the region or the Rocky Mountains the most recent deposits found on this continent follow the mountain slopes. Thus it will also appear that the oldest chain on this continent is that which follows the great Canada lakes, where we find the very oldest beds slightly raised and following the undulations of the land, while even the oldest fossil-bearing rocks are at the foot of the hills, and do not rise to the summit. Now these interruptions mark the limits of these great successive geological periods. During the intervals between those great commotions the earth has remained quiet as it is now; animals and plants have gone on multiplying, and their remains became buried in the strata, until another commotion produces another change, another configuration, another disturbance of land and sea, and all the concomitant results. And in each of these sets of beds, as I have stated, we find peculiar combinations of animals, but through all ages consisting of representatives of all the great divisions of the animal kingdom -- at first polyps, acalephs and echinoderms, associated with bivalves, univalves and chambered shells, also with worms, crustacea and fishes; then very soon with insects, reptiles, birds and mammals, and at last with man. And now the order of succession in detail I shall present in my next lecture.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LECTURES OF PROF.

These diagrams were made by our correspondent on the island, while the military movements and the battle were still going on. We have already described, in detail, for the benefit of those who had forgotten the lessons of the school-room, the geographical and topographical character of this part of the State, and of the seacoast, and it is not now necessary to rehearse. From the rebel news we publish this morning, it would appear that our troops had taken possession of several other towns since the date of our advices direct from BURNSIDE. Hertford and Plymouth, as well as Edenton and Elizabeth City, heretofore reported captured, all on or near Albermarle Sound, are said to be in our hands, and our gunboats had penetrated the Chowan River as far up as the town of Winton. The position of all these places will be seen on the map, as also their relation to Norfolk and the railroad running south from that point. Hertford is the capital town of Perquimans County, and is situated on the south side of Perquimans River, near its entrance into Perquimans Bay, a branch of Albemarle Sound. It is a small place of some five hundred inhabitants. It is only 50 miles south by west from Norfolk, and there is a road leading from there to the railroad connecting with that great rebel stronghold. Plymouth is the capital of Washington County, and is a small town of 1,000 inhabitants. It is situated on the south side of Roanoke River, eight miles from its entrance into Albemarle Sound. Edenton, the citizens of which raised the white flag on the approach of our troops, is the capital of Chowan County, and contains about 2,000 inhabitants. It contains a fine court-house, a jail, two churches, an academy, and a printing-office, and is a place of some shipping -- inland navigation. Elizabeth City, heretofore reported as in our possession, after being burned by the rebels, is the capital of Pasquotank County, and and has 1,000 inhabitants. It is situated on Pasquotank River, 20 miles from its mouth. Vessels requiring seven feet of water come up to the place.

Some commentators have gathered from this that Job was a reviewer by profession, and rejoiced in the pleasurable anticipation of paying particular attention to that particular book, in the literary columns of some antediluvian daily or hebdomadal. But the only ground for assuming that he was troubled with books as well as with boils, and obliged, in the faithful performance of his duty, to read all that was printed -- there were fools before the flood -- is found in the record which hands him down to us as a man of many sorrows and much patience. It is more to be supposed that Job desired his enemy to become an author, because he knew how fatal it is in the majority of cases, for a man to commit himself to print. An evidence of folly is thus put upon record which will continue until the edition is bought up, and the stereotype plates destroyed.

In accordance with the suggestion of Mayor OPDYKE, the Stars and Stripes were, in commemoration of the glorious Union victories of the week, raised over all the public buildings of the City; and the newspaper offices, libraries, hotels, shipping in the harbor, and tens of thousands of private dwellings followed the example. The emblem of our nationality did not float more proudly in the pulsing air than our hopes beat high at the successes of the cause. And the flag seemed to have a meaning different from that it conveyed during the uprising after Sumter. Then it marked a prophecy, a resolve; now it signalizes triumphant fulfillment. During the ""winter of our discontent,"" too, the flag all but disappeared from view; but now it bursts forth like the buds and blossoms of Spring. Let it not cease its inspiring presence; for if last week was glorious in its victories, this week promises to be still more so -- opening as it does with the illuminated initial of the downfall of Fort Donelson -- the Sebastopol of the rebellion in the West.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/17/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"A brief dispatch received in this City last evening made the gratifying announcement that Fort Donelson had fallen before our troops, and that the Old Flag was waving over it. From subsequent dispatches, giving details, we learn that the battle commenced on Thursday, and continued through Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- the fighting on the three last days being very desperate. The upper fort, or redoubt, was captured by our troops at 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and the Stars and Stripes were immediately hoisted upon it. One of our field batteries, commanded by Col. SWARTZ, was at one time captured by the rebels, but was retaken in the most gallant manner by our troops. Commodore FOOT went into the action on Friday afternoon, with the gunboats St. Louis, Louisville, Pittsburgh, Carondelete, Tyler and Conestoga, and after an hour and a quarter's fighting at close quarters, was forced to withdraw, his boats having been disabled, with fifty-four men killed and wounded, himself among the latter, though not dangerously. Some idea of the strength of the rebel batteries may be formed when it is stated that the St. Louis alone was struck fifty-nine times. The enemy's firing was very accurate, special pains having been taken to collect in the fort all the best cannoneers in the rebel service. Three batteries were playing upon the gunboats -- one near the water, one fifty feet above this, and the third fifty feet above the second, mounting four 18-pounders, the fire of which was reserved until the gunboats arrived within four hundred yards of the fort. Several of the gunboats in this encounter were more or less disabled. Among the land forces, the Illinois Eighteenth and the Iowa Seventh Regiments are mentioned as having suffered severely. The possession of the upper fort, however, gave our forces a great advantage, as it commands the main work, and Gen. GRANT on Saturday evening telegraphed to Gen. HALLECK that he had no doubt of finishing the work yesterday. Commodore FOOTE states in his official report, that had his boats not been rendered unmanageable by the shooting away of the steering apparatus, in fifteen minutes more he would have had possession of the fort, as the rebels were already running away from their guns. A dispatch from Chicago, giving news from the Fort to Friday, asserts that the rebels were flying the black flag.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/659ae96c-4de7-57cd-a31b-809f2db20cc7,1532,nyt://article/659ae96c-4de7-57cd-a31b-809f2db20cc7

To render more clear to everybody the value of these victories, we give the above map, showing not only the important positions which have of late been the scenes of Union triumphs, such as Fort Henry on the Tennessee, Fort Donelson on the Cumberland, Bowling Green on the Big Barren, Mill Springs on the Eastern waters of the Cumberland, and other strategic localities, but showing also the bearing of these points on Columbus and Memphis, on Clarksville and Nashville, on Cumberland Gap and Knoxville, still in rebel hands; and exhibiting, too, the relation of the several places captured, and of those on which our army is now rapidly advancing, to the rebel States immediately south and east of Tennessee, to the Gulf States of Mississippi and Alabama, and to Georgia, North and South Carolina. If the reader will give a few minutes' study to this little reference-map, to its topography, railroads, rivers and mountains, he will gain a more accurate knowledge of our present military situation in the Southwest, and of the directions and places whence our banners will next be borne, than could possibly be given by verbal descriptions.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/17/archives/news-from-albany-providing-for-the-public-defencethe-bill-in-the.html,,"On motion of Mr. STETSON, the bill to provide for the public defence reported by the Committee on Militia and Public Defence was taken from its place on ""general orders,"" and referred to the first Committee of the Whole for discussion. Section first constitutes the Governor, Lieut.-Governor, and Comptroller a Commission, entitled ""The Commission of Public Defence."" Section second provides that the Engineer-in-Chief, the State Engineer, and Surveyor, with three engineers of good professional reputation be designated by the above Commissioners, and constituted a board to consider and report plans for the defence and protection of the harbors and frontiers, said Commission to receive a suitable compensation, fixed by the first Commission named, and their actual expenses. Section third authorizes the Commissioners of Public Defence to procure such heavy ordnance and all its appurtenances and ammunition and projectiles therefor. Section fourth authorizes them to turn over such part or parts of the ordnance, and so forth, as they deem proper, to the United States Government, to become a charge against the United States. Section fifth makes the same provision in regard to small arms, accoutrements and ammunition, as section third, in regard to heavy ordnance. Section sixth authorizes surveys and plans to be made for public defences, and the incurring of the necessary expenses therefor. Section seventh provides for the raising, arming and equipping of a volunteer force not to exceed 100,000 men, to serve for one year, unless sooner dismissed, on the same pay and under the same regulations as prevail in the United States service. Section eighth provides for the erection of the temporary fortifications, recommended in the Board of Engineers, under an impending necessity therefor. Section ninth gives a general authorization of all needful measures for affording security to persons and property in the State, in case of war, invasion, insurrection, or imminent danger thereof. Section tenth appropriates $2,000,000 to defray expenses authorized in third, fourth and fifth sections. Section eleventh appropriates $3,000,000 for the expenses contemplated in the sixth, seventh and eighth sections, providing that no portion shall be expended unless in the opinion of the Commissioners there shall be a necessity, actual or impending, for the use of the same, or a portion thereof, before the next session of the Legislature. Section twelve declares that the act shall take effect immediately. The resolutions introduced early in the session, in regard to the exchange of prisoners, were called up, and upon motion of Mr. STETSON again laid upon the table. The moving spirit to this result was a desire to do nothing which can embarrass a Government whose actions are beginning to show its energy and power so gloriously. The people have confidence in a Government that can strike so vigorously, and will have prudence to abide its course of action. In this connection I may add that the order for the release of State prisoners is here regarded as a masterly State paper, and not only that, but a good stroke of policy, as evincing to those who have been carping at what they called unconstitutional actions, that the Administration is anxious to confine itself to the exercise of its ordinary powers, when it safely can dispense with the use of extraordinary powers. It effectually crushes out all cries of centralization, a growing despotism, and all that sort of thing, which quasi-loyalists have been sounding during the whole progress of the war. Mr. REDDINGTON called for the consideration upon his resolutions upon the liquor-prohibition clause of the Constitution, which were pending at the adjournment yesterday. The question pending was the motion to reconsider the vote rejecting Mr. MCMULLEN's substitute. The motion to reconsider was lost, and the question was then taken upon the original resolutions, which were carried by a good majority. Mr. PRYNE called up his resolutions of congratulation upon our recent victories, and made a very patriotic speech in support of them. They were, however, laid upon the table, in order that, when finally passed, they may include other victories, whose announcement is hourly expected. Mr. MCLEOD introduced a resolution refusing the petition of W.R. JACQUES and other citizens of New-York City, in regard to frauds in the street cleaning contracts, to a Select Committee, with power to send for persons and papers, and to act during the recess of the Legislature, if necessary. Being a concurrent resolution, it lies upon the table. A resolution was passed providing for the holding of evening sessions, after the 18th instant, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings of each week, for the consideration of bills in Committee of the Whole. This begins to look like work, and there is a chance that important bills will now receive their long delayed and needed attention. Mr. TRACEY, of Tioga, called up the resolutions in reference to the expulsion of JESSE D. BRIGHT. Mr. PRINGLE moved as an amendment, seeing that the original resolution was not new pertinent, to strike it out, and insert therefor a resolution expressive of the satisfaction of the Legislature with the action of the Senate. Mr. MCLEOD, of New-York, moved to amend by adding ""and extend their thanks to Hon. PRESTON KING for his vote upon that occasion."" After an expression of opinion upon the question of passing an implied censure upon Senator HARRIS, the gentlemen withdrew his amendment in order to allow members to vote directly upon the original resolution, but Mr. ALVORD again renewed the amendment. Hereupon, a long and animated discussion arose, in which gentlemen pitched into each other promiscuously. The House finally dodged the question by adjourning until Monday morning. The anxiety of some gentlemen to avoid any vote upon this question is not so indicative of a fierce adherence to the Government, as their loud-mouthed professions of fealty and patriotism. But the majority are determined to have a vote, and the resolution, unamended by Mr. MCLEOD's addition will pass. Mr. MCLEOD's amendment, or a resolution embodying it, cannot pass, I think. Many who would be glad to vote thanks to Senator KING, will vote against anything which implies a censure of Senator HARRIS. Just about the close of the debate, Mr. SCHOLEFIELD announced the receipt of a dispatch that two batteries at Fort Donelson had been taken by our troops, and that by that time, the Fort itself was probably in our hands. The announcement was received with loud applause. The victories awaited have now come, and let us hope that the resolution of approbation of our brave soldiers will not be upon the table any longer than Monday.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/17/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"MILITARY MATTERS IN BROOKLYN. -- The Police, a few days since, received a list of no less than 180 deserters from the Fourteenth Regiment N.Y.S.M., Col. A.M. WOOD. The men have all deserted since the battle of Bull Run, several having reached home only within the last few days. The most of these men are still lounging about Brooklyn and New-York and vicinity. The Police have at different times made arrests and delivered the parties over to the military authorities at Governor's Island. During the last week nine members of the regiment were arrested, and they will be taken on to Virginia to-day, together with about 175 recruits for the same regiment. The Police make serious complaints of the attempts of a certain class of lawyers to prevent the deserters from being forwarded when arrested, by taking out writs of habeas corpus under the Baby act. Other subterfuges have been resorted to for the purpose of depriving the Government of the services of these men, but thus far without any degree of success commensurate with the efforts put forth in their behalf. One of the local Judges seems to took upon it as an outrage that deserters should be arrested by the police at so much a head, and has intimated a determination to communicate with the Secretary of War upon the subject. The Police, as yet, have not presented any claim for the $5 allowed by the Government for the arrest of deserters. Not withstanding all the difficulties encountered, the Police are determined to obey orders, and arrest every deserter they can find within their jurisdiction. There is considerable dissatisfaction among the members of the Fourteenth, owing to the changing of their numerical designation to the Eighty-fourth, and also growing out of the extended absence of Col. WOOD, who has been a prisoner in the hands of the rebels since the battle of Bull Run. Under the recent change of affairs it is confidently expected that Col. WOOD will soon be permitted to rejoin his regiment, and that he will be able to bring order out of chaos, Officer COYLE, of the First Precint Police, on Saturday night arrested JOHN LYNCH, a member of the regiment, for desertion. LYNCH is something of a desperate character, and avowed a determination never to be taken alive. A severe fight ensued, during which LYNCE seized Officer COYLES chin in his mouth and was shaking him in true terrier fashion, when fortunately assistance arrived, and the pugnacious LYNCH was safely lodged on Governor's Island. WM. THATFORD, another deserter from the Fourteenth, was also arrested Saturday night, by Officer UTTER, of the Fourth Precinct.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c36211b7-bad5-52f7-a596-46fee600a8ec,518,nyt://article/c36211b7-bad5-52f7-a596-46fee600a8ec

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/18/archives/mr-lindsay-and-the-blockade.html,,"-- It is reported that Mr. LINDSAY, whose thirst for notoriety has already led him to an absurd and intemperate zeal in the service of the rebel cause, intends to present the House of Commons a list of same five hundred ships which have run the blockade. From present appearances, however, it is probable that Mr. Bull will be in no humor to listen to such representations. For English newspapers are inquiring how it is that cotton cannot be exported, if the blockade is really so imperfect; and journals formerly hostile to our National cause, argue that the blockade is proved to be generally efficient by the ""excessive prices of sugar, salt, leather, woolen goods, and other articles of prime necessity;"" and especially by the fact, that ""at Richmond, during the prevalence of ague-fever among the troops, it was impossible in November last to obtain quinino at any price.""

With respect to the rebel steamer he has has but little to say, and prefaces that little by observing that ""she is not worthy to be called a vessel-of-war."" This may account for the contemptuous brevity of his description, which is as follows: ""She was improvised by the Southerners by taking her from commercial pursuits, and armed with a couple of useless guns, manned and sent to sea as a privateer.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/18/archives/general-city-news.html,,"LAUGHING GAS EXHIBITION IN AID OF THE FIVE POINTS HOUSE OF INDUSTRY. -- Nothing daunted by Boreas with his terrific aids of sleet and snow, the tried friends of the Five Points Mission proved themselves other than fair-weather friends, and crowded Cooper Union main hall last night, to witness the scientific as well as ludicrous developments, produced by the action of laughing or nitrous oxide gas upon the human brain. One hundred and twenty-five children occupied the platform, or rather each side of it, while the centre was fenced about and left vacant for the inhalers of the gas. First the children sang sacred and patriotic songs, then Dr. COLTON came forward and stated that, as we all were aware, there was a time appointed to be serious, also one to laugh and dance; this was the moment for the latter, and although he had prepared the gas, he scarcely thought its agency would be required to make people laugh to-night, after the joyous news of the day. Great applause hailed this allusion, which was joined in by the youthful denizens of the Five Points to such a hilarious extent as to call for demonstrations of rebuke from their guardians, although they themselves could scarcely keep their faces straight long enough to scold. The exhibition was a perfect success, and netted a handsome sum which, after the deduction of the necessary expenses, will be appropriated as above stated. So popular have these innocent exhibitions become that Dr. COLTON is in demand among our amusement-lovers, who desire not alone their own satisfaction, but the advancement of some good cause, and he has consented to the proposition of one such for next Wednesday week, in the same hall. The proceeds are to go to the increase of the fund established for sending children to homes in the West. Due notice of it will appear in the City Press. It will also be seen that Dr. COLTON will give one of these agreeable entertainments to-morrow afternoon for ladies only.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a90de68-6ab6-51fe-b6fa-4e9696355e73,1031,nyt://article/6a90de68-6ab6-51fe-b6fa-4e9696355e73

These fundamental maxims, which gave victory to such great Generals as ALEXANDER, HANNIBAL and CAESAR in ancient Europe, and GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, TURENNE and FREDERIC the Great, in a less remote age, are receiving new illustrations in the glorious achievements with which Gen. MCCLELLAN's campaign is so auspiciously opening. Here lies one great difference between our strategy and that of the insurgents. The latter have never exhibited any masterly combinations, followed up a single victory, or reaped the smallest advantage from success, but our reverses have served only to develop our strength, reveal our defects, and improve our discipline, while our triumphs have invariably led to others more decisive and commanding.

The leaders of the army wisely declined to yield to this insane pressure. They saw the necessity of adding to bravery discipline, unity, steadiness; of preparing the entire long line of the projected advance, so that its movement might be nearly as possible simultaneous; of familiarizing the men in some degree to the smaller encounters of the field, so that when the pitched battle or the assault might require an exhibition of nerve and resolution, there should be less danger of panic, terrors and reckless flights.

To accept offer of throne of Mexico; Austrian Archduke Maximilian to accept offer of throne of Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/19/archives/the-negotiations-with-the-archduke-maximilian.html,To accept offer of throne of Mexico; Austrian Archduke Maximilian to accept offer of throne of Mexico,"The idea of creating a royal throne in favor of the Archduke MAXIMILIAN is of less recent date than may be generally supposed. Even before making preparations for the Mexican Expedition, the Cabinet of the Tuileries sounded the intentions of the Court of Vienna as to the eventual reception which the offer of the throne of Mexico to an Austrian Prince might be likely to meet with. The Cabinet of Vienna did not show itself very eager to close with the offer, although great care was taken at first to say nothing about equivalents. is only within the last few weeks that it has been shadowed forth in a very delicate manner. The idea of a connexity between the trans-oceanic extension of the Austrian power and the excision of some of its possessions in Europe. It will be readily understood that this confirmation of suspicions previously entertained was ill calculated to remove the objections at Vienna, and the offer made to the Archduke MAXIMILIAN continued to be looked upon very coldly. The idea then arose of finding some further compensation for Austria in Europe. It was believed, on good grounds, that Turkey would not be altogether intractable, if a good pecuniary indemnity and other advantages were offered against the cession of Herzegovine, as a measure conducive to the peace of Europe. There was certainly a chance at one time that this combination would have had a chance of success at Vienna. But the latest news loads to the supposition that great difficulties are in the way. The Cabinet of St. Petersburgh, which so seriously took to heart the little affair of Suttorina, would never consent to such important territorial changes on the Lower Danube; and it does not appear that Paris and Vienna have made up their minds to go against Russia. We may add, as latest news, that, according to a dispatch just received from Vienna, the Archduke Maximilian's Privy Councilor, M. Scherzenlechner, has just started for Mexico.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ARCHDUKE MAXIMILIAN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ARCHDUKE MAXIMILIAN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Courrier des Dimanche', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d652c9a-0e52-5602-b72a-4e4e0beaa342,487,nyt://article/0d652c9a-0e52-5602-b72a-4e4e0beaa342

Recent occurrences have impressed the Governments of England and of the United States with the enormous importance of such a means of communication, and the President and Government of the United States have decided on giving every support in their power to any well-considered project of that kind. The Government of the United States have in a liberal manner offered to subscribe one-half of the sum which would be required for making the cable, and give the use of vessels of their navy in assisting to lay it, provided the British Government will grant the remaining portion of the sum. Mr. CYRUS FIELD, who took so active a part in reference to the former, Atlantic telegraph, has, we are informed, undertaken a mission to this country, for the purpose of inducing the British Government to act in a spirit of equal liberality, and cooperating with this friendly offer on the part of the United States. As further evidence of the friendly spirit which has actuated this offer, the Government of the United States are perfectly content that the telegraph should have its terminus on British territory, as that will afford the nearest point of communication with England or Ireland. Any arrangements that would be entered into between the two Governments would of course provide for the efficient working and use of the line, and would guarantee its protection by both countries in the event of hostilities. We are at a loss to see upon what grounds our Government can refuse to respond favorably to the offer, which, if not already made, will shortly be submitted to its consideration. The cost of the cable, calculated with the greatest amount of care, and with every improvement, would not be greater than that which was expended on the line from Malta to Alexandria, and which was wholly defrayed by the Government. Our interests with the American continent are not less important than those with India, and even if greater importance were to be attached to our Eastern possessions, it would only render still more necessary a line across the Atlantic, seeing that with the telegraphs which already exist on the American continent, and which now extend to the Pacific coast, it would afford a means of rapid and valuable communication, from the West, with China and our Indian Empire.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Atlantic Telegraph.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Atlantic Telegraph.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Observer', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e00d167-ffb9-5f4a-bb48-ceb975cafeb9,418,nyt://article/1e00d167-ffb9-5f4a-bb48-ceb975cafeb9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/19/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The later and more full dispatches relative to the capture of Fort Donelson, which we publish this morning, add to rather than detract from the immense importance of the victory, especially in a strategic point of view, and considering the great moral force which such a success must necessarily carry with it. Our men fought with a bravery which cannot be too highly extolled, and at a disadvantage in point of position which more than overbalanced their superiority of numbers. The nature of the ground, where the most severe fighting took place, was such that hardly more than one regiment could engage the enemy at the same time, and regiment after regiment in turn stood up before the concentrated fire of thousands of the enemy, and only fell back with the expenditure of all their ammunition. SCHWARTZ's battery was captured by the enemy only after all the horses attached to it had been shot, and all the officers in charge of the guns had been killed. It was recaptured again, however, in the most gallant manner, by a bold dash, in which also a portion of the rebel intrenchments were secured. The rebels, on Saturday, fought in one particular direction with the utmost pertinacity, evidently with the purpose to cut their way through the beleaguering forces and escape, but they were happily foiled in their intentions. On Sunday morning, previous to the surrender, an exchange of brief notes took place between Gen. BUCKNER, commanding the rebel forces, and Gen. GRANT. The former proposed a Commission, to fix upon terms of capitulation. Gen. GRANT replied that he could allow no terms but an immediate and unconditional surrender; and BUCKNER, making a virtue of necessity, yielded with bad grace. It is believed that the five thousand rebels who escaped with FLOYD and PILLOW went to Nashville or to Clarksville, intending to make another stand, in conjunction with the forces already there. Commodore FOOTE has, doubtless, ere this, paid his respects to them once more. There is yet no definite announcement of the number of our killed and wounded.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/19/archives/effect-of-the-new-declaration-of-neutrality.html,,"Small impertinences often vex us more than great misfortunes, and these miserable Yankee ships that have come into our ports, and go steaming about, have become a nuisance which it is absolutely necessary to abate. There is nothing of the dignity of power about any of them. It is as if two potboys insisted upon fighting out their quarrel in the Royal Exchange, to the derangement of the business of the city. Any one of the quiet British frigates lying about could knock all these quarrelsome craft into splinters, just as any policeman could carry off the two potboys, one under each arm. It is the Tuscarora ant the Nashville to-day -- it may be the Sumter and some other rickety craft with combustibles on board to-morrow. To see the Tuscarora with her fires banked, or her steam up, and her guns run out, lying among the peaceful merchant vessels at Southampton or running in and running out, and making demonstrations of zeal to devour a wretched river steamer, it might be supposed that there were no international police regulations in the world, and that we were not strong enough to protect our own peace and quietness in our own harbors. What the Tuscarora has been doing at Southampton the Sumter has been doing, although less offensively, at Gibraltar, and probably the same game would be played among all our merchant shipping in all our ports, scattered all over the world, if it were not stopped. Earl RUSSELL has issued a letter of instructions to the British Admiralty to put an end to this inconvenience. We printed the letter on Saturday, but it is as well to draw attention to its chief provisions. Now, we cannot drive any ship to sea which comes to us in a dismasted state, nor can we refuse any ship water, or provisions, or coal sufficient to carry her home. These are acts of common hospitality, which must be rendered to every floating thing which is not absolutely a pirate. We must give them what our workhouses give to a tramp -- shelter for the night and food to carry them on. But encouragement or harbor, or license to carry on their cockboat battles in our ports, or to interrupt our business with their little fights, is out of the question. We do not allow our own little boys to disturb the thoroughfares with squibs and crackers on the 5th of November, and why should we submit to be annoyed with the two guns of the Nashville or the ""columbiads"" of the Tuscarora, eager as these mighty men-of-war may be to make themselves noisy and disagreeable in the neighborhood of Osborne? The rule of International law is plain enough. Every nation has the right, if she likes, of giving hospitality to the ships of war of either or both belligerent Powers, and she may suffer them, or either of them, to bring in their prizes and submit them to her Admiralty Courts. But every nation has also the right to exclude them altogether, unless where such exclusion would be contrary to the general dictates of humanity. Our Government has made its choice, as we think, very wisely, and has excluded both parties. Earl RUSSELL in this State paper measures out equal measure to ships of war and privateers. He excludes both from all British ports for all warlike purposes. If they come into our waters, except in distress, they are to be warned away, and to depart in 24 hours. If they be in distress, they are to go as soon as they have obtained the repairs and supplies necessary to enable them to sail homeward. If any hostile ships or merchantmen that might be made their prey are in the same harbor, they cannot follow them out until 24 hours' ""law"" has been allowed to the fugitives. All this is old law, which has been already enforced within the French ports without any public declaration such as this now made by our Foreign-office. The comparatively recent appliance of steam to war-ships has made the question of coals a novelty in our international law of neutrals. The obvious idea of supplying a ship of war with only coals sufficient to take her to her nearest home port would not meet the present case, for she would spend these coals in a cruise and come back for more, being again in distress. Earl RUSSELL meets this difficulty by a provision that a ship of war or a privateer shall not obtain coal within the British dominions, even to take her home, more than once in three months.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EFFECT OF THE NEW DECLARATION OF NEUTRALITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EFFECT OF THE NEW DECLARATION OF NEUTRALITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46478090-d2e8-553c-ac6c-f20ec3a4cd21,1037,nyt://article/46478090-d2e8-553c-ac6c-f20ec3a4cd21

By his industry and good conduct he rose from the ranks to a First Lieutenancy in the artillery. An ardent Republican, he was thrown into prison after the coup d'tat, but made his escape and went to England, where he remained a short time. In 1853 he came to this country, and, until the breaking out of the rebellion, supported himself by teaching mathematics and the French language. For three years, in one of the largest private schools in this City, he did his duty in the most thorough and conscientious manner. He took the most lively interest in the advancement of his pupils, shrinking from no labor or drudgery which might in any way contribute to their improvement. He has been known repeatedly to sit up half the night, correcting and recorrecting, with his own hand, their exercises -- paying equal attention to the work of the boy of eight and the youth of eighteen years. His guiding principle was the faithful performance of his duty, and all his conduct showed him to be a most honorable and reliable gentleman. When the rebellion broke out, his old military enthusiasm was rekindled, and he immediately offered his services to the Government.

For while, on the American side the war would have been one of reckless persistency in wrong, on ours it would have been a war in alliance, and, to practical purposes, in defence and propagation of Slavery. We had, indeed, been wronged. We had suffered an indignity, and something more than an indignity, which, not to have resented, would have been to invite a constant succession of insults and injuries from the same and from every other quarters. We could have acted no otherwise than we have done; yet it is impossible to think, without something like a shudder, from what we have escaped. We, the emancipators of the slave -- who have wearied every Court and Government in Europe and America with our protests and remonstrances, until we goaded them into at least ostensibly cooperating with us to prevent the enslaving of the negro -- we, who for the last half century have spent annual sums equal to the revenue of a small Kingdom, in blockading the African coast, for a cause in which we not only had no interest, but which was contrary to our pecuniary interest, and which many believed would ruin, as many among us still, though erroneously, believe that it has ruined, our colonies -- we should have lent a hand to setting up, in one of the most commanding positions of the world, a powerful Republic, devoted not only to Slavery, but to Pro-Slavery propagandism -- should have helped to give a place in the community of nations to a conspiracy of slave-owners, who have broken their connection with the American Federation on the sole ground, ostentatiously proclaimed, that they thought an attempt would be made to restrain, not Slavery itself, but their purpose of spreading Slavery wherever migration or force could carry it.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

JOHNSTON, PILLOW, BUCKNER and FLOYD were all named among the Generals who surrendered. Of these BUCKNER only was actually present to give up his sword to Gen. GRANT. The lateness of the hour at which the correspondence between this officer and the National commander was received by telegraph prevented a correction of the mistake as to Gen. ALBERT SYDNEY JOHNSTON. Had he been present, he would have ranked BUCKNER, and, of course, conducted the negotiation for surrender. But the fact seems to be that he was, at no time during the investment of the rebel army, in or very near Fort Donelson. Gen. PILLOW would also have ranked BUCKNER, but he took himself off during the night of Saturday, and with his staff and certain favorites accompanied FLOYD in the direction of Clarksville and Nashville. The demoralized force that under these two valiant leaders, made their escape on that night, is reckoned at five thousand. There is scarcely a doubt that the number would have been doubled, nay, that the whole army would have precipitately evacuated under cover of the night, had the means of transportation been at hand to justify the attempt, without the hazard of early pursuit and inglorious capture. But the number and capacity of the steamboats immediately above Dover were limited, and the railroad four or five miles in the rear, with uncertain means of transportation at command. Hence the sudden change of Senior Commander, to which BUCKNER alludes in one of his notes to GRANT, from PILLOW to himself.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Situation on the Cumberland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Situation on the Cumberland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df2026f2-d309-5be6-8079-1d9caba2d66f,819,nyt://article/df2026f2-d309-5be6-8079-1d9caba2d66f

Gen. PRICE's army has again fled from before our pursuing columns; and, according to Gen. HALLECK's dispatch, published this morning, the elder PRICE himself and his Staff, as well as the younger PRICE, his son, have been captured; while other, and later dispatches, announce that the entire Missouri rebel army had been cut up, routed, or taken prisoners. Gen. CURTIS set out from Sedalia, about twenty days ago, to do this work; and, after a Winter march of extraordinary severity and celerity, down through the wild regions of Southwestern Missouri, he has succeeded in achieving the splendid success we chronicle. This capture of the man who organized the rebel army in Missouri, who has led it and upheld it through all its varying fortunes, and to whom it was attached with the greatest devotion, destroys all hope of the rebels achieving any future successes, or making any future forward marches in that State. There are still bands of marauders, each a few hundred strong, scattered here and there, who subsist by plunder, and amuse themselves every now and then by capturing some city of half a dozen log huts; these, in a vast, sparsely populated State like Missouri, may be able to carry on their ravages for some time yet; but the martial-law which now rules the State, is rapidly curtailing their range and reducing their numbers. There is yet much virulent disloyalty in some of the heavy slave counties bordering on the Missouri River, and, indeed, throughout the State; but that is now brought under a rigid moral discipline, before which it is speedily disappearing. With the defeat of all hopes of rebel success, disloyalty, both active and passive, will soon become utterly extinct. A small military force maintained at Springfield, will now uphold the National supremacy in the State, while the bulk of the heavy force under Gen. CURTIS, will at once be set free for operations in Arkansas, or to cooperate, after a march across the latter State, with the forces preparing for action in Southwestern Tennessee. This success also clears the way for the forward march of Gen. HUNTER's frontier column, which will soon now be on the move.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'End of the War in Missouri Price ""Bagged"" at Last.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'End of the War in Missouri Price ""Bagged"" at Last.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28221e53-1fa1-5274-8919-65d66bd23bc3,676,nyt://article/28221e53-1fa1-5274-8919-65d66bd23bc3

Observations from Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/20/archives/the-new-declaration-of-neutrality-dissatisfaction-of-the-american.html,Observations from Great Britain,"The publication of the ""The orders and directions for the observance of neutrality"" has not only called forth, as was to be expected, great indignation on the part of Mr. ADAMS, but some difference of opinion among home critics as to the policy and propriety of the course taken by the Foreign Office, for which I was less prepared. There is among us an active and intelligent party of strong sympathizers with the North, who have all along complained that the tone of our Government to the Washington Cabinet has been studiously cold and unfriendly, even if there has been a formal observance of neutrality. This party might be expected to find in Lord RUSSELL's notification a new instance of unfriendliness to the North. But I hear not a few intelligent and well-informed persons, not connected with this party, disposed to doubt the policy, as well as the necessity, of promulgating orders and directions of which the effect will be to close all European ports against both Federal and Confederate ships-of-war. These objectors say that the notification is an innovation; that it introduces new restrictions on the rights to shelter and hospitality of ships-of-war belonging to belligerent Powers with which we are peace. They anticipate that similar orders and directions will be promulgated by France; indeed, one of the most stringent parts of the order -- that which prohibits vessels-of-war from more than twenty-four hours' stay in port -- has already been acted upon by Spain, at Cadiz, in the case of the Sumter. They say that not only are the orders harsh and unfriendly -- which is to be regretted -- but that they would be followed by serious and practically inconvenient consequences if the Federal Government should, as may be expected, issue a similar notification as to our ships-of-war seeking Federal ports.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW DECLARATION OF NEUTRALITY DISSATISFACTION OF THE AMERICAN MINISTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW DECLARATION OF NEUTRALITY DISSATISFACTION OF THE AMERICAN MINISTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'Correspondence of the Manchester Guardian.

Neutrality, if it be more than a phrase, means impartiality. The Nashville, three months ago, entered an English port, laden with living witnesses of an atrocity which at once defined its piratical character. It had seized and burned a vessel, which was returning to the United States, after fulfilling the peaceful mission of carrying broad to the famishing workmen of England. The act was so clearly in contradiction of every principle of maritime right, that a Government which has since deplored hypocritically the temporary closing of Charleston harbor as an inexcusable barbarity, had no right to withhold from the violator of international law and civilized usage the just punishment of its crime. On the contrary, the Nashville was received with empressement. There was no suggestion to apply the law which limits the stay of a privateer in a neutral harbor to twenty-four hours. Supplies were furnished it in abundance, and for three months the vessel lay in the Southampton docks, while the pirates who commanded her were the recipients of lavish hospitality in London. It was only when the United States steamer Tuscarora, arriving in chase of the malefactors, anchored in the same waters, that the British authorities began to examine their text books for an excuse under which the frigate of a friendly Power might be refused the entertainment which had been freely afforded a rebel adventurer; and finding no plausible ground for discrimination, resorted to an expedient, which, while it permitted the rebel to escape, and prevented successful pursuit, closed every British port in the world to the navy of a Power with which the Queen has just been made to say, ""the friendly relations of her Government are unimpaired."" A proclamation was issued, denying the rites of hospitality to all war vessels coming from the United States, in any British harbor. The Nashville, by this ruling, would be obliged to leave her snug quarters, and take the chance at sea of a fight with the Tuscarora; but to save the craft from this encounter, which its officers, had they not been cowards as well as pirates, would not have declined, a British frigate of far superior metal was placed alongside the National steamer, in order to restrain her for a day from following the fugitive. The Nashville is thus dispatched to sea scathless, under British auspices, to resume its work of reckless destruction against the peaceful commerce upon which the people of England and France are dependent for their existence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The British Cabinet and America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The British Cabinet and America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/858b6794-c717-53ca-b18d-b084a811bfba,1115,nyt://article/858b6794-c717-53ca-b18d-b084a811bfba

"The opinion has often been expressed in these columns, that whatever might be the sentiment of the aristocracy of England, or the dubious policy of its Government, a friendly feeling toward this country is now, as ever, cherished by a large section of its industrial, wealth-producing population. The latest files of English papers confirm this view, and show that prior to the opening of Parliament, numerous public meetings were held, at which resolutions in favor of our Government found enthusiastic and unanimous support in various parts of the kingdom, but especially in the cotton manufacturing counties of the North, where the suffering from the war is the most intense, and the discontent at its continuance has been represented as most bitter and emphatic. Such a wide-spread popular movement cannot but have a wholesome influence on the deliberations of the British Legislature. It is also, on many accounts, gratifying to ourselves. For the progress of enlightened opinion in Europe relative to the prospects, resources and power of our National Government will not only prove a barrier to the policy of intervention, but will infallibly develop a growing sympathy, and cement a closer alliance between this country and the nations identified with us in speech, lineage, religion, laws, and a common civilization. At the same time it will inaugurate more signal triumphs for freedom, commerce and human progress, than could be won by the more brilliant achievements of internecine war.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/20/archives/curiosities-of-london-journalism.html,,"To detect and point out a tithe of the malicious misrepresentations and absurb inconsistencies of the leading London newspapers about us and our unhappy war, would be a task equally wearisome and unpleasant. But when these traits of journalism are striking and significant, it is worth while to note them. So we remark that the London Times, in the course of a compact column of sneers at this country and its eminent men, quotes Mr. LOVEJOY as saying that he ""hates England and declares his hate inextinguishable."" Mr. LOVEJOY said no such thing. His indecorous ebullition of feeling, which elicited rebuke on all sides, and especially in these columns, was excited by an object very different from England or the English people: it was the ""English [i. e. the British] Government"" which he said that he hated; and although such a declaration was in the highest degree indecorous on the floor of Congress, yet it did not so outrage the public sense of decency as that one would which the Times has adroitly foisted upon him. The people of this country draw a very wide distinction between England and the English people (ill-natured to them as the latter sometimes are) and the British Government. For the truth is, that the history of the last hundred years and more justifies the conclusion -- and we call the shades of BURKE and FOX to witness it -- that although the English people in their personal intercourse are as honest as any people who are no honester than they, the British Government seeks only to get on -- honestly if it can, and if honestly, to make a great fuss about it; but at any rate, to get on; and that it will reward any man with place, peerage or pension, or all of them, who, by force or fraud extending British dominion and advancing British interests, provides posts of honor and profit for the British governing classes, and open markets for the British merchants and manufacturers. It is this disposition and this policy which has caused the British Government to be regarded with suspicion and defiance by people who still turn their eyes lovingly to Old England, and with a kinsman's feeling toward the English people.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Curiosities of London Journalism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Curiosities of London Journalism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d212c43a-8eb5-5b85-8e82-aecff93221b1,659,nyt://article/d212c43a-8eb5-5b85-8e82-aecff93221b1

There may be some great object of national importance to be attained by their steady attacks upon Gen. MCCLELLAN and their overstrained laudations of Mr. STANTON; but we don't see it. Both these journals insist that Gen. MCCLELLAN had nothing whatever to do with the preliminary arrangement for the combined military movements which were set on foot immediately after the accession of the new Secretary, -- that his removal from the chief command was in fact essential to the vigorous prosecution of the war. It is possible that this may be so, though we have seen nothing whatever in any quarter to render it even probable. And even if it were so, it seems to us a very unfortunate moment for the excitement of the feelings as the discussion of such a topic must of necessity create. Our armies are to move together. The grand assault which has been so splendidly commenced in Tennessee will be followed up, at the proper moment and with all desirable rapidity, on the Mississippi and in front of the Potomac; -- and in our judgment the public Press would be much more usefully employed in arousing the ardor and friendly emulation of our commanding Generals, than in planting among them seeds of discontent and hostile dissension.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Untimely Discussions.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Untimely Discussions.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8a97bc9a-1b2a-50af-9db4-f60455866ec9,707,nyt://article/8a97bc9a-1b2a-50af-9db4-f60455866ec9

The ground assumed was alleged irregularity in the sentence, based mainly upon the act of this State, passed in 1860, in relation to capital punishment. It appears that before GORDON was sentenced, the question of the place of execution was considered by the Judges. They doubtless remembered the unseemly spectacle which took place on the occasion of the execution of the murderer HICKS, on Bedloe's Island, when thousands of people thronged out on the Bay to witness the execution, as if it had been a regatta. And that no such thing should recur, they directed, in their sentence, that the prisoner should be taken back to the City Prison, in which he had been confined, and there executed.

The address in the House of Peers was moved by Lord DUFFERIN, that brilliant and accomplished descendant of SHERIDAN. In the language of the mover, as well as in that of Lord DERBY, Earl RUSSELL and Earl GRANVILLE, the leaders of the Tory and Whig Parties in the Lords, there was nothing more observable than the gratification at escaping an American war growing out of the Trent business, and the eagerness to counsel nonintervention in our domestic quarrels, whatever the provocation. With the slightly supercilious tone of Lord SHELBOURNE, and the thoroughly English arrogance with which he ascribed the entire merit of the recent pacific settlement to the wisdom and moderation of Her Majesty's Government, we may bear with patience, seeing the traditional experience we have had of the defects in the parental John Bull's personal character and habits.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/22/archives/the-execution-of-nathaniel-gordon.html,,"NATHANIEL GORDON, the Captain of the slaver Echo, suffered the penalty of the law yesterday afternoon. A determined, but fruitless attempt was made on his part to escape it by suicide. Every other means had been previously exhausted. Ingenious and able counsel strove energetically to prevent his conviction, but the evidence was too clear to be thrust aside -- so clear that no one can doubt that he was guilty of the crime alleged. Nor did their efforts in his behalf cease with his conviction. Every exertion was tried, every argument possible was urged before the Courts to break down the conviction or the sentence. A very powerful effort was made, also, to reach the clemency of the Executive. It is said that petitions for a commutation of his sentence, signed by twenty-five thousand names, were forwarded for presentation to the President, to say nothing of the meeting at the Exchange on Thursday afternoon. But the endeavors were all in vain. The President's duty was clear to him, and though it must have been most painful, he has shown himself to be, what we all know he is, a man to whom the voice of duty is all-powerful. There were interests at stake too mighty to allow him to turn back the mighty power of justice which this unfortunate man had put in motion against himself. And thus the majesty of the law has been vindicated, and the stamp of the gallows has been set upon the crime of slave-trading in so forcible a way that it will not soon be forgotten. And it was time. That crime has been far too lightly thought of among us of late. That it has been so, GORDON himself was a living proof. Born in an intelligent, law-abiding community, of reputable parentage, with means of education within his reach, an American shipmaster for years, why should he four times have put his life in his hand, four times have gone into a traffic to which the law had affixed the penalty of death? Because our commercial communities had become demoralized upon the question. The ""cursed greed of gain"" had caused them to shut their eyes, had deadened their consciences when the Slave-trade was in question. This City has exerted a terrible influence in that direction. She might well send petitions signed by twenty-five thousand names in GORDON's favor, for his blood lies partly upon her skirts. New-York has been most deeply engaged in the traffic. Her merchants have largely profited by its bloodstained gains; and worse, New-York divines have argued upon the curse of Ham in a way to help on that greed which was urging the merchants and shipmasters into the trade. Religious societies of our City have refused to lend their aid to resist this constantly increasing debauchery of public sentiment, and New-York newspapers have applauded the clerical watchmen that refused to blow the trumpet. And so the navigators and shipping men have lost their sense of the wickedness of the trade, and have come to deride the idea that punishment so terrible should ever be meted out to any one who engaged in it. It has been said, not once or twice only, even since GORDON was convicted: ""They dare not hang him."" Was it a surprising thing that he should have transgressed the law, when there were so many influences around him to suggest that the crime was not great, and that the punishment would not be awarded? New-York influences might well be exerted to save his forfeited life, for the influences of this City had smoothed his way to that forfeiture, and hereafter his blood may be required of some among us who will cry out in surprise, as did another, ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" and be met with the same reply.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Execution of Nathaniel Gordon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Execution of Nathaniel Gordon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bbef8d69-0efb-561e-9aea-28249d11bb75,928,nyt://article/bbef8d69-0efb-561e-9aea-28249d11bb75

In the House, the gallaries set apart for the public were densely crowded. Many persons were unable even to gain admission to the Capitol. After the House was organized, Mr. CRITTENDEN, of Kentucky, in consideration of the fact that the presentation of flags was not contemplated in the joint resolution providing for the celebration, moved that the ceremony be omitted. This gave rise to a long debate as to the propriety of the proposed presentation, which ended in the adoption of Mr. CRITTENDEN's motion, 70 to 61. At this juncture the members of the Senate, headed by the Vice-President, entered, with the heads of Departments, the Judges of the Supreme Court and the representatives of foreign Governments -- officers of the Army and Navy, including Gen. MCLELLAN, coming last. The ceremonies then commenced with a prayer by Rev. Mr. STOCKTON; after which Col. FORNEY read the Farewell Address, which was listened to with profound attention.

One or two of the most vague and indefinite character relate to the pecuniary affairs of his division, the odium being in this instance equitably divided with the other officers of the command. Because there has been no response to these wholly unauthenticated stories, the Tribune hastens to pass judgment by default, charitably inferring that BLENKER is guilty, or he would turn upon his impugners, and demand inquiry. The judgment, like most of those so freely pronounced in that particular court, must be set aside. Gen. BLENKER does demand an inquiry. He has caused the arrest of Colonel D'UTASSY, who is implicated in the circulation of the charges, and investigation will determine how far the recent conduct of the General authorizes such imputations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SCANDAL ABOUT GEN.

Tracing the rumor to its source, we find that it rests upon the authority of Professor EVE, of the Medical School at Nashville, now on a visit to Augusta, Ga. He says that after the fall of Dover, Gen. A.

gives series of lectures at Brooklyn Academy of Music,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/23/archives/lectures-of-professor-agassiz-in-brooklyn-order-of-succession-of.html,gives series of lectures at Brooklyn Academy of Music,"The fifth lecture in the series was delivered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, on Sunday evening, Feb. 16. Prof. AGASSIZ proposed to devote this and the closing lecture to the consideration of the question of the existence of Providence in nature, as demonstrated on purely scientific grounds. The Author of Nature may work by one of two methods, viz.: 1. By established laws, or 2. By direct action. We may recognize intelligence in the constitution of a machine, but the work that the machine does is not intellectual work. Intelligence first devises the machine, and thereafter the machine does the work, and intelligence has nothing to do with it. Now, the question is, are living beings the product of established natural laws, or are they the direct work of the Creator? I have already adverted to a series of facts bearing upon this question. I have shown that there have been interruptions in the sequences of organized beings upon the earth -- that one set of animals, after continuing a certain period, have disappeared, to make room for another, but not in the way in which one generation makes room for another. The earth has again and again been inhabited by successive generations of different kinds of animals. There is a very well-received theory lately propounded by some very learned, but rather fanciful scientific men, that in the beginning animals were few in number, and, as they became more and more numerous, they became more and more different from one another. Let me show, before I take another step, the fallacy of that theory. The lower strata of the earth are, of course, not so accessible as the superficial ones. Now, our information respecting the number and characteristics of the early inhabitants is derived from the remains which we can exhume, and this process is difficult in proportion as they are buried deeper. Then, there is another difficulty which has been entirely overlooked. Living animals exist in profusion everywhere, while fossils are few. We are restricted in our researches for the remains of animals of past ages. Africa, Australia and the greater part of Asia and South America are sealed books so far as regards fossil remains. It is chiefly in certain parts of Europe and North America that we are enabled to compare the remains of past ages with the animals now living on the whole surface of the globe. In order to make a fair comparison we should take the dead and the living species of an equal extent. Let as do so. Near Verona, in Italy, is a celebrated quarry not many miles in extent, from which alone have been taken over one hundred different kinds of fossil fishes, which is more than the whole extent of the Adriatic furnishes of living species. In the neighborhood of Riga, on the Baltic, are found more fossil fishes than the present number of living species in the Baltic and German ocean. So here we have direct evidence that in former periods, within similar areas, there was as great a diversity of animals as now exists. But not to confine the comparison to fishes, let us take shells. In one single region in the neighborhood of Paris, the naturalist LA MARQUE, after ten years' research, described several hundred different kinds of fossil shells, all, of course, different from any that now exist. And yet the number of living species in the Mediterranean, or in any other region of the earth of the extent of 100 miles square, does not exceed 500. And the geological survey of the State of New-York has disclosed in each of the successive strata as great a variety of fossil shells as the sum total of all the living species on the whole Atlantic coast of this Continent. You will bear in mind, that though the number of living species in a particular region is so few, yet the aggregate is very large. The number of living species of fishes on the globe, now known, is nearly 10,000, and the number of shells exceeds 16,000, and yet, taking the fossils of any particular region, they are found to exceed the living species of a very large adjacent area. This is a most powerful blow at the theory that all animals have been derived from a few original beings, which have become diversified and varied in course of time. I will now proceed to enumerate the animals of the different periods, illustrate their character, and show the order of their succession. In the oldest beds we find representatives of the four great divisions viz.: Radiates, Molluses, Articulates and Vertebrates, and not only that, but all the different classes of the first two of those divisions. Of the Radiates we have Polyps, Acalephs, and Echinoderms; and of the Molluses, we have Acephala, Gastropoda and Cephalopoda, from the beginning. Of the Articulates, we have Worms and Crustacea in the lowest strata, but no insects; the first appearance of the latter being in the carboniferous period. Of the Vertebrates, the only representations we have in the lowest strata are Fishes. Reptiles are not found till we reach the carboniferous period. Birds are not earlier than the Triasic, and Mammals at a still later epoch, while no trace of man is found till we reach the present period. So striking are the differences between the various classes of animals at different periods, that the geologist is able to recognize them almost at first sight, and tell to what period they belong. Their characteristics are as distinct as those of the living species. Animals are distributed on the surface of the globe according to definite laws and with remarkable regularity. Each different species has its definite home. Now, in the order of succession there is something quite similar. The idea of an earlier or a later period of existence is associated in the mind of the geologist with the structure of the fossil, just as we associate the palm with a warm climate, and the pine with a cold climate. And not only is there order in the succession of animals, but there is an order which shows, at all times, consecutive thought, which, at the outset, perceives the end. This is something which is never put by mind into machinery; it is something which the architect retains to himself only while he is superintending the work. To present the argument on this subject I will take the class of echinoderms. These are divided into several orders, according to structure. First and lowest are star-fishes, with a stem attached to the ground; second, those which radiate equally in every direction; third, animals with a central disc and radiating arms; fourth, those which have a hemispherical form, with certain anatomical complications, which, without entering into the details, require us to assign them to the fourth position; and, lastly, we have the cylindrically-formed animal which is the highest, being the most complicated of all in structure. As to the frequency of the types of these different animals, we find only one single kind of the description of number one now known to exist; while of the second class there are more, of the third, still more, and so on. Those occupying a higher position are very numerous at the present day, while those occupying the lowest places are exceedingly rare. But let us inquire into their occurrence in past ages. In the lowest beds at Lockport are found innumerable echinoderms all of the [???] of number one -- nothing but echrinoids -- and as many different families of that species as exist of all living species along the whole Atlantic coast. Passing up through the superior beds we find quite as great a variety of echinoderms, but not a single species like those oft he lower strata. Rising a little higher, we find genuine star fishes, and still higher genuine sea urchins, but not a single representative of number five until the present epoch. We find, therefore, that the other in which these animals have been introduced on earth in time presents a similar series to that which we observe in the gradation of the structure of the present living species of the same animals. We have two series which coincide in this result -- one an order of succession in time, and the other an order of gradation of structure. But this is not all. Let us see how echinoderms grow. The little starfish, when it is forming within the egg, and when it is just hatched, is not the same free animal that it is in the adult state. It is a little being attached to a stem or prong, with branches above, forming a kind of cup. It resembles those echinoderms first born on the surface of the earth, the type of which has become extinct, with a single exception. After having lived for some time in that form, it casts off the stem, just as we find in the course of time, a period when starfishes with stems no longer exist, but are succeeded by those that have no stems. So this little animal casts off its stem, becomes free, and assumes the form of its parent. Here, then, we have the order of growth of the young animal coincident with the order of sucession in time and the order of gradation of structure. In other words, we have three different ideas which in their results coincide, viz.: 1. The plan upon which animals vary in their structure in course of time. 2. The order of gradation of structure of living species. 3. The order of growth of the young animal from the egg. What is this but the direct working of an Omnipotent mind? And this result is not confined to one, but to every class, so far as our researches have gone. Unfortunately, we are not sufficiently acquainted with the exact gradation and growth from the egg of every class of animals. But let me take, for further illustration, the class of crustacea. It requires not much insight into their structure to perceivre that of the three groups of this class, shrimps are the lowest, lobsters next, and crabs highest. Now at Trenton, N.Y., in the lowest fossiliferous strata, are found immense quantities of trilobites, the prominent characteristic of which is a body in which the head and tail are hardly distinct from the rest of the body, with uniform transverse divisions of the whole body such as we find in shrimps of the present day. In the middle geological period, especially in the triassic, we find nothing but lobsters like crustacea. They are as numerous in the lithographic quarries of Bavaria as trilobites at Trenton. Then in the more recent sandstone of Switzerland we find scarcely anything but crabs -- fewer lobsters and no trilobites. Now let us see how they grow. The young crab, long before it is hatched, when it first shows signs of distinct parts, presents a shield in front and behind, and transverse ribs just like a trilobite. In fact, it is a diminutive diagram of the trilobite of the earlier ages. But when it is hatched it does not come out a crab, but a long-bodied animal, just like the lobster. So here, again, is the same thought manifested as among echinoderms; the pattern of growth, the order of introduction in time, and the gradation of structure are coincident. Let me now advert to the vertebrates. We have among the vertebrates a similar gradation of structure from the fish to man -- first, fishes, next reptiles, then birds, then mammals, and lastly, man. And this order we can trace through the successive geological formations, showing that the order of succession is coincident with gradation of structure. Let us see if the same coincidence does not exist in their mode of development. Take the egg of a bird. At first it has the features of a fish -- the resemblance being very striking. So here, again, we have the same thought in the mode of development. Is it then, too much to say that when the first vertebrate was called into existence in the shape of a fish, it was part of the plan of that frame-work into which its life was moulded that it should end with man -- the last and highest in the order of succession? We find evidence of this fact in the comparison of the attitude in which he stands with that of the fish, and also in the comparison of the brain. In the fish the brain is only a slight swelling, scarcely raised above the level of the spinal marrow, and the posterior division of the brain is the highest. In the reptile, the posterior, middle and anterior regions are of the same height, and the whole brain is slightly raised above the level of the spine. In the bird the anterior portion is the largest and the posterior region the smallest, and we have a slanting position of the spine. Passing from the quadruped and coming to the man, we find the brain so organized that the anterior portion covers and protects all the rest so completely that nothing is seen outside, and the brain stands vertically poised on the summit of the backbone. Beyond this there is no further progress, showing that man has reached the highest development of the plan upon which his structure was laid. But trace this progress in another aspect. The fish swims horizontally; his body is one cylindrical mass, the head does not rise above the rest of the body, and there is nothing to define the neck. The reptile [???] a slight contraction for a neck; for even in the serpent you can perceive where the body ends and the neck begins, even though there are no limbs to raise the body. But the next step is in the lizard, where rudimentary legs appear, sometimes capable of raising the body slightly; but even yet, like the snake, the animal moves mainly by means of the undulation of the backbone. Then we come to birds, in which the tendency is to an upright position. The bird stands on its hind limbs, but yet it has not reached that position entirely. It requires one further step by which one pair of limbs alone are made to perform the function of locomotion, while the other pair become subservient to the mind. The hand of man is no longer an organ of locomotion, and it is no longer a paw. It is the organ with which we express our deepest feeling; it is the limb with which we grasp our fellow-being in cordial recognition. The brain of man occupies not merely the foremost but the uppermost position. It is not merely forward, but upward -- forward in the direction of all progress in intellectual culture; upward in the direction of all moral excellency; forward and upward towards that Mind according to whose image man is made.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LECTURES OF PROFESSOR AGASSIZ IN BROOKLYN.; Order of Succession of Animals--Scientific Proof of the Direct Work of the Creator in that Succession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LECTURES OF PROFESSOR AGASSIZ IN BROOKLYN.; Order of Succession of Animals--Scientific Proof of the Direct Work of the Creator in that Succession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62e3e3b2-f730-5f65-940e-9740189a035e,2505,nyt://article/62e3e3b2-f730-5f65-940e-9740189a035e

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/23/archives/whats-in-a-name.html,,"-- We have undoubtedly captured the rebel Gen. JOHNSON, at Fort Donelson, and the rebel Gen. PRICE, in Missouri; and now hold both of them as prisoners of war. Over the seizure of each of these rebel magnates we have gloried for one day -- only to discover the next morning that while rebels, hearing these respective cognomens and titles have been taken prisoners, those personages whom the public usually identify exclusively with the names and rank, are still at large. It certainly was somewhat of a damper on our spirits, when we were elated at the capture of the most distinguished commander in the rebel service, to learn in a short time that the General we really had captured, was a fellow whose prenomen was Bushrod, instead of Albert Sidney, and that his title to the rank mentioned was exceedingly dubious, while his claims to military genius were unknown outside of the schoolroom where he had taught the young idea how to shoot. So, again, with the General just caught in Missouri. For nine months past, in that State, our armies have been in constant pursuit of a great rebel chief yclept General PRICE, known to the world as the hero of three of the most remarkable foot races recorded in the annals of war. Twenty-five days ago Gen. HALLECK sent out an army twenty thousand strong to pursue, capture, or kill him at all hazards. Daily we chronicled the movements of this pursuing army, hourly and eagerly we looked for news of its catching the old rebel fox; a week ago it reached his den at Springfield, only to find that he had fled; but, tally-ho! and away it started in pursuit down among the hills of Arkansas. Suddenly a message from Missouri was flashed over the wires that ""Gen. PRICE has been captured. Signed, H.W. HALLECK, Major-General."" And, in truth, PRICE had been captured, and Gen. PRICE too, but alas! as it appeared next morning, not the great old PRICE, but only a cub of the hoary animal, Gen. PRICE, Junior. The old tiger was still at large, his chops red with blood, and his soul plotting further mischief. So, though we have caught JOHNSON and PRICE, PRICE and JOHNSTON still remain the great uncaught.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""WHAT'S IN A NAME?"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""WHAT'S IN A NAME?"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/71a594a0-fa5f-5e24-a88f-fa89deffc542,594,nyt://article/71a594a0-fa5f-5e24-a88f-fa89deffc542

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/23/archives/balize-and-the-negro-troops-of-great-britain.html,,"A writer in the February number of the British United Service Magazine, who dates his communication from Balize, with which place he is evidently well acquainted, deals with the question of colonial military expenditure as itaffects the territory improperly called British Honduras. He regards this settlement as falling in the category of places which Imperial policy demands should be held by a military force, and for the following reasons: ""The late troubles with the Indians of Yucatan point out the necessity of a force being kept up for the protection of the frontier. The navy could do little or nothing toward subjugating these unruly tribes. The shallows along the coast prevent a near approach, and would endanger the safety of even ships' boats. The rivers are deep, but difficult of access, and, once entered, oppose an impenetrable barrier of bush to an attempted landing. With safety, therefore, to this part of our dominions, we cannot denude Honduras of troops."" But who, he asks, cares for Honduras? Why not abandon it? The question will probably be echoed by a large portion of the British public; but the writer, though his description of the place is very uninviting, believes that it is destined to play a far more important part in the political world than its climate, inhabitants, products, or physical development would seem to intimate, and all on account of its geographical position. Writing as recently as December, 1861, he is of opinion that the proposed line of railway from Port Cortez, on the Atlantic, to the Bay of Fonseca, on the Pacific, would be of incalculable advantage, and ""at once raise Honduras in the scale of social advancement.""

A telegram from Louisville brings intelligence that the Cumberland Gap is in possession of our troops, and also that Russellville, Ky., the seat of the bogus rebel Government of that State, has been occupied by National forces. Cumberland Gap is the key to East Tennessee and its possession opens the way at once to all that most important section of the country. It is one of the points the seizure of which has been regarded as of the first importance ever since the war broke out, but which the rebels have been able to occupy and hold for three-quarters of a year. Our troops can now at once move on to whatever point in East Tennessee it may be thought most desirable to seize; they can push on to the seizure of the great ""backbone"" railroad connecting the Southern States of the East with those of the West -- the line of which is but thirty miles from the Gap. Or if they do not at present move any further than the Gap, but simply hold possession of it, they will there furnish a rallying point for the Union patriots of East Tennessee. We shall probably now soon see a general and determined uprising of these long-persecuted, but faithful and gallant men. The troops that have just achieved this most important success are undoubtedly those in the brigade of Gen. CARTER, which left London and Barboursville, shortly after ZOLLICOFFER's defeat, to do this very work. The roads in that section have been shockingly bad; and difficulties and obstructions of every kind have been in the way of the advance; but it seems they have all been overcome, and the magnificent natural gateway to East Tennessee, and the Thermopylae of the West, is ours. As for Russellville, it was there that the recently-erected bogus State Government of Kentucky had established its capital. A body of five thousand rebels have, until lately, been stationed there for its defence. But in the late general flight of rebels from Kentucky, it would seem that these alsohave fled. It is probable that the loyal force now in possession is the division of Gen. MITCHELL, which has reached this point on its way down to Nashville -- before reaching which it will form a conjunction with the immense and victorious column under Maj.-Gen. GRANT. The rebel Government at Russellville has thus been scattered to the winds; that at Richmond will soon follow.

They fortified along the sea-coast, along the Potomac, in Eastern, Central and Western Kentucky, in Central and Western Tennessee, in Missouri, and elsewhere. The white chivalry worked at fort building, the black slaves toiled at it, and Irish laborers were forced to work at it. The rebels finished their forts, mounted their guns upon them, and, sitting down within them, pronounced them impregnable. About that time our sailors and soldiers were preparing to test their impregnability. Commodore STRINGHAM was the first to open the ball. The rebels had constructed two strong forts at Hatteras and Ocracoke Inlets, to guard the gateway to North Carolina, which, if they were held, would effectually protect the whole coastline of that State from the danger of invasion. But Commodore STRINGHAM went down there with a small squadron, with which he performed that celebrated gyratory movement, which so confounded the rebels that they speedily gave up their forts and themselves to his tender mercies. The South Carolinians, too, had constructed their fortifications at Hilton Head, in the latest and most approved style of the art of fortifying -- so far as was known in South Carolina. Commodore DUPONT's naval gyrations soon gave us possession of these forts, and with them a foothold from which to operate upon any part of South Carolina or Georgia. We next went to work on their inland and river forts and strongholds. ZOLLICOFFER's impregnably fortified position near Somerset was possessed -- rather by adroitness than assault, however. JOHNSTON's unassailable position at Bowling Green was evacuated by him, and is now occupied by our troops, owing, again, to the superior strategy and greater force of our Generals. Fort Henry the rebels had built at the northern gateway to Tennessee, to guard against our entrance into that State; but Commodore FOOTE seized, occupied and possessed it, and took captive its garrison. Fort Donelson was altogether impregnable -- so much so that the rebel Generals risked twenty thousand of their best troops behind its battlements; but, excepting the regiments which FLOYD (the thief) stole away, all of these rebel defenders have now taken up their Summer quarters in the tents of ABRAHAM -- and Fort Donelson is ours. On Roanoke Island, again, the rebels had constructed two forts, Bartow and Blanchard not to speak of Pork Point Battery and other batteries; but, strong as were these posts, they have fallen, and the rebel garrison is now boarding al our expense. The rebels are said to have run away from their fortifications at Clarksville; PRICE has fled from his fortifications at Wilson's Creek; and even at Columbus, the Sebastopol of the West, we begin to sec signs of a rebel evacuation. The fortifications at Manassas are still allowed to rear their rebellious front, as it is doubtless well they should be permitted to do so for some time yet. But everywhere else, and at every important point, our navy and army are making brief work with rebel forts.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Walls Manned by Union Soldiers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Walls Manned by Union Soldiers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d37a7fcc-12e4-5185-9960-9a8849ddeff3,667,nyt://article/d37a7fcc-12e4-5185-9960-9a8849ddeff3

The morning was ushered in by the firing of national salutes in different parts of the city, accompanied by a numerous discharge of fire-arms in the hands of the more youthful of the population -- reminding one more or Fourth of July than any other occasion -- and these demonstrations were soon followed by a general display of the flag of the Union in all parts of the city. Not a block could be seen but at least one flag was displayed, and on many they were to be counted by dozens. Up to midday a majority of the stores were kept open, but after that time business was very generally suspended, and the after part of the day was passed, by the people, in pretty much the same manner as all other holidays. Some went to church, others found amusement in more exciting pastimes, such as skating, playing ball, &c. The most attractive event of the day was, perhaps, a game of ball played on skates at the Nassau Pond, between the Atlantic Base Ball Club on one side and the Charter Oak and Star Base Ball Clubs on the other. This novelty attracted thousands of our citizens to the spot. Although the ice was not in the best condition imaginable, there was nevertheless some splendid manoeuvring by the players.

Editorial on prevalent belief that general amnesty is about to be proclaimed,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/24/archives/an-apprehended-amnesty.html,Editorial on prevalent belief that general amnesty is about to be proclaimed,"There seems to be prevalent an apprehension that the war against the rebellion is to have a premature close. Some of our neighbors indicate their fears that a general amnesty is about to be proclaimed, which may have the effect of dissolving the rebel army and of releasing the rebels themselves from the penalties they have incurred. These apprehensions, it seems to us, are groundless. It is by no means impossible that the Administration may deem this a fitting time to reassure the great mass of the Southern people who have been deluded into this rebellion by a studied falsification of the motives of the war on the part of the Government, and to give them to understand that they have nothing to apprehend from the mere vengeance of the Government, and that a prompt return to their allegiance to the Constitution is all that is required at their hands. In this sense, and to this extent, the President may very properly proclaim an amnesty, for the humane purpose of preventing the needless slaughter of thousands of our countrymen. If the proffered terms should be rejected, even the most embittered of the rebels could not say a word against the most vigorous and relentless prosecution of the war.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Apprehended Amnesty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Apprehended Amnesty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/272f6756-ad78-5003-a046-26a56d3f21e7,828,nyt://article/272f6756-ad78-5003-a046-26a56d3f21e7

This is highly important intelligence. Cumberland Gap will undoubtedly be held as a rallying point for the loyal East Tennesseeans, and ultimately as a base of operations against Knoxville. Russelville is situated in Southern Kentucky. It is the capital of Logan County, and is a place of about 3,000 inhabitants. It is located between Cumberland and Green Rivers, about 35 miles from each. The place derives its present importance from the fact that when, a few months ago, the rebels established a Provisional Government for Kentucky, it was selected as the State Capital. A bogus State Legislature has already held one session there, and a bogus Governor (JOHNSON) has been installed in power. A rebel force, 5,000 strong, has been stationed there, until recently, for its protection. All of Kentucky, excepting Columbus, is now clear of rebels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/489e7a20-360d-530f-8dcf-d530c25c250e,847,nyt://article/489e7a20-360d-530f-8dcf-d530c25c250e

On the assembling on the House, however, Mr. CRITTENDEN, the noble old patriot of Kentucky, moved that this part of the ceremonies should be omitted, and after a brief yet interesting discussion, the suggestion was adopted, though by a vote -- seventy assenting against sixty-one dissenting voices -- which strikingly illustrates how easily men arrive at divergent judgments by regarding a subject from opposite points of view. While the presentation of the rebel flags was looked upon simply as a transient formality, designed to lend eclat to the proceedings of the day, and while the insignia themselves were viewed merely as ""trophies won by our brave soldiers in hotly contested battle,"" as a member phrased it, the ceremony was not only unobjectionable, but well fitted to add to the pomp and circumstance of the occasion.

"-- M. HAUTEFEUILLE, the leading French authority on international law, publishes in the present number of the Revue Contemporaine a very remarkable paper on the rights of neutrals, that is noticeable for its hostile tone toward England, which he accuses of arbitrarily taking her own interests as the supreme law. He urges the meeting of a Congress to settle the rights of belligerents at sea, and the formation of a league of armed neutrality, to protect the commerce of neutrals in the event of a maritime war. His plan is to form a coalition of armed neutrality, similar to those of 1669 and 1780, of which France is to be the head. Around her, he urges, will flock all other naval nations, which, thus united, will form an aggregate sufficiently formidable to counterbalance the naval superiority of any belligerents. The maritime equilibrium so important for the repose and freedom of the world, will thus be established. Formed in anticipation of war, it will subsist in time of peace, and become a lasting element in the international relations of civilized peoples. England, he reasons, could not, more than any other nation, take offence at the formation of the league of armed neutrality.

C.M. BUTLER, on ""The City of Washington during the Rebellion."" The lecturer was introduced by the President of the Society, Hon. LUTHER BRADISH, and after some few preliminary remarks, commenced his topic by a general allusion to the traitors of our country. The question had occurred whether the rebellion would have taken place if Washington was situated on the Delaware, instead of the Potomac. A controlling influence at the Capital favored a growth of the conspiracies. Bold and defiant treason was uttered in the Halls of Congress. TOOMBS, WIGFALL, MASON, IVERSON, BENJAMIN, SLIDELL, HUNTER and DAVIS, the master-spirit of them all, made the Senate ring with their treasonable language. The spirit of concession and of moderation exhibited by the Northern members was deemed cowardice and weakness by the traitors. The lecturer often wished while sitting in the Senate Chamber and listening to them, that some master-spirit would rise to rebuke and crush its design. If WEBSTER had been there perhaps this rebellion might have been averted, but Providence had his own ways to perform. ""In revolution,"" says MIRABEAU, ""audacity is needed for success."" NAPOLEON made rebellion know that it had its master when he charged upon the conspirators before the Tuileries. The lecturer reviewed the last days of the Administration of BUCHANAN, and the traitorous schemes of BENJAMIN. When the brutal TOOMBS closed his last speech in Congress he said he was about to go into the war with a torch in one hand and a sword in the other. Referring to the attempt to destroy the City of Washington, the speaker was positive that before the fall of Sumter, organizations were formed in the very city itself for its total destruction. Mr. HOLT received a glowing encomium in the course of the address, for his fervent patriotism and steadfastness of purpose. Mr. HOLT had thus far proved more than equal for all the demands made upon him. He had stood alone and guided the helm of the old ship. After the fall of Sumter, secession began to take a conspicuous form at the Capital; and why the city was not taken by the traitors at that time could not be easily accounted for. After the proclamation calling for 75,000 men had been issued there was great anxiety for them to appear. As a Massachusetts regiment was marching through the city he was struck with their youthful and almost defenceless appearance. This silent column looked as though they were going into a great white tomb as they passed into the Capitol. It was expected every moment that they would be overwhelmed with myriads of armed traitors, and the city be destroyed. The following day was gloomy enough. Confusion and consternation seized upon the Union men, and confidence was not secured until regiment after regiment had been encamped in their midst. Just before the Seventh New-York Regiment arrived, an anxious suspense pervaded all loyal men. A battery on Arlington Heights then could have easily taken Washington.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The City of Washington During the Rebellion.; LECTURE BEFORE THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The City of Washington During the Rebellion.; LECTURE BEFORE THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d1017a3-aeb6-5f83-8b5f-699faef0bceb,799,nyt://article/3d1017a3-aeb6-5f83-8b5f-699faef0bceb

editorials on need for improved system,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/25/archives/wanted-a-good-postal-system.html,editorials on need for improved system,"A bill has just been introduced in Congress, by Hon. JOHN HUTCHINS, of Ohio, to effect some improvements in our postal system. We either have a very inconvenient and imperfect Post-office, or the American public are a difficult people to please, and find fault without just cause. To believe in the latter alternative, is evidently absurd. It may be useless to attempt to look into the causes of our unsatisfactory postal arrangements, but wherever the cause may lie, the facts are not creditable to us as a thrifty, ingenious, enterprising and intelligent people. Once in four years a new Postmaster-General comes into office, and he is usually as ignorant of the details of the Post-office, as a hardware merchant is of the qualities of bottled beer. He usually -- we speak of the past record of several of the late incumbents of that office -- sets up a violent opposition to any postal bill that he did not draft with his own hand. And those bills that have been concocted by the head of the Department have usually been unfortunately conspicuous for their inconvenient, undesirable features. A late Postmaster-General procured the passage of the compulsory prepayment enactment, whereby millions of valuable and important letters have been detained and destroyed, to the great loss, suffering and business inconvenience of innocent citizens. Prepayment is good, and every inducement should be used to persuade and make the public prepay their letters, but when there is forgetfulness of payment, loss of the stamp, or theft of the postage-money by a dishonest servant, to have the letter detained or destroyed in consequence of accidental circumstances, is simply atrocious. Every city Postmaster in office sees daily evidences of the cruelty of this compulsory law, and yet no Postmaster-General has, since its passage, made any comment or recommendation respecting it, except to scold the public for their willful disobedience of the law. Pray, may we ask, must people suffer all the inconvenience of the failure and stoppage of important business letters, without any fault whatever -- where a stamp falls off, a dishonest or careless boy neglects to put one on, or even if the prepayment is forgotten? We have heard of one well-authenticated case, where a witness' testimony failed from this circumstance -- the seizure and stoppage of a letter because it was not prepaid -- and the witness dying soon after, a defendant in a lawsuit lost his cause and an estate worth $30,000, in consequence. Then, too, see the wretched circumlocution, false economy, useless labor and loss of time attendant upon the miserable patching which such a foolish postal law requires. A letter is found in a Post-office box without a stamp -- as several score are every day found in the New-York Post-office -- and forthwith a clerk is set to work to send a letter -- part printed and part written -- to the person to whom such letter is addressed, informing him of the missive held in quarantine, and that if he will write for it, prepay his postage, and send a stamp of the value of three cents, the epistolary prisoner shall be released, and sent along to glad the heart of the recipient. He writes, and his letter is forwarded. Here two letters are prepared and sent, at an expense of time, paper and ink, and three have to be transported, and for this two postages, or six cents, have been received by the Post-office. The full sum of six cents might have been obtained by simply forwarding the letter in the first place, subject to a double charge for postage, and all without any expense of useless correspondence, any transportation or delivery of two useless letters, and with no inconvenience, delay or loss to either party. Really, we are a great people, and have a vast amount of wisdom at Washington, when such a law disgraces our statute books, simply because one man stupid enough to make it happened unfortunately to be in power.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Wanted A Good Postal System', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Wanted A Good Postal System', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Postal Service', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-02-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a6ef509-66d0-5c45-96ef-f389a607c44c,952,nyt://article/6a6ef509-66d0-5c45-96ef-f389a607c44c

We see no reason to discredit this report, certainly none in the high character of our Fortress Monroe informant. And, independent of his news, we have had for a day information of the movements of the National divisions of BUELL and HALLECK, and of the state of popular sentiment at Clarksville and Nashville, confirmatory of the extreme probability of the peaceable occupation of the city, on the arrival of either or part of both divisions. Gen. MITCHELL's column passed rapidly on from Bowling Green, and was within thirty miles of Nashville as early as Tuesday last. Several of FOOTE's gunboats were at Clarksville on Friday, when the Cumberland was rising fast, and there would be no difficulty in making Nashville in a few hours, the distance by water being but sixty miles. A special dispatch to the Cincinnati Gazette, dated from Cairo on Thursday, states that white flags were flying at Nashville as well as Clarksville, and that Gen. GRANT had been invited to occupy both places.

"doubt that the great rebel victory in Arkansas of which ALBERT PIKE telegraphs to JEFF. DAVIS, is the affair of the 18th at Sugar Creek, concerning which Gen. HALLECK sent a brief report five days ago. It appears that PRICE, on his last retreat from Springfield, took the Southwestern road, (the United States Mail route,) and fled toward the Ozark Mountains and the Indian Territory. On his way he was reinforced by five thousand of the rebels lately under BEN. MCCULLOCH, and, if ALBERT PIKE was at the fight, probably also by some Indian rebels. He continued in his retreat, however, until he got as far as the Sugar Creek crossing, in Benton County, Arkansas, where he was overtaken by the pursuing column under Gen. CURTIS, and according to Gen. HALLOEK's official dispatch, was defeated, and again started on his flight, away among the mountains. An evidence of the rout is, that many of the rebels were taken prisoners, and many of the arms which they threw away in their flight were taken by our men. PIKE, on the other hand, gives no details of the action, but simply says that in it the Nationals lost seven hundred men and the rebels one hundred; and he closes with the announcement: ""We have gained another great victory."" Probably they have gained another victory of the kind of which they have been enjoying so many lately -- one of the style of which BUCKNER boasted at Donelson when he surrendered unconditionally all his men, with the remark that the ""Confederate arms had achieved a brilliant success.""

In the West, his armies had just been routed and taken captive; his strongholds had fallen, and one-fifth of his dominion had just been wrested from his clutch. In the South he could almost see the advancing bayonets of his foes. Along the coast line, at twenty points, his enemies were penetrating into his kingdom, and their cannon were at the gateways of every one of his critics. In his front he beheld a host, sufficiently great to annihilate him and every vestige of his power, about to be hurled against him. From across the seas there was no word or sign of hope; those on whom he had relied he now found but mocked at his calamity, and laughed at his fears. Even they of his own household welcomed the flag of his foes, and those whom he had deceived were turning their swords against him. All around him and above him were the evidences of dissolution and destruction. Neither had he within himself the inspiration of a just or noble cause, but only the consciousness that he was going down to destruction, because he had dared to set himself up in opposition to his country's power, to the rights of man, and to the laws of Heaven.

The former slip-shod guardians of society, who used to hang about corner-groceries, and were in intimate relations of friendship with gamblers and pimps, are replaced by a well-dressed, orderly, disciplined force, with much esprit du corps, who are a real terror to evil doers. The personnel of the force is admirable; we doubt if a finer-looking body of men in physical proportions can be found in the country. The old habits of slovenliness and dawdling are mostly broken up. The men carry themselves well, are neat in person, and respectful to strangers. The ""Detective Force"" is very active and well managed, and we believe there is no large city in the world where there is less of picking pockets and petty thieving. Of course, there are some troublesome relics of the old system of police, and the force in some wards needs ""weeding out"" yet. Men are still found who are ready to disgrace the name of an officer of the law, by guilty connivance with criminals, and there is still a lack of thorough military discipline in some portions of the body. Still, on the whole, we may safely compare the orderly condition of our City and its police-management with that of any European city. Crime is on the decrease -- especially among the young -- and is sternly kept under. Deeds of violence occur no more frequently than they must everywhere where five hundred thousand human beings gather together. Every street and lane of the Metropolis, in the darkest hour of the night, is perfectly safe to stranger or citizen. It is true, certain species of crime, as gambling, and the evils connected with prostitution, are reached with more difficulty, but this is due rather to defective legislation than any want of energy in the Police Commissioners.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New ""Truant Officers.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New ""Truant Officers.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b64a4a9d-cd06-54c2-9880-58e8ca223254,837,nyt://article/b64a4a9d-cd06-54c2-9880-58e8ca223254

"-- When the war against the rebellion was first commenced, the people took it for granted that the National forces were to be easily triumphant everywhere, and important successes gained by Gen. MCCLELLAN in Western Virginia served to confirm this impression. Although there was a little grumbling at the wholesale administration of the oath of allegiance after the battle at Carricksford, there was a spice of magnanimity in releasing 1,500 prisoners, which was, on the whole, gratifying to the national pride. The battle of Bull Run put another phase upon affairs, and there were very few who did not wish that the paroled Georgians and Alabamians were in our custody again, for they would have been a very useful commodity in effecting a restoration of the equilibrium of exchange which had so long been against us. There are symptoms, however, that the overweening confidence which ruled the hour at the outbreak of the rebellion is returning, and it is manifesting itself in the same carelessness regarding the safe custody of the prisoners captured. It was all very well for Gen. BURNSIDE to release, on parole, the twenty-five hundred traitors captured at Roanoke Island. It paid a debt of honor which we had incurred on rebel account, and saved the useless expense of transporting this ""elephant,"" as BURNSIDE styled his unexpected acquisition, to some Northern prison-house; but it is not at all gratifying to hear that Gen. BUSHROD JOHNSON, whom we unwillingly accepted as a substute for the redoubtable ALBERT SIDNEY, has, with his staff, ridden unquestioned out of Fort Donelson, -- whither no body seems to know -- or that the prisoners taken to Chicago are escaping by scores from the camp to which they have been assigned, simply for the want of a sufficient guard. It is impossible to tell what phases of ferocity, unexpected success, or the desperation caused by still further overwhelming defeats may develop among the rebels, and our past experience should lead us to be fully prepared for any emergency which may arise.

Editorial regrets temporary lack of telegraphic communication with Fortress Monroe,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/27/archives/the-telegraph-to-fortress-monroe.html,Editorial regrets temporary lack of telegraphic communication with Fortress Monroe,"-- The public has real cause for regret in the temporary failure to complete telegraphic communication with Fortress Monroe. Some weeks ago the TIMES pointed out a few of the advantages which would result from laying a wire between Old Point Comfort and Cape Henry, and one of the first evidences Secretary STANTON gave of the practical earnestness with which he intended to push forward the work of suppressing the rebellion, was in issuing orders for the immediate prosecution of this important undertaking. All the arguments which we formerly urged in favor of the enterprise are as applicable now as they ever were; and what is of more immediate importance, if the order prohibiting the publication of army movements is strictly enforced, Fortress Monroe is about the only point from which we shall be able to procure intelligence of the operations of our forces in Tennessee and Virginia for some time to come. Rebel spectacles, it is true, have never presented our affairs in a very cheerful aspect, and just at present there is little reason to hope for improvement; but a more extended experience will enable us to separate the truth from the false in the reports which may come from these sources, and the meagre information received from Norfolk will go a little way toward appeasing the popular demand for news, which will otherwise soon become so clamorous as to be intolerable even to Mr. STANTON. We take it for granted that our authorities are not to exercise a stricter censorship than is in force in the Confederate States. There the papers are at liberty to publish all they can learn from the enemy, and just at present, thanks to Gen. MCCLELLAN and Secretary STANTON, they are receiving some very valuable lessons by virtue of this license. We do not anticipate that the tables will very soon be turned upon us, and we are therefore all the more anxious to get news as early as possible from the rebel States. Let the line to Fortress Monroe, then, be completed at once. Certainly a single failure cannot decide the fate of the enterprise.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TELEGRAPH TO FORTRESS MONROE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TELEGRAPH TO FORTRESS MONROE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c1ab327-5079-5f00-b6ef-eeea298f164a,354,nyt://article/6c1ab327-5079-5f00-b6ef-eeea298f164a

It diminishes the territory of this Southern District a little, but practically the only effect of it will be to divide the Northern District into two and this makes the remarks of Mr. DIVEN, who reported the bill, seem rather extraordinary, if correctly reported. He is reported to have alluded to the fact that this City ""alone gives more business to the District Court than is transacted in any other District in the United States."" True enough, but that seems to us rather an argument against the bill than in favor of it. If Mr. DIVEN would have any one suppose that the placing in another District of the counties above the Highlands, will make any appreciable difference with the business of this District, he is certainly misinformed. The business of this District is the business of the City, and the only way to give relief here, is to give additional Judicial force here. We do not mean to say that the proposed new district may not be needed for the relief of the Northern District, although that has not thus far been so great as to prevent Judge HALL from coming down here now and then, to help transact the business of this District. But this proposed change should be put upon true grounds, and not upon false ones.

Editorial on Davis reasons for secession as stated in inaugural address,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/28/archives/the-true-cause-of-rebellion-disparaging-discriminations.html,Editorial on Davis reasons for secession as stated in inaugural address,"We have thought it not to be wondered at that reckless politicians, who saw the reins of power slipping from their hands, should have betaken themselves to treason and rebellion, in the hope of being able still to retain them. It was not, however, unnatural that the rebels and their allies should not assent to this view, but should place their action upon very different grounds. The difficulty has lain in their inability to agree among themselves as to the real reason of the matter any better than they could agree with us. Mr. STEPHENS said it was in order to establish freedom upon its true corner-stone of Slavery, and to get rid of that element of weakness which pervaded the ancient Constitution, in that it considered freedom as the true basis of freedom. Mr. YANCEY did not admit this. In his view, the South had rebelled on account of the tariffs which they had heretofore carried through the National Congress. Others said it was because of the Abolitionists. Others attributed it solely to the election of Mr. LINCOLN. All these conflicting views must, however, now be abandoned. JEFF. DAVIS must be considered as having a higher authority to speak upon this point than either YANCEY or STEPHENS, and in his Inaugural he has declared very explicitly what was the real cause of the rebellion. He tells us that it was because the rebels ""believed that to remain longer in the Union would subject them to a continuance of a disparaging discrimination."" We trust that hereafter we shall hear no further discussion on this point. Mr. DAVIS' authority is the highest, and no one could venture to say that the reason which he gives is an improbable or insufficient one. If the rebels have plunged headlong into perjury and treason, into theft and murder, and all the crimes of the calendar; if they have uprooted the peace of a Continent, and brought evils upon the land which will be felt for long years in the sorrows of hearts made desolate, and in heavy burdens to be borne by our children's children; if they have prostrated the prosperity of their own section of the country and quite possibly utterly overthrown the system which, as they claimed, was the foundation of that prosperity -- what are these evils, when weighed in the balance against ""a disparaging discrimination?"" Before this, all the crimes of the old tyrannies must ""pale their ineffectual fires."" Let us hear no more of them. We have learned of a yet deeper depth of atrocity than past history has told us of. Henceforth, if any one speaks of dragonnades, of conscriptions, of star-chambers and inquisitions, we shall say triumphantly, what do all these popular wrongs amount to compared with this continuance of a disparaging discrimination?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The True Cause of Rebellion Disparaging Discriminations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The True Cause of Rebellion Disparaging Discriminations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1121f6e2-6e51-515d-a4a6-9bd8b3cf7fc3,504,nyt://article/1121f6e2-6e51-515d-a4a6-9bd8b3cf7fc3

"-- The explanations which Earl RUSSELL continues to offer in the House of Lords, give renewed evidence that England is preparing for a year of peace. The British Government will not interfere with the blockade. The British Government will not in any form intervene in the American question. The British Government will not aid in imposing a monarch upon a reluctant population in Mexico. In thus refraining and abstaining, the British Cabinet perfectly responds to the sense of the English people, who demand peace at any sacrifice, except of national honor. To the same effect is a statement given in our Washington correspondence. The estimates both for the navy and army have been materially reduced. Both arms of service, for years carried forward on a war basis, and urged as if the great battle of Armageddon was to be fought in this year of grace, on the shores of the channel, are to be placed on a peace footing.

I had all the time since we saw her been watching her motions, and replied to the Captain that I thought I could scare her a little. 'At any rate,' says the Captain, 'try it.' I immediately got my gun to bear on her, which she no sooner saw than she began to turn tail up the 'Passe,' but a little too late; my shell went screeching through the air, and struck her just abaft of the smoke-stack, making the splinters fly beautifully. What damage we did we couldn't find out, but I'll assure you she went up the river at full speed, and we have not seen her since. The Captain complimented me on my excellent shot.

But, in regard to this first great collision of the hostile armies of the West, we find it necessary to add to all our earliest reports. Time and fuller information reveal the battle of Fort Donelson as the greatest battle fought thus far on the American Continent; a three days' desperate struggle between an assailing force of (probably) 30,000 men, and a well-intrenched defending army of from twenty to thirty thousand -- the line of battle reaching for several miles -- the struggle veering to and fro as positions are taken or lost -- the woods and ravines echoing with the crack of thousands of rifles and the boom of at least seventy pieces of artillery on each side. Desperate sorties are made -- batteries are taken, retaken and lost again -- fresh regiment succeeds regiment in the fierce struggle, and in one case, a sally is made with the most determined purpose by some 10,000 men of the besieged force to cut their way through -- an attack which is finally repulsed with great loss. They are three gloomy and deplorable days in the natural world -- though forever glorious in our history.

Editorial on martial law being enforced in captured Confederate areas,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/28/archives/martial-law-in-rebel-states.html,Editorial on martial law being enforced in captured Confederate areas,"dominates in Kentucky, and Gen. GRANT has just declared it in force over West Tennessee. It will probably soon be extended over the whole State, until such time as a new and loyal civil Government can be put in operation. It is impossible for the National Government or the military authorities to recognize in any way the authority of the rebel Governor or the other forsworn traitors now in power in that State, just as it is impossible for them to recognize the authority of the rebel President. They were elected outside of the Constitutional provisions, and have sworn allegiance to another so-called Government. ""Martial law,"" (says Gen. HALLECK, in his valuable work on the ""Laws of War,"") ""derives no authority from the civil law, nor assistance from the civil tribunals, for it overrules, suspends and replaces both. It is from its very nature an arbitrary power, and extends to all the inhabitants of the district where it is in force."" The enforcement of martial law, even for a brief time, will work changes in Tennessee, as it has done in Missouri, where it has been so ably and effectively administered by that eminent jurist and soldier, Gen. HALLECK. The writ of habeas corpus and the ordinary personal freedom and the franchises of the citizen will be suspended; hundreds of rebel newspapers will be suppressed; hundreds of rebel functionaries will be expelled from office; treason in every shape will be sternly repressed; and a quick trial and sharp punishment will follow every infringement of the martial code. This is undoubtedly a stern and an extraordinary mode of rule for the heretofore rampant rebels; but, in the interval between the advance of our army and the establishment of a legitimate government, no other law is possible.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MARTIAL LAW IN REBEL STATES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MARTIAL LAW IN REBEL STATES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6aaaff0e-b1f5-5f00-a24e-4331a3d94a14,436,nyt://article/6aaaff0e-b1f5-5f00-a24e-4331a3d94a14

FELTON, the President of Harvard College, whose death is announced by telegraph this morning, was one of the most eminent living Greek scholars -- a man of extraordinary natural powers and of wonderful attainments in classical learning. His loss will be deeply deplored by scholars everywhere, as his name was one of the few known over the wide world, and his learning and virtues were universally admired. To the College over which he presided, and to American learning, the loss will be irreparable, while in the groves of Greece itself, of which country be was for some time a resident, he had many admirers and friends. He was born in Newbury, Mass., in 1807; graduated at Harvard in 1827; was appointed tutor in 1829, and Professor of Greek in 1832. In 1834 he was appointed Eliot Professor of Greek Literature, the duties of which place he continued to discharge until recently, when he was chosen President of the College in place of Dr. WALKER, resigned. He published many classical works -- an edition of HOMER; an edition of the Clouds, of ARISTOPHANES; editions of the Panegyricus, of SOCRATES; of the Agamemnon, of AESCHYLUS, and of the Birds, of ARISTOPHANES; a Greek Reader, and aided also in the publication of a work on classical studies. He translated, edited and published also many valuable works on scientific and historical subjects, and made numerous contributions to periodical literature. In 1853 he visited Europe, and again in 1858, on account of his impaired health. Prof. FELTON was a member of the Massachusetts Board of Education, and one of the regents of the Smithsonian Institution. In social life he was very much beloved. He was open-souled, generous and hospitable; and his Homeric banquets are mentioned by more than one eminent traveler. In his loss, American classical learning loses its most illustrious ornament, and the world loses an honorable, a virtuous and a noble man.

"The order of the War Department suspending the publication of news of military movements, naturally provokes the comment of the Press. The Press is the ear of the people.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/02/28/archives/the-suppression-of-war-news.html,,"is bidden to be deaf, and its censure to be dumb. The public has, therefore, its incontestible right to question this curtailment of its privileges of hearing and judging the doings of its servants. The same right belongs to the Press, that immediate servant of the people. The journals, which are looked to as the most prompt and trustworthy reporters of intelligence, maintain their repute for promptitude and accuracy, by untiring enterprise and the lavish outlay of money. At great conjoint expense, they support a system of telegraphic communication which reaches over the entire surface of the loyal section, from ocean to ocean. The NEW-YORK TIMES has its special telegraphic reporters at every point of interest, its correspondents with every division of the army. Our readers are able to judge the results of this extended enterprise. The columns of this paper have furnished the earliest and fullest intelligence of those brilliant actions which, during the last six weeks, have done imperishable honor to the soldiers of the Union, as well as to those who planned and directed their movements, and to those who gave to those movements a necessary impulse. With the entire system, which at a cost hardly less than would suffice to sustain an army, has produced results so satisfactory to the public, the order of the War Department is in conflict, and if correctly interpreted as a permanent war measure, must be fatal to newspaper enterprise. Journals whose arrangements are of the same comprehensive and elaborate character as our own, are, therefore, warranted in scrutinizing this step of the Administration with jealous eyes, and only surrendering their well-ascertained privileges upon thorough conviction that the public is best served by misinformation, and that the duty of the Press is to reverse its mission, and propagate ignorance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Suppression of War News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Suppression of War News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/981c797b-71d4-5e35-a362-95c47eb908ae,437,nyt://article/981c797b-71d4-5e35-a362-95c47eb908ae

Dr. SAYRE yesterday presented a long report, dealing largely in statistics, and going so far to show the absolute necessity of general vaccination in a large City like New-York, as to lead to the conclusion that if people will not be vaccinnated when the authorities are willing to cause it to be done free of charge, the law should, for the preservation of the general health, compel them to be vaccinated.
