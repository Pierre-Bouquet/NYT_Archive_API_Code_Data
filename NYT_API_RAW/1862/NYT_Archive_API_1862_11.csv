There is then a prospect of a mighty vote in city and country next Tuesday. The people are at last finally aroused to the real character of the issue. The brief period of earnest discussion has ventilated the field wonderfully. The dust and the smoke which  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/01/archives/the-close-of-the-canvass.html,,"the Seymourite leaders early contrived to raise has been dispelled, and the real principles and aims of these men now stand out in clear relief. It has been made perfectly evident that these leaders mean to weaken and paralize the arm of the President -- that they seek to distract and divide the loyal sentiment of the North -- that they desire to convince foreign nations that there is not spirit enough left here to oppose intervention -- that they purpose to make all things bend to the one sole consummation of a speedy peace -- that they will give or take any terms, and that the whole practical result of their policy must be the yielding to the rebels of everything they have struggled for, and the making them entire masters of the situation. The demagogues themselves have discovered that it is useless for them to try to hide their real motives longer. They have dropped all their first clap-trap about the more vigorous prosecution of the war, and now do not stick at proclaiming that the sooner it is abandoned the better. The have devoted their later labors particularly to fixing the responsibility of the existence of the war upon the Abolitionists, and to maintaining that the war is only continued to realize the ends of the Abolitionists. There can hardly be a doubt that if the canvass were continued a month longer these leaders would come square up to the Beauregard mark, and not only denounce the war as an Abolition war, but denounce as Abolitionists every officer and soldier engaged in it.

"A very important case of burglary and receiving stolen goods has just been developed in the Sixth Ward, and among the parties implicated is the noted ""Red Drop"" loan, better known as Dr. HUNTER, alias Uriah Levison, of No. 3 Division-street, where he has been located for over thirty years.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/01/archives/local-intelligence-important-arrest-of-burglars-a-doctor-of-thirty.html,,"It appears from the facts, as already developed that about two weeks ago the store of JACOB RAUTH. No. 82 Chatham-street, was burglariously entered through the window, and robbed of diamond jewelry, gold watches, rings, &c., valued at $2,500. Mr. RAUTH duly reported his loss to Capt. DOWLING, of the Sixth Ward Police, who detailed Sergeant JOURDON and Officers GOLPEN and RAKER, to make a thorough investigation of the matter. While thus engaged, the officers were not a little surprised to learn that the burglars had again entered the same store last Sunday night, and stole, plated ware worth $40. After two weeks of vigilant search, both night and day, the officers traced a portion of the stolen goods to JERREHIAN DOOLEY, who keeps a thieving resort at No. 23 Baxter-street, but without molesting him at once, the officers first arrested the burglars, who gave their names as BERNARD DUREY, JOHN CAHUL, DENNIS HALLEN and JOHN WARREN, all boys from 14 to 18 years of age. The prisoners not only confessed to the commission of the burglary, and their manner of doing it, but said they sold the goods to DOOLEY. The latter was then taken into costudy, and in turn, after seventeen hours incarceration in a dark cell, confessed to selling the stolen, demands to Dr. HUNTER. The Doctor then received an official visit from Sergeant JOURDON, and after each hesitation admitted he had the diamonds received from DOOLEY in the safe at his residence. Washington street, Brooklyn. The officers there discovered and seized the precious stones, minus the settings, the latter of which were subsequently found at his place in Division street. For what purpose, except to present beautification, the diamonds were removed from their settings, is best known to Dr. HENRY, but may be readily explained on him. In the doctor's house were found rosewood cases containing 18 gold watches, 17 silver [???], 23 gold vest chains, 16 guard chains, magnificent diamond rings, pins and brooches, estimated to be worth $7,000. Sergeant JOURDON, and the officers engaged with him, are strong in the belief that most, if not all of the diamonds. &c found in HUNTER's , he doubtless tells the truth. It is stated as a fact that on other occasions he has received goods from this name DOOLEY, who is one of the most hideous and suspicious looking men to be found on the Points. After the arrest of HUSSER Thursday night, two officers were placed in his house to prevent any valuables being removed from the safe till it could be legally searched. The officers are still in hot pursuit of the balance of the stolen diamonds with a fair prospect of success.

"SIR JAMES ELPHINSTONE, M.P., and Sir FRANCIS BARING, M.P.. were present at the 108th anniversary of the Beneficial Society, celebrated at Portsmouth. on Oct. 15, and both gentlemen spoke at some length. Sir JAMES, in the course of his speech, made the following allusions to the war in America: ""The events of the last month appear to me to bring the period for us to mediate nearer than it ever has been. Both parties have tried their hands at invasion, and have found that, while they are capable of defending their own soil, they are not able to hold possession of each other's territory. It appears that the line of the Potomac is the natural boundary between the two dissentient parties, and I cannot help thinking that the time approaches when the Powers of Europe can be brought together to offer to mediate. Although that mediation may be rejected, and probably rejected with scorn, still it would form a nucleus, which men of moderate opinions in America would be able to fall back upon."" Sir F.T. BARING, speaking on the same subject, said: ""As far as I can judge from circumstances, there seems to be, I am sorry to say, a stroug feeling in America against this country, and I am afraid the interference of this country would rather damage the cause of mediation than benefit. What may happen some time hence I will not venture to prophesy; but at the present moment I very much question whether any attempt at mediation would be taken in that spirit of friendliness in which it would be offered. I need not say that our object would be that the two unfortunate parties in America should make up as far as may be possible, the quarrel between them, and should become what they will be under any circumstanses. I believe there exists on the part of the Government of this country an earnest desire to contribute, as far as possible, to peace between the contending parties. I believe they are the best judges, know most, and have the best information on the subject.

He thus describes the opening of the engagement:  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/02/archives/the-battle-of-chaplin-hills-ky-official-report-of-majgen-lh.html,,"""On the morning of the 8th, on the march, Gen. MCCOOK showed me an order of Gen. BUELL, in which it was said he should move cautiously on approaching Perryville, as the enemy would probably make resistance in that vicinity. When near Chaplin Hills battle-ground, and perhaps three miles from Perryville, the report of artillery to our right and front was heard, and Gen. MCCOOK ordered me to advance my cavalry and infantry in reconnoissance leaving the artillery on an eminence in the road. I moved on with the infantry, preceded by [???] companies of the Second Kentucky Cavalry, Col. [???] BOARD, and when near the [???] of battle Col. BOARD reported the enemy in sight. I [???] the command, sent back for Gen. MCCOOK, and he and I rode forward to front, examined the ground, and chose a line of battle to be adopted if the enemy advanced upon us, and soon afterward moved up to RUSSELL's house, on the hill overlooking the field, and there halted the head of the column. [???] there, the artillery (two pieces) of Capt. HARRIS' Battery, with Gay's Cavalry, continued to fire, and small arms were also heard. GAY addressed a note to me, saying he had been pressing the enemy all the morning, was pressing him then, and much needed a regiment of infantry to support his pieces. I ordered the Forty-second Indiana Regiment to do so, and rode forward to his pieces, and found him and Capt. HARRIS there. The enemy was just disappearing in the woods, far to the front, and out of range of HARRIS' ordinary brass pieces. I then ordered up [???] with two of his Parrott guns, and he shelled the woods, the enemy now and then appearing, until finally he was no longer to be seen, and the firing was ordered to be erased. Everything indicated that the enemy had retired, and it was so believed. Gen. MCCOOK rode off to see Gen. BUELL, understood to be two or three miles on our right. Waiting, perhaps, an hour, I concluded to resume the march to Chaplin Creek, then probably a [???] our front, to get water for my men, who were [???] intensely for want of it.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BATTLE OF CHAPLIN HILLS, KY.; Official Report of Maj.-Gen.

If such was the motive of England, it can scarcely be said to hold at the present time, for England is now acting under the conviction that not only is the division of the Union a fixed fact, but that neither North or South will come out of the struggle powerful enough to contest the occupation of Mexico with France.

MAYOR AND GENTLEMEN: I join with you in deeply lamenting the sanguinary struggle which we see still unhappily continued on the other side of the Atlantic; and I am sure it is the duty of us all fervently to pray the Giver of all good that He may ""Incline the hearts of men to peace."" and may be pleased in his mercy to stop those floods of bloodshed which are beginning more and more to shock the sense of the world. [Cheers.] You have alluded, Sir, in terms of kindness, in the address, to the conduct of Her Majesty's Government, when during the last Winter, occasion arose for the vindication of the honor of England. Sir, it is my deep conviction that, although we are a people becoming more and more attached to the arts of peace, yet we are also a people who, as respects the vindication of England's true honor, never intend to depart from the traditions of our forefathers, [Loud cheers.] Nor can any minister, I am certain, ever hope to stand before an assemblage, such as this, and experience a reception such as that which has been too liberally and too kindly bestowed upon me [cheers] unless he belongs to a Government which has shown itself both sensible in theory of its duty, and ready to apply that duty in practice. [Hear, hear.] There never was, I believe, a case more clear than that ease, in which it was the duty of the Government during the last Winter to indicate that they were prepared to maintain rights which involved, in the first place, the flag of England, but involved, in the second place, all the principles that regulate the intercourse of nations -- [loud cheers] -- and we felt, Mr. Mayor, that we were engaged in vindicating not merely a British interest, and that this was no mere matter of opinion, because it will be in your recollection that with a ready and generous frankness the other Powers of Europe, the greatest among them, above all and beyond all the rest, the great Empire of France, lost not one moment instead of waiting, as has been perchance the policy of some parties and of some States -- instead of waiting to draw some selfish advantage from the quarrels of their neighbors -- lost not one moment in taking rank upon our side, and in declaring that we were charged with the execution of no selfish purposes, but that we were, in the course we had to take, the champions of the honor and of the interests of the civilized world.

Was he knowing to the disunion plot of the Southern conspirators by whom he was surrounded, and was he an accomplice, virtual or conscious, of that plot? This is what Gen. SCOTT practically charged him with, and this is the question which he entirely evades. The opinions of the nation on the matter -- which were formed from the events daily developed in the last four months of BUCHANAN's administration -- are pretty firmly settled in this matter.

Editorial backs Ward,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/03/archives/newjersey-politics.html,Editorial backs Ward,"are well characterized as the Peace Party or Submissionists, and the Unconditional Union or War Party. The indications now are that the latter will to-morrow carry the State. The candidate presented by the Union men of New-Jersey -- MARCUS L. WARD, of Newark -- is a gentleman who, from the very commencement of the struggle, has given his whole time and influence to the cause of the Union, and to the interests and comfort of the soldiers in the field. Of a generous as well as statesmanlike character, his large and enlightened patriotism has been unremitting in every effort, both to sustain the Government, and to lighten the burden of the soldier. He has, without a thought of remuneration, completely devoted himself to the soldier. He has organized and systematized a method of forwarding the pay of the volunteers to their families, taking charge personally of the distribution of the money, and he has always been in advance of the tardy Government payments with sums from his private purse, reaching many thousands of dollars. He has lent a ready and sympathetic car to the wants of those dependent upon the gallant men who are fighting their country's battles, writing their letters, sedulously guarding their interests, protecting them from imposition, and in all respects acting toward the thousands who looked to him for help, as a father or friend. He has personally and frequently visited the various military camps and hospitals, to ascertain their condition, and minister to the wants of the sick and wounded. He has been the founder of a noble hospital at Newark, designed first for New-Jersey volunteers, but afterward being found by the Government so admirably appointed, it was adopted as a United States institution, and now contains over 1,300 patients from all parts of the Union. It is no wonder, therefore, that Mr. WARD is idolized by the soldiers, who have bestowed upon him the title of the ""Soldier's Friend,"" a prouder title than that of Lord or Prince. It is the almost unanimous desire of the New-Jersey contribution to the army that Mr. WARD should be elected Governor; for they feel that, understanding their wants, and with his heart enlisted in their welfare, their interests and comfort would be greatly advanced under his management of State affairs.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-Jersey Politics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-Jersey Politics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New Jersey', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-11-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/778aabcf-b9a4-56ef-8072-a9d56aef2681,553,nyt://article/778aabcf-b9a4-56ef-8072-a9d56aef2681

The experiments with ordnance were, in short, successful in every sense, and the consequence is that the Navy Department is to be informed to-morrow (26th) that the Chilicothe is ready for any service to which she may be ordered on this coast. The machinery worked very satisfactorily, giving the ship a speed of eight miles an hour, or two miles more than that specified in the contract.

"An audience which about two-thirds filled the Church of the Puritans in Union-Square, assembled on Sunday light, to listen to a sermon of Rev. Dr. CHEEVER on the exciting questions of the day. The Reverend gentleman, in his opening prayer, alluded to the coming election as one of the great crises of our National history, and earnestly besought Heaven....  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/04/archives/rev-dr-cheever-on-the-slavery-question-he-disagrees-with-the.html,,"[???] so direct and guide the hearts of men that they might choose rulers who should serve the holy interests of Freedom, and rigidly and religiously bear testimony against the great iniquity that had brought upon us the evils of civil war. Previously to announcing his text, he gave notice that on Monday evening a prayer meeting would be held in the Church, to be devoted to special prayer for the right issue of the elections of the morrow, and that next Monday -- to-day week -- would be observed as a day of fasting and prayer for the country, and it was hoped other churches would join in the services incident to the occasion. Then selecting his text from the first chapter of Malacut, at the fourth verse: ""Thus saith the Lord of hosts. They shall build, but I will throw down, and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the Lord hath indignation forever."" The preacher proceeded to declare the reality and sure fulfillment of the prophecies of God, wherein he declares his hatred of oppression and cruelty, and applied the specific one he had selected as his text to our present condition. To avoid the overthrow and destruction so solemnly announced, we must as a people disavow and withdraw ourselves from all complicity with the barbarous, odious and satanic system of slavery, so separating ourselves from our enemies, who, as the opposers of the weak and helpless, are directly and really under the divine denunciation. To escape this vial of wrath, we must discard what politicians tell us -- that it is expedient for a while to submit to wickedness and oppression -- and firmly place ourselves upon the ground of principle. We have hitherto doomed, and are now dooming ourselves to destruction as a people by disdaining the word of God against Slavery. The President had hesitatingly and partially proclaimed the word of emancipation, but by this very timidity and hesitancy of the act had weakened its moral force. It would have needed no more than the 75,000 men of the first call of defenders to crush utterly and forever the rebellion, had we started with principle and justice on our side. But we had carefully abstained from making any declaration against Slavery, and had taken pains to clear ourselves of any suspicion of fighting for the emancipation of the black man. We found infinite fault with Great Britain for giving the lie to all her Anti-Slavery declarations by refusing to aid us in our contest with the South, and willingness to give aid to our enemies. Great Britain was not a whit worse than we, who had declared and were now ready to receive back the Confederates, nourishing still the great iniquity of Slavery in their bosom, into the Union, in the event of their laying down their arms. We would, they so returning, give perpetual protection and sanction to that most diabolical of institutions, return fugitive slaves, repeal personal liberty bills, restore the slaveholder to Christian communion, and yet expect the blessing of God. But destruction would be our reward. How can we then find fault with England? Our lack of principle is as great asher's. The preacher believed that the contest, between Expediency and Principle was to be the not far distant and general contest in which Europe and America was to be engaged. He warned his hearers against the treachery to justice and right which was now planning to receive back to the Union the rebellious States, with renewed and strengthened guarantees for their [???] system of Slavery. He would not take back a single State or a single shred of a State, except on the terms of full and unconditional submission and freedom to every slave. To no other terms could we expect the acquiescence of God, and they alone would save us from the wrath of Heaven which threatens our destruction. We must not ask consequences in a thing of moral obligation. To do so is to serve the Devil and not God, who bids us obey his law unreservedly. He protested against proclaiming emancipation merely as a war measure. We must do it as an act of moral obligation, which undone is sure to bring upon us the Divine wrath. It is not enough to emancipate the slaves of rebels alone, assuring protection to loyal slaveowners and slavedealers. We must sweep the whole, iniquity away even though every man of us die fighting to clear our skirts of the pollution. He referred to the probability of the recognition by England of the Confederacy, and said that when the representative of cruelty and Slavery should be presented to Her Christian Majesty, there ought at the same time to be presented the Envoy of the King of Dahomey -- both the representatives of the [???] system if man-stealing and man-selling and that when the Southern Confederacy was admitted to the family of nations, Dahomey also should be welcomed as a Christian Kingdom.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rev.

"TWO INGENIOUS COUNTERFELLERS CAUGHT--A very ingenious mode of swindling the banks of this City and State has just come to tight, through the arrest and examination of two noted counterfellers named JOUN CANNON AND Mr. YOUNG.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/04/archives/general-city-news.html,,"The former was arrested, a few days since, in this City, by Officers RADFORD and LEARE, of the Detective force. A about the same time, YOUNG was taken into custody, at Binghamton, in this State, both upon the charge of having been guilty of forgery, under the following circumstances: About three weeks ago, the accused parties went to the Butchers' and Drovers' Bank to this City, where they made a special deposit of the sum of $15, at the same time receiving the usual certificate, signed by the Cashier and paying-teller of the bank. They then went to an engraver named FREDERICK KIMBEL doing business at No. 85 Nassau-street, where they made an arrangement to have a large number of fac similes of this certificate engraved, and also to have a large number of photographs of the names of R.P. PERPIN, the Cashier, and G.G. BRINCKERHOFF, the Paying Teller of this Bank, ready for them at a given time. The examination made yesterday, before Justice CONNOLLY, revealed the fact that after the engraver had executed the order, he then went to the bank and informed the officers thereof of the fraud which he believed was about to be practiced upon them. But the mischief, it is feared, had already been done, and a large number of spurious certificates of deposit were already in circulation. Quite a number of them have been presented to banks in this City, one of which was paid before the fraud was detected. The fact that more than a week elapsed between the time when the rogues were furnished with the false certificates, and the time of their arrest, and also that one of them had traveled as far West as Binghamton, induces the belief that many banks, and perhaps private parties, have been defrauded. The prisoner, CANNON, was yesterday committed to the Tombs in default of ball.

Not even the Presidential election elicited so much strong feeling. Betting ! during the day, throughout the city (confined, of course, to gambling politicians), was strongly in favor of the election of SEYMOUR; and there has not been an election, State, County or City, on which there has been so many gambling bets. In Wall-street wagers were laid on the result from $100 to $5,000 -- the bets being generally even in amount, with the exception that the SEYMOUR men agree to pay in gold, while all they asked, should they lose, was ""Government currency."" And that offer was not confined to the speculators in elections in Wall-street -- about the same percentage was offered freely throughout the City; and when the returns began to come in at the several newspaper offices, showing, as is usual, at an early hour after the closing of the polls majorities in favor of the Opposition, the Seymour men gathered in great numbers, and were exceedingly jubilant. The quiet confidence which they had manifested during the day resulted in the greatest enthusiasm at night, and the feeling among them was common, that SEYMOUR would go out of New-York City with 36,000 majority; and that Brooklyn, in proportion would do better. There was great confidence in the power of money potently applied. The day was beautiful -- the weather as fine as could be desired for an election day, and the voting was carried on orderly in almost every Ward. The same was true of Brooklyn. The arrests made during the day were chiefly of those who had claimed exemption from the draft on the ground that they were aliens -- but few attests were made for disorderly conduct; and for the sympathizers with SEYMOUR, all went ""merry as a marriage bell,"" until late in the evening, when the returns from the ""rural districts"" were placed upon the bulletin boards. Soon after that, the friends of SEYMOUR and Compromise discovered that it was quite late, and retired to their homes -- or somewhere else. Just previous to their arrival at the above conclusion, many jokes were perpetrated at the expense of prominent Wadsworth and Union men. For instance, from the Tribune office, at about 11 o'clock, numerous newsboys rushed out with what purported to be ""extras,"" shouting ""the suicide of HORACE GREELY,"" &c. But such jokes were failures, and when, as we have said, the returns from other parts of the State began to come in, the boys could not find any one who was willing to expend a quarter in postage stamps to perpetuate the fun. Nevertheless, among the Union men of the City there was profound sorrow, in consequence of the success of the WOODS, as against the patriotic men who had opposed them. As an evidence of the belief in which the main portion of the Seymour vote had been cast in this City, and that a majority of those voting for him were not knowingly disloyal, the cheers, when a Seymour majority was declared, were mainly for GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN. The belief seemed to be that a vote for SEYMOUR was so far an indorsement of Gen. MCCLELLAN.

The streaming crowds of merchants, clerks, mechanics, laborers, and sewing women, had stopped a moment, on their up-town journey, to look with incredulous eyes at the staring capitals upon the World Bulletin, which announced of course incorrectly a great Democratic majority Massachusetts, before even the canvassers there had time to collect, much less to count the votes -- but the mass of the streaming populace waited to cat a hasty evening meal before returning to expend their enthusiasm over victory or exhaust their patience over defeat, when the full and correct returns should be displayed upon the newspaper bulletins. At 7 o'clock the space in front of the TIMES Office was beginning to be rapidly filled with the eager faces of the expectant citizens, and half an hour later, an impatient, eager, but really orderly crowd was assembled. The City returns come in somewhat more slowly than usual, but at 7 1/2 o'clock the figures began to be pasted upon the bulletin boards which had been conspicuously placed. Democratic majorities from the City came in first, and drew from the Submissionist portion of the throng repeated cheers. The Wadsworth man maintained a cheerful silence, declaring that they expected nothing from the City, but much from the country. The industrious clerks in the TIMES newspaper office continued every few minutes to paste up -- the crowd meanwhile stretching their necks had straining eyes to catch sight of the figures -- the Seymour majorities of the City Wards, and groans and cheers followed the appearance of the returns. As every Ward began to appear strongly on the wrong side, the Wadsworth men, some of them, grew disheartened, but others clung to their predictions of a fully counter-balancing coming vote. Bets began to be offered. JOHN MORRISSEY, hedging, so it was said, pressed heavy sums upon SEYMOUR, and found some takers, but the majority preferred to wait for fuller returns before committing themselves and their money. The interest in the result of the contest between WALBRIDGE and WOOD was intense. The returns came in slowly. The report from the Second Ward, as announced upon the Tribune, giving the plucky War Democrat a majority, was received with repeated cheers for the supposed successful candidate. But as fuller reports from other Wards and Districts came, in, the loyal men were forced to keep silent.

Not even the Presidential election elicited so much strong feeling. Belting' during the day, throughout the city (confined, of course, to gambling politicians), was strongly in favor of the election of SEYMOUR; and there has not been an election, State, County or City on which there has been so many gambling bets. In Wall-street wagers were laid on the result from $100 to $5,000 -- the bets being generally even in amount, with the exception that the SEYMOUR men agree to pay in gold, while all they asked, should they lose, was ""Government currency."" And that offer was not confined to the speculators in elections in Wall-street -- about the same percentage was offered freely throughout the City; and when the returns began to come in at the several newspaper offices, showing, as is usual, at an early hour after the closing of the polls majorities in favor of the Opposition, the Seymour men gathered in great numbers, and were exceedingly jubilant. The quiet confidence which they had manifested during the day resulted in the greatest enthusiasm at night, and the feeling among them was common, that SEYMOUR would go out of New-York City with 36,000 majority; and that Brooklyn, in proportion would do better. There was great confidence in the power of money potently applied. The day was beautiful -- the weather as fine as could be desired for an election day, and the voting was carried on orderly in almost every Ward. The same was true of Brooklyn. The arrests made during the day were chiefly of those who had claimed exemption from the draft on the ground that they were aliens -- but few arrests were made for disorderly conduct; and for the sympathizers with SEYMOUR, all went ""merry as a marriage bell,"" until late in the evening, when the returns from the ""rural districts"" were placed upon the bulletin boards. Soon after that, the friends of SEYMOUR and Compromise discovered that it was quite late, and retired to their homes -- or somewhere else. Just previous to their arrival at the above conclusion, many jokes were perpetrated at the expense of prominent Wadsworth and Union men. For instance, from the Tribune office, at about 11 o'clock, numerous newsboys rushed out with what purported to be ""extras,"" shouting ""the suicide of HORACE GREELY,"" &c. But such jokes were failures, and when, as we have said, the returns from other parts of the State began to come in, the boys could not find any one who was willing to expend a quarter in postage stamps to perpetuate the fun. Nevertheless, among the Union men of the City there was profound sorrow, in consequence of the success of the WOODS, as against the patriotic men who had opposed them. As an evidence of the belief in which the main portion of the Seymour vote had been cast in this City, and that a majority of those voting for him were not knowingly disloyal, the cheers, when a Seymour majority was declared, were mainly for GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN. The belief seemed to be that a vote for SEYMOUR was so far an indorsement of Gen. MCCLELLAN.

Like busy giants they work on, not stopping to inquire whether the world around them is awake or asleep, at peace or at war. The HARPERS seem very early to have recognized the truth that the demand for good hooks can never be supplied, and evidently they intend to act on it just as long as paper can be found in market. It is a notable fact that a book bearing the indorsement ""HARPER & BROS,'"" on its back is generally safe to read or to buy. Running through the long list of their publications for the past twenty years, very few can be found that had better have been left unpublished, very few that are not works of permanent value as well as of momentary interest, and calculated to enrich as well as adorn the library. Of course, Franklin-square has its amiable weaknesses, and occasionally publishes a young author merely for his gratification, and not at all with a view to its own profit and renown.

editorial on campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/07/archives/campaign-of-the-mountains-the-carbel-gaps-we-publish-a-section-of.html,editorial on campaign,"map of Virginia this morning, for the purpose of showing the region in which our army is now operating, and its relation to the rebel position at Winchester. From Harper's Ferry one column under BURNSIDE has marched southward along the east side of the Blue Ridge, while another column, under SIGEL, has moved southward in the direction of the Bull Run Mountains, which run for a short distance parallel with the Blue Ridge. The work of these bodies has so far been confined to the capturing of the mountain gaps or passes, through which communication from Winchester is maintained with Eastern Virginia. The great importance of Snicker's Gap, which we look on the first day of this week, will be observed at a glance. There is a good turnpike leading directly from Winchester, through Berryville, to the Shenandoah River, at which crossing there is a bridge, and from thence it cuts through the various mountain ranges and spurs till you reach Aldie, from which a march north to Leesburgh or east to Fairfax Court-house or any point in front of Washington, is easy. Ashby's Gap, likewise in our hands, is of equal importance. The road from Winchester to this pass is very direct, and after cutting through the Blue Ridge, it divides into two lines, one leading southeast and the other directly east, the latter line converging at Aldie with the Snicker's Gap road, and from thence, of course, leading to the some places. Continuing south from Ashby's Gap, the next important pass we come to is Manassas Gap, which, at lates, advices, had not fallen into our hands. Through this runs the railroad leading into Eastern Virginia, and connecting at Manassas Junction with the Orange and Alexandria line. If Gen. BURNSIDE has [???] of, taken Manassas Gap, Gen. SIGEL, operating eastwardly from BURNSIDE, has captured. Thorough fare Gap, also on the Manassas line of railroad, and which lies between the Bull Run and Bond Mountains.

Editorial on ex-Mayor Wood views on war now he has been elected to Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/08/archives/let-the-president-stand-firm.html,Editorial on ex-Mayor Wood views on war now he has been elected to Congress,"Nobody who knows the vaulting audacity of the man FERNANDO WOOD, can doubt, now that he is elected, that he will make good his promise to his liegemen, to ""go to the President and tell him that without we have a change of measures, so help me God! we will make a change of men."" The President may as well make up his mind at once to be soon bullied and brow-beaten in a style that he has never before seen or heard of; -- that is to say, if he does not ""put his foot down"" at the first rampant word. Of course FERNANDO does not intend to operate slope. He will choose unto himself seven other spirits as presumptuous as himself, and with them he will assume to speak in the name of the triumphant Democratic Party. Not entirely without reason, either. Every reader of history understands that in revolutionary times. It is almost invariably the holdest and the most violent who lead; and really if the Democratic Party, as revived, is to have any leadership in Washington, we know of nobody so likely to succeed to it as FERNANDO WOOD. At all events, whatever the power behind him, this man will attempt to use against the Presdent all the airs of authority and all the arts of intimidation, of which his long discipline in the democratic politics of this city -- the most mephistophilian school extant -- has made him the complete master.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Let the President Stand Firm.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Let the President Stand Firm.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ef7148a-2bca-568f-bab0-36da38d7f07b,835,nyt://article/5ef7148a-2bca-568f-bab0-36da38d7f07b

He had no military education and but limited opportunities for literary culture. Early in life he embarked in the lumber trade on the Penobscot and by his energy and strict attention to business amassed a large property, which was nearly all swept from him by the commercial reverses of 1857. When the rebellion broke out, although his business had so revived as to give him every reason to believe that he might speedily repair his pecuniary losses, he relinquished everything and at once offered his services to the Governor of the State. He was appointed Colonel of the First Maine Regiment and commanded it with such skill and bravery in the battle of Bull Run, that he received the official commendtion of Generals Keyes and Tyler. On Sept. 3, Col. Jameson was made Brigadier-General. His troops were the first to enter Yorktown after its evacuation by the rebels, and during the Peninsula campaign he conducted himself in such a manner as to show that his promotion was deserved.

We recognize this fact now. The Tribune declares that it found no supporter of SEYMOUR, who did not support him ""as the Peace candidate."" Our own experience is different.

It was alleged that WILKES, with his squadron, had blockaded Bermuda, and refused to withdraw his ships at the request of the Governor. This report lacked confirmation and received but little credence, but it nevertheless had its effect. Mr. GLADSTONE had reiterated his sentiments on the American question, in a letter written to a Manchester merchant. He took occasion to say, however, ""that to form opinions upon questions of policy, to announce them to the world, and to take, or be a party to taking any of the steps necessary for giving them effect, are matters which, though connected together, are in themselves distinct, and which may be separated by intervals of time, longer or shorter, according to the particular circumstances of the case.""

The vault is built of bricks, cement and iron. The walls of the Custom-house form two sides of the vault which stands in a corner of the room occupied by the Collector of Customs. The vault is strongly constructed. The walls are about fourteen inches thick and between every layer of bricks there is also a layer of crossed and riveted iron firmly imbedded in the cement. The vault contained all the money belonging to the Pay Department, as well as a large sum to be disbursed by Major HILL, who is acting as mustering officer here. The burglars, though amply provided with tools, could not open the heavy iron door of the vault, so they set to work with crow-bar and chisel to dig a hole through the only exposed side. They succeeded in digging out the bricks and making a large aperture in the wall, but the iron still remained and could not be removed. The portion of the money not contained in small iron safes, but in packages and bags, was located at a point some four or five feet from the aperture in the vault. Not being able to get into the vault, the burglars improvised a hook, with which they attempted to drag the bags up to the aperture, but again the iron bars interfered. They could see and feel the money, but could not get at it. The work accomplished by the rascals must have occupied several hours, and it is thought that the early dawn must have caught them in the state of progress we have described, and thus they were compelled to abandon their work without taking away a single red cent.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SECURITY OF THE CROSS BARS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SECURITY OF THE CROSS BARS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Wheeling (Va.)

The main building is divided into apartments for the accommodation of the Superintendents and Assistants, and conveniences are provided for 350 children. The second, third and fourth floors were used as sleeping apartments. Heat was furnished by means of furnaces, two of which were located in the basement under the north wing, and two under the south wing. The main entrances in front and rear of the centre building, the halls and stairways, were all of wide dimensions, and to this feature, together with the presence of mind and the activity displayed by those in charge, it is mainly owing that the conflagragration did not result more disastrously -- for, as near as could be ascertained, two children only, out of 248, lost their lives.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TERRIBLE DISASTER; Destruction of the Brooklyn Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum by Fire.

There is but one mine of this ore in the world. The zinc being first extracted from the ore, the residue is the brilliant and singular metal which we have named ""Crystalized Iron."" For many years, no use was made of this metal, and it was simply kept in small specimens in gentlemen's cabinets as a curiosity. However, a use has at last been found for it, and, since it has proved so superior in this instance, many other avenues for its introduction are now opening, and it bids fair to prove not only one of the most remarkable, but one of the best metals the world has ever known. As a preventive against drilling, when combined with wrought iron and steel, it is the best and most perfect protection against a burglar now known. Chilled iron, by late improvements in hardening drills, can be easily bored. Hardened steel is not only so brittle as to be almost useless, but its temper can be drawn by a blow-pipe, and then it is at the mercy of the burglar's tools. With ""the crystalized"" the case is different; it can be furnished any thickness, is not so brittle as any other hard metal, cannot be affected by a blow-pipe, and is the hardest material to bore through ever yet produced.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TO BANKS AND BANKERS.; THE NEW DISCOVERY!

This report lacked confirmation and received but little credence, but it nevertheless had its effect. Mr. GLADSTONE had reiterated his sentiments on the American question, in a letter written to a Manchester merchant. He took occasion to say, however, ""that to form opinions upon questions of policy, to announce them to the world, and to take, or be a party to taking any of the steps necessary for giving them effect, are matters which, though connected together, are in themselves distinct, and which may be separated by intervals of time, longer or shorter, according to the particular circumstances of the case.""

"Editorial lauds Pleasanton, now pursuing Stuart cavalry",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/10/archives/a-brilliant-cavalry-officer.html,"Editorial lauds Pleasanton, now pursuing Stuart cavalry"," -- Almost every day for the last two months, we have recorded some splendid exploit on the part of that valiant and invincible cavalry officer, Gen. ALFRED PLEASANTON. He first appeared prominently after the battle of Antietam, when he harassed terribly the enemy's rear, pursued them hotly to the Potomac, and played havoc among their faltering regiments. Subsequently he was sent in chase of STUART, being permitted to start just about the time the rebel officer was sweeping along our left line; and though it was preposterous to suppose that he could actually overtake STUART, yet he and his men made one of the most remarkable gallopades that we have had in the course of the war. Since our army began to move along the east side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, PLEASANTON seems to have been in perpetual pursuit of the foe and perpetual fight; and in every case has he been victorious. He has met STUART and his men, heretofore the terror of our army, on half a dozen occasions, and in every instance STUART's horse has shown PLEASANTON his tail. On Saturday we gave a vivid pen-picture, from our correspondent, of the three days' exciting chase after STUART's cavalry, which ended on Monday evening last, and in which, after a brisk fight of two or three hours, STUART's force was defeated with heavy loss. On Saturday last, PLEASANTON had another tilt with his rebel foemen, of which we have a telegraphic mention this morning. It was at Little Washington, some forty miles south of the place where the previous fight was fought, and our redoubtable cavalryman had his usual luck -- capturing three pieces of STUART's artillery and a number of his men.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A BRILLIANT CAVALRY OFFICER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A BRILLIANT CAVALRY OFFICER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a2399403-6eac-58ff-b9ca-78913bd1dd2a,477,nyt://article/a2399403-6eac-58ff-b9ca-78913bd1dd2a

NANCY COOTS, who made the will, was originally a slave in Virginia, and, after securing her freedom, came to Philadelphia, about twenty years ago, and resided for the most of her time in the Twenty-fourth Ward.

This result is worthy of special attention, as showing a progress in the public sentiment of the Slave States on this subject, which is in the highest degree encouraging. While certain portions of the people of the Free States are terribly alarmed lest Slavery should be in some way damaged or interfered with, the people of the loyal Slave States are preparing to meet this inevitable issue with courage and common sense. One of the worst features connected with Slavery in the South, has been the absolute silence forced upon the people in regard to it. No evil is intolerable so long as the community in which it exists is free to discuss it.

The name of the unfortunate family is SEABROOK, and their residence was a two-story and basement frame building, directly in the rear of the HECKER bakery. Mr. SEABROOK had just returned from his day's work, and having taken supper, was assisting his wife in preparing their young children for bed, sitting in the basement, excepting their oldest child, a boy of ten years, who was asleep on the second floor. Suddenly they were startled by a swaying of the tenement, accompanied by a dull, dead sound, and a gradual settling of the ceiling down upon their heabs. With parental instinct, the father clutched his youngest child, a babe nine months old, and the mother took the re-remaining little one, a girl of four years, and both awaited the terrible fate which they saw to be inevitable. But their own misfortune did not make them unmindful of the peril of their boy, whom they called, and bade him fly for his life. Singularly enough, he succeeded in reaching the street unscathed, his escape being incomprehensible both to himself and everyone else. The thundering crash of the fallen wall aroused the entire neighborhood, and, in a short time, several hundred people had assembled in great excitement, and in genuine earaestness to render assistance. As soon as it was ascertained that several poor creatures were beneath the mass of brick, mortar and shattered wood, Officer CARNES, of the Seventh Precinct Police, on whose post the accident happened, crept through an aperture in the debris scarcely large enough to admit of the passage of his body, and at the imminent risk of his life began the work of extrication. In consequence of the contracted space in which he was compelled to labor he found the task to be difficult and tedious, but by downright and persistent effort, he finally made a breaeh through the floor of the second story, which was crushed to a level with the pavement of the street, and Roundsman LOCKE immediately entered to aid him. In about an hour they wereable to reach the sufferers, whose cries of distress filled the hearts of the heroic men with anguish, and awakened liveliest sympathy and torturing suspense in the crowd outside. A more painful scene can seldom have been witnessed. The dead body of the infant was first extricated, and soon afterwards Mrs. SEACROOK was taken out. Both her legs were found to he broken, and the chance of her surviving is small.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A FAMILY BURIED ALIVE.; Terrible Crash at Hecker & Brothers' Bakery--One Person Instantly Killed and Two Fatally Injured."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""A FAMILY BURIED ALIVE.; Terrible Crash at Hecker & Brothers' Bakery--One Person Instantly Killed and Two Fatally Injured."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a55e8b1-991a-5f97-bfa9-85be1db1126c,602,nyt://article/5a55e8b1-991a-5f97-bfa9-85be1db1126c

Contrary to what might be supposed, he is gentle in his deportment and deplores the taking of life. He is one of Berdan's sharpshooters, and during the campaign on the Peninsula was constantly employed, using his rifle with almost mathemtaical precision. His plans of operations was to take his food with him to the morning, and seek a favorable position, from which he would shoot during the entire day, only ceasing at night, after closing the existence of all rebels on whom he could draw bead. Recently, while thus engaged, his rifle was struck by a ball, which glanced and scraped his nose and cheek, leaving a deep scar, but doing him no further injury.

He did not believe that if the war should soon be brought to a termination if would end in the separation of the North and South. He thought those who professed so much for Italian unity ought to appreciate more the same union in America.

Lord LYONS' departure for his post, and the proceedings of Commodore WILKES at Bermuda, are coupled by the London Globe in some comments on British relations with the United States, which are not, in the opinion of that semi-official journal, at all likely to become unfriendly. Mr. GLADSTONE's rash prophecy has brought out many counter declarations of sympathy with the North, which, it is noticeable, have everywhere been favorably received. There are many signs of a reaction in the English mind. Speaking of the proceedings of Com. WILKES at Bermuda, the Times thinks the Federals justified in a vigorous prosecution of the right of search where contraband traffic is so brisk. The report of the abdication and flight of King OTHO, of Greece, is fully confirmed. Cotton had taken a decided tumble in the Liverpool market -- 2d.@3d. for American, and 1d. for Surats.

editorial on policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/13/archives/lord-lyons-instructions-nonintervention-still-the-british-policy.html,editorial on policy,"We receive from London this morning an inkling of the instructions brought by Lord LYONS on his return to this country, and concerning which there has been such a large amount of portentous speculation, based on nothing. By this we are reassured once again in regard to the improbability of foreign, or at least of British, interference in our affairs; and though the protestations of continued neutrality are not yet given in their official form, the statements may be regarded as semi-official, and their authenticity and accuracy as beyond question. The precise point, as stated, is that ""Lord LYONS takes out with, him the most full assurance that while England will be eager, in concert with other civilized nations, to adopt any step that may tend to promote a permanent return of peace, either through a restoration of the Union on the old or any new basis, or an agreement for a friendly separation, she will, meanwhile, individually refuse to depart one hair's breadth from her course of non-interference."" To this the London Globe adds, that there is no doubt that Lord LYONS' ""intercourse with the President's Government will remain as peaceful and uninterrupted as the best friends of England and America could wish,"" and that ""on the part of Her Majesty's Ministers no course will be pursued calculated to give any just cause of offence to the still great State beyond the Atlantic."" So if, as is to be hoped, there be no diplomatic hypocrisy about these fine phrases, those who have been disturbed in their souls about intervention may now lapse into quiet for some time longer. There will be no stoppage, of course, to the building and equipping of ships and rams for the rebels in British yards; there will be no surcease to any of the innumerable acts of practical unfriendliness which the British Government has so long winked at.

Editorial says Government and people must be faithful to each other,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/13/archives/the-duty-of-the-day.html,Editorial says Government and people must be faithful to each other,"The excellent spirit with which Gen. MCCLELLAN has given his hand to his successor, and parted from his army, should be imitated by his admirers, and by all loyal men. It is clear that the purpose of the President, in making the change, has been to remedy, if possible, the slow progress of the war, in response to the dissatisfaction which has been so emphatically expressed at the polls. The people have rightly chosen to hold the President responsible for the delays rather than his Generals. They look to the Commander-in-Chief, even though he is a civilian, for the right management of the war. The President overcomes his natural indisposition to interfere, and comes promptly up to the full work of his constitutional responsibility. All the movements indicate that it is fully decided that nothing shall prevent the utmost possible activity in military operations through the coming Winter months. We are, in all probability, entering the decisive stage of the war. It would be too much to hope that it will not have its varying fortunes. The uncertainty of arms has always been proverbial. But there are the best grounds for believing that the triumph will be with us. This much at least seems certain, that the Government means to put forth its utmost available strength, and that it will be no fault on its part if the rebellion is not writhing in its death-struggles before the Spring equinox. The President, in assuming the responsibilities and committing himself so unreservedly as he does to all the risks of this great work, but meets the call of the people, and he has a right to their staunchest moral support.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Duty of the Day.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Duty of the Day.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/733b864c-cdd5-5a9d-8f09-3464df7a2f0d,880,nyt://article/733b864c-cdd5-5a9d-8f09-3464df7a2f0d

The Committee, through Mr. McGRATH, reported the names of a large number of boss painters whom they had visited, a majority of whom cheerfully coincided with the request of the journeymen, as expressed through their circular. Some bosses objected to the hourly rates, and proposed paying wages by the day. A few refused to give any answer to the demands of the circular, or to have anything to say to the Committee uponthe subject. Considerable discussion ensued, with reference to the action which should be taken, or whether the meeting should take any definite action. The idea of a strike was unanimously disapproved of, and it was thought that a majority of the bosses of the City would admit the reasonableness of the journeymen's demand for an increase of wages, and that a compromise could be effected that would be satisfactory to both parties. With this view the Committee were instructed to continue their visits to bosses, and report further at the next meeting, on Thursday evening next.

"Prize Court, yesterday, counsel appeared on behalf of the claimants of the schooner Elmira Cornelius and cargo, and presented the preliminary papers. This is the first vessel from a Northern port captured in an attempt, as alleged, to run the blockade. She sailed out of New-York with a clearance for Port Royal, which she reached in July last. After lying there several months without unloading, she cleared for New-York, and was captured in Bull's Bay, by boats' crews of the United States ship Restless. The captain of the schooner was in court, yesterday, and made a voluntary statement in reference to the voyage and capture of his vessel. He denied that there was any intention from the first to run the blockade, and said that the story of the steward of the schooner to the effect that he (the captain.) had declared such to be his intention was false. When the vessel was run ashore, he said that she was leaking badly and that he made for the beach to keep her from filling. His flag of distress he had taken from the cabin with the intention of hoisting it, but had forgotten to do so. When the boats of the Restless boarded the schooner, a file of marines came on board, and he and his crew were forced into the boats at the point of the bayonet.

The minuteness of its details shows that its authors had studied and fully comprehended the vast number of available resources of revenue in a free and prosperous country. But it is beginning to appear that Congress, however advanced in knowledge, on most subjects connected with revenue necessary to their intelligent action, did not at all comprehend the productiveness of the sources of income they incorporated in their bill. The Ways and Means Committee estimated a revenue of One Hundred and Fifty Millions from their measure. But the work of the Assessors has so far progressed, and the rate of income from stamp duties so far been established, as to indicate a very great increase over the Committee's estimate. There are those who have given the subject attention that predict an income of Two Hundred Millions of Dollars the first year, and others still who declare that at least Two Hundred and Fifty Millions will be derived from the Internal Revenue laws now in force.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REDUCTION OF TAXATION--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REDUCTION OF TAXATION--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/638a2994-ca14-565b-9235-cee794b33525,574,nyt://article/638a2994-ca14-565b-9235-cee794b33525

The name of the mate is JAMES W. COOK, and of the steward, WILLIAM JONES. The vessel cleared from Belfast, Ireland, on the 20th of September last, and arrived at this port on Wednesday evening. The crew came on shore, and, proceeding to the Forty-third Precinct Station-house, related the circumstance to Capt. RHODES. According to their statement, LITTLE was employed by the Captain (SMITH) before setting sail, as man of all work, at the rate of $10 a month. When the vessel got out to sea the mate ordered him to perform the duties of an able seaman, which he was totally disqualified from doing, and in consequence of his inability to perform those duties, was subjected to such a course of brutal treatment that in eighteen days after leaving port he was prostrated by illness, and soon after died. The mate, as stated by the sailors, took occasion to beat LITTLE with whatever he had in his hand, whenever he failed to do his work as directed, or as it was done by other sailors; and the steward, taking a dislike to LITTLE, joined the mate in abusing him. On one occasion, LITTLE, with some others, was sent aloft to stow the topgallant sail. The seamen informed him that he could be of no use to them and told him to go down. When he reached the deck the mate asked him why he did not help the seamen, and while trying to explain he struck him on the head with an iron belaying-pin, inflicting two severe gashes, and knocking him insensible. He was picked up and taken to the hold, and was for some days unable to perform duty. On recovering sufficiently to be about the deck, the mate and steward, as alleged, continued to abuse him on every possible occasion, until at length he became exhausted and was taken below, where he remained until he died, which was on the afternoon of the 13th of October. The sailors are detained as witnesses. Their names are Henry Edwards, John Mahoney, John Taylor, James Walker, Wm. Johnson and Henry McAnnally. The two latter smuggled themselves on board the vessel at Belfast, and succeeded in reaching New-York without paying their passage. The accused parties have been taken before the United States authorities for examination.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BRUTALITY AT SEA--DEATH OF SAILOR BY SEVERE TREATMENT.--Sergeant FERRY, of the Forty', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BRUTALITY AT SEA--DEATH OF SAILOR BY SEVERE TREATMENT.--Sergeant FERRY, of the Forty', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb38d566-90c8-59b2-baa3-1175bce984a2,902,nyt://article/cb38d566-90c8-59b2-baa3-1175bce984a2

The thing is grossly unjust to the volunteer officers who raised brigades, regiments or companies. Many a man, after being authorized by the War Department to raise a regiment, went to work, assiduously applied himself to it night and day for months, spending all his own money and all he could obtain from his friends; and after being successful--after drilling his men for months, after leading them through the campaign of the Peninsula, or the Rappahannock, or the Shenandoah, and probably losing in this way one half of his force, he now finds a regular army officer authorized to enter and recruit from his ranks; and the regular officer probably succeeds, by various means, in seducing from the ranks of the volunteer officer a half of the remnant of the shattered regiment he had raised, and drilled, and led. In this way entire regiments have actually been struck out of existence, and their original officers left without a command; and in many cases, captains who by untiring efforts and lavish expenditure, raised a hundred men a year ago, now find themselves without a soldier to lead, and all their money and labor lost.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN UNJUST SYSTEM.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AN UNJUST SYSTEM.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d95de046-14fa-5a12-9b92-1a325d0b4f39,485,nyt://article/d95de046-14fa-5a12-9b92-1a325d0b4f39

Mme.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/15/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- BELLINI's grand tragic opera of "" Norma"" was revived here last evening to a house that made us forget that the work has seen the day of its greatest popularity, and is now, unjustly and almost sacrilegiously, voted slow. Mme. LORINI (nee WHITING, an American, as our readers who can recall the last decade of opera will remember,) made her debut as Norma, and was supported in the contralto part by the new and favorite prima donna, Mlle. MORENSI. During the interval of seven years that has elapsed since Mme. LORINI was last heard in public, she has made the tour of Europe, and obtained a reputation which we can now estimate at its just value in the principal opera houses there. She returns to us fresher than when she left, with a method vastly improved and a style at once large and lyrically dramatic. The vastness of the Academy imposes a severe tax on the voice of the singer, and we should be lending ourselves to a fiction if we said that Mme. LORINI makes us utterly forget this circumstance. Nevertheless her voice is fuller and richer than any other soprano of American origin we have yet heard on the stage, and its genuine quality -- the true soprano sfogato -- enables the artiste to make her best effects in a way that the most distant listener can appreciate. There was no lack of appreciation last night; the house applauded every well-known morceau with enthusiasm, but the greatest treat was undoubtedly to that limited number who knew what constitutes art, and who had, in consequence, the pleasure of fully recognizing Mme. LORINI's great ability. The soft charm of a rich fresh voice, added to consummate skill of execution, and rare elegance of style, left really nothing to be desired. We cannot think of a singer who has created a more profound impression. Mme. LORINI suggests so much that may be said, that general commendation is the briefest form in which to express it. The lady must be pronounced the best of our native prime donne. We hope that the threat of her early departure for Europe will be speedily withdrawn, in view of a triumph and a recognition so complete.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0471a492-884c-548f-a4ac-8e6ddb7a9df7,550,nyt://article/0471a492-884c-548f-a4ac-8e6ddb7a9df7

ROBINSON, in compliance with a request from Mayor OPDYKE, Dr. BELLOWS, and others, lectured at Cooper Institute last evening, on the necessity of furnishing the Government with a more ef ficient cavalry force than we now have in the field. Commencing with a rapid sketch of the relations of science and art to war, and an allusion to the imperative necessity of the cavalry arm of the service to prosecute a successful war, Major ROBINSON passed to a running review of the progress of various nations in the use of cavalry, from the time of the first regularly organized troops of the Greeks to the terrible destruction of the Roman army by the light and heavy artillery of HANNIBAL, who killed forty thousand and captured thirty thousand out of an army of eighty thousand Romans. He showed how the Romans profited by this lesson, and were enabled in their turn to master the world. He depicted the daring achievements of the Hungarian cavalry, and drew a thrilling picture of the sacrifices which had been made by the Italian Republics, on account of their culpable neglect of cavalry. ""In comparison with cavalry,"" he said, ""rifled cannon and Minie muskets are but as naught."" He narrated the achievements of the Milanese cavalry in their contest with the troops of FREDERICK, and the daring charge of the Cohorts of Death -- a handful of devoted cavalry who succeeded in capturing the royal standard, disorganizing the army, and compelling FREDERICK to flee for his life. He spoke of the terrible battle which decided the contest between LOUIS of Bavaria and FREDERICK of Austria, when 4,000 knights were slain. He related the interesting story of the retreat of the English commander HARKWOOD, in the fifteenth century, with 6,000 of his cuirassers, although confined on an island by the Italian commander. Although the first work on cavalry tactics is attributed to CHARLES the Bold, in 1443, there can be no doubt that works of the kind were written as long ago as forty years previous. Maj. ROBINSON sketched the progress of the cavalry service in Europe, especially of the English and French. He said that the aged soldier was very apt to be averse to the development of any military arm other than that by which he gained renown, but, that he would be quite surely defeated in his first great war by his younger adversary, whose genius might consist merely of a due appreciation of the lessons of military history, and of availing himself of those teachings without regarding them as innovations. Maj. ROBINSON detailed the masterly manner in which NAPOLEON handled his cavalry, and his divisions of his cavalry into three kinds. First, fifteen regiments of heavy cavalry; second, thirty regiments of lancers and dragoons, and third, forty regiments of hussars and chasseurs.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A PLEA FOR CAVALRY.; Lecture by Major H.

THOMAS! He is an impressive man, his deportment is as quiet and simple as that of a poet's farmer. He look's heavy. It takes an occasion to move him, I should say, but when he moves his momentum is enormous. There is much lymph in his composition, although he has the complexion of a sanguine temperament; he is a close observer, but a better thinker, and is wedded to his profession. Long after he was commissioned a Brigadier-General, he persisted in wearing his Colonel's passants. Finally he donned the solitary star, probably because the eagle l'argent on his shoulder's was worn out. Some months have elapsed since he was appointed Major-General, and he appears to be waiting for the lone star to wear out. Some of the ""boys"" are discussing the propriety of purchasing the twin stars for him, if they can get assurance that he will mount them. His aspect is peculiar -- not stern, but rather benevolent and grave, with a strong cast of firmness. His figure is so square and large, that, together with considerableCorpulence, it seems to rob him of several inches of stature. He is fully six feet high and big, almost as great as Nelson was. The former swelled, you know, as you looked at him. Manners, more than matter, were the cause of that optical delusion. Gen. Thomas don't magnify until you begin to measure him. Sandvish hair and whiskers closely cut; keen blue eyes of medium proportions, sunken under shaggy brows; straight nose, not strikingly prominent, but strong; ruddy features, deeply seamed; square face and body; large, compact head; general bigness; heavy, but firm, step -and you have the man, personally. He is patient, persevering and persistent, even-tempered and energetic,speaks deliberately and not frequently, and sometimes indulges in grim pleasantry -- which is rather astonishing than otherwise. Altogether, the [???] describe him best when they tell you about ""Pap"" Thomas. His escort occasionally get a little impatient at his deliberate way of riding, and press too hard upon him. He is accustomed to remind them of their indisecretion by giving the command, ""slow trot!"" so the boys got to naming him old""Slow Trot."" General Rosecrans entertained such an exalted esteem for him at the Military Academy that he was accustomed to call him ""General Washington."" His regard for him has not diminished. Heis an active of Virginia; is aged about forty-five.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23c7300e-81a4-57d4-aea0-5bbbfb3283ad,4296,nyt://article/23c7300e-81a4-57d4-aea0-5bbbfb3283ad

Missouri will not see another battle like Springfield, for not only has the rebellion in that State had its backbone broken, but every bone in its body has been ground to powder, and there is not an organized rebel force anywhere in the great central State of the Union. Arkansas will not witness another day when so many combatants will struggle so fiercely on her soil as they did at Pea Ridge; for the small bodies of our troops who have scoured nearly the whole of the State, have nowhere met a rebel force capable of seriously interrupting their progress. Kentucky is not likely to behold another such battle as the late one at Chaplin Mills; for we cannot conceive it possible that we will ever again have a commander who is such a superlative imbecile as to permit a rebel force to march into and through a State from which one-fifth of his army could have kept them back. Tennessee will hardly again be the scene of such conflicts as those at Donelson and at Shiloh, or such naval fights as those at Island No. 10 and at Memphis, for in the central and western parts of the State there is no foe who does not flee from our advance; and we should think that ROSECRANS' strategy -- considering the immense force at his command --would easily secure the expulsion of BRAGG from East Tennessee. Northern Mississippi is hardly likely to see another battle equal in magnitude to those at Corinth and Iuka, for already GRANT has penetrated below Holly Springs without getting sight at an enemy. There may be a contest between Gen. PRICE and our Mississippi column, at Jackson or at Vicksburgh; but, if the fortunes of war go against the Confederates there -- as they inevitably must -- there will not, so far as we know, be an organized rebel force of any magnitude in all the vast region we have reviewed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Phases of the Rebellion West and East.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Phases of the Rebellion West and East.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cacee444-f97f-53bd-9940-e79b623db668,720,nyt://article/cacee444-f97f-53bd-9940-e79b623db668

The three prime donne which Mr. GRAU has had the good fortune to present to the public have met with so much favor and the desire to see them in other works is so universal, that the impressario has wisely determined to postpone the production of MEYERBEER's new opera until Monday next. In this way there will be additional time for rehearsal, and the public will not be over hurried from one excitement to another. Tonight BELLINI's opera of ""Norma"" will be repeated, with Madame LORINI as the heroine. On Wednesday Madame GUERRABELLA will appear as Maria, in the ""Daughter of the Regiment;"" on Friday, ""Lucrezia Borgia"" will be produced for the last night of Madame LORINI, and on Saturday the week will terminate with a grand matinee. We are desired by the manager to state that the patrons of the opera will consult their interests by not purchasing tickets of speculators at the doors. Some inconvenience, we are informed, has been experienced from this cause. To prevent misrepresentations, the manager desires it to be understood that a certain number of seats equal to the average demand for them, is always set apart for the evening sale, and no one need purchase a ticket outside, in the belief that the regular office of the establishment has ""sold out"" all its vouchers.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0028bc44-2c92-5c63-b4b6-7a1e47d62636,2143,nyt://article/0028bc44-2c92-5c63-b4b6-7a1e47d62636

Gignoux, and the other leading representatives of the modern school of landscape and genre. We have rarely seen a finer show of cabinet subjects. The pictures thus liberally contributed, will of course be sold for the benefit of the fund. But the interest of the Exhibition is not limited to the pleasant contemplation of these free-will offerings. The Society has succeeded in borrowing from wealthy collectors an assortment of the best works of art in the Metropolis, and the result is an exhibition which exceeds in general interest and intrinsic value any exhibition that has preceded it. Those who would know what American artists have accomplished, may here do so. It is indeed an opportunity which no one should neglect, for it may not occur again.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/17/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- When the little folk learn that ""Aunt Fanny, author of the Night-Cap stories, has Written a book for grown people, they will naturally be very wroth and indignant. We rather apprehend that the door of that lady's residence will be besieged by clamorous crowds in short frocks and jackets, remonstrating, both in sorrow and in anger, against such an act of secession on her part. They will, perhaps, send in petitions, as constituents do to Congressmen, and if these petitions are disregarded, peremptory demands may follow. We fear that ""Aunt Fanny"" will be compelled to return to her allegiance by sheer force of arms -- outreaching childish arms -- whose mute appeals she cannot resist, though she do the threatenings of clenched little fists. Certainly in the success she has achieved in The Wife's Stratagem -- published by the APPLETONS -- there is temptation enough to make an ordinary woman dismiss children and night-caps forever, and busy herself with the heads of adult audiences. The book is not so strategical as the title would indicate. All the plot can be told in a few words, all the stratagem laid bare in a sentence. A pretty little wife -- whose husband, in consequence of the wicked secession of the South, and the non-payment by the chivalry of debts due to Northern mudsills, stood on the verge of bankruptcy, in morals as well as in means, and began to manifest an alarming fondness for broiled bones, deviled crabs, whisky punches and other strong inventions of the enemy -- hit upon the expedient of starting a literary society, which should meet regularly to read and discuss papers and stories written by the members. The plan worked to a charm, and we behold the young husband surrendering his latchkey and resolutely turning his back on the devil and all his crabs. The stories written and read at these meetings form the staple of the book. Throughout it is pleasant and piquant. Written in the same sprightly vein which made the Night-Cap stories so charming to both old and young, and with uncommon grace of diction, we can heartily recommend Aunt FANNIE's book to all who desire to spend a few of the spare hours of the approaching long Winter evenings pleasantly and profitably.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b8bc825b-67ea-5400-9677-219b58fc6650,1303,nyt://article/b8bc825b-67ea-5400-9677-219b58fc6650

And that decision is adverse to the hopes of the Confederates. In many ways does the evidence of the fact reach the world. But we desire nothing more conclusive than the outgivings of the Richmond Press on the subject. These organs of the rebellion announce the news with the positiveness and circumstantiality that they would employ in publishing any other fact bearing upon their interests. It is declared that the decision was unexpected, that it broke up negotations of Confederate bonds abroad, which had already commenced at rates so favorable as eighty-six cents on the dollar; and the Southern people are exhorted, in view of the foreign news, to cast away all thought and all hope of the recognition of the Confederacy by foreign Powers, and trust to their own unaided efforts to secure independence. The hope of recognition has been an ever-present and inspiriting support of the Confederates in their struggle hitherto. We may rest assured that their leaders would not permit so discouraging a communication to be made to them unless it were beyond doubt true and irremediable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Practical Lessons in State Craft.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Practical Lessons in State Craft.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2fc167a0-9ec5-53cf-b0d5-671ffe8e7a2f,1100,nyt://article/2fc167a0-9ec5-53cf-b0d5-671ffe8e7a2f

He is not a lecturer after the manner commonly known among us, but delivers, unincumbered with notes, or any kind of written reference, effective, brilliant orations. These orations are eloquent, critical summings up of individual character. Most of them are eulogies of famous Irishmen -- Dean SWIFT, CORRAN, GRATTAN, BURKE, SHERIDAN, O'CONNELL and TOM MOORE among the rest. He has, however, devoted his undoubtedly fine talents to other subjects. Last night, for instance, he drew a vidid portraiture of the hero of Italian independence -- GARIBALDI. Mr. JONES is an amazingly fine speaker. He has a good presence, a rich, melodious, powerful voice, and he possesses the faculty of swaying the passiens of his audience beyond the control of calm, deliberate judgment. He is evidently in earnest, and is himself carried away by the enthusiasm which he imparts to others.

"WALLACK'S THEATRE The comedy of ""The Clandestine Marriage"" has been so seldom played of late years, that its revival is an event of almost as much interest as the production of a new piece  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/18/archives/amusements.html,,"WALLACK's THEATRE. -- The comedy of ""The Clandestine Marriage"" has been so seldom played of late years, that its revival is an event of almost as much interest as the production of a new piece representing, like it, the manners of the last century. It is one of the best constructed and most amusing of the comedies of the period, and must be regarded as a far higher order of piece, artistically considered, than the domestic dramas so plentifully manufactured by MORTON and the younger COLMAN. COLMAN, pere, wrote ""The Clandestine Marriage,"" and GARRICK subsequently touched it up and polished it; among other improvements amplifying the part of Lord Ogleby, and making it worthy the acceptance of WILLIAM KING, a famous performer of that day -- the original Puff, in ""The Critic,"" and Sir Peter Teazle. After KING's retirement from the stage no one was thought capable of playing the part until, in 1818, the late Mr. FARREN, then quite a young man, astonished the town with his special genius for embodying the peculiar characteristics of gentleman-like old age. He virtually monopolized the part throughout a long career, and those who recollect him declare that he never can be equaled in it. It is a fact that Fate, in distending the person of Mr. BLAKE beyond the limit usually allowed to man, effectually prevented his attempting, and Mr. WALLACK has, in consequence, been hitherto unable to produce it in his theatre. With Mr. JOHN GILBERT, in place of Mr. BLAKE, this difficulty is now removed, and the piece can be given with very fine effect. Mr. GILBERT is a performer who has trained in the most careful and conscientious of schools, and any part he undertakes is sure to be satisfactorily -- even admirably -- acted. In Lord Ogleby he has fine opportunities, and he does not neglect them. The part requires a great deal of elaboration, and this it receives from him very thoroughly. Mr. GILBERT is among the best of the patently elaborate school of actors, as distinguished from the apparently spontaneous school, whereof Mr. BLAKE is the ablest exemplar. The other parts in ""The Clandestine Marriage"" are filled with that near arrival at perfection which renders all dramatic entertainments at Mr. WALLACK's Theatre so completely enjoyable. It is almost superfluous to say that Miss Sterling could not be so charmingly played by any one as by Mrs. HOEY; that Fanny Sterling is made irresistibly pretty and interesting by Miss MADELINE HENRIQUES; that Betty -- a specimen of the maid-servant whom our ancestors used to tolerate, but whose smartness would, in this degenerate age, be rewarded with prompt and ignominious dismissal -- becomes delightfully quaint and natural in the hands of Miss GANNON; that, as Mrs. Heidelberg, Mrs. VERNON gives further proof of her being the greatest of living comedians; and that Messrs. MARK SMITH, C. [???], JOHN SEFTON, REYNOLDS, and FLOYD, make up an ensemble of excellence which cannot be approached elsewhere.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/753d1791-6c88-5c33-9baa-49d7c903e9a1,1147,nyt://article/753d1791-6c88-5c33-9baa-49d7c903e9a1

"In January, 1861, the Americans had 41 vessels of all rates in commission.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/18/archives/the-american-navy.html,,"In January, 1861, the Americans had 41 vessels of all rates in commission. There are now 256 menof-war carrying the Federal flag, so that the navy has been multiplied six-fold in less than two years. This, however, though denoting a wonderful effort on the part of the nation, is not a very extraordinary result, when the circumstances are reviewed. On the same conditions we could send a thousand cruisers to sea even in a shorter time. The fact is, as we have before taken occasion to remark, that the Americans were driven out of their old tactics by the sharp pressure of instant necessity. Instead of concentrating their energies and their expenditure on one or two monstrous specimens of their respective classes, they pressed at once into their service every floating vessel that could be found. River steamers, ferryboats, mail-packets, merchantmen, and coasters were all bought up, hastily armed, and sent to sea under the pennant. The result, of course, was an astonishing increase of the national marine, and, as it happened, an efficient one, too. The Federals were fighting against an enemy who had no navy at all, and, consequently, any fleet was good enough for the purpose. A really effective squadron might have made short work of these makeshifts, but the Confederates had no squadron of any kind, and so the extemporized fleet of the Northerners succeeded in keeping the sea, and blockading the helpless ports of the helpless South, Although, however, the Federals acted with this judicious decision upon the spur of the moment, they lost no time in putting some better work in train. They accepted very promptly the conclusions of European Governments respecting iron-cased vessels, and ordered a good many ships on the new model. At the present moment they have between 25 and 30 of these vessels actually afloat, and no fewer than 27 building. Yet even here we must not delude ourselves with the belief that the ""iron-clad steamer"" of the Federal Navy List represents anything like such vessels as are now included in our own squadron at Lisbon. The same urgency in the demand, and the same peculiarity in the contemplated service, have been at work were also to affect the efficiency of the ships turned out. We know by experience what is required for such constructions as these; and when we hear that even improved and powerful models are launched in a few months, and for £80,000 a piece, we can form a very good idea of their general quality.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMERICAN NAVY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE AMERICAN NAVY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b94d338e-b924-50b0-9818-3543edd51a80,1245,nyt://article/b94d338e-b924-50b0-9818-3543edd51a80

The body was entirely free from bruises, the bead being the only part of the person which gave any indication that the deceased had been crushed under the great mass of brick and mortar, and literally buried alive beneath the ruins. The body was taken to the Headquarters of the insurance Patrol, No. 90 Crosby-street, where Coroner WILDEY held an inquest. A verdict of accidental death was rendered after the introduction of such testimony as could be obtained. The body was then taken to the house of Hose Company No. 13, the deceased, at the time of his death, being an exempt member of this Company. Here the body was prepared for burial before sending it to his family in Williamsburgh. The members of the Insurance Patrol, and of Hose Company No. 13, are entitled to much credit for their persevering efforts in searching for the body, they having labored almost constantly for near twenty-four hours in removing the rubbish in order to secure the remains of their lost comrade.

editorial on Cobden speech,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/18/archives/our-friends-in-england.html,editorial on Cobden speech,"Mr. COBDEN made some sensible and practical remarks on American affairs in a late speech at Rochdale, which will be found in our foreign extracts. He don't see that there is any use in English politicians and the English Press abusing us -- can't see that it will stop the war; he don't believe that the struggle will end by a separation of the South from the North; he shows that England and France could not successfully intervene in our contest; and, if they did intervene, it would only end in harm; he don't imagine that military interference would get cotton; and even if there is a prospect that it might do so, it would be cheaper to feed all the population engaged in the cotton manufacture on turtle steaks, champagne and venison, than to try and obtain the staple by force of arms. Beside all this, he indulges in some remarks that are neither very pert nor very philosophical regarding the undesirability of great territorial empires, and contrasts the vast empires of ""Assyria, Persia and the rest,"" with the glorious little States of Greece and Italy, all of which has no bearing whatever upon the Union question, and no point of analogy with this Republic or its war for existence. ""Assyria, Persia and the rest,"" were great despotisms; ""Greece, for instance, or Italy."" -- in their days of glory, were free States; and the littleness of the latter had no more relation to their glory than the vastness of the former had to their corruptioe and decay. This Republic is at once vast in its territory and perfect in its freedom -- vaster, by far, than ""Assyria and the rest,"" and freer than ""Greece, for instance;"" and all its glories have sprung from, and depend upon, the principle of Union. What Mr. COBDEN likes to see better than vast empires is, the ""development and elevavation of the individual man;"" and no one knows better than he how grandly that end has been secured by this Republic.

In the first report of the affair, which we published on Monday, he mentioned that he had captured several freight cars, laden with arms, ammunition, accoutrements, shovels, and sugar, besides taking 208 belligerent rebels; and in a subsequent report, which we give this morning, he states that he had also collected a large number of cavalry and artillery horses and mules, and further still that the discomfited enemy had left behind them over 400 wagon-loads of negroes, all of which had fallen into his hands. Of a good deal of this remarkable lot of plunder, the General can easily dispose; but he is at his wits' end to know what to do with the contraband children of Ham. The 208 rebels he says he released on parole; the horses and mules can be put to immediate service by his own men; he will also find abundant use for the arms, ammunition and accoutrements, and, perhaps, even for the shovels; and with the sugar he and his boys can sweeten their coffee, but the 400 wagon-loads of negroes, alas! what can be done with them.

It appeared from the evidence that the prisoner met the deceased in the lobby of the theatre on the evening in question, and charged him with being a deserter, and endeavored to induce him to return to the regiment. An altercation ensued between the parties, pending which the deceased struck the prisoner in the mouth and about the head several times, and followed up the attack by seizing him by the hair of the head, bending him down between his legs and pummeling him at his leisure. The prisoner seeing no chance of escape, drew his Zouave knife and thrust it into the abdomen of DOHERTY, inflicting a wound from which he died two days after. It was proved that the prisoner had authority to arrest deserters wherever he found them; that he was first attacked by the deceased, who was a much heavier and more powerful man than himself, and that after inflicting the wound he made no attempt to escape, but acknowledged he committed the deed, and said that it was done in self-defence.

At the time this mortgage was given, as claimed, the defendant had received all advances under the contract, but was unable to complete the buildings for want of means, whereupon the plaintiff deeded the property to her and took mortgages for the price of the lots and all the advances which he had agreed to make; he then made the additional advance of $700, and took the mortgage sought to be foreclosed on all the property, to secure it; this was shown to be a necessary advance to complete the buildings, and that it was actually used for that purpose, and so as recorded on March 30, 1860.

All candid friends of the Administration freely admit that, owing to the super-serviceable zeal of certain officials, there was at one time a serious abuse of this power of summary imprisonment. In the recent canvass the Republicans forbore to take issue on that point at all, though their opponents made much of it. They contented themselves with trusting that the good sense and fidelity of the President would soon take note of the evil, and apply the appropriate remedies. This seems already to have been very effectually done, and, doubtless, would have been just as soon done had the elections resulted differently. The war devolved an immense variety of momentous duties and responsibilities upon the Administration, and, in the nature of the case, time was necessary for its subordinates to understand them justly, and fulfill them correctly.

They have issued a ""report"" upon this subject, in which not one word occurs as to the negligence or inefficiency of their own navy; but they declare that ""the most wide-spread exasperation"" is rising against this country, because the Confederate war steamer Alabama burnt the Federal merchant ship Brilliant. Their reason for this exasperation is that the Alabama was built in this country, and that the guns with which she is mounted were also bought in this country. We have no doubt of these facts, although we have no special information as to them. But what has England to do with this? Suppose we had knowingly allowed a ship-of-war to be built, and armed, and provisioned, and manned, and to go, flying the Confederate flag, out of one of our seaports, we should have done wrong. We should have done what the United States did when, during the Russian war, they sent the America across the Pacific to the Russians in the Yellow Sea. We should have done what the United States did when the Russian war ship, the Great Admiral, was laid down in an American dockyard. But we have done nothing of the sort. Our shipowners have sold a ship as they are every day selling ships. Whether she was better adapted for war or for peace is nothing to them or to us. She left our port an unarmed vessel. Depend upon it, she infringed no law municipal or international, for Mr. ADAMS and his agents, as well as the secret Committee which sits in London, had all their eyes upon her. Whether she would have been a lawful prize when she had left our waters, we know not; that must depend upon her papers; but she was not a ship which our Government had a right to stop. How many steamships does the New-York Chamber of Commerce think our shipbuilders turn out in a year? Are we to shut up our ship-yards as well as our factories as a homage to the Federal lust of conquest? The New-York Chamber of Commerce, and especially Mr. Low, who seems to be their mouth-piece, would appear to be of this opinion. They have ""heard with amazement"" that other ships are being built in England and Scotland which may possibly become at a future time Confederate vessels of war. Mr. Low has, moreover, heard that an iron-clad ship is being built here for that purpose, and he was also read in the patch papers that a ship loaded with Confederate stores was lately such in the Clyde.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New-York Chamber of Commerce and British Neutrality; From the London Times.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New-York Chamber of Commerce and British Neutrality; From the London Times.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/43040582-d31d-5909-89fb-8221c19ae7ca,900,nyt://article/43040582-d31d-5909-89fb-8221c19ae7ca

Our Minister at Madrid had had an audience with the Queen in regard to the matter, and had given assurances that the United States Government did not authorize the acts of the Captain of the gunboat Montgomery. Mediation rumors were again current in London, but they are probably worthy of no more attention than those which have preceded them. The French Cabinet is said to be more at variance than ever regarding the Roman question. It was thought that a majority of the Ministers would resign unless the Emperor should resolve to give Rome to the Italians. The Grecian question still remained unsettled -- it being uncertain whether the Provisional Government would decide in favor of a monarchy or a Federal Republic. The Bank of France had advanced its rate of discount to four per cent. The sales of cotton at Liverpool for the week had been 47,000 bales, and the market closed dull.

Speaking of Mr. CURRAN's defence of ROWAN, before an English Court, for libel on the Crown, Mr. JONES quoted from the learned barrister's speech that portion which so highly eulogises Universal Emancipation, and incidentally alluded to the Briton's boast, that the foot of no slave can press the soil of the British Empire or any ground covered by the British flag, and said that he hoped the time would soon come when the same might with truth be said of another flag -- the star-spangled banner. ""Oh,"" said the speaker, ""if you only knew the derision that foreign nations cast upon you in consequence of the stain of Slavery that is on that flag, there is no Democrat or Pro-Slavery man at the North"" -- Here the speaker was interrupted by a number of hisses, the noise of which was soon drowned in a tremendous outburst of applause, that lasted for some time. Mr. JONES again essayed to proceed, when the hisses were renewed and much confusion created, Cries of ""put 'em out,"" ""hear him,"" &c., were frequent, while the friends of the sentiment partially avowed by the speaker having the majority, drowned all opposition by their applause. Order being restored. Mr. JONES said:",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. T.

Nothing particular transpired until yesterday morning, when the girl complained of a severe sick headache, and the kitchenwork was accordingly done by the ladies of the house. It was observed, however, that whenever coal or anything was wanted from the cellar, the girl would immediately go for it, and her manner appeared somewhat excited. Subsequently, after the work had been finished up in the basement, the girl went up to her room. The curiosity of the ladies having beenaroused, they proceeded to the cellar, and there found the lifeless remains of an infant, buried under a quantity of ashes, over which had been thrown a piece of sheet-iron, tubs, and other articles. Upon going to the girl's room, she was found lying insensible. Dr. HADDON, City Physician, was called in, and, from the symptoms, is of opinion that the woman had taken poison for self-destruction, but that the object was defeated by swallowing an over-dose, thereby causing her to vomit. The proper remedies were applied, and the Coroner was notified.

The time stated for the commencement of the serenade was 10 P.M., but as early as 9 o'clock there were several hundred people present. About that hour the Committee appointed by the Common Council to extend to him the hospitalitiesof the City, headed by Alderman FARLEY, was present and ready to perform the duty to which it had been assigned, but after many inquiries and a fruitless search for the General, the Committee retired -not over well pleased with the failure of the visit. There were also a number of other distinguished gentlemen present. Among them, Ex-Chief of Police MATSELL, Mr. BRENNAN, D. D. CONOVER, Alderman F. I. A.

Among the articles exposed for sale in the Hall were what were called knit bonnets, a vary great improvement on anything in the way of hoods, and something that might become the prettiest complexion. They were of gray and white, mixed, and white and pink, suiting a most fastidious taste. A very tasteful arrangement of forest leaves into a crucifix was observable, and will no doubt sell well. There were oil paintings and an array of wax bouquets that would have tempted any one to linger in examination of their rare imitation of nature, yet, unless you have plenty of money, you had better not expose yourself to the allurement of charms that guard the inaccessible rarities.

It rained, the gas-lights furnished the lightning, RENDERS' gun the thunder, and the Young Men's Democratic Association completed the general disturbance, of the elements involved. But yesterday and last evening, all was serene. The General was not disturbed. As the reporters say, (with unusual propriety,) the General, after the fatigues of the past, was permitted to repose in the bosom of his family. During the morning, several gentlemen somewhat known in these several political districts called, but were not admitted. The General was busy. There were others more fortunate, among them Lieut.-Col. SWEETZER, U.S.A., and Senator LATHAM of California. In the afternoon Gen. MCCLELLAN returned the visit of Gen. SCOTT, both occupying rooms in the same hotel. During the evening there were few visitors and no unusual gathering in the halls. The night was rainy, and the people seemed to know that the General required repose. At the time our reporter left, the General's acceptance or domination of the hospitality of the City, tendered by vote by the Common Council Committee on National Affairs, had not been definitely determined on.

If it is his design to go there, it indicates that the final contest in the Southwest is to be on the eastern verge of the Mississippi.

McCLELLAN from the command of the Army of the Potomac seems to have aroused a bitterness of feeling in some quarters, quite beyond what would naturally have been expected. That some should be displeased with that removal was quite natural. There were many men among us who believed sincerely in Gen. MCCLELLAN, who were heartily in favor of the most vigorous prosecution of the war until the rebellion was suppressed. But it is not this class who have shown this extreme bitterness. That has rather made its appearance among those whose loyalty has been doubtful, who are suspected of a desire for peace at any price, about whom there is and has been a taint, -- a suspicion. The mouths of such men, the columns of such papers, have been full of bitterness on the subject of this removal. If they had been soldiers under Gen. MCCLELLAN, their warmth of feeling might have been accounted for by the attachment of a soldier to his chief, but there has not been any great readiness on the part of these men to take an active part in the war. Their activity has taken the direction of politics instead of soldiering; they have been earnest in endeavors to embarrass the Administration rather than to fight the rebels, to keep out of power those who favored the heartiest prosecution of the war, and to prevent measures which should attack the rebellion in its vital part.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Election and the Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Election and the Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9290aa4a-0180-50ac-9d5a-b5fe8d3b2925,1022,nyt://article/9290aa4a-0180-50ac-9d5a-b5fe8d3b2925

Coroner HEGEMAN having been declared elected under the District law, commenced performing his duties within the country district, but finding that it did not pay, opened an office in the city and secured a large share of the business of the City Coroner, Mr. ALFRED HORTON. The latter brought an action against HEGEMAN in the Supreme Court, and it was there decided that the district law was unconstitutional and that any Coroner elected in the county had jurisdiction anywhere within its limits. In the present case it was contended on the part of the plaintiff that the District law having been declared unconstitutional, and RYDER having received a majority of the votes throughout the whole county, was entitled to the office.

We yesterday published Gen. SUMNER's demand for the surrender of the city. To-day we have the reply of the Mayor, evidently written at the dictation of the rebel military authorities. It gives assurances, as from the rebel commander, that certain matters complained of shall cease; refuses to deliver the city into the hands of Gen. BURNSIDE, and closes with a complaint as to the shortness of the time given in which to remove non-combatants. Friday night, however, was busily occupied in the work of removing them, and daylight revealed the fact that it had also been busily occupied in another kind of work. A line of earthworks had been constructed to the right and rear of the town, and rebel cannon were already in position. Our artillery was immediately placed in the most favorable positions, and the encampments in range of the enemy's guns were moved further back. There were good reasons for not opening upon the city yesterday, unless the enemy should force it, and up to noon he had not done so, although the rebels had fired a few shots, as though to provoke it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/644631d4-d341-58e8-b9c7-62dfdfdc30d0,925,nyt://article/644631d4-d341-58e8-b9c7-62dfdfdc30d0

"In the Prize Court, yesterday, Judge CADWALADER set aside the sale of the cotton brought to this port in the prize schooner Caroline Virginia.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/23/archives/the-mexican-expedition.html,,"In another month we shall probably be purusing a a second chapter in the history of the Mexican Expedition. It would not be very diflicult to forecast the ccontents of the narrative. The present state of affairs reminds us of Sir WILLIAM NAPIER'S introduction to one of the episodes of the Peninsular War, when ""BLAKE, pursued by 50,000 enemies, was flying from Nava to Epinosa: CASTANOS and PALAFOX were quarreling at Tudela; the Conde DE BELVEDERE was at Burgos with 13,000 bad troops, and NAPOLEON was at Vittoria with 170,000 good troops."" The Mexicans, according to the must recent accounts, were ostensibly preparing for a desperate resistance against the French columns which were marching on the Capital. To oppose these 20,000 excellent soldiers, they had raised by arbitrary conscription about 10,000 recruits, already demoralized. To defray the charges of the war, they had proposed a new loan, the scrip of which was qouted at [???] discount on the Mexican Exchange, it needs little power of divination to [???] the result of a contest on conditions like these, but when the French are actually in possession of Mexico a third chapter of the story will be opened, and the tenor of that chapter it would be very hard to predict. The problem involves nothing less than the settlement of Mexico -- a country in which an attempt at self-government has resulted. after in exhaustive trial, in an anarchy so brutal and hopeless as to be noxious to the world. Three European Power combined a short time ago to terminate a state of affairs from which their subjects had long been suffering, and the flags of England, France and Spam were seem flying together in Mexican waters. From this alliance England and Spain ultimately withdrew, and left France alone with a has was them thought the privilege, but what [???] moved to be the burden of the projected enterprise. We have explained on former occasions the circumstances under which this separation occurred. The alleged object of the expedition wasthe [???] of grievances. The combined Powers desired to obtain satisfaction for a multitude of wrongs, and this satisfaction the Mexican authorities were eager enough to offer. But, unless the whole proceeding was to be a farce, it was a necessary sequel of the original demand that some assurance should beforthcoming for the fulfillment of the promises so liberally made. If nothing more had been required than an understanding from the Mexican rulers for the time [???] to liquidate their just debts and refrain from outrages for the future, that a [???] of ""[???]"" could unquestionably have been obtained without any [???] at all. A single in theharbor at Vera Cruz might have been intrusted with the mission. The real purpose of the in their more serious proceeding was to terminate once for all the state of things which had [???] such [???] and though the convention under which they acted recorded their disinclination to [???] of the [???] affairs of Mexico, it is very difficult to see how the end of the expedition couldhave been accomplished if the Government of the country had been left to stand as it stood. The French however, stood alone in the logical conclusions of [???] point. They proposed, as an indispensable condition of peace, that the existing Government should abdicate, and when the suggestion was declined, resolved to enforce the demand. Upon this the British and the Spaniards retired -- the former from genuine reluctance to enter upon the undertaking before them the latter, it may be surmised, from an unwillingness to see themselves superseded by the French in the work of political reconstruction. An this way was the Emperor NAPOLEON left [???] with an obligation which her proved more [???] than was anticipated. Relying on the representations of a refugee, the French advanced upon the Capital with a force which would have been efficient to gave the ascendancy to an influential party in the State, but which was [???] overcome a condition of all the factions together It was supposed that the Emperor's policy [???] to the establishment of a monarchy under a foreign France, and as this, event presumed the extinction of all existing pretensions is united in opposition all classes of pretenders. The French were stopped on their [???] it is but recently that reinforcements [???] are [???] them to resume it. But what is to be [???] mere military miscalculations have [???] corrected? The Emperor has already [???] desire of forcing an unpopular Government on the Mexican people, but if the ruling factions merit no recognition, by what administration [???] is their rule to be superseded? We cannot impeach the force of the argument by which the French justified their advance upon Mexico. We believe that if the Allies, had occupied the promises of JUAREZ. in satisfaction of their demands, and then withdrawn their forces from Mexican territory, the state of affairs would have been just as bad in twelve months time as it was when the expedition was organized. [???], in this country there would always be a predisposition to strengthen the Liberal Party, and if that party in Mexico had established any pretensions to its title, we should have regretted to see its proposals set aside. No such claims, however, had been made out. On the contrary, we are convinced that any impartial observer of Mexican politics for the last ten years would admit that the factions which disputed the possession of power were alike destitute of all [???] to either confidence or support. We have seen it stated that there really was a change impending at the moment of the expedition, and that, but for the invasion of this country, JUAREZ would actually have taken measures, if not for the payment of debts, at any rate for the security of life and property. To this prediction we can only reply that it might possibly [???] have happened, but that the very same men had persisted in the very same courses for so long a time, and without the least symptom of repentance, that the miracle could be waited for no longer. As far as a very long experience enabled us to judge, there was not a pin to choose between ""Constitutionalists"" and ""Absolutists,"" or, indeed, any reason for presuming that such designations implicit any principles at all. It follows necessarily, according to these views, that [???] the Government of Mexican has been in some manner reorganized, no arrangements for a settlement of the long-pending questions are likely to be successful. We have been [???] that in these speculations we are putting out of sight the rignts, interest:, and wishing of the Mexican people. We reply, than if we could discover a Mexican people anywhere, we should ask for nothing better than to leave it [???] of it own [???]. But throughout these long years of revolution and anarchy we have looked [???] for the appearance of any such phenomenon. We suppose there must be Mexicans who admire [???] JUAREZ nor MIRAMON, but we have never been able to discern the least expression of any [???] opinion as distinguishable from the cries of the contending factions. As each faction robs and [???] and, indeed, does little else, it is reasonable to presume that both factions have then enemies, and that even in Mexican there are men who desire to lead a quiet life. Our correspondent declares his conviction that there [???] such a party, though [???] that it has hitherto been invisible, and conceives thatit would make its appearance if the two old factions which have rent the State were kept down by arbitrary power. If this be, in deed, the case, the task of the French may be materially facilitated; but we must say that we have hitherto looked for such a public opinion in Mexico without the slightest success, and we certainly cannot [???] it directly or indirectly with either of the ruling parties. On this point we trust that our neighbors, if they are under any misapprehension, will promptly undeceive themselves. Our correspondent intimates that we are supposed to favor one party, while the French incline to the other. That we favor a principle is true, but not that we wish to commit ourselves to a faction. We are always ready as a people to advocate constitutional government, and, whenever the Mexican question is debated, that leaning will be perceptible. But we are not ready to defend the ""constitutionalism"" of JUAREZ and his friends, or to pronounce dogmatically on the policy for which Mexican affairs may call. In point of fact, by leaving the French with the work of the expedition, we have left them also with the privilege of shaping its results. We cannot pretend to much further voice in a transaction from which we have withdrawn, but though we certainly hope that the future Government of Mexico may repose on better foundations than those of absolutism and priestcraft, we have not the least desire to take up the cudgels for the worthless faction by which those principles have been ostensibly opposed.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mexican Expedition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mexican Expedition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc2dea6d-779a-5b0e-9225-6c56cf20fd57,1515,nyt://article/cc2dea6d-779a-5b0e-9225-6c56cf20fd57

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/24/archives/foreign-miscellany.html,,"-- A letter in the Athenaeum, dated Naples, Oct. 18, mentions some interesting discoveries at Pompeii. The writer says: ""In an extreme corner of an inner room of a small and apparently poor house, have been discovered some human bones -- a rare thing in Pompeii, where most of the population had time to escape. Further researches -- and it was interesting to observe with what extreme care and delicacy they were conducted -- revealed yet others, until the skeletons of five persons were visible -- four women and an infant, all crouched up in a corner. The sex and age of the victims, and the very form in which they were found, are suggestive of incidents and sufferings which would promise materials for an affecting tale. The arms seem to have been clasped as if all hope had been abandoned, and they had come there to die, whilst the legs were doubled up with the agony of their sufferings. The mouth of one skeleton was open, distended, and hard must have been the last expiring efforts of that poor person. The infant was in the extreme corner, where a mother's love, perhaps, had placed it, in the hope of its there finding greater protection from the storm of ashes which was raging around them, and penetrating into the most secret recesses of every building. Poor, helpless women they were too weak or too feeble to escape, and had been abandoned by husband, father, brother -- by every male friend. There were bronze armlets or bracelets round their freshless bones; and by the side of them lay what were evidently the remains of a purse, in which had been inclosed twenty silver Roman coins and two copper coins. Of course the material of the purse was imperfect, and was reduced to mere tinder; still the texture was perceptible, and this it was which contained the hurried gleanings of the unhappy party. There were considerable traces of cloth, too, in the ashes, all around the bodies or skeletons -- that is to say, on the ashes there were impressions as of cloth which had been laid over them, and then exposed to the fire. The probability appeared to be that they were the clothes of the wretched fugitives, for there were impressions as it were, of folds.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN MISCELLANY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN MISCELLANY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a87607f-a924-5192-9c5f-b27868f05a68,3323,nyt://article/3a87607f-a924-5192-9c5f-b27868f05a68

The rebels have not held either since Corinth was evacuated in the Spring. And Lagrange, the most advanced of the two, was occupied nearly all last Summer by Gen. HURLBERT with an entire division. Gen. GRANT, it is now stated, has not an army sufficiently strong to advance into the heart of Mississippi.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/27/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"DESTRUCTIVE FIRE -- ONE MAN AND TWENTY HORSES BURNED TO DEATH. -- Shortly after 9 o'clock last evening a fire broke out in the stables of the Knickerbocker Ice Company, in Furman-street near Fulton Ferry, and resulted in the destruction of the building and contents, together with twenty horses. A hand in the employ of the Company was burned to death. His name is JAMES MCGUNNIGLE, who, it appears, was in the habit of lodging on the premises, and as supposed was asleep on some straw at the time the fire originated. There was considerable hay and straw in the stable, which burned with such rapidity that, the whole was enveloped before means could be taken to suppress the flames. Several persons broke open the doors, and succeeded in rescuing four horses at the peril of their lives, while twenty of the poor animals were left to be consumed. Mr. FREDERICK HAUGERZA, one of the principal men about the establishment, fearing that some persons were in the stable, made search, and found the dead body of MCGUNNIGLE. It was feared at the time that others were inside, but it was then impossible to make further examination. It is believed, however, that MCGUNNIGLE is the only one who did not succeed in making his escape from the premises. The stable was of frame 25 feet front by 50 feet deep, and valued at about $600. It was designed to build a brick structure this Fall. The value of each horse averaged $200, making a total loss, with harness, &c., about $6,000. The property is owned by the New-York Knickerbocker Ice Company, Mr. A. BARMORE, President. There were several wagons in the rear yard, and a vessel at the dock, but all were saved by the exertions of the firemen. The fire, it is supposed, originated by accident.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/08a2ac46-a3e7-5ec6-97b8-383918250781,306,nyt://article/08a2ac46-a3e7-5ec6-97b8-383918250781

Mr. WRIGHT F. CONGER called the meeting to order, and on his motion Mr. ROBERT M. HENING, of Montclair, was called to preside. After spirited speeches by Messrs. PRATT, HART, DODGE, M.W. DODD, and others, a series of resolutions was adopted declaring the delays a source of great inconvenience, and detrimental alike to the interests of the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad and to those of the community for whose accommodation it was built, asserting that the growing importance of the section of country represented in the meeting no only justified but demanded increased accommodation and more rapid communication with New-York, and urging direct communication without change of cars, as the proper remedy for existing difficulties. A committee of seven, consisting of Messrs. J.H. Pratt, Henry Nason, Wright F. Conger, H.J. Mills, C.D. Gibson, R.M. Hening, and James C. Beach, was then appointed to confer with the Directors of the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad Company, and to pledge them a hearty support in any liberal policy which would promote the interests of the road as well as those of the public.

CASTILLA published patriotic addresses to the nation and to the navy when he retired, and President SAN ROMAN, in two addresses to the nation and the army, promises to govern strictly under the Constitution and laws, and to retrench the expenses of the Government. President SAN ROMAN called Gen. MANUEL MENDIBURU to take charge of the portfolios of the War and Navy Departments, charging him to organize the Cabinet as President of the Council of Ministers. This gentleman, however, finally threw up the attempt to form a Cabinet, for the reason that one of the persons whom he had proposed to associate with him declined the place assigned him. On the 26th, Don JOSE GREGORIO PAZ SOLDAN succeeded Gen. MENDIBURU, associating with himself as Minister of the Government, Don ANTONIO ARENAS; Minister of Finance, Don JOSE SANTOS CASTANEDA; Minister of Justice, Don MELCHOR VIDOURRE; Minister of War, Gen. ISIDRO FRISANCHO. The Government, after a great deal of public and private discussion, has finally accepted the $11,000,000 loan lately made in England, and which, after a portion of the money had arrived in Lima, Congress refused to sanction, on the ground that the loan and conversion of the old debt was made in London by the Peruvian Minister without due authority, and was an onerous one for the Government. Don PEDRO GALVEZ, Secretary of Hacienda, having refused to sign the decree accepting the loan, he resigned, and was succeeded by Senor MENDIBURU, Chief Comptroller of the Exchequer, who was more pliant. The usual scandal in such matters is circulated in Lima, that GALVEZ refused to approve the loan because he had his pet scheme by which he could better fill his own pockets, and that MENDIBURU did sign it because he got $200,000 for doing so. How this may be I know not, but I do know that in an $11,000,000 operation in Peru a good deal of the money is expected to stick to the palms of the Government officers. £900,000 of the money is deposited in Lima, awaiting the news of its acceptance to reach England.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERU.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERU.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4112a18-d082-5cd5-bb72-03b145d34929,528,nyt://article/c4112a18-d082-5cd5-bb72-03b145d34929

It appeared from the evidence adduced by the prosecution that the prisoner had been an employe of Mr. WEBB, the shipbuilder, and, in accordance with the usual custom of that establishment, presented himself on Saturday evening at the office of the Cashier to receive his weekly wages. The number of days that each hand worked during the week. It seems, is left to his own statement, and the prisoner, on stepping up to the Cashier's office, merely uttered the words ""five days,"" and was thereupon paid five days' wages by the Cashier. Immediately after making the payment, the Cashier said he suspected all was not right, and on inquiry at the yard, ascertained that the prisoner had not-worked at all that week. Mr. SPENCER, counsel for the prisoner, claimed that under the law, as laid down in the case of the People vs. Haynos, 14th Wendell, his client was entitled to an acquittal on the testimony of the Cashiers -- he having proved, by his own evidence, that he did not exercise that ordinary caution which the law requires of every business man. The Court took the same view of the case, and without proceeding any further in the trial instructed the jury to render a verdict of not guilty. This the jury refused to do, or at least two of their number declined to obey the instructions of the Court. Under these circumstances the Court informed them that they could retire and consult together, and intimated that they would be permitted to remain together until after Thanksgiving unless they could agree. This was not a very pleasing prospect to the refractory jurors, and after being out twenty minutes they compromised the matter by agreeing to the following verdict: ""Not guilty, according to the instructions of the Court.""

"A GANG OF JUVENILE PILFERERS DISPERSED -- ARREST OF AN ALLEGED RECEIVER. -- For some time past many of the down-town merchants have had considerable amounts of goods stolen from them, by an organized band of young thieves, most of whom live in the First Ward. On Wednesday, Officer Fincke, at the Twenty-seventh Precinct, made a raid on the young rascals and arrested six boys, ranging from 10 to 14 years of age, who gave their 'names as Wm. Gleason, Edward Ryan, Dennis McCarty, Philip McCall, Wm. Roscome, and John Fallon. Two of them had stolen each an odd boot from the store of JOHN MORTON, No. 122 Greenwich-street, and as the boy GLEASON alleges, sold them to Mrs. MART LOCKHEIMER, of Rector-street. GLEASON confessed to Capt. DECAMP, to selling the boots to Mrs. L. for $1 each, when, as he says, she induced him and his confederates to return to Mr. MORTON's store, and steal the boots to match those previously taken. By so doing, she would have two pairs of boots. GLEASON also stated that this gang of thieves have long been in the habit of selling stolen goods to Mrs. LOCKHEIMER, who even went so far as to indicate what articles she wanted them to steal. He says Mrs. LOCKHEIMER complained that they did not steal cloth enough, and wished them to bring her more dry goo is. On the testimony of the boys, Mrs. LOCKHEIMER was arrested, and the whole party were subsequently arraigned before Alderman HALL, who committed four of the boys and discharged the others (MCCARTY and McCALL.) Mrs. LOCKHEIMER, who claims to be a woman of the highest respectability, was also required to find ball in the sum of $1,000, to answer before the Court of General Sessions.

Now, it so happens that this same French Emperor is himself, at this moment, engaged in a war -- a war with the Government and people of Mexico -- which struggle has been raging more than a year upon the American Continent, and is watched by us with painful interest -- just as His Majesty watches ours. We have observed the most strict neutrality in the struggle. Even now the sentiments dictated to us have undergone no change but of a benevolent character. That neutrality ought to make us of service to the two parties, by helping them out of a position which seems to have no issue. After more than a year's efforts to subjugate Mexico, the French are now nearly in the same position as at first. They have, it is true, seized by their gunboats two or three towns on the coast, but they have not yet captured the Mexican Capital -- any more than our army has captured Richmond. Nothing authorises the presumption that more decisive military operations will shortly occur, according to the latest news received. The French and Mexican armies, on the contrary, were in a condition that would not allow either party to hope within a brief delay for any decided advantage to turn the balance and accelerate the conclusion of a peace.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'QUID PRO QUO.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'QUID PRO QUO.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/65d70ddf-f3a7-5ad4-ab1c-4fa2c0884a77,1063,nyt://article/65d70ddf-f3a7-5ad4-ab1c-4fa2c0884a77

It marched at the head of the column to Manassas, and subsequently to Warrentown Junction. It went with MCCLELLAN to the Peninsula, and was present at the siege of Yorktown. It took part in the battle of Fair Oaks, when it was placed in the foremost line; and during the fight it was pitted against five rebel regiments, and lost one half of its men -- for its bravery and good behavior on which occasion it received the warm acknowledgments of Gens. FRENCH and SUMNER. It continued in the most active service during the entire period of the campaign before Richmond -- fighting heroically in the fierce contests at Savage Station, White Oak Swamp, and Malvern Hill. The regiment left the Peninsula, and went up to take part in POPE's campaign, on which occasion it covered, with SUMNER's corps, the retreat from Centerville. It accompanied MCCLELLAN from Washington into Maryland, and at the battle of Antietam (in RICHARDSON's Division,) it was in the advance. In this Maryland campaign it was under a rebel artillery fire for two days and nights, and faced the columns of rebel infantry on the two following days. It is now in the front line, opposite Fredericksburgh, on the banks of the Rappahannock.

We find in yesterday's Tribune a statement of the case. ANDREW ALLSMAN, an old resident of Palmyra, Mo., was a well known adherent of the Union cause, and had made himself especially valuable to our armies by his services as a guide. When the rebel Gen. PORTER descended upon Palmyra he took ALLSMAN prisoner. When Gen. MCNEIL, commanding the Union forces, returned to Palmyra, he heard of this capture and wrote to PORTER demanding his return, alive and unharmed, within ten days, and threatened, in case this demand was not complied with, to execute ten persons whom he held as rebel prisoners. So far as appears this demand was not delivered to PORTER, though the Tribune says that it was ""widely published,"" and that "" as PORTER was known to be in Northeast Missouri during the specified ten days, it is impossible but that he became apprised of Gen. MCNEIL's determination."" At all events, no word came in reply, and accordingly on the 18th of October the following ten men held by Gen.

She deserves to be ranked, not as a child-wonder, who at the age of eight years has vanquished nearly all the technical difficulties of the piano, but as an artist of first-class sensibility. Her perception of musical meaning; the clearness with which she sees, and the delicate skill with which she executes passages that are ornate or obscure, belong only to the better rank of performers, and are in fact characteristics that cannot be attained by study. It is not difficult to trace in the charming face and graceful figure of this beautiful child the indications of an extraordinary nature, and music -- as plainly -- is one of its healthiest and most genuine manifestations. She has an instinct for art which leads her to its beauties, and overcomes all obstacles in her search for them. Three pieces -- without counting the encores -- so different in style as those on Miss CORRENO's programme, would have taxed the powers of the best player. They were interpreted easily by the young lady -- with abundant technical skill, good force and quality of tone, and the nicest of expression.

I have often expressed my strong conviction that the negroes would show themselves courageous and worthy of their freedom, if ever the opportunity was offered them to fight, and recent events have fully justified this opinion. You have already received an account of a successful expedition of one of the tugboats with a company of armed blacks to Sapelo River and other places on the Georgia coast, where they were for the first time under fire, and acquitted themselves bravely in an engagement with their former masters, protecting the flight of a large number of their race who sought to escape the horrors of bondage. That success led to the projection of another enterprise, which, in brilliancy and practical value surpasses the first. Three companies of these South Carolina Volunteers, Capis. TROWBRIGDE, JANES and RANDOLPH's, under the command of Lieut.-Col. BEARD, Provost-Marshal under Gen. SAXTON, left Beaufort on the 13th inst., in the steamers Ben. Deford and Darlington, going to Doboy Sound, Georgia, and remaining there a week, returning with with two hundred thousand feet of the best Georgia pine lumber, sawed and ready for use. This was taken from HAWKINS's, TODD's and BLUE's mills on the mainland, directly in face of the rebels, who gave the black soldiers an opportunity to test their pluck on shord as they had previously on a tug-boat, where they fuoght with the advantage of a partial barricade. While most of the negroes were engaged in loading the steamers with lumber, the company of Capt. JANES advanced on a reconnoissance, and were opened upon with musketry by the rebels, from a position in ambush.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Front Page 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Front Page 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/452e2c64-7261-52ab-9de8-24b1ef809b94,634,nyt://article/452e2c64-7261-52ab-9de8-24b1ef809b94

BOOTH and TUTTLE, the Committee of the Board of Supervisors, to whom was intrusted the money appropriated by the authorities for paying bounties to soldiers enlisted in Kings County, have concluded their labors. These gentlemen have been constantly engaged in this business for the past three months, during which time they have disbursed several hundred thousand dollars. Yesterday they visited the camp of the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Regiment at East New-York, and the Ironsides Regiment at Jamaica. Nearly $4,000 was distributed among the men. The latter had been provided on the day previous with three wagon loads of pumpkin pies and 150 turkeys, with which they were enabled to observe Thanksgiving in a becoming manner. The articles were furnished by the ladies of the village, to whom the soldiers return their sincere thanks. Some other regiments did not fare so well. There has of late been a great accumulation of soldiers at East New-York. Several New-York regiments, and all from the Eastern States, are emcamped between that point and Jamaica. The road is lined with tents the entire distance, presenting a scene well worth a visit. Yesterday the Twenty-eighth Maine Regiment was added to the number. They arrived in Brooklyn the night previous, and having no place to sleep, were generously provided with quarters by Rev. HENRY WARD BEECHER, who opened his church for their accommodation. Yesterday morning the regiment was taken to the Park Barracks, in New-York, and furnished with breakfast. After which they returned and marched to East New-York. The regiment numbers almost 1,000 men, under command of Col. WOODMAN. Last evening the Fifty-sixth Massachusetts Regiment returned to the City for the purpose of embarking for the seat of war. It is expected that all the regiments will take up their line of march on Monday next. Although it is understood that they will join the expedition under Gen. BANKS, nothing appears to be known as to their destination. The One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New-York Regiment is now on board the steamer Northern Light awaiting orders. The Colonel, Hon H.A. NELSON, having been elected to Congress, resigned his position, and the Lieutenant-Colonel, E.L. MOLINEUX, has been appointed to fill the vacancy.

It is a work peculiarly German in character, and depending largely on dialogue and jocularity of a provincial kind. But to the American who understands a little German there is sufficient of broad, hearty humor to keep him in merriment from the opening scene to the final one. The music is in the happiest vein of the composer -- who, we may take this occasion to say, is not sufficiently known to our public. It is full of freshness and gaiety, and is amply filled with melodies, moreover, that are taking to the average ear. The performance last evening was extremely good. Herr GRAFF, who played the part of Baculus, the Schoolmaster, displayed an unctious vein of comicality which we hardly gave him credit for possessing. Without sacrificing the musical opportunities of his role he succeeded in keeping the house in a roar. Mme. JOHANSSEN was admirable also, as the Baroness Freimann, and a lady whose name we have not met before -- Mme. SCHAUMBERG -- made a favorable impression as Grettchen. The remaining characters were sustained with spirit and success by Messrs. WEINLICH, QUINT and KRONFELD. We have always to praise the orchestra and chorus at the German Theatre, and may unhesitatingly do so on the present occasion. Rarely have we sat out a performance that gave so much genuine satisfaction, or obtained so merited and unequivocal a success.

All the ordinary pleas for non-intervention fail in this case. That we have the right to interfere is  amply established by the precedents of Greece and Belgium.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/30/archives/ministers.html,,"All the ordinary pleas for non-intervention fail in this case. That we have the right to interfere is amply established by the precedents of Greece and Belgium. That we should do any injustice by interfering is obviously false; interference is needed only to check a wanton aggression and to assist a brave, orderly, and unanimous people in rescuing their soil from the hordes of a barbarous invader. That we have no interest in interfering no honest man pretends to think, and became man dares to argue. Two years ago our chief manufacture was in a condition of especial prosperity now it is entirely suspended. Its raw material exists in plenty: it could be supplied in abundance for the future, if only we took means to secure its safe conveyance to this country. Until the war began the operatives of Lancashire were happy, contented, industrious, thriving. They had ample wages, cheerful homed, money laid by; they were learning to improve their condition and prospects by means of those cooperative states, with whose name and nature most of our readers are familiar. The blockade has ruined everything. It has closed the cooperative stores; it has emptied the savings banks; it has swept away the little provision which thrift and forethought had made for a time of pressure; it has turned happy homes into houses of mourning; it has extinguished the fires on cheerful hearths; it has taken the work from industrious hands and the bread from mouths unused to want; it has robbed half a million of people of the furniture, the clothing, the comforts they had acquired by a lifetime of honest and skillful labor; it has pauperized the most prosperous, proudest and most intelligent working population in the world. Ten years of war could not have done us half so much harm. And now, though these sufferers have a bare supply of food, and efforts are being made to give them fuel and clothing, we find that they are likely to perish by famine, if not of it. The diseases which famine breeds are making rapid progress among them; and there seems great reason to fear that, if the blockade lasts six months longer, the people of Lancashire will be decimated by a pestilence scarcely less deadly than the plague or the yellow fever -- a pestilence due to want alone -- to that want which has been created by the American blockade. And for the life of every man who dies by that pestilence her Majesty's Ministers are now solely and absolutely responsible. Whether their own consciences will ever forgive them we cannot pretend to say; their country never will.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MINISTERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MINISTERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Herald', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4668083d-eaf4-5f8f-9533-5437e936f9e7,441,nyt://article/4668083d-eaf4-5f8f-9533-5437e936f9e7

Brig.-Gen. CLAIBOURNE's command, with which was Gen. POLK, just at nightfall came upon an Indiana regiment. Gen. POLK was some distance in advance of our troops, and suddenly found himself in the very midst of the Indianians, who were firing briskly upon CLAIBOURNE's columns. Gen. POLK, seizing the Indiana Colonel by the shoulder, demanded, ""Why he was firing upon his friends?"" The Colonel said that he did not know that he was guilty of such a blunder, and asked, ""Who are you?"" ""I'll show you who I am,"" said Gen. POLK, and then, raising in his stirrups, he gave the order to the Indianians to ""Cease firing!"" Saying to the Colonel, ""You shall at once hear from me, sir,"" POLK rode quietly away, and as soon as he was out of sight, with accelerated velocity came dashing at headlong speed to the spot where Gen. CLAIBOURNE stood. Pointing to the Yankees, he exclaimed, ""Let them have it, boys, they are Yankees; I've been there."" Gen. POLK said afterward that he counted not less than fifteen balls as they penetrated his back while he rode away from the Indianians. We are happy to advise our readers that, on his arrival at this place Gen. POLK had entirely recovered from his imagined wounds; in fact, he wears a charmed life.

Well may the President of the Federal Republic of North America express surprise and regret at the turn the elections have already taken in his own States.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/30/archives/the-american-elections-no-argument-for-mediation.html,,"Well may the President of the Federal Republic of North America express surprise and regret at the turn the elections have already taken in his own States. Every day renders it more evident that the people of those Northern States are discontented with the policy of Mr. LINCOLN, and are determined upon a change. There is a sort of electrical sympathy which courses through the population of this vast American nation. They act and think in masses, and they change in masses. For two years there has been one impulse which has swept all before it -- a racing tide which neither the counsels of wise men nor the lessons of misfortune could turn or stern. In mid-channel it runs as hard as ever, but it is ebbing at the shores. Everything is strange in American nomenclature. The faction who call themselves ""Republicans"" are those who care nothing for the Republic, but who are ready to sacrifice constitutional forms and individual liberty, civil rights, and the protection of law itself, to the one desire of vengeance. They are anything but Republicans. The only name which will describe them is that lately fixed upon them by their opponents and their victims, that of ""Exterminators."" They who call themselves ""Democrats,"" on the contrary, are anything but Democrats. They are the Conservatives of this great Republic. They are for the Constitution according to WASHINGTON, for the law according to the Judges of the Supreme Court, and for the equal protection of the legal rights of all classes of the community. The Republicans are for absolute power, to be obtained by the sword, and to be exercised under the dictation of mobs led by a few frantic parsons and fanatical laymen. The Democrats are for limited power, to be exercised within the limits of the Constitution, and under the influence of the educated classes. The Republicans seem to have disgusted the unattached masses by their violence and their ill-success. The elections, thus far, are unmistakably going against them; and if the anticipations we publish to-day should be realized, and if it should turn out that New-York, New-Jersey and Massachusetts have followed the example of Pennsylvania, the first impulse will have been given to the change, and the Democrats will by peaceable or by forcible means once more obtain the direction of the policy of the Government.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS NO ARGUMENT FOR MEDIATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS NO ARGUMENT FOR MEDIATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-11-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, Nov. 13', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Nov', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b448acf8-a6e7-580e-96ff-f306ac255519,1588,nyt://article/b448acf8-a6e7-580e-96ff-f306ac255519

If any of my brethren who dwell in parsonages and worship in sanctuaries, dissent from building log huts on Sunday, before I reason with them I shall insist that they just master the question, by taking one blanket and one ordinary sheet from their beds -- and going forth into an exposed meadow, snow three inches deep, and wind a blowing, to spend Saturday night. Next, let them be forbidden to enter any house, or take any hay, straw or shelter stuff. Compel them to hands off from all wood-piles. Somewhere about ten o'clock in the morning, Sunday, give the good man an axe and a Bible, and tell him to find his duty and do it, and, my word for it, he will build log shelters all day Sunday, quietly saying: ""How much better is a man than a beast.
