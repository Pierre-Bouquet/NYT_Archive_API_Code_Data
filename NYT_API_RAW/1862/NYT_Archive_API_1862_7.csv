"The close of the past week was marked by important events before Richmond, prominent among which was a battle, or rather a series of battles, continuing through two days. ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/01/archives/news-of-the-day-the-rebellion.html,,"The close of the past week was marked by important events before Richmond, prominent among which was a battle, or rather a series of battles, continuing through two days. The fighting, however, was only incident to more important matters, which will be found detailed in our columns this morning. Gen. MCCLELLAN has contracted his lines, and massed his troops between the Chickahominy and James Rivers -- the latter of which will constitute his base of operations until the fall of the rebel Capital, which cannot apparently be long delayed. Whit House has been abandoned and the right wing of the army has been drawn in across the Chickahominy -- not with out considerable loss of life, but still slight, it is believed, in comparison with that of the enemy. The supplies for the army will hereafter be conveyed up the James Rivers under the protection of our gunboats. On Friday morning the enemy made the looked for attempt to turn our right wing. The rebel division of Gen. JACKSON, which must have started for Richmond immediately, after the fiasco in Shenandoah Valley, attacked Gen. MCCALL's Division of the Pennsylvania reserves, on our extreme right. The action lasted for three hours, and was brilliantly successful on our part. JACKSON was repulsed and severely punished. The rebels then made a general attack on our right wing, which was composed of Gen. FITZ JOHN PORTER's army corps. A severe battle ensued, in which the rebels suffered severely. In the midst of this battle Gen. MCCLELLAN executed the movement for which he had been preparing. His whole right wing commenced an orderly retreat, falling back until it had crossed to the south side of the Chickahominy, in the rear of his left wing, and pushed on toward the James River. The movement was carried out in excellent style, everything valuable being secured, and the rebels repulsed in their attacks upon our rear guard. The evacuation of the White House was completed on Saturday, all that was valuable being carried away, and the remnants not worth moving burned. In this destruction the White House itself shared, some unauthorized person's having set fire to it in the confusion. Our troops there were finally put on board steamers and taken to Yorktown.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/18c375ee-fcb0-5e6b-9e56-0076153c9593,757,nyt://article/18c375ee-fcb0-5e6b-9e56-0076153c9593

The Assistant District-Attorney thought that although there was no evidence that the prisoner was aware that the bill was a counterfeit when he passed it, still his not calling for his vest was a circumstance strongly tending to show guilt. The Recorder decided that the evidence did not warrant the commitment, and discharged the prisoner.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/52ff8326-0278-5759-9b21-572cd6634138,666,nyt://article/52ff8326-0278-5759-9b21-572cd6634138

It will not do to render the result in any way uncertain for want of men while hundreds of thousands can be had. It will not do to prolong the war by permitting the occurrence of alternate instances of victory and defeat, defeat and victory, when it is possible to inflict upon the rebels a defeat after which no victory shall ever come to crown their arms or to sustain their spirits. We have now, practically speaking, the whole Confederate force centred at one point -- near the rebel Capital, The small detachments in the Cotton States at Charleston and elsewhere, are of little account in the general issue. The capture of isolated rebel towns, or the possession of vast spaces of rebel territory, are of minor moment compared with the destruction of the army upon which the hope of the rebellion and of the rebels rest.

The assault was to begin on Friday last; and it is not unlikely that the town may by this time have fallen. Still, we would not be surprised if the Vicksburgh rebels were able to make quite a lengthened stand against our fleet. Their heavy guns are planted on the high bluffs, and at commanding positions, where it is quite difficult work for the guns of our gunboats to reach them, or for the mortars of our bombketches to strike them; and we have no land force sufficient to attack the town in the rear. The telegraph says that the rebel force there is estimated at twelve thousand men, which is much more likely to be true than most of the other stories that have come to us from the Southwest of the large rebel bodies massed at various points. The rebel army at Corinth had direct railroad communication with Vicksburgh, and we know that a considerable body of rebels went southward from Grand Junction on the Mississippi Central Railroad. Their object now is simply to delay and annoy us as much as possible, and also to defend the State Capital.

Dispatches from Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/01/archives/news-from-washington-debate-in-the-house-on-the-question-of.html,Dispatches from Washington,"The house devoted its entire session to-day, continuing for more than five hours, to the discussion of the bill for the enlargement of the Erie and Oswego locks and the Illinois Ganal and River. The expenditure of the United States is carefully limited by the bill to three and a half millions for the former work, and ten millions for the latter, which sum is to be expended gradually, and only so fast as the accruing tells pledged to the United States shall suffice to pay the interest. The merits of the bill were sustained in able and effective speeches, by Messrs. FRANK BLAIR, of Missouri; ARNOLD, of Illinois, and ELY, POMEROY OLIN and VAN HORN, of New-York. The Pennsylvania delegation and that of New-Jersey, and those of the Border States, opposed the bill en masse. Mr. SEEVENS, of Pennsylvania, the only speaker against the bill, undertook to throw ridicule upon it by introducing a sham amendment for a slack water navigation of the Sasquehanna for the passage of gunboats, followed by a motion to postpone the whole subject to the first Monday of January next. The previous question being demanded on the latter proposition, it was defeated by the close vote of 57 to 58. A series of fillibustering movements were then made by the enemies of the bill to prevent further action upon it, and the Ayes and Noes were repeatedly taken. It is a very singular and noticeable circumstance, that Hon. FREDK. A. CONKLING, the only Republican Member from the City of New-York, steadily voted with the Opposition, in which he was sustained by his brother, Hon. ROSCOM CONKLING, who lives upon the line of the Erie Canal. With these exceptions, the whole body of the New-York Delegation present, including Messrs. WARD and BEN. WOOD, of New-York City, firmly supported the bill. It also received the votes of many of the substantial Members from New-England, and nearly all the Members from the Western States. The House at length adjourned, with the understanding that the final vote upon the measure should be taken in the morning.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEWS FROM WASHINGTON.; Debate in the House on the Question of Enlarging the Canals.

Editorial argues against vindictiveness in dealing with the Confederates,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/02/archives/our-dealings-with-the-rebels-more-vindictiveness.html,Editorial argues against vindictiveness in dealing with the Confederates,"The pulse of our people is rapidly working up to fever-heat. By nature the Northern American is one of the most cheerful and long-suffering of mortals. He bears the tyranny of servants, the fleecing by railroad companies, the impositions of hotels, the explosions of steamboats with an equanimity and good feeling which utterly surprises a European. Mr. TROLLOPE considers this trait a National defect. The Northerner is not naturally vindictive. It has taken him a year fully to realize that his Southern brother really wants to cut his throat, and that war is war. But he is finally becoming convinced of these facts. The madness of the enemy, their ferocity to the wounded, their causeless destruction of property, their determined resistance, and the priceless blood which is staining the Southern fields, are all lighting that dull glow of passion which fires slowly in our Northern heart, but which burns up finally to an intense all-devouring heat. When we think of the little cause we have ever offered for this satanic rebellion, of our patience through years of stinging provocation, and now of our brethren and friends -- every man of them worth to the world hundreds of the wretched ""white trash"" opposed to them -- dying by thousands from disease and wounds, we are ready to feel that no punishment could be too great and no revenge too bitter for such wrongs. A cry goes up from the people for punishment, for severity, for unrelenting sternness. Confiscation is demanded; the wasting of the rebellious districts, and condign and terrible punishment on the leaders. To a certain extent these feelings are just. No punishment could be too severe on the leaders in this unnatural and gigantic rebellion. Confiscation of the property and slaves of the Southern treasonable aristocracy is called for by every motive of policy and justice. Neither should our soldiers suffer when their supplies are short, and provisions and forage are plentiful around them in the rebellious territory. No one demands this, and there is no likelihood of its ever occurring. But it is time now for the leaders of opinion in the North, and for the religious teachers to instruct the people what should be the limits to these feelings of vindictiveness. We must remember that we are not engaged in an ordinary war with the South. If we were, the task would be comparatively simple. We should then only have to consider how we could inflict the most loss and damage on the Southern country. But this is not our object. We simply desire to break the armed resistance of the rebels. To do this, we must blockade their coast, capture their towns and destroy their armies. But after that, we are obliged to hold their territory in peaceful bonds, to develop the loyal feeling, to change treason into loyalty, to make it for their interest to be associated with us in one united Republic. It is true, if this cannot be done by all reasonable means, the North is in such a frame of mind that it would give up the Southern country to emancipated slaves or to Northern armed colonists, or even to crocodiles, rather than have it held by a foreign and hostile Power.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Dealings with the Rebels More Vindictiveness.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Dealings with the Rebels More Vindictiveness.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/332400c9-a0e8-506a-bf2f-f19202cdf752,833,nyt://article/332400c9-a0e8-506a-bf2f-f19202cdf752

"It may be remembered that some two years since the Arion Society, which has seceded from the old Liederkranz, competed at Buffalo for a silver goblet which was offered for the best choral singing. They won it, and have since established their reputation by their annual concerts in New-York as one of the best choral societies, if not the best, we have ever had here. Their annual masked ball has also been largely attended by the leading German and French families of the City -- many of the younger members of which are enrolled among the members, with some of our best resident musicians. Now, this Society has determined to make an excursion of pleasure to Niagara Falls, during which it is their intention to give two grand choral and instrumental concerts, conducted by their musical directors, CARL ANSCHUTZ and BERGMANN, at Buffalo and Rochester -- to the former of which cities they have been repeatedly requested to repeat their visit. For the purpose of combining pleasure with an increase of reputation, at a reasonable rate, arrangements have been made with the Directors of the New-York Central Railroad for a trip of twelve days, visiting the intermediate cities between our own and the Falls, while many of the leading instrumentalists have been secured to make their concerts the veritable musical features of the season in Buffalo and Rochester. Among these are MILLS, the pianist; SCHREIBER, with his cornet-a-piston; WOLLENHAUPT, NOLL and MOLLENHAUER. With such an array of talent, we are disposed to guarantee them a pleasant as well as a profitable excursion -- profitable, because the expenses will scarcely be more than it would have cost them had they remained in New-York.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/02/archives/musical-excursion.html,,"It may be remembered that some two years since the Arion Society, which has seceded from the old Liederkranz, competed at Buffalo for a silver goblet which was offered for the best choral singing.

"We are still without any specific information as to the present status of our army on the James; but all the items of news that trickle from official and unofficial sources, the gleanings from persons who left the lines as late as Sunday, and from the bearings of movements known to have been successfully accomplished, the inference is that the work which Gen. MCCLELLAN has in hand is progressing to a favorable result. The heavy operations of the battle-field, last week, practically ended with Friday, by which time the change of position which was desired, had been effected, and further offensive action on the part of the enemy was impossible. Our left wing rested upon the James River, our right upon the Chickahominy, and the whole National line was less than nine miles in length. Communication with the gunboats had been opened up; perhaps other forces to the southward had been spoken with; and the now compact mass of the Union army was ready for the next word of its Commander. Of the rebel army, we hear actually nothing. Whether that section of it which pushed to the railroad and the York River still remains there; or finding that in their occupation they had achieved a barren conquest, and that it were altogether useless to attempt to hold or use it, whether they have drawn back again to the main line of defences, near the rebel capital, there to await the onset of MCCLELLAN, we are quite in the dark. We should judge that the latter would be their policy, and that they would have carried it out just as rapidly as possible. They cannot cross the Chickahominy; they cannot operate on the York River, or anywhere north or east of it; and so, perhaps, leaving a small force for the sake of show, and to give themselves assurance of a victory won, JACKSON at once hastened in the direction of the beleaguered capital. JACKSON's name and army would be a tower of strength there at present, crowned as he is with the laurels of the Shenandoah, and followed by fifty thousand of the beat troops in JEFF. DAVIS' service. All these rebel masses, however, cannot avail for the defence of Richmond when once our gunboats shall have passed Fort Darling and the rebel obstructions in the river. When they reach the town, its surrender is certain; the most feasible line of retreat of the rebel army is cut off, if indeed the iron-clads be not capable of rendering a successful retreat altogether impracticable. At present, we judge that the National and rebel armies are now again fronting each other, with the former in an incalculably better position than it formerly occupied, and consequently far stronger, and with a line not one-third the length of its former line to defend.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/02/archives/the-lines-before-richmond.html,,"We are still without any specific information as to the present status of our army on the James; but all the items of news that trickle from official and unofficial sources, the gleanings from persons who left the lines as late as Sunday, and from the bearings of movements known to have been successfully accomplished, the inference is that the work which Gen.

ANDERSON and RODERIGUE, of the Commissioners' office, had charge of the commissary department, and dispensed the crackers and cheese to the little orphans in the most bountiful profusion. Officer CRONIN, of the Thirteenth. Precinct, also accompanied the excursion, and rendered valuable assistance.

It was the intention of the Warden to have the children land at New-Rochelle, and to allow the little girls to enjoy themselves in the shade, while the boys composing the ""Light Guard"" were to march up to the village, a mile and a half distant. On arriving at the landing, however, the proprietor of the Neptune House peremptorily refused to allow the little orphan girls to sit in the shade of his ample grounds while their brothers marched up to the village.

It has been stated in the public prints that a Convention has been entered into by Sir C. WYKE and Commodore DUNLOP on one side, and the Mexican Government on the other, by which the British claims on Mexico will be satisfied, and that the Convention has been ratified by Her Majesty's Government. As to the first part, it is quite true that a Convention has been signed by Sir C. WYKE and Commodore DUNLOP, and it has been sent home for ratification. The arrangement contemplated for the satisfaction of British claims was fair and liberal, but we found that the Convention referred to another Convention between Mexico and the United States, and, fearing that it might involve this country in difficulties, Her Majesty's Government determined not to ratify it. There is another point upon which I wish to make a statement to the House. It is generally believed in France, and much circulated here, that Her Majesty's troops, together with the Spanish troops, were withdrawn, leaving the French troops alone to contend with the difficulties of the situation. After the temporary check which the French troops received, no one can be surprised that the French Government have resulted to send large reinforcements to Mexico, but the order is not founded upon any course taken by the British Government. In the original Convention of October there was no specific engagement as to the number of troops to be sent on the part of the different Governments, but communications were made separately by each Government. The Spaniards declared that they meant to send 6,000 or 7,000 troops. The French said at first that they would send 2,600, which was afterwards increased to 2,500 men. The British Government proposed to send a squadron with 700 marines, to be landed, if necessary, for the occupation of forts. The marines were landed, and for a short time occupied some forts. It seemed that the land forces met with difficulties, and Commodore DUNLOP, in order not to have the appearance in any way of leaving the allies, said he would provide, by his own activity and resources, camp equipage and conveyance. That, however, has not been approved by the Home Government, and orders were sent out that the marines should be reembarked. Commodore DUNLOP, on his side, very soon found that there was no immediate danger of collision with the Mexicans, and he determined to send away the marines, who were never intended to march up the country. They were accordingly removed from Vera Cruz. After this came the convention, and the allied commissioners agreed to a proces verbal, with regard to which I will now say nothing, as I do not wish to enter into the great question involved in it. But it should be known that at that time there were only 150 marines in occupation of the various forts, and when the rupture took place between the French Commissioners on the one side, and the English and Spanish Commissioners on the other, it was determined by Commodore DUNLOP to haul down the British flag in the ports of Mexico, and to withdraw his small force. There was thus no question of withdrawing troops from Mexico, for there never were any land troops there; the only force we ever sent in the naval squadron was a force of 700 marines, the greater number of whom were withdrawn some time previously. [Hear.] I thought it necessary to make this statement, as I believe that great misapprehension has arisen on the subject. I am informed that considerable indignation has been expressed in France as to the presumed withdrawal of troops by this country at a very critical moment. That supposition, as I have shown, has no foundation in fact, as there were no British troops to be withdrawn from Mexico.

It is to be hoped the right of free discussion was last night vindicated to the content of everybody. The meeting at Cooper Institute ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/02/archives/the-submission-meeting-at-cooper-institute.html,,"It is to be hoped the right of free discussion was last night vindicated to the content of everybody. The meeting at Cooper Institute was evidently not to the public taste, notwithstanding the extreme diffidence with which its object was announced. ""The Union, as it was, the Constitution as it is,"" is an indifferently good war cry, chiefly because it means anything or nothing, at the option of the utterer; treason, if treachery happen to be the individual bent; loyalty, if personal caprice fortuitously take that better direction. But people generally had little faith in any commendable sense to be affixed to the phrase. The antecedents, remote and recent, of the men principally interested in the business, were of themselves sufficient warrant of malign purposes, or of a folly more mischievous than the extreme of malignity; men, who either openly abetted and encouraged the rebellion, or who interposed between it and a punishment which, had it been prompt, might have been instantly curative. Even the mob, which too often runs without reading, understands that an Ex-Mayor of this City, who interposed to secure arms for the rebels, and an Ex-Senator from Kentucky, who paralysed the stroke of justice by attempts at accommodation which the insurgents unanimously scouted, are not likely to wish simply a restoration of peace and order. A strong suspicion prevails, quite naturally, that sympathy with the objects of rebellion, and a desire to concede everything to the spirit of violence and treason, which have flooded the nation with ills unspeakable, really underlie the very temperate professions of these peacemakers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Submission Meeting at Cooper Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Submission Meeting at Cooper Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a394a2e5-3443-54e4-88c2-efaab4b2daa7,935,nyt://article/a394a2e5-3443-54e4-88c2-efaab4b2daa7

The citizens of Bowronville -- a small but beautiful and enterprising village in the Eighteenth Ward -- propose to spend a much larger sum than the City authorities, in a patriotic demonstration. In the grove, near the Dutch Reformed Church, the day will be ushered in by the firing of a National salute. At 3 P.M., after a prayer, the Declaration of Independence will be read by HENRY C.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/03/archives/general-city-news.html,,"OPENING OF THE NEW-YORK RACES. -- The second meeting of the racing campaign instituted by Mr. J.L. CASSADY, and to be continued under his auspices will take place to-morrow, the Fourth of July, on the Union Course, Long Island. Mr. CASSADY has taken upon himself the laudable task of endeavoring to revive public interest in the sports of the turf in the Northern States, and under his judicious management, combined with the many improvements made on the programme of his predecessors, we think he has a fair chance of success. The old and exorbitant fee of $1 for admission to the track is to be abolished, and the moderate sum of 25 cents will purchase all the privileges of the Course, with the exception of a seat on the Grand Stand, for which the old price will be charged. Ladies, if accompanied by gentlemen, are to be admitted free, including a seat on the Stand. If such liberality does not render the race-course popular, it will be safe to conclude that all interest in the sport is past ""revival,"" at least in this latitude. Mr. CASSADY has secured the attendance of the leading sporting men of Kentucky and Tennessee, with their studs, and the attractions of the opening meeting to-morrow are such as can hardly fail to secure a large attendance. There will be three races during the day -- one of three-year olds, two-mile heats, for which there are 12 entries; another of saddle horses, half-mile heats; and the third, last, and most important, a handicap race, two-mile heats, for which there are 13 entries, with a certainty of at least 10 starters. The following are the entries for this race, with the ages and weights to be carried: Laura Ferris, 6 years, 105 pounds; Pope Swigart, 5 years, 100 pounds; Bettie Ward, 5 years, 100 pounds; Hillsborough, 4 years, 90 pounds; West Roxbury, 3 years, 90 pounds; Reporter, 4 years, 95 pounds; Troratore, 5 years, 90 pounds; Sunshine, 3 years, 85 pounds; Miss Jessie, 3 years, 85 pounds; Cyclone, 5 years, 85 pounds; Throg's Neck, aged, 85 pounds; Revenge, 4 years, 85 pounds; and Belie, 4 years, 75 pounds. Pools for the races will be sold on each evening previous to the races by Dr. UNDERWOOD, at 754 Broadway, corner of Eighth-street. All the horses have arrived, and are at the stables of the Union Course, L.I.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f265183f-ab6a-52ce-a247-76f9680dda68,1937,nyt://article/f265183f-ab6a-52ce-a247-76f9680dda68

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/04/archives/rebel-strategy.html,,"It should be remembered, whatever reverses may occur during this portion of the campaign in Virginia, that the rebels have one important strategic advantage. They are at the centre or on the smaller arc of the circle, while we move on the circumference. A distinguished Prussian officer, whose military criticism was quoted in these columns, indicated more than a month before the date of the event, the threatening possibility of a defeat of BANKS' corps. The position recalled to him a well-remembered campaign on the borders of his own country -- that year when NAPOLEON, holding Dresden as a centre, kept an overwhelming mass of the Allies in check, by moving out with tremendous rapidity from his centre, now upon one corps and then another, and defeating them in detail. Or better still, it might have reminded him of NAPOLEON's position in his last glorious campaign in France, before the banishment to Elba. There, moving on the smaller arc, though with a much inferior force to the whole of the Allies, he was enabled to fall upon BUTCHER's corps, and other corps with superior numbers and tremendous effect, and at one time seemed about to drive out in disgrace the enormous armies of the Allies. Owing to the nature of the country, and to Gen. MCCLELLAN's making the Peninsula his base of operations, together with the numerous railways behind the enemy's front, the rebel General has been enabled to have the advantage of a central position, while our line has necessarily been extended from the Shenandoah to the Rappahannock and the Chickaliominy. Our connections have been difficult, owing to the character of the surface, and for some unknown reason, unity of action was destroyed by the Washington authorities in the very outset by the division of the army into separate corps. The consequences have been what might be expected.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Strategy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Strategy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0dfd55de-c0f5-591d-9b0b-a4ee97cab40a,508,nyt://article/0dfd55de-c0f5-591d-9b0b-a4ee97cab40a

The extraordinary series of battles which began with Wednesday morning of last week, on our right wing, and which raged almost continuously for the whole week along our entire lines, and over a distance of between thirty and forty miles, seemed to be still unfinished on Wednesday night of this week. ""On Tuesday,"" says Gen. MCCLELLAN, ""we had a severe battle, and to-day (Wednesday, 2d inst.,) we beat the enemy, the men fighting even better than before."" Whether the battle was renewed yesterday, and whether this morning the strife may be still raging, we do not yet know. The main position of our army, however, at Turkey Bend, on the James River, was quite secure under the safeguard of gunboats. The good news also comes to us this morning, that by Wednesday reinforcements had arrived from Washington and we learn, too, that on Tuesday morning a heavy column of Gen. POPE's army reached Fortress Monroe, and had immediately been pushed up the James River. This body must have reinforced Gen. MCCLELLAN by Wednesday, and doubtless rendered him abundantly able not only to hold the rebels in check, but perhaps also to assume the offensive. We suppose that other of the divisions of POPE's army will at once follow that of SHIELDS', and that not less than forty or fifty thousand men altogether can be dispatched to the Peninsula from different points. From Gen. BURNSIDE, strange to say, we have as yet not a word; but he is most certainly on his march to cooperate with MCCLELLAN, if he has not, as we think he must have, joined him before this time. One of our cotemporaries, last evening, gave prominence to a story from Washington that our army had ""lost its siege guns and thirty thousand men;"" but MCCLELLAN himself, writing as late as Wednesday evening, says he had ""lost but one gun, which had to be abandoned because it broke down;"" and another account states that HEINTZELMAN captured eight guns and a whole brigade of rebels, which seems to be much more likely, judging from the latest advices. Four of the most prominent rebel Generals are reported lost to their cause -- Stonewall JACKSON, killed; BARNWELL RHETT, killed; ANDERSON, mortally wounded, and MAGRUDER a prisoner; while of our own general officers, MCCALL and REYNOLDS were reported missing on Tuesday night. The death of JACKSON, which is undoubtedly a fact, as it is announced by the Richmond papers of Monday, and confirmed from our own side, will be a tremendous blow to the rebels. Of all their Generals, he was the only one who had ever assumed the offensive with success; and the successes of their army last week were entirely owing to his quick, energetic and determined action and skillful manoeuvres.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Situation on the James River Better Prospects.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Situation on the James River Better Prospects.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15f87b33-6790-5bc0-94ff-0e0271b4d999,779,nyt://article/15f87b33-6790-5bc0-94ff-0e0271b4d999

Upon looking into the well they discovered a woman sitting upon a cross-beam some 70 feet below the surface, who begged to be taken out. The Police were notified, a rope obtained, and the woman was drawn out in safety, and apparently uninjured. When asked how she got into the well, she stated that her name was CATHERINE GRIFFIN, and that she was employed as a servant at No. 85 Sands-street; that on the afternoon before she went to New-York to see some friends, and while there drank freely of intoxicating beverages. She started for home after dark, and while in a Fulton ferryboat, a young man, whom she had never seen before, induced her to walk to Fort Greene; there he attempted to take borne improper liberties with her person, when she ran away from him and accidentally fell into the place where found. This well is 80 feet deep, about 4 feet in diameter, is walled with stone, and has long been out of use, but has about 10 feet of water in it. Over the top is a stone slab, and through it a hole where a pump formerly was inserted. Over this hole there has been a stone slab, and the place has been reported several times by the Police as a dangerous nuisance. The woman was found seated upon a cross piece a few feet above the water.

A dispatch from the General himself was received at the War Department, yesterday afternoon, which states that he had succeeded in getting his army to the banks of the James River, with the loss of only one gun, which had to be abandoned on account of its becoming disabled; that the wagon train, with the exception of one wagon was in a safe position; that we had a severe battle on Tuesday, and that we beat the enemy on Wednesday. And what is of more importance, Gen. MCCLELLAN announces that reinforcements from Washington had already arrived. These reinforcements,together with those under Gen. SHIELDS, which embarked at Annapolis and arrived at Fortress Monroe on Tuesday, will be sufficient to insure Gen. MCCLELLAN in his new position, if not to enable him immediately to follow up his success of Wednesday, and push straight on to Richmond. The fight of Monday, partially described by our correspondents in yesterday's TIMES, was of the most desperate and determined character. In fact, the fighting of the entire seven days may be thus characterized. The consequent loss of life has been most fearful, but on the rebel side particularly so. The entire losses on both sides, in killed, wounded and missing, are estimated in one account at forty-five thousand, of which our proportion is but fifteen thousand, leaving thirty thousand for the rebels. Among their losses in killed are Gen. ""Stonewall"" JACKSON and Gen. BARNWELL RHETT, of South Carolina. Gen. MAGRUDER is also reported to have been taken prisoner. Many wounded prisoners have been captured on both sides. On the whole, it appears from the latest accounts that the advantages of the fighting have been on our side, though fighting against fearful odds. The number of the rebels is estimated at one hundred and eighty-five thousand, including a large part of BEAUREGARD's army, while against this enormous force we had opposed not more than ninety-five thousand effective men.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64e4fea8-bfe9-53e1-97f2-985cc6c47363,829,nyt://article/64e4fea8-bfe9-53e1-97f2-985cc6c47363

CONCERT BY THE GRAMMAR AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF THE 20TH WARD. ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/04/archives/general-city-news.html,,"CONCERT BY THE GRAMMAR AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF THE 20TH WARD. -- Wednesday night, raining as it was, could in no wise defer the friends of the soldiers from patronizing an entertainment prepared for the benefit of widows and orphans made desolate by the war; and the Academy of Music could never hold forth more popular inducement to the lovers of music and poetry than drew the tremendous audience that witnessed it. Six departments of the public schools of the Twentieth Ward were represented, comprising in all six hundred well trained performers. Drills, tableaux and music, vocal by the young ladies and gentlemen, and instrumental by Dodworth's Band, made up the main attraction. To enter into detail of the excellent manner in which each and every one of these performances was conducted is unnecessary, but the military evolutions, first by the boys of Grammar School No. 32, and afterward the ""Zouave Drill,"" by the young ladies of Grammar School No. 33, were so remarkably appropriate, and elicited such unqualified applause, that great praise must be accorded to their instructors. The ""Wreath exercise"" was also a peculiar feature of the entertainment, and one which exhibited striking perfection in methods of the drill. Mayor OPDYKE presided, and numbers of distinguished persons were present. The ""Tableaux"" at the close depicted: ""The Seasons."" ""Taking the Veil."" ""The Sculptor's Dream,"" and best of all ""The Wounded Soldier."" The pupils were at each divertissement costumed in character. The exercises continued till a very late hour, and the Committee of Arrangements must certainly find their exchequer amply filled. Much good may it do the widows and the orphans of our self-sacrificing soldiers.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb671a27-9cad-5d18-a276-6bf684c3bcd2,1285,nyt://article/bb671a27-9cad-5d18-a276-6bf684c3bcd2

"The people living on the line of the Charleston road are kept in terror by recent raids in that vicinity.

The cavalry force under JACKSON was large, and seemed to be bound for District No. 9, a district in which there was considerable cotton, none of which the Confederates had had time to burn before the occupation of Memphis. This District is reached by the Macon road, and is said to contain about fifteen hundred bales of cotton. This, or at least the larger portion of it was destroyed by the Confederates on Wednesday. Two persons who were up there buying cotton were arrested and taken off as prisoners. Two other merchants of Memphis, who were also out there, were arrested and taken South. And our informant states that the Confederate cavalry threatened to take as prisoners and to destroy all the property of all persons who, on any pretext, should come to the City of Memphis. They also stated that their intention is and will be to destroy the railroad and telegraph every time they are repaired, and to prevent the working of either. Our informant, who resides in that section, is fearful that their threats will be carried out, and if they should be, he anticipates the worst possible results to his property.

"We have heard some few persons since the arrival of the unfavorable news from the army of the Potomac, who either from sympathy ... ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/04/archives/courage-and-onward.html,,"We have heard some few persons since the arrival of the unfavorable news from the army of the Potomac, who either from sympathy with the rebels, or faint-heartedness, treated the matter as decisive of the question, and declared their opinion that it was all of no use for us to try to fight further, that the new volunteers would never be furnished, and that we might as well make up our minds to accept the fact of the Southern Confederacy with the Ohio River, and the Southern line of Pennsylvania for its northern border. This seems quite too great a conclusion to draw from any facts which we have. If MCCLELLAN's army were annihilated, the Monitor taken, Fortress Monroe strictly besieged, and the rebel cannon thundering upon Washington, it would still be, we think, too great a conclusion to draw. We would be still too mighty, too high-spirited a people to yield to such dishonorable terms. For consider what this involves. It involves first and foremost the surrender of the Mississippi which has been opened by our gallant tars amid storms of shot and shell, and the crash of iron prows against wooden walls. It involves giving up to the tender mercies of the rebels not only the scattered Unionists who have made themselves known under the protection of our flag, even in the regions where secession was most poisonous, but the masses of those who have endured so long in East Tennessee, who have fought so gallantly and well in Kentucky, Missouri and Western Virginia. It involves giving up the City of Washington with all its public buildings. It involves giving up Mount Vernon, so that we and our children will need Confederate passports to enable us to stand by the tomb of WASHINGTON. It involves the triumphant sheers of the London Times and the continuous outcry against us and against free institutions of all those who hate them and hate us because we love them. It involves the triumph at home of VALLANDIGHAM and COX, and the two WOODS and those who follow them, whether covertly or openly. It involves endless disgrace and degradation for us in the future, endless strife and confusion, endless war and disturbance, the downfall of American ideas, the overthrow of republican institutions, the turning back of the shadow upon the dial of human progress. We have no fear that any thought of accepting such results will be allowed to dwell for an instant in the minds of our people. As long as our fleets hold the sea, and our gunboats hold the rivers -- as long as the ports and the forts of the Southern harbors remain in our possession, and the rebels are shut out from any but clandestine commerce -- as long as their currency is shinplasters, at fifty per cent, discount, while ours is bank bills and United States notes, at par -- as long as our army is an army of volunteers -- why should we give ourselves up to such gloomy anticipations. Such disgrace is not yet in store for us. When salt is not to be had, and pins and needles are not to be bought in the stores of New-York; when our soldiers are on half rations and without uniforms; when want and distress fill the land and stand in every door and when President LINCOLN shall acknowledge, as JEFF. DAVIS has done, that without conscription it is impossible to keep our armies in the field, then, and not till then, will we begin to talk about giving up our hope of a restored Union of one free people, sweeping from the Lakes to the Gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

If the facts in the case could all be made known, the public mind would be shocked beyond measure at the state of things which has existed and still exists. Quacks of all sorts, apothecary's boys, and even barbers and others, wholly destitute of professional knowledge, actually hold the posts of Surgeons and Assistant Surgeons to regiments, and even of Medical Directors of brigades.

This mass of people came upon the ground, remained for nearly two hours and then dispersed, without any disturbance or unruly conduct, whatever.

A fine band of music was on duty, as at every other place where fireworks were exhibited, and kept down the impatience of the thousands who had come to see only the fireworks. The entire exhibition proved the correctness of the Committee's judgment in awarding to Messrs. EDGE the duty and honor of preparing them. Having already published a list of the pieces intended to be presented, it is only necessary now to say that the entire programme was carried out to the letter, and to note those which received the most popular applause. All of the pieces were really magnificent, but those which elicited the greatest applause were the engagement between the Monitor and Merrimac, and the closing piece, a temple of Liberty, with Gen. MCCLELLAN as the centre piece, which was really a chef d'oeuvre of pyrotechnic art.

That every person, package and letter transported between the metropolis and the capital of America, should, in this steam-propelled age, be dragged for two hours round the streets of Philadelphia and Baltimore by horses, and boated across bridged rivers, when the express trains between London and Edinburgh, for instance, accomplish the journey of 400 miles in ten hours, is quite incompatible with the spirit and intentions of the people. Whereupon Congress is called upon to remedy the evil by legislation, and a score of schemes are urged -- schemes diverse enough in engineering demerit, certainly, but irregularly alike, in that they are all based upon pecuniary aid from the Government, and that they all propose to furnish a higher speed and cheaper fares, with a loss cost for road and equipment, than any present lines. Now, any suggestion other than to heap obstacles and punishment upon the local monopoly, has invariably been denounced as sympathy in its behalf; but this treatment has never remedied its abuses, and never will.

The military appeared to decided advantage -- the glittering helmets of the cavalry, who headed the parade, glancing in the bright sunlight, and the polished muskets of the infantry flashing as they passed through the pleasant shady streets. Many of the windows on the route were filled with ladies, who welcomed the soldiers with waving of hands and handkerchiefs. Between 9 1/2 and 10 o'clock the procession halted before the church. After a short delay, during which the soldiers displayed their efficiency in the manual of arms, the doors were thrown open to the public, and the building was quickly filled. The decorations of the house were exceedingly simple, two Union flags being crossed above the pulpit -- only these. While the audience were being seated the band played a March, which was well executed. An earnest prayer was made by Rev. J.P. Wilson, D.D., after which the choir sang ""Hail Festal Day."" The Declaration of Independence was next read by Mr. W.R. HOWELL, when the choir again sang, this time ""The Ship of State,"" which was received with enthusiasm. Hon. JAS. BROOKS was then introduced as the orator of the day. Mr. BROOKS regretted not being more thoroughly prepared -- the present serious aspect of affairs had so preyed upon his mind that he felt almost indisposed, and incapable of the task before him. Our country, he said, had been cradled in adversity. From a glance at its earlier history, the speaker turned to a more lengthy consideration of the period following the Declaration of Independence, and to subsequent events in its annals, whereby, for a time, the continuance of the Union seemed endangered; not forgetting to indulge in a sneering remark relative to the old ""Bay State,"" and similar in style to many of those which formed the staple of his speech at the ""Cooper Institute"" in this City, a few nights ago, wherein he aimed the barbed arrows of his hate at all New-England. It is but justice to the people of Newark to say that the slur was not appreciated. Whatever may be the opinion of some, Mr. BROOKS declared it to be his, that the South are without cause in this quarrel, and utterly undeserving of sympathy. Rebellion must be met with a bold front. Before determined resistance it would succumb; and by the time another Anniversary of this, the National Sabbath of our land, he devoutly honed to see these thirty millions of Americans once more a united and happy people.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE OBSERVANCE AT NEWARK.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE OBSERVANCE AT NEWARK.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ef13447d-97dc-5f51-ad9d-32c560aca4f9,592,nyt://article/ef13447d-97dc-5f51-ad9d-32c560aca4f9

A foreign observer is necessarily ignorant of every nation but his own; and even of their own people, how few can ever give us unbiased and well-considered judgments. Doubtless when educated Frenchmen hear of the tendency toward royalty or despotism in this country, they receive the dogma with as much faith as we do the accounts of revolutionary movements in France, or of the popular hatred, still supposed to exist there toward England, or of the sentimental friendship for America. We read here continually such utterly false and crude theories and statements of fact, made by European critics and observers, in regard to this country, that we have become rather skeptical as to similar statements, made with such confidence about foreign countries. It is accordingly an incredible relief to obtain, at length, a trustworthy witness with reference to the internal condition of a European Power.

The soldier's name is JACOB BERGMAN. He arrived in this City on Saturday, direct from the army of the Potomac, where he was engaged in the six successive battles recently fought in front of Richmond, and on the banks of the Chickahuminy and James rivers. In the last action he was so seriously wounded that it was thought advisable to send him home. Before leaving, however, he obtained from the proper officer a discharge, which states, among other things, that he has served bravely, and with credit to himself, in MCCLELLAN's army for the last ten months. All arrearages of pay were received by him in the shape of three $100 Treasury notes and a few notes of a smaller amount. Upon the arrival in[???] at a public [???] morning, while [???] fellow-boarders asked for the [???], and while he was feeling in his [???] for this article, he accidentally let fall his pocketbook, which contained his hard earnings. He did not notice it at the time but about half an hour after he discovered the loss and gave an alarm. The doors of the house were immediately closed, to prevent any one from escaping, and it was proposed that a search should be instituted. As soon as a proposition for a general search was made, young SAVAGE was the first to accede to it, and his apparent anxiety to have a general overhauling of all pockets completely deceived those who might otherwise have had some suspicion that he was the guilty party. In the meantime, some person had kindly volunteered to obtain the services of Capt. PETTY, of the Fifth Precinct, and he was soon in attendance. Under his directions all the persons in the room were carefully and thoroughly searched, but no clue to the missing money could be obtained, until the last one of the party had been examined. On account of the active part which SAVAGE had taken in the affair, and the great anxiety which he manifested in the recovery of the money no suspicions were entertained that he could be the guilty man, and he was, therefore, left to be examined last. An examination of one of his boots revealed the three $100 Treasury notes, and under the canvass lining in the lower part of one leg of his pantaloons there were found the other $7 in small bills. The pocket-book he had managed by some means to throw into a neighboring vault. Justice BRENNAN committed the accused for trial. Capt.

By some remarkable coincident, cause known only to the popular President of the Fort Washington Clam Bake Club, JOHN E. DEVELIN, Esq., a large company of notables collected on the Point about 2 P.M. There was Surveyor ANDREWS, who came up on duty, in search of liquors which might be smuggled in quantities of more than 93 gallons in one cask. Superintendent JOHN A. KENNEDY found it necessary to look after the up town police; Senator R.B. CONNOLLY went to look after some of his constituents; the younger STETSONS of the Astor House felt bound to lend their advice to the chef. Rev. Father CUMMINGS and Rev. Dr. IVES lent the influence of their good example. The old war horse, ELIJAH F. PURDY, had to look after the youngsters; Sheriff JAMES LYNCH to keep the posse in order; JEEMS PIPES, of Pipesville, and E.F. UNDERHILL, to enliven the scene with characteristic delineations. Then there were Judges Hilton, Sutherland and O'Conner, Street Commissioner Shepherd F. Knapp, Malcolm Campbell, J.P. Cummings, Thos. C. Fields, H.B. Perkins, Commissary-General Welch, Anson Herrick, Jas. Gordon Bennet, Jr., Henry Erben, Richard Schell, Thos. Dunlap, and a host of other social and political celebrities. But the qualifications for membership of the Club are not so much political as gastronomic, gustatory and bibulous. The capacity for degurgitation and deglutition are regarded as of more consequence than the art of wire-pulling. To eat, drink and be merry, constitute the platform of principles. History does not record an instance of a member of the Club failing to observe his duties. All religions and all shades of politics are represented, from the Puritan to the Catholic -- from the hardest -- Hard and softest Soft to the conservative Republican and John Brown Abolitionist; so that their digestive apparatus is unimpaired, their mastication perfect, and their appetites good, and they good fellows, are welcomed to the festive board -- pine board tables, spread in a shady bower on the rock-bound banks of the placid Hudson.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; A CLAM BAKE.

"JACKSON be not dead -- and there is now a doubt thrown over the statement that he was veritably and actually killed in the late battles -- is there no danger of his taking a column, and with it marching suddenly in the direction of Washington? The movements of this daring rebel, during the last two months, have been as rapid and successful as they have been extraordinary in other respects. It is but a few weeks since he pounced upon and defeated the forces of MILROY and SCHENCK, in the Shenandoah Valley. From that work he entered upon the pursuit of Gen. BANKS, drove him to Winchester, defeated him there, pursued him a distance of seventy or eighty miles up to the Potomac; then retired, and during his retreat defeated FREMONT and SHIELDS; then swept over the Blue Ridge and across Eastern Virginia to the Chickahominy, and attacked the right wing of our main army ten days ago -- with what success is known to our readers -- having in this brief space of time fought four battles at distant points, and traversed a distance of four or five hundred miles. In each of the instances his movement was more or less of a surprise, and each of them would have been declared by most men quite impossible before it was actually done. It would undoubtedly be a difficult thing for JACKSON, whether he be or be not dead, to take twenty thousand rebels and move north to Fredericksburgh, thence to Manassas, thence eastward to the Potomac; and it is not likely he will try. We believe, moreover, that our troops now at Washington and the points named are fully prepared to resist such a movement. At least we hope so. And we also hope, that now that it is known that JACKSON's forces are at Richmond, our troops in the Shenandoah Valley and elsewhere in Eastern Virginia, will be so disposed of as to effectually prevent any other northward movements of this rebel, if he be alive, or of his ghost, if he be dead.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/07/archives/is-washington-safe-if-stonewall.html,,"JACKSON be not dead -- and there is now a doubt thrown over the statement that he was veritably and actually killed in the late battles -- is there no danger of his taking a column, and with it marching suddenly in the direction of Washington?

Hundreds of those who have survived deserve promotion; and we hope that the different Commanders will hasten to give their names and their actions officially to the country, and that the President will hasten to confer upon them the well-earned rewards of merit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE VALOR OF OUR OFFICERS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE VALOR OF OUR OFFICERS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cac8e111-151b-5d1d-b202-6c4586057d64,305,nyt://article/cac8e111-151b-5d1d-b202-6c4586057d64

"No one can yet know the extent of our losses or of our gains, in the recent fearful week of battles around Richmond.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/08/archives/grounds-for-encouragement.html,,"No one can yet know the extent of our losses or of our gains, in the recent fearful week of battles around Richmond. The result may be the disorganization and demoralization of the Confederate army, so terribly have their regiments been cut to pieces; but the more probable effect is that both armies will lie on their arms for weeks to come, recruiting the soldiers and re-forming regiments after their great losses, and that the next stroke will be some new military combination on our part, in which our powerful reinforcements, and the great naval force on the James River, may have a share. In the meantime, we have leisure, after the first disappointment that the rebel army was not completely defeated, to look about us and see how we stand. Had calamity really befallen us; had we been utterly routed, and driven off from the Peninsula, and forced back again to the line of the Potomac, as we were last July, still the year's work, as a whole, would have well paid. First and foremost, we have established that we of the North are a Nationality, with a vitality and vigor which announce a glorious career of centuries, whatever may become of the Cotton States. This alone, to prove to ourselves and to the world, would be worth rivers of blood and stores of treasure. Secondly, we have gained the Valley of the Mississippi, and as a consequence, all the vast territories and fnture empires beyond. For these acquisitions, had we been without them, we would willingly have given the five hundred millions which this war has cost, and even fifty thousand lives, had it been necessary. This possession -- a magnificent Empire -- belongs, henceforth and forever, to the civilization of the North, and to a Government based on free labor. Thirdly, we have substantially -- for for Mobile, and Savannah and Charleston must fall whenever our fleet approaches -- the control and possession of the vast Southern seaboard. We hold the forts, (with one or two exceptions,) the best harbors, the natural outlets, the islands, and points and inland waters which protect the coast from foreign invasion and command its commerce. We shall soon have under our power all the arteries of Southern business -- the great rivers -- and wherever a gunboat can sail through the water net-work of a vast interior, will our flag reach. But even more than this: we have almost unconsciously erected ourselves into the most effective naval Power in the world -- atleast for defence. The immense fleet of iron vessels, the powerful gunboats and floating batteries which the United States will possess by next Autumn, would make any foreign interference or intervention in our affairs the most dangerous of all proceedings to even the most warlike of European nations. A year ago we knew nothing of war -- were utterly inexperienced in the preparation for and practice of a campaign -- had few arms and little materiel of war. Now we have vast and disciplined armies, arms by the million, warlike material in immense stores, and above all, a settled confidence in our own courage and resources. We still hold the enemy shut in from the world and outward supplies; we know that vast bodies of his people have no interest in, and even a dislike of the war; we believe that when once victory has settled on our banners, a host of friends will appear in his ranks. Why should we not hope and be cheerful? But more than all, one great arm and source of strength is indicated to us in Gen. HUNTER's letter. If a foreign Power shall intervene, if disaster of the worst shall come, we then call up another element in the strife -- even he armed and emancipated slave, acting under the strict laws of war, but fighting for the Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Grounds for Encouragement.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Grounds for Encouragement.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30a04145-d5b9-514a-afb4-c7f374c5e613,729,nyt://article/30a04145-d5b9-514a-afb4-c7f374c5e613

"valor and endurance of our soldiers, as exhibited during the two weeks previous to this, have been mentioned by Gen. MCCLELLAN, and commemorated by a thousand presses. The long lists of killed and wounded, which have crowded our columns every morning since Thursday, furnish a mournful exhibit of those who are, as the French say, hors de combat -- out of the fight. But among the soldiers -- we refer, at present, particularly to privates -- who survive and are fit for active duty, prompt notice should be taken by Government of the more remarkable and striking cases of heroism which may be mentioned in the reports of different regimental officers, or which may otherwise come to the knowledge of the authorities; and prompt rewards, by promotion, should be given. Among the wounded, also, where the wound is not such as to incapacitate for service, a similar recognition and reward would often do much good; and to all whose extraordinary services may merit distinct recognition, whether they are to go disabled through life, or speedily to die from injuries suffered, such honor would be gratefully received -- if it be not given too late. Within the last six months, and particularly within the past two months, there have been a hundred cases of heroism mentioned in these columns, which, under NAPOLEON, would have received recognition and reward even on the field of battle; but in our army they often go entirely unrewarded, and, but for the Press, would be totally ignored. Our soldiers, it is true, both privates and officers, generally go to the field of battle from a far deeper motive than desire of glory; they are impelled by an unquenchable love of liberty and their country. But mention of their names and deeds, and promotion to a higher position, would intensify every honorable emotion that dwells in the soldier's bosom. In a few cases the public themselves have taken this matter in hand, and shown their appreciation of services rendered -- as in the instance of the gallant sailor who sat upon the barrel of gunpowder, and in the instances of the naval heroes of the Cumberland; and in these and in other cases the Navy Department has also officially done its duty. But in the army there has been a general neglect, which it is our painful duty to mention. There is now an opportunity to make some striking examples in the case of the great seven days' battle on the Peninsula. Scores of officers of all grades were there killed; hundreds of others were disabled from duty for life. Many of these vacant positions might be filled from the ranks; and to the higher grades, the more deserving of the inferior officers might be promoted. We hope that this thing will not be delayed until the records of the battle are half forgotten in the rush of subsequent events; but that our soldiers will be stimulated to great deeds in future by a prompt recognition of their heroic services now.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/08/archives/promotions-from-the-ranks-the-deathless.html,,"valor and endurance of our soldiers, as exhibited during the two weeks previous to this, have been mentioned by Gen.

Our country has heretofore been cursed with thousands of persons whose main business has been to seek place under the Government, hoping to obtain a livelihood thus, rather than by engaging in regular and legitimate occupations. Every change of Administration brings with it apprehension in the minds of those who have held positions under the former one, lest they shall be sacrificed to make room for others whose party services have rendered them worthy in the eyes of the incoming heads of departments. Thousands who, if appointments to and removals from office were made with regard only to qualification and disqualification, would engage in pursuits profitable to themselves and useful to the community, find office only to be removed therefrom at the expiration of four years. This evil, it appears, will be largely increased by the passage of the Tax bill, which requires a large additional force of Government officials to be appointed. The injury inflicted on the country by withdrawing competent men from other occupations to fill these places, is not the only one. The people will be heavily taxed to support them, and to pay them for collecting the money due the Government.

Editorial expresses concern for loyal Unionists in Arkansas now that Confederates again threaten state,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/08/archives/the-arkansas-unionistsinfamous-desertion-of-the-them.html,Editorial expresses concern for loyal Unionists in Arkansas now that Confederates again threaten state,"-- One of the most gratifying indications that has appeared in the Southwest since the beginning of the war, was the remarkable outcropping of Unionism in Northern Arkansas. Wherever Gen. CURTIS marched with his columns along the northern line, and southward toward the State capital, the people came forward in large numbers and voluntarily took the oath of allegiance; and in some instances, whole towns did so. Now that CURTIS has taken the back track, and is retreating northward into Missouri, before a rebel force, what will be the fate of those unhappy loyalists of Arkansas? We know what those who have remained loyal in other parts of the South, have suffered, and we know the punishment which the rebels have meted out to those who have signified their loyalty in any town or section that has been occupied by our forces, after that town or section has been given up to the rebels, and reoccupied by their forces. We remember Southern Missouri, Western Virginia, and Eastern Tennessee, in times gone by; we remember Jacksonville, in Florida, and the rebel rule of terror over Unionists everywhere. Now that the greater part, if not all, of Arkansas has been repossessed by the rebels -- by a part of that rebel army which Gen. HALLECK did not capture or destroy at Corinth -- we suppose that such scenes are being repeated in the northern part of that State; and that many of those who demonstrated their Unionism a month or two ago, have already paid the rebel penalty for it by a forfeiture of their lives or property. The rebels do not stickle over quibbles in this matter. To their foes, it is a stout rope and a short shrift, a cell in a prison, or a quick confiscation of all that they possess. Better had it been for the Arkansas Unionists, in a worldly point of view, that they had not come forward so readily to welcome the flag and take the oath -- better for them that they had welcomed CURTIS' troops with bloody hands and greeted them with scowls of defiance. When our army goes back there, it will doubtless have a different reception from what it met on its first advent. But how, in the name of loyalty, can we expect Unionism to appear anywhere in the South under such circumstances?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ARKANSAS UNIONISTS--INFAMOUS DESERTION of the Them.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ARKANSAS UNIONISTS--INFAMOUS DESERTION of the Them.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a425bd59-d9de-59af-9cf6-adf6ad7d65e1,513,nyt://article/a425bd59-d9de-59af-9cf6-adf6ad7d65e1

The pieces are identical, except that one is danced throughout, whilst the other is half ballet, half musical drama. The musical dramatic part of the version done at NIBLO's, is interpreted by Miss CAROLINE RICHINGS, principally; accessorarily by Mr. P. RICHINGS, Mr. JAMES DUNN, Mr. BOUDINOT, and a chorus. Miss RICHINGS' share of the interpretation is, of course, performed with exquisite finish and harmonious wealth. There is nothing for her to sing that can ever become very popular, yet enough of graceful melody to satisfy any reasonable audience. The most attractive vocal chances she has are in the quaint little air, ""Love me? Love me not?"" and the scena at the end of the first act, with a variation of that air as refrain. She also sings a romance in the second act very nicely, and warbles brilliantly enough in the finale to bring the curtain down in triumph. Of the dancers, it is sufficient to say that Signorina GALLETTI is the choregraphic chief. As queen of the nocturnal waltzers, she surpasses the most bewildering of her previous achievements. Mile. KATRINI and Mons. TOPHOFF support her very capably. The scenery of the new piece is -- some of it -- beautiful.

"It is with infinite pleasure that we read from day to day the accounts now given by our special correspondents, and especially those furnished this morning, of the admirable condition and spirits, the growing numbers and strength, and the lively hopes and prospects of our army on the James. It is just a week ago last night that the fearful seven days' conflict ended, and the change of our lines was effected. From that time to the present, the enemy has not dared to venture forth to the attack; and the period of quiet consequently enjoyed by our army, has been wisely and actively taken advantage of, to clear off the blood and grime of the week of battle, to strengthen the tone of the regiments, and to prepare generally for active field work yet to be undertaken and achieved. It is astonishing indeed, that an army of volunteers, not yet a year old, after such a struggle as ours has just passed through, against a foe so greatly superior in numbers, and imbued with such bloodthirsty ferocity, should come forth in a condition equal to, if not better than, what could have been exhibited by the veterans of any of the fixed armies of the Old World. It is owing, of course, to the possession of qualities by the volunteers of our republican army, which appertain to the soldiers of no other army. Our troops possess intelligence, personal character, an absorbing interest, in the struggle, and a boundless, unselfish devotion to country: these, added to the drill, the esprit de corps, and the mechanical mobility of other armies, produce a military force which may he temporarily beaten without being vanquished, which may render retreat victory, and which, though it may be decimated in numbers, has yet that vitality and cohesive force deeply implanted in its nature, which makes it practically invincible, as no troops without these nobler moral qualities can ever be said to be. No army could be put to a severer test of its mettle than that to which the army of the Potomac has just been subjected; and from all we can learn we judge that there was never an army put to such a test, that came forth with such honor, in a military point of view. This is all against what we have so often been told by our insensate European critics would be the case when the crucial experiment of war was made.

We allude to the entire absence in the war, so far, of any rule for the exchange of prisoners. There is a grave fault somewhere in regard to this matter; and it has cost untold suffering to thousands of Union prisoners whom the hard fate of war has heretofore cast into rebel jails. Now several thousand others are in a like melancholy plight, and we shudder to think of their renewing the hard experience of the earlier captives in the war. Think of the crowded and filthy tobacco warehouses, the brutal keepers, the sanguinary guards, the rotten food, the untended wounds, the unmedicined disease, the miserable marches through the blazing South, and the reincarceration in other jails, more remote than the first, which a voice from home does hardly ever reach.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Prisoners Must be Exchanged.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Prisoners Must be Exchanged.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ac2f5d9d-d44d-5734-91fc-216ed9b66395,924,nyt://article/ac2f5d9d-d44d-5734-91fc-216ed9b66395

It was not expected that organized endeavors would be made to raise companies, until orders from Albany had been promulgated, instructing officers on what terms enlistments would be permitted, and their own relative positions defined. Still, a great many superior men have been constantly enrolled. Native Americans, Irish and Germans have come in, in a steady stream -- in numbers quite up to the anticipations of those who have had experience in the matter.

"-- Thequestion of employing negroes as soldiers or as military laborers was again up in the Senate yesterday, and the debate upon it was very interesting. Senators GRIMES, SHERMAN, FESSENDEN, RICE and WILSON spoke strongly in favor of arming the slaves; Senators SAULSBURY and CARLILE opposed it; Senator COLLAMER argued that the laws confined the militia to white men; Senator DAVIS opposed employing negroes as soldiers, but would use them as laborers; and Senator KING, of this State, proposed to receive into the service persons of African descent, ""for the purpose of constructing intrenchments or other camp service or labor for which they are fitted."" The question was treated entirely in its practical bearings; and with a view to legislation for filling up the new requisition of troops called for by the President. The speakers were very serious; and their views were evidently greatly affected by the recent rebel doings on the Peninsula. There was strong opposition to what was called the ""white-kid-gloved,"" ""rose-water"" mode of conducting the war; and Mr. SHERMAN argued that we ""could not fight against savagesunless we became part savage ourselves,"" and that ""rather than that the Union should be destroyed, he would organize a great army of black men, and desolate every Southern State."" Other speakers were not behind this in strength of expression or in determination to adopt any and every means to put down the rebellion. To the proposition of the Senators from New-York and Kentucky, there certainly can be no reasonable objection. There is a vast amount of military labor on which the slaves in the districts occupied by our army might be employed, and the doing of which by our troops has in some places terribly affected their health and general sanitary condition, and quite unfitted whole regiments for the proper duties of the field. The lines upon lines of prodigious earthworks, constructed before Corinth by our gallant Western soldiers, and the hard labor of which sent thousands of them to their graves in those dismal swamps, should all have been built by the slaves of the insolent rebels of West Tennessee, who were within easy reach, but who, by HALLECK's Order No. 3, were excluded from the lines. So in South Carolina, so in New-Orleans, on the Mississippi, in the Valley of Virginia, and elsewhere. There is enough military work, other than fighting to be done, to employ all the rebel slaves we now have, or are likely to catch for some time. We believe that, just now, it would be better to employ them in this work than to use them as soldiers, for which plenty of far more efficient men can be found. This would be a good point to begin with, and to stop at, at present. And to use them in this way our military commanders should be promptly authorized and ordered.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/10/archives/senate-debate-on-arming-slaves.html,,"-- Thequestion of employing negroes as soldiers or as military laborers was again up in the Senate yesterday, and the debate upon it was very interesting.

The question was treated entirely in its practical bearings; and with a view to legislation for filling up the new requisition of troops called for by the President. The speakers were very serious; and their views were evidently greatly affected by the recent rebel doings on the Peninsula. There was strong opposition to what was called the ""white-kid-gloved,"" ""rose-water"" mode of conducting the war; and Mr. SHERMAN argued that we ""could not fight against savagesunless we became part savage ourselves,"" and that ""rather than that the Union should be destroyed, he would organize a great army of black men, and desolate every Southern State."" Other speakers were not behind this in strength of expression or in determination to adopt any and every means to put down the rebellion. To the proposition of the Senators from New-York and Kentucky, there certainly can be no reasonable objection. There is a vast amount of military labor on which the slaves in the districts occupied by our army might be employed, and the doing of which by our troops has in some places terribly affected their health and general sanitary condition, and quite unfitted whole regiments for the proper duties of the field. The lines upon lines of prodigious earthworks, constructed before Corinth by our gallant Western soldiers, and the hard labor of which sent thousands of them to their graves in those dismal swamps, should all have been built by the slaves of the insolent rebels of West Tennessee, who were within easy reach, but who, by HALLECK's Order No. 3, were excluded from the lines. So in South Carolina, so in New-Orleans, on the Mississippi, in the Valley of Virginia, and elsewhere. There is enough military work, other than fighting to be done, to employ all the rebel slaves we now have, or are likely to catch for some time. We believe that, just now, it would be better to employ them in this work than to use them as soldiers, for which plenty of far more efficient men can be found. This would be a good point to begin with, and to stop at, at present. And to use them in this way our military commanders should be promptly authorized and ordered.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SENATE DEBATE ON ARMING SLAVES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SENATE DEBATE ON ARMING SLAVES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d8dca0f-3907-5435-9cfc-2a310a075c6c,476,nyt://article/4d8dca0f-3907-5435-9cfc-2a310a075c6c

Want of space compels us to a brief mention of the occasion, which, as belonging to one of the oldest in the country, deserves more than we have room to say. The orator of the evening was ALEX. L. SHAW, Esq., Ex-Councilman, and P.G. of the Lodge, and was worthy of himself and the occasion. From the statistical statement presented by the orator it appeared that the Lodge numbered now 457 members. That since their organization, twenty years ago, they had paid out in sick benefits and donations the munificent sum of $10,014, and have on hand now the sum of $7,744 53 -- a larger amount than can probably be claimed by any Lodge in the City of New-York. Apart from the allusions to the Lodge and the records of its doings, Mr. SHAW wandered off into the fields of patriotism, and brought down the plaudits of the assemblage by his eloquent allusions to the various Generals who are conducting our armies to victory in front of Richmond. The ceremonies of the evening here closed by a collation to the friends and ladies who had honored the occasion, which was worthy of the reputation of one of the most honored lodges in New-York.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; A RALLY FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE WAR', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; A RALLY FOR GOVERNMENT AND THE WAR', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5fbbdb8b-8103-5ba7-adb3-7710ef31e768,1346,nyt://article/5fbbdb8b-8103-5ba7-adb3-7710ef31e768

"The weight of evidencenow seems to be that the rebel JACKSON was not killed during the late engagements on the Peninsula. The news of the event came to us from so many sources that it seemed indisputable. It was affirmed by correspondents, confirmed by prisoners, put beyond reasonable doubt by the assertions of the Richmond Press; and the only other items of proof needed to make the chain of evidence perfect, were the account of his obsequies and the certificate of the officiating undertaker. But the correspondents were deceived; the rebel prisoners labored under a mistake; and the Richmond Press, as usual, got the thing all wrong. There is little doubt that he is still alive; for though the proof on the point is negative rather than positive, it is very strong; and, positively, he is also reported to have been within the past week at various localities in Virginia. The same authorities that gave us his death, gave at the same time the death of Gen. Palmetto RHETT, and the mortal wounding of Gen. ANDERSON; but, though it were well that both these infamous rebel leaders were disposed of, there is even less reason to credit the tale of their taking off than that of JACKSON's. Still more grievous is it to be compelled to discredit, and in this case to discredit utterly, the fourth item in the batch of telegraphic news that reached here on the Fourth of July, to wit: that Gen. MAGRUDER -- the whisky-headed, blustering, profane fop and bully, MAGRUDER -- was a prisoner in our hands. The news was good, and, it seems, too good to be correct. There is no doubt concerning the mistake in this case, as, were MAGRUDER in our hands, it would be quite impossible to conceal the fact for a day. He is still destroying rebel liquor, and is, doubtless, swaggering and swearing more than ever. Thus all the reports we had of the killing or capturing of rebel Generals, during the bloody week, appear to be untrue. The statements on this matter, that reached us, were unusually in accurate.

WARD, Esq., there is now in successful operation in that city, one of the most complete army hospitals yet extemporized, capable of accommodating about seven hundred patients. The buildings are situated at the Centre-street Depot, fronting on the river, and are so located that wounded or sick soldiers brought by either the cars or the boats, maybe landed in their beds with but one change. There are in all, three edifices, three stories and basement high, and covering about 100 feet square of ground. They were erected for a large manufacturing house, at a cost of over $100,000. On the reception of the news of the battle of Williamsburgh, Mr. MARCUS L. WARD conceived the idea of having these spacious rooms converted, under the auspices of the State, to the use of the sick and wounded soldiers of the State of New-Jersey, and particularly of the vicinity of Newark. Arrangements for this purpose were partially made, and in connection with other benevolent gentlemen, and a number of volunteer lady nurses, the hospital was started. Local jealousies of other cities in the State, together with, perhaps, some political interference, prevented the successful working of the institution, but, nothing daunted, Mr. WARD and his associates brought the matter before the War Department. The admirable location, and perfect adaptability of the buildings, and the success of the preliminary movements, immediately convinced the Department that the location was favorable. The building and grounds were therefore leased by the Government, and placed under military rule; JOHN H. JANEWAY, Assistant Surgeon United States Army, being placed in sole charge.

A bill was also reported from the Judiciary Committee to amend the act to prohibit the Slave-trade, so as to authorize the President to make arrangements with foreign countries, and especially with Denmark, for the colonization of recaptured Africans. A bill to provide for the employment of persons of African descent in building intrenchments, and for other war purposes, was introduced from the Military Committee. A bill to provide another punishment for treason was introduced by Mr. DAVIS, of Kentucky, and referred to the Judiciary Committee. The resolution introduced several days ago, in relation to the quorum of the Senate, was laid on the table, after some debate. The Naval Grade bill was passed. The Post-route bill, providing for a bridge across the Ohio River at Steubenville, was passed. The bill introduced on Tuesday by Mr. WILSON, amendatory of the act of 1795, authorizing the President to call out Militia, &c., was taken up, and was debated at considerable length. Mr. GRIMES, of Iowa, offered an amendment, in effect authorizing the enrollment of colored persons in the service of the Government. Mr. KING, of New-York, wished to amend by authorizing the employment of colored persons only in building intrenchments, &c., and declaring such persons so employed free. Objections were advanced by Messrs. SAULSBURY, of Delaware, CARLILE, of Virginia, and other Border-State men.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/10/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"THE KINGS COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY AND DR. REA, THE COLORED M.D. -- A meeting of the Kings County Medical Society was held on Tuesday evening, at the Brooklyn Institute, when, after the transaction some preliminary business, the case of Dr. REA was called up for consideration. The facts of this case are about as follows: Dr. REA, a well known physician, having an extensive practice in the Eastern District, and said to be a highly educated and scientific man, applied to be admitted as a member of the Kings County Medical Society. The application was duly presented, and referred to the Committee of Censors, and that body reported in favor of admitting the applicant. Just as the vote was about being taken, a discovery was made that Dr. REA was only three-fourths white -- the other fourth being the same as the ancient Adam is supposed by many to have been -- black. Here was a dilemma. Some members were indignant, others opened their eyes in astonishment, while a few took the matter like philosophers and laughed. After one of the astonished members had recovered his consciousness, he moved to lay the matter upon the table. There it was laid, and the Society adjourned. The next meeting was held on Tuesday night, as we have said above, when something more than an hour was wasted on an effort to dodge the direct question before the Society -- to admit or reject the applicant. The majority, if not all of those present, would doubtless have voted against the applicant had the question been put to a vote; but they hesitated to do this, because they know that Dr. REA can compel them to admit him if he so elects. The subject, however, was discussed very dispassionately, and with a full consciousness of all the embarrassments surrounding it; yet there was apparently a general desire to get rid of direct action by showing that the application of Dr. REA was not legally before the Society. One member moved that a Committee be appointed to request Dr. REA to withdraw his application. This was at once declared to be impossible, because -- he is only three-fourths white. The motion was voted down. Another member alleged that the Committee of Censors had not been legally organized, and therefore Dr. REA's application was not legally before them. The censors did not know, but supposed they were organized properly. Another said the applicants named had not been filed at the County Clerk's office, as required by both a State law and a law of the Society, where physicians receive their diplomas from institutions outside of the State. The censors had never heard of this law before. An indignant member said that he could show by science that this was a white man's Society, and that no colored man could be admitted. After setting forth in eulogistic terms the position of the Society -- he said -- admitting a colored man would be to a certain extent amalgamation, and amalgamation had a tendency to deteriorate -- therefore, a colored man could not be admitted. The speaker apologized to the society for tendering his views -- being the youngest member and took his seat. The Society was not prepared to consider the scientific part of the question. A member said that Dr. REA could be rejected because he kept a drug-store and sold quack medicines. It was suggested that several members in good standing were guilty of just the same thing. The answer to this was that two wrongs cannot make a right; that if the laws had not heretofore been strictly enforced they should be now. A proposition was made to drop the subject, and take no further action until compelled to do so. This met with no favor. A motion to lay the whole matter on the table was lost; a motion to refer the whole subject back to the censors was also rejected, it was finally referred to a Committee of three, consisting of Drs. SMITH, NORTH and SCHAPPS -- to investigate and report as to the legal qualifications and status of Dr. REA, with a view to find some good reason for rejecting the applicant, other than the color of his skin. The sensitiveness of the public mind upon the negro question, was characteristically illustrated by one of the most learned and respected medical gentlemen present at the above meeting. He made the closing speech, reminding the members that this was a scientific Society, and therefore it was their duty not to let what transpired there ""leak out"" and get into the papers, as the public had nothing to do with their affairs.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/998b35d1-ed7c-53ec-9f6d-e60626c760ac,1239,nyt://article/998b35d1-ed7c-53ec-9f6d-e60626c760ac

The story, as it comes to us, is so odd an affair, that we hardly know whether to believe it or not; but it reports that a canal is being cut across the neck of land opposite Vicksburgh, which will take the Mississippi several miles out of its present route, and leave Vicksburgh an inland town. It is well known that directly opposite this point the Mississippi makes an easterly bend of fourteen miles, returns on itself, and leaves a narrow peninsula of about three-quarters of a mile in breadth. Across the neck of the peninsula it is that the canal is being cut. Several thousand negroes are reported to have been at work on it for some time, and when completed, as it is to be immediately, it is expected that the Mississippi will leave its present bed, and cut a wide channel during high water; while Vicksburgh, from being a river town, will wake up and find itself half a dozen miles off in the interior!",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Turning the Flank on Vicksburgh Butler's Prestidigitation."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Turning the Flank on Vicksburgh Butler's Prestidigitation."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b06cc616-a99c-5590-82db-6589a2c166e9,451,nyt://article/b06cc616-a99c-5590-82db-6589a2c166e9

Last night I slept for the first time under a tent; before that I have caught a wink occasionally on the bare ground, without blanket or overcoat. We have fought every day, and marched every night. I have lost in killed and wounded in my brigade over eight hundred -- nearly one-third. I have but one Colonel left, two Lieutenant-Colonels, and two Majors. The Fifth Maine Regiment has not got a single field-officer left. My horse was wounded, but I am thankful to say I am uninjured. I led on Friday each one of my four regiments to the charge separately. Here is where all my field-officers were killed or wounded. We have a good position here, but expect a fight before night. Our men are heroes, and it would make your heart bleed with sympathy and pride to see them enduring such untold fatigue without food or rest and to see their light hearts and smiling faces, whenever I ride among them. The enemy have three men to our one, and yet our noble army are confident that we could beat them in an open field, although the enemy fight like devils, and with a hate that is unaccountable.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""BARTLETT'S BRIGADE.; EXTRACT OF PRIVATE LETTER FROM COL.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/10/archives/local-intelligence-the-adjourned-meeting-of-the-grain-merchants.html,,"The adjourned meeting of the grain merchants was held, yesterday, at the Produce Exchange. Mr. ALBURTIS, Chairman, called the assemblage to order, and remarked that the object of this meeting was to hear the report of the Committee, appointed at the previous meeting, held on Tuesday. He hoped the Committee would immediately report. The Secretary, Mr. HERRICK, Jr., said he had received no written report. Mr. TOMPKINS, on behalf of the Committee, was repeatedly called for, but did not respond. The Chairman then said that probably the Committee had not completed its labors, nor prepared any report. He would like to know what the meeting desired to have done. Calls were made for Mr. BARBER, who promptly appeared and explained verball what progress the Committee had made. He said that the Committee, as such, had had no meetings, but some members of it, including himself, had attended the laborers' meeting at Tammany Hall, Tuesday night, and had endeavored to ascertain the actual grievances of the shovelers, and what they wanted to have done for them. He had spoken to the laborers in a conciliatory manner, and was very cordially received. He repeated the substance of his remarks on the occasion referred to, which have been already published in the TIMES. Mr. BARBER added that, as a merchant, he was sorry that the resolutions of Tuesday had been adopted by the merchants. There was really no necessity for taking such action. It was not all dignified nor wise for the merchants of New-York to do anything under the circumstances that had any appearance of defiance or intimidation. The laborers were acting in a most orderly and unobjectionable manner. As far as they were right, he was with them; but any opposition to the working of the elevators he considered decidedly wrong, and he had so stated to the meeting at Tammany Hall. He had been assured there that the men did not propose to prevent the working of the elevators, nor to interfere with any other laborers, who might be employed in connection with them. He believed that the laborers had real cause for complaint, and that they obgnt not to be treated in a hostile manner. He would say that he believed that the Committee of merchants appointed on Tuesday could speedily settle all difficulties, if they honestly and energetically set about doing so. The fact was, according to Mr. BARBER, the actual trouble was between the elevators and the stevedores, and that it was not properly the business of the merchants to have anything whatever to do with the quarrel. He ought as appropriately bring his private business troubles before a meeting of merchants. Such conduct, however, would be promptly and quietly denounced. As he understood the matter, the stevedoers had been in the habit of receiving fifty cents per one hundred bushels, for the work that they were required to perform. The elevators now share the labor, and the proprietors of the machines get thirty-seven and a half cents, while the stevedores are paid only the additional twelve and a half cents per one hundred bushels. He did not think this a fair division, and the merchants, he felt assured, would not suffer themselves to be made a party to such a manifest injustice. He had no more to say, and he believed that had the airy report been prepared by the committee, no more could have been said in it.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Adjourned Meeting of the Grain Merchants.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Adjourned Meeting of the Grain Merchants.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d5ba0a13-0057-5369-94f6-c715f5a37388,894,nyt://article/d5ba0a13-0057-5369-94f6-c715f5a37388

"It is remarkable how consistent is the logic of prejudice. The London Times has either taken up or has assumed the theory that the Government of this country is a disorganized mob, waging a causeless war to gratify the popular love for power or popular vindictiveness.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/11/archives/canada-and-the-united-states.html,,"It is remarkable how consistent is the logic of prejudice. The London Times has either taken up or has assumed the theory that the Government of this country is a disorganized mob, waging a causeless war to gratify the popular love for power or popular vindictiveness. Everything is represented as in a chaos or as falling into indistinguishable ruin. No one knows what he is fighting for or what will be the result when it is all over. It is a kind of ""invasion of barbarians"" over the civilized and luxurious regions of the South, and the only effect will be a military despotism through the whole country, or society reduced to a chaotic condition. Holding these as the major premises, a logical conclusion would be that any civilized and well-to-do Provinces in the neighborhood of such a barbaric and chaotic Power would naturally be the first victims when ""the brawls"" here were over. The 700,000 freebooters or mercenaries gathered on the soil of the Union, for the purpose of plunder and glory, would at once, after the war, be dispatched to ravage and devastate these unfortunate neighbors. So intimates our London cotemporary. But, unfortunately, a few weeks since, the bill for the more efficient arming of the Canadian militia was brought up before the Provincial Parliament for a second reading, and yet, with all these horrors in view, with the seven hundred thousand Yankees hungry for the wheat and rye fields of the Canadas, it was quietly tabled. Nobody seemed to think of war, or that there was the slightest danger of collision with the National Union. They evidently felt that they could appropriate a few scores of millions better to railroads and canals than to feeding and arming useless soldiers. The London journal, true to its logic, cannot understand this. It indicates to the Cockney mind that the Canadas do not mean to arm themselves, because they expect the British Empire to defend them. It shows ""the evils of dependence;"" and the unfortunate Provinces, who could not possibly fall into a quarrel, except as appanages of Great Britain, are coolly informed that if they are invaded by those 700,000 mercenaries, they must defend themselves; that Great Britain has not the power or the will to uphold them against the American Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Canada and the United States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Canada and the United States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/442c3815-bcf2-5033-8f27-7c0227ebca6b,719,nyt://article/442c3815-bcf2-5033-8f27-7c0227ebca6b

Perhaps nowhere are single battles reduced to a perfect science. Much of the issue depends always on the imagination and fears of either side. When the presence of NAPOLEON was reckoned by his adversaries as equal to a corps of forty thousand men, it was not merely his strategical combinations that they were regarding, but the moral effect he produced both on the spirits of his own men and of those opposed to him. When this same great leader lays down as a maxim of war that you should always, in your public estimates, double your own force and halve the force of your enemy, he has in view especially the effect on the imaginations of men. It is true, in the long run, that war is a contest of science and wealth, and no weak Power can, after a length of time, overcome a strong one, where both are equally in earnest.

Editorial on shortage of small change in NYC as result of war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/11/archives/small-change-the-currency-and-small.html,Editorial on shortage of small change in NYC as result of war,"change difficulties are working great injury to the retail trade of the City, and giving insufferable annoyance to all parties, whether buyer or seller. Gold, silver and nickel have all become so highly appreciated that, in purchasing a cheap dinner or a cigar after it, a pound of sugar, a yard of cotton cloth, or such like articles, the discount on a dollar bill, or a five-dollar bill, is often greater than the value of the article purchased, and hence the seller, in furnishing gold, silver or nickel change, actually loses more than the value of the goods sold. The various expedients adopted to obviate the difficulty give almost as great annoyance as the original trouble itself. The private shinplaster system is the worst. A person may come down town in the morning with five dollars in bills in his pocket, and after making half a dozen trifling purchases, may find himself with four dollars of shinplasters, which are worthless except at the places where they were issued, which he may not want to visit again in a month. Postage stamps for change are also a great annoyance, particularly in these dog-days, as they stick to the fingers, to the portmonnaie and to everything, and quickly get torn, dirty, wasted, uncurrent and worthless. It has been proposed that the City authorities issue paper change of the denominations of ten, twenty-five and fifty cents, which might be made universally current -- in other words, a sort of legal tender. It is said that the New-England banks are preparing to issue bills for twenty-five and fifty cents; but they could not supply us with this currency, even if we wanted it. Probably the best mode of relieving the difficulty at present is that adopted in some establishments on Broadway, namely, for the storekeeper to charge the current premium for specie when it is paid out, and allow the premium when specie is received. This mode also has its troubles; and in the daily fluctuations in the price of gold, silver and nickel, would necessitate a good deal of sharp calculation. But, in lieu of something better, it is the most equitable and convenient way of relieving what, after all, is only a temporary annoyance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SMALL CHANGE.

"A serious though happily not fatal casualty occurred Thursday, on the New-Jersey Railroad. The 11 P.M. mail train for Philadelphia and Washington, at a point midway between the Hackensack Bridge and Newark, was precipitated violently from the track. The engine and tender, after running about fifty yards, were hurled into the ditch, while the rest of the train, running ahead some distance, were wrenched right and left, and huddled up in a heap. The baggage cars were tossed off and twisted round like chips, the first passenger car was thrown across the track at right angles, the two hind cars fortunately remaining on the track. Considering the extraordinary violence of the catastrophe it seems miraculous that no fatal casualties resulted. The engineer, who went with the engine into the gully, was battered about the head; one of the brakemen was badly hurt in the leg, and a lady (the wife of the conductor,) received a violent shock by being thrown across the seat, resulting, it was feared, in the breaking of three of her ribs. These were the only accidents of any moment that occurred, and Dr. WHITE, of Fairhaven, who was on the train, kindly rendered every assistance in his power. It was at first thought that the accident was caused by the breaking of the engine's axle, or the giving way of one of the truck wheels; but on examining the point at which the train was hurled from the track, it was found that a tie had been laid across it. Further on, nearer Newark, several other ties were found placed across the track; so that there is no doubt it was the diabolical inspiration of some fiendish mind. The bewildered passengers, emerging from the cars, were struck with horror at the wreck around them, and all agreed that nothing short of a miracle bad saved them from destruction. After being compelled to stay several hours on the scene, a prey to the multitudinous mosquitoes of the salt marsh, a train was at length procured for Newark, and about 3 o'clock yesterday morning they passed on their way to Philadelphia. This is the second disaster that has occurred on the New-Jersey Railroad during the present week -- that of Sunday last having resulted in the death of two persons. Considering the circumstances of yesterday's accident, however, it would not appear that in this case blame rests either on the Company or the engineer. The train was going at a moderate speed, the customary vigilance was used, and the obstructions seem to have been placed on the track but a moment before the train passed. The Company has offered a thousand dollars reward for the apprehension of the guilty person. A suspected individual was arrested yesterday afternoon, but was, we believe, discharged.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/12/archives/local-intelligence-a-serious-railroad-accident-villainous-and.html,,"A serious though happily not fatal casualty occurred Thursday, on the New-Jersey Railroad.

"THE SCARCITY OF CHANGE A SENSELESS PAN10. The obange panie which has so suddenly come over this community, continues unabated, and apparently absorbs the entire attention of the people to the exclusion of the war, the condition of the army.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/12/archives/general-city-news.html,,"THE SCARCITY OF CHANGE A -- SENSELESS PANIC. -- The obange panie which has so suddenly come over this community, continues unabated, and apparently absorbs the entire attention of the people to the exclusion of the war, the condition of the army, the new call for troops, the doings of Congress, or even the policy to be pursued with regard to the negro. The flood of manuscripts that has poured into this office, containing suggestions, recommendations and remonstrances, in relation to the subject, well nigh rival the deluge of skinplasters, and promises to pay, that have been emitted from the thousand and one marts of trade and traffic, and scattered broadcast over the City. One man sends word that he will give and take postage stamps in change, but unfortunately for his suggestion, the postage stamps have to be paid for in specie, and are a very troublesome and inconvenient medium of change after you get them. Another proposes that the Government shall issue fractional bills of almost every conceivable amount, but before the Government could get the new bills into circulation, it is to be hoped the panic -- for it is nothing but a panic -- will have subsided. So far as this City is concerned, however, a plan is set forth in our editorial columns to-day, which could be speedily put in operation through the agency of the City Chamberlain, and which would promptly remedy the evil. Until this or some other plan is adopted, the best thing every citizen can do is to refrain from adding to the panic by telling everybody he meets what a heavy premium silver commanded yesterday and to-day, to stop hoarding up what little he may get hold of, and to ""indignantly frown,"" in the language of WASHINGTON, upon the whole crew of miserly bipeds who insist upon thrusting upon him their dirty shipplasters in change, when heaps of silver lie in their drawers which they have received from their customers. Nothing can be clearer than that a keeper of an eating-house or drinking-saloon, or dealer in any commodity, is morally bound to pay out silver in change so long as he has the article on hand which he has received from his customers. When he is out of charge, and is compelled to purchase it at 10 or 12 per cent, premium, then he may be excused for giving instead a promise to pay; but as it is now, they take all the change they can get from their customers and pay out none. What do they do with it? If they sell it to the brokers and pocket the premium, they are miserly scoundrels, and ought to be robbed. If they hoard it up for fear it may be still scarcer, they are only adding to the panic, and increasing the very scarcity they profess to lament. There is ample gold and silver in this City and throughout the country (at least in the loyal portion of it) for all the purposes of business, and there can be no doubt that if every business man and citizen would commence to-day and pay out freely what specie he has in his possession, as occasion requires, in less than three weeks it would be as plenty as it was two months ago.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f9c9093-975e-51a8-9c26-661dec27caaa,1230,nyt://article/8f9c9093-975e-51a8-9c26-661dec27caaa

The first impression naturally was that the enemy had attacked our right flank, but the soldier's ear soon detected the absence of that peculiar sound which distinguishes a blank cartridge from the screaming shell; and when he had counted 22, the matter was explained. It was the salute for the President of the Untied States. Immediately bugles sounded and drums beat throughout the camp as if by one spontaneous impulse, and almost before the echo of the salute had died away, long columns of troops were observed marching from their several encampments and taking their places in regimental lines for review.

Worden, of the Monitor, had a most enthusiastic reception at Grand Rapids, on Wednesday evening July 2. The exercises were at Lutte's Hall, which was tastefully decorated. Lieut. Worden was introduced to the immense company by P.R.L. Pierce, Esq., and responded briefly to a congratulatory address. The most interesting incident is thus described by the Eagle; ""The feature of the evening, and the best conceived and finest executed scene of the kind that we ever witnessed, was next presented by thirty young ladies and little girls, all of whom were very [???] attired in pure white, and ornamented with festoons and wreaths of flowers, tastefully arrangement on their dresses and heads. This [???] of beauty and loveliness, all unexpected to the majority present, came upon the stage, the parties composing it each having in her hand a bouquet or wreath, or both, of sweet flowers, and slowly encircled the Lieutenant, who had been seated near the centre of the platform. The ladies then moved in single file slowly around the hero, singing some beautiful lines prepared for the occasion, a welcome to the brave, a requiem for the dead, and a prayer for the future of the patriot hero, casting at his feet, as they passed turn in front, bouquets, wreaths and garlands of lovely flowers, until he was half buried beneath the sweet [???] of love.""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c01b7ecf-f5ac-5d79-a019-673749899cf0,679,nyt://article/c01b7ecf-f5ac-5d79-a019-673749899cf0

It is certainly true, for example, that, as a people, we are too excitable. We have not attained that enviable philosophy which would enable us to bear adversity with cheerfulness, and success without elation. Whether it arises from the admixture of a large proportion of the Celtic element in the national organization, or is to be traced to climatic influences, we have lost a portion of that steadiness and imperturbability which distinguished the Revolutionary Fathers. It may be that we have gained in enterprise and audacity what we have lost in equanimity; we may have more elans and less obstinacy; yet we confess to an abiding faith in the staunch old characteristics, and regard it as an atoning feature of the present war that it is likely to foster and strengthen those solid qualities which went so far toward ennobling the character and establishing the success of our ancestors.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Uses of Adversity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Uses of Adversity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1156f613-6499-5722-a450-4df1d4b0ee31,782,nyt://article/1156f613-6499-5722-a450-4df1d4b0ee31

She was attired in a gray traveling suit and dark blue veil, which she kept over her face during her presence in Court She is 24 years of age, possessed of a graceful figure, interesting appearance, and modest demeanor, and would indicate the opposite to that of being one capable of inflicting the summary punishment which deprived a heartless and relentless husband of his life. The plea of not guilty was put in to the indictment, and Mr. EDWIN JAMES, her senior counsel, then moved that the indictment be removed into the Oyer and Terminer, as the defendant was desirous that she be tried before the highest tribunal in the country, which was granted by his Honor Judge MCCUNN. Mrs. REAL's exemplary conduct, modest manner and uncomplaining suffering, have established for her in the minds of all who see her, a character deserving of respect and sympathy; while the unpublished persecutions which have attended her daily life during the dread ""four years"" entitle her to the support of every honest man and virtuous woman.

Now and then, it is true, there are found instances of the seeming prosperity of the wicked, so lung continued and so fair as to raise a doubt in the minds of some whether that is a law of the Universe. Even King David was afflicted with such doubts sometimes, but he speedily put them to flight; and the race of man on a whole have accepted it as a fact, that any one who sets the currents of his life running counter to those great currents of right and justice which flow from under God's throne, will surely come to overthrow.

There are the malignant croakers, who do their work with a hearty desire to work evil, who, like the Herald, loudly proclaim disaster, and threaten dissension and consequent defeat, because they desire the disaster and defeat, and think this is the surest way to secure it. And then there are the melancholy croakers -- the men who desire most earnestly that affairs shall move successfully, and are willing even to take hold to help attain success, but who are cast down and dismayed by any adverse wind. These men go about our streets with long faces, talk in lugubrious tones, shake their heads and say they begin to doubt whether the rebellion will ever be put down. They dwell with great emphasis upon this or that failure of the Administration, or of some General to have done what they think should have been done, and if one of a more cheerful turn is disposed to look at things more favorably, and to think that even our mistakes may have not been unproductive of good, they are mad. They will not look at the deadly wounds on every side of the trunk of the rebellion, but because it still stands upright, they groan out, ""We shall never cut it down,"" and they complain of the dullness of the axe, and wonder why the blows were not struck upon the one side of the tree instead of the other, and why John or Thomas was not allowed to hold the axe, instead of James or Dick, and they descant upon their own improved method of wood-cutting, and insinuate that this man or that is thinking of something else besides chopping, or quite possibly does not wish the tree to fall -and so they spend their time and their energies in croaking, croaking.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Counterblast to Croaking.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Counterblast to Croaking.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5640228a-862c-5bb4-8c50-1b1b89bf0b55,1115,nyt://article/5640228a-862c-5bb4-8c50-1b1b89bf0b55

"In the batch of New-Orleans papers received by us yesterday, there is great complaint made of the scarcity of flour, the high price of bread, and the lack of provisions generally in that city. There were two or three causes which prevented a large supply of these necessaries from being forwarded at once to New-Orleans from the North when the port was opened to commerce. One was that there was a general impression that the Mississippi River would be opened immediately, and that abundant supplies, indeed a glut, of everything in that line would be sent down the river from the Northwest. The others were the deranged condition of the Southern currency, and the supposed adverseness of the people to trade with the Yankees. The obstinacy of Vicksburgh, however, has, up to this time, kept the Mississippi closed to commerce, and while there is a plethora of flour and all small grains on the upper line of the river, the people at its mouth are starving. Even after Vicksburgh does fall, there is likely to be great difficulty in peaceful steamboats navigating the Mississippi for some time, as there appears to have been a system of guerrillaism inaugurated there, in which the guerrillas operate with pieces of flying artillery on the river banks. This it will take some time to root out. As for the other obstacles in the way of trade with New-Orleans, the currency difficulty is certainly bad enough, but it is found that enough respectable current funds still circulate to purchase supplies; and the people are not at all adverse to procuring them from whoever has them to sell. Now that these things are known in the North, an abundance of flour and other necessaries will doubtless at once be shipped for the relief of the breadless people of the Crescent City.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/13/archives/scarcity-of-breadstuffs-in-neworleans.html,,"In the batch of New-Orleans papers received by us yesterday, there is great complaint made of the scarcity of flour, the high price of bread, and the lack of provisions generally in that city.

MITCHEL, from the Louisville Journal; and as it is understood that on account of certain charges made by his superior officer, he had resigned his command, and that, upon notification of his resignation reaching Washington, he was summoned to that place, it is to be hoped that an immediate investigation will be made into the case, so that a gallant officer may be exculpated from insinuations and charges which, we have no doubt, are false. The statements put forth so far will astonish the public; and that they should be made, and copied and reechoed by other Western journals, will produce throughout the country a feeling of profound sorrow. The Louisville paper makes no specifications, gives no details, nor does it, nor any other of the Western journals, furnish any facts upon which a public judgment can be formed respecting the alleged delinquencies of Gen. MITCHEL. It merely speaks of his conduct in North Alabama as being ""injurious to the Government and disgraceful to humanity;"" that he has ""perpetrated deeds of cruelty and of guilt, the bare narration of which makes the heart sick;"" that ""his villainous misconduct is a national calamity"" -- it calls upon the Government to exercise upon him vengeance without mercy, and it applies epithets, and indulges in other strong talk, which we would not reproduce but that it has been extensively copied and has done damage in the West, and that we desire that the case may be promptly and officially settled, before the public service is further injured. No one who knows Gen. MITCHEL will place the slightest belief in the statements as they now stand. As an officer, a man, a gentleman, a savan and a conservative politician, he has been honorably known, and eminent in society and throughout the country and the world. His personal character alone is a complete shield against any imputations affecting himself individually.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHARGES AGAINST GEN. MITCHEL.

Waddell, the General Assignee in Bankruptcy, as proceeds of the estate, and that Taggard took possession of said real estate and held it till his decease, Feb. 18, 1851; that afterwards, on Oct 15, 1858, the General Assignee, without notice to the petitioners, who are the wife and children of Taggard, sold this same property to John D. Brown, who thereupon conveyed it to Fernando Jones. The petition then prayed that this sale of Oct 15, 1858, should be set aside. The papers were served on Waddell and also on Brown and Jones, and answers were put in by them, averring that the transaction was in good faith, and denying the validity of the sale by order of the Court of Chancery, and also the title of the petitioners. The objection was first taken that by the statute this application should have been made within two years from the sale. This question was, by the District Court, adjourned to the Circuit Court, and Judge NELSON there decided that the short bar of two years mentioned in the statute did not apply, having no reference to suits growing out of the dealings of the Assignee with the property in his hands, and the case now came up for hearing in the District Court.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Important Decision in Bankruptcy.

The Governor had skedaddled. To what spot he had wended his fugitive footsteps, no man could tell. The only thing known was that he had jumped on board of a steamboat when he heard of the approach of our fleet, and fled up the river as fast as high-pressure and pitch could carry him -- having, in his progress, ordered the steamboat's cargo of a dozen or twenty hogsheads of sugar to be thrown overboard, so that nothing might impede his getting safely away from the naval furies whom he imagined to be in pursuit. This unheroical flight from his capital, without an effort to defend it, furnished such a piece of practical ridicule on all his previous heroics, that for over two months, or ever since the close of last April, he has kept himself hid from public view. His own subjects and slaves knew not where he was; and even Gen. BEN. BUTLER, who knew almost everything else, was in the dark on this point. The fugitive Governor has at last been found out -- discovered by a proclamation addressed ""to the people of Louisiana,"" and dated from the town of Opelousas, close to Crocodile Bayou, and upwards of two hundred miles nearer to Mexico than the city of New-Orleans. This much at least is gained: the citizens of his own State, and mankind generally, know where Gov. MOORE is.

The anticipation is fully realized. Since then the official spokesmen in both Houses of Parliament -- Earl RUSSELL in the Lords and Lord PALMERSTON in the Commons -- have, on several occasions, made emphatic declarations against any interference in the issue of our civil war.

The hurricane of indignation, horror, and wrath, which swept over the North upon the fall of Sumter, was as much an explosion of passion as of patriotism. Men of all creeds and parties and antecedents were equally carried away by the wrong done the flag, and the danger brought by bad men upon the Union; and all hastened to the great Union rally, to find in the mouth of some one the expression of the overheated sentiments for which themselves could find no utterance. It was possible for a man to have taken a fervent and even enthusiastic part in the meeting of April, 1861, without a spark of true and generous patriotism kindling in his heart. This has been capitally proved by several who took part in the late meeting at Cooper Institute -- a gathering expressly intended to neutralize the expiring effect of the impulse given the popular heart a twelvemonth and more ago.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Meeting To-Morrow Night.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Meeting To-Morrow Night.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad799334-f582-5c94-921d-d8303903d816,312,nyt://article/ad799334-f582-5c94-921d-d8303903d816

"Miss MAGGIE MITCHELL played ""Fanchon, the Cricket,"" every night for a month--a remarkable, if not an unprecedented thing for a star to do, with a by no means powerful drama of French extraction.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/14/archives/amusements.html,,"Miss MAGGIE MITCHELL played ""Fanchon, the Cricket,"" every night for a month -- a remarkable, if not an unprecedented thing for a star to do, with a by no means powerful drama of French extraction. Since the completion of the month, it has been repeated twice by special request; and, judging from the audience it drew on Thursday, it will most likely be done again before this week is through. Of course the success of the piece is due to the strikingly original performance of the character of the heroine by Miss MITCHELL. It is so seldom we come across an actress who has individuality and unconventional intelligence, that when one suddenly drops upon the stage before us, we feel like cherishing the rara avis, and making as much of it as we can. It was the secret of MATILDA HERON's triumph. It is the secret of Miss MITCHELL's. More finished actresses than they are plenty -- actresses who have achieved the dead level of mechanical perfection; but whilst these never rise above that level, and can only have their talents recognized as a necessary contribution to a good stock company, one spark of originality, of genius, gives its possessor the right to rank as a star, and to receive a certain amount of popular support, on his or her own merits, even though unassisted by any company worth mentioning. The most surprising circumstance about Miss MITCHELL's relations with the public is that she should have remained so long contented with the plaudits of provincial crowds, when she unquestionably had it in her power to make a Metropolitan reputation. Henceforth it is to be hoped she will visit New-York with frequent regularity.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af705329-9d31-5716-bc08-ea774e601dc3,1166,nyt://article/af705329-9d31-5716-bc08-ea774e601dc3

"Capt. E. GEORGE BREWSTER, of Company C, First Regiment New-Jersey Volunteers, who fell at the battle of Gaines' Mill, Va., on Friday, June 27, deserves more than an ordinary passing notice. A direct descendant of Elder BREWSTER, of the Mayflower, he inherited a love of country, a devotion to the Union, a high regard for things sacred and noble common to few. Capt. BREWSTER was a native of Scio, Allegheny County, New-York, where in his boyhood days he was beloved for his gentle, kind and amiable qualities of heart. As a graduate of the Alfred Academy, for meritorious attainments, he had few superiors. As the years of his boyhood rolled away he went to New-York City, where he for several years occupied a very honorable position in a prominent mercantile house, whose confidence he ever enjoyed; but the troublous times of 1857 and '58 caused revulsions and changes in business, which brought Capt. BREWSTER into the establishment of the Messrs. SCRANTON, at Oxford Furnace, N.J., at which place he resided when the first call for troops was issued. Capt. BREWSTER at once enlisted as a soldier in a company organized at Oxford Furnace, under command of Capt. ROBERT MCALLISTER, now Lieutenant-Colonel of the First New-Jersey, and the company proceeded to Trenton, N.J.; but although this company had been nominally accepted, they, with two others from the same County, (Warren,) could not go in Gen. RUNYON's Brigade, as it had already forty companies. The company, after remaining at Trenton a few days, was disbanded, and the soldiers honorably discharged, many of them going to other States and enlisting. Capt. BREWSTER and a few others, waiting for another call for troops, which soon followed, joined Company C, First Regiment, New-Jersey Volunteers, of which he was made Sergeant, and soon after promoted to a lieutenancy; and upon the promotion of Capt. WM. BIRNEY to the Majority of the Fourth New-Jersey Volunteers, he was unanimously chosen Captain. Possessing an ardent nature, a generous soul, and a tall, commanding form, he carried an enthusiasm into the ranks such at few men can excite; the writer of this once heard his General remark before a large party of officers that he considered Captain BREWSTER one of the finest line officers in the brigade.

"The gentler sex cannot well mow hay, shoe horses and build fences; but they can milk cows, feed chickens and keep the farm-yard in order. They cannot be expected to handle  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/14/archives/soldiers-in-shops.html,,"The gentler sex cannot well mow hay, shoe horses and build fences; but they can milk cows, feed chickens and keep the farm-yard in order. They cannot be expected to handle the musket, camp out in swamps, or shoot rebels; but they are entirely equal to the task of handling laces and ribbons, and selling needles and pins. In a time of war like the present, no man should be found doing work which can be readily and properly performed by a woman. There is a double reason for this assumption; for not only does the female substitute release another soldier to fight for his country, but there are hundreds of the wives and sisters of men already fighting or slain who would gladly earn bread for themselves and little ones behind the counters which men now exclude them from. There are thousands of putty-faced, dainty-fingered gentry in our large cities who should forget the mysteries of silks and muslins for a while, to grow familiar with knapsacks and bayonets. There have been times of great emergency, in European cities, when masculine venders of feathers and frippery have been hooted from their shops, and forced to take up the musket. As a consequence of pressing military necessity, far more women find employment in selling dry goods and lighter wares, in the Old World, than with ourselves. It is rare in passing through a Parisian Boulevard or Passage to see males serving in the shops; in a country like ours, where there is so much for strong hands to do, and so little for feebler ones, it should be still rarer. Even in time of peace the system of exclusively employing men in retail shops is objectionable enough; but in time of war, and such a war as that which now threatens our National existence, such a system becomes a distinct nuisance and should be abated. A reform should be effected in this matter, and there will be no time more favorable than this to inaugurate it. Many a husband, son and brother will fall in the existing struggle, leaving females behind partly or wholly unprovided for. Whenever a clerk or other employe now enters the army or navy, the niche should be promptly filled by a woman. In nine cases out of ten, the females, after a little experience, will do the work quite as well as the males, and the public interest will unquestionably be promoted by the measure. Moreover, the interests of employers will ultimately be furthered by the change, for if women do less work, they are paid by lower wages; and it is only a fair tribute to the gentle sex to acknowledge that it has been satisfactorily demonstrated that, as shop-tenders and receivers of money generally, their average integrity is superior to that of the men. Thousands of dollars, in goods and cash, are yearly absorbed by dishonest clerks and shopmen, to be used in purchasing gratifications which have no temptation for women. Now that taxation is to become heavier than we have ever known it, this consideration of itself is a highly important one. Another point which addresses itself to the thoughtful and humane, lies in the obvious circumstance that the more we multiply the avenues for female employment, the more we reduce excuses for the cancerous ""social evils,"" that problem which is so universal and so difficult of solution.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Soldiers in Shops.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Soldiers in Shops.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dbe555bd-7867-568f-835f-1165f99d2a05,697,nyt://article/dbe555bd-7867-568f-835f-1165f99d2a05

The facts of the case, as they transpired upon the investigation before the magistrate yesterday, may be briefly stated as follows: The complainant's wife, Mrs. GEORGE, was out walking with her son, a lad aged about seven years, when she encountered SARAH J. ADAMS, one of the prisoners, who importuned her to call at the house of her sister, in Marlon-street, and rest herself. While Mrs. G. was there, she was presented with a glass of wine, a portion of which she drank. Soon after she fell into a state of stupor, so profound that all the efforts of her little son to arouse her were unavailing. During the time she was in this condition the prisoner, SARAH J. ADAMS, took the two diamond cluster rings, above mentioned, from Mrs. GEORGE's fingers, placed them upon her own, and in a few minutes afterward, left the house with two or the other prisoners. The lad immediately followed, and, although he ran as fast as possible, he could not keep up with the parties, and for the time they escaped. Yesterday, however, all the persons thought to be implicated in the theft, were arrested by Officer FARLEY, of the Fourteenth Precinct, and committed for examination. The rings have not yet been recovered.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c0017ce-c534-5798-a8eb-993d8c0c7faf,1166,nyt://article/3c0017ce-c534-5798-a8eb-993d8c0c7faf

text of newly revised bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/15/archives/a-horrible-picture-by-lord-brougham.html,text of newly revised bill,"Lord BROUGHAM rose to call attention to the civil war now raging in America, in the horrors of which, according to information which he had received from persons who were most friendly to our kinsmen across the Atlantic, surpassed anything which had been made public. It appeared that not only were thousands of men embattled on either side, and displaying a courage and a conduct which were above all commendation, but the war had taken root in every rank of life, and all the evils of a civil contest were experienced in their greatest intensity. The inhabitants of the same village were banded against each other, and neighboring farmers and proprietors daily armed themselves and went forth, not to fight in their armies, but to carry on a sort of private warfare, and to gratify their feelings of animosity or revenge. In private families, where a difference of opinion as to the war prevailed, the most intense animosity existed, and was avowed almost without shame. He knew one instance of a respectable family in which the son said he hoped to hear of his father's death, because they had taken opposite sides. He threw out no imputation on the character of the American people. Proverbially, the corruption of the best was always worst, and a dispute among near relatives was always excessively bitter. But although the war might be explained, it could not be justified or even extenuated. It was clear that neither the Government of France nor that of England could interfere in the quarrel. [Hear, hear.] But at the same time every one was anxious that these horrors should cease, and those who most fervently cherished that desire were those who had always been most friendly to the Americans. For upward of sixty years he had been known as a warm advocate at all times of the American Government and the American people. Some might recollect that he was once called the partisan of JEFFERSON and the Attorney-General of MADISON. Others, too, who had uniformly taken the part of the Americans were now most cruelly shocked and disappointed by the present course of events. If the civil war continued they would be bound to admit that the worst stain on the American character was not domestic Slavery. The white men had suffered more in the war than ever did the negroes under the most cruel of their masters. The present strife was doing more mischief, creating more misery, and laying the foundation of more lasting animosity even than slavery. If the Americans would only listen to the voice of their true friends they would, if they regarded the continuance of their reputation in their country and of our affection toward them, see the absolute necessity of putting an end to this horrible war. He could not for his life believe that the good sense of those among the Americans who were better informed and capable of calm reflection, would not, sooner or later, be exerted to put a stop to this calamitous quarrel.

These stamps are inserted in inclosed cards, with raised rims around the edge of each stamp, which effectually protects them from wear and tear, and make them very convenient to handle. If no better substitute can be had than postage stamps, this will prove a very useful contrivance.

What the community want is some temporary substitute for change that will pass current everywhere, until the originators of this panic, and the speculators in silver, shall find their occupation gone, and then the article will quickly find its way back into circulation. The plan proposed in the TIMES a few days ago, of authorizing the City Chamberlain to issue checks, purchasable in current bills, and redeemable in the same, is the speediest and most effectual that has yet been suggested, but as the Common Council have not seen fit to take any action in the matter it only remains for some responsible Banking-house, in which the community has full credit, to adopt the suggestion, and do themselves credit, and benefit the public by carrying it out.

The revenue steamer Winants, having the party on board, left the barge office at 1 o'clock, and by invitation of Capt. PETRIE, of the steamer City of New-York, and JOHN G.

It, with the April demonstration of last year, forms the second of the two largest and most influential meetings ever held in New-York. It proclaimed, in unmistakeable language and in clear voice, the purpose of the people in regard to the war and in support of the Union and the Government. From every stand and by every speaker there was but one tone; and every man present seemed inspired by the spirit of the hour. It was that the war begun by traitors must be pushed on till treason is extirpated from the whole land; that the Union which, during the year has cost so much blood and treasure, must be battled for while any blood or treasure is left in the country; and that, to this end, the legitimate directors of the war must be upheld in every effort for its successful prosecution, and impelled onward by the people to greater efforts and the most decisive measures. Though during the year thousands of the bravest and best of the sons of New-York have given their lives for the sacred cause, there were yet thousands more ready to meet the ordeal of battle for its support; and though tens of thousands were now on the battle-field in Virginia, there would be no lack of men willing to follow them there or anywhere else. They were in favor of the strongest measures on the part of the Government; the most determined vigor on the part of commanders; the most unflinching prosecution of the war. The most energetic words were applauded with most vehemence; the most courageous expressions met with the warmest response in the people's hearts. There was no talk of discouragement, not the shadow of a thought of doubt of ultimate triumphant success. Recent disasters were acknowledged and felt to be but temporary and accidental; and the long roll of victories that glorify the year gave faith that the triumphs of our arms in the future would be none the less prouder and decisive.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Voice of the Metropolis.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Voice of the Metropolis.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4884d140-e445-52d7-b8f9-0158ccbb32ce,729,nyt://article/4884d140-e445-52d7-b8f9-0158ccbb32ce

From circumstances attending the case, it is supposed that DEMAREST was murdered and robbed. From the evidence adduced, it appeares that on Monday morning deceased called at the public house in the Elysian Fields and had some refreshments, and in paying for them, the bartender noticed that he had a considerable quantity of bills, mostly Treasury notes. From there he went out into the fields. Lieut. HINCKLEY, of the Fifty-third New-York Volunteers, testified that DEMAREST was at the camp at Red House on Monday morning, and as he was about going away, he remarked that he expected to receive $100 that day. PATRICK DONOVAN, of Hoboken, testified that on Monday evening about 8 o'clock, as he was going up to the toll-gate at West Hoboken, two women, who were a little way off, called out to him, saying that a soldier was shot. He paid no attention to this, supposing the women were ""funning."" They appeared to be talking to the man. The body was discovered on Tuesday morning. About fifty yards off, in different directions, were found a single-barreled pistol and a razor. The deceased appeared to have been dragged some distance. An empty leather purse and some business cards were all that was found. Dr. ELMER made an examination, and found that a ball had entered above and came out below the knee, severing a large artery and causing death. The inquest was adjourned until to-day.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/030a8a05-531c-50ed-add4-fd59587a4d01,489,nyt://article/030a8a05-531c-50ed-add4-fd59587a4d01

The country is responding promptly, enlistments are going rapidly forward, and the men will soon be in the field. Three hundred thousand guns will be immediately required to arm them. Is the Ordnance Department prepared to meet this demand? Is it prepared to place in the hands of each man either a Springfield or Enfield rifled musket, or some other safe and efficient arm? We all know that a sufficient number of the Springfield and Enfield guns cannot be had in time, as evidenced by the fact that a considerable part of the force now in the field is armed with smooth-bored guns. The Government can produce the Springfield rifle only at the rate of some 13,000 per month. Private contractors are not producing a thousand a month. We doubt, indeed, whether a thousand guns of the Springfield pattern have as yet been delivered from all the private manufactories of the country. Where then are our arms to come from? We should have less anxiety on this subject if onr Ordnance Department had heretofore shown efficiency in the discharge of its duties. Unforunately our Chief of Ordnance, we all know, is disposed to practice a cruel and expensive economy, and pursue a sort of hand-to-mouth policy, which, if it can furnish the supplies needed for to-day, allows to-morrow to take care of itself.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT ARE WE TO DO FOR GUNS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT ARE WE TO DO FOR GUNS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/14e62319-ff2f-521d-84da-b53726711f06,561,nyt://article/14e62319-ff2f-521d-84da-b53726711f06

There may be a thousand at Fortress Monroe, five or six hundred at Yorktown, and as many more in MCCLELLAN's army -- women and children included.

Several Senators objected to such a method of legislation, preferring rather to receive a veto message from the President, which should state his objections in full, and enable the Senate to meet them understandingly. The debate was continued at great length, and it was finally voted to make the amendment as well as another suggestion to meet the President's objections, rather than jeopardize the success of the bill.

British steamer Ann captured at Mobile Bay trying to run blockade,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/17/archives/an-important-prize-capture-of-the-british-steamer-ann-at-the-mouth.html,British steamer Ann captured at Mobile Bay trying to run blockade,"The prize steamship Ann, of London, cut out from under the guns of Fort Morgan, at the mouth of Mobile Bay, on June 20, arrived at this port yesterday. The Ann had run in during the night by the blockading fleet, as it was so dark that she could not be seen by our vessels. Lights had been kept burning on the fort all night, so that she had no trouble in finding the channel. The next morning she was discovered by the Susquehannah, within a half mile of the fort, unloading her cargo into a rebel steamer alongside. The Susquehannah, accompanied by the gunboat Kanawha, then got underweigh and steamed within gunshot and opened fire on the strange steamer. The fire was returned by the fort, and kept up for an hour on both sides. In the meantime the crew had deserted the strange steamer, as the shells from our vessels fell about her rather too thickly for safety. She was soon discovered to be adrift, and dropped down with the current about a mile, when the Kanawha was ordered to go in and bring her out, which she did in fine style, under a heavy fire from the fort. When the Ann was boarded by Acting Master PARTRIDGE from the Kanawha, she was found to be in a sinking condition, her injection pipe having been cut, and the kingston valve left open. The engine and fire-room were soon filled with water, but as she was built in 4 water-tight compartments and the communication between them had not been opened, only one compartment was filled. Through the persevering efforts of the officers of the Susquehanna and Kanawha, the leak was stopped and the water pumped out.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN IMPORTANT PRIZE.; Capture of the British Steamer Ann at the Mouth of Mobile Bay.

"The new Tariff bill passed Congress last week, and having received the signature of the President is now a law. Its provisions have occasioned much uneasiness and disquietude to a large body of our merchants, whose interests are thereby affected. Since we last referred to the bill many important amendments to it have been made, by the House of Representatives, the Senate, and a Conference Committee of both bodies. We have not space to note the many alterations in the rates of duty, and can only briefly refer to the changes made in the general provisions of the bill. The bill as first reported to the House made it the duty of importers to withdraw from bonded warehouse all merchandise, paying the duties thereon, before the day on which the act should take effect. This was fixed at Aug. 1. The bill was so altered, however, as to require goods which were bonded previous to the time of the passage of the three months' warehouse law, to be withdrawn before the 1st of August, in order to escape the imposition of the new rates. Those which were deposited in store under the law referred to, are not necessarily to be withdrawn before the first of August, but may remain in store for the time for which they were originally bonded, without being subject to the additional duty. The time allowed for goods to remain in bond, under the new law, is one year, when they shall be withdrawn for consumption, and three years when they are to be exported.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/17/archives/local-intelligence-the-custom-house-the-new-tariffthe-amended.html,,"The new Tariff bill passed Congress last week, and having received the signature of the President is now a law.

For certain reasons not now necessary to mention, but which may be easily inferred from the above named head of the commission, the Legislature found it necessary, for the economical prosecution of the work, to appoint a new set of commissioners, and in the winter of '61 they selected WILLIAM MINOR, JOSEPH SOUTHWORTH and JAMES DAVIS, of New York, and Judge ROBINSON and ALSOP H.

Editorial on Confederate activities in Southwest,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/18/archives/the-rebel-irruptions-in-the-southwest.html,Editorial on Confederate activities in Southwest,"The sudden forays by bodies of rebel marauders in Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri, -- their capture of Murfreesboro and menace of Nashville -- their ravages in Kentucky and advance toward the capital of that State, and toward the Ohio River -- their reappearance in Northern Missouri, and their operations on the very border of Iowa -- their demonstrations in the vicinity of Corinth and along our entire line in North Alabama -- the bold front they assume in Northern Arkansas and along the Mississippi River -- indicate that the embers of rebellion in the Southwest are still hot and smouldering. They prove that the rebels have taken new heart from their so-called successes on the Peninsula, and that they yet look forward to a reconquest of the Southwestern States; or rather, perhaps, they may indicate that, though Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri are inevitably lost to the Confederacy, the expelled rebels are determined to carry into them fire and sword, destruction, confusion, rapine and bloodshed; and thus, if they cannot rule, they will at least do their best to ruin. We are inclined to think that the latter purpose is the real one intended, and that these irruptions are but the first attempt at that guerrilla system in the Southwest which the rebels have threatened when other means of success failed. The rebel force in Kentucky which has been operating on the railroad lines, and up as high as Harrodsburgh, if not by this time to Frankfort, is reported to consist of but two mounted squads of about a thousand men each; the cavalry force which captured Murfreesboro, and to which a regiment of our troops is stated to have so discreditably surrendered, is reported as between three and four thousand strong; and in other places generally the rebel bodies have appeared in small cavalry troops. Of course such demonstrations can mean nothing but rapine. If this rebel troop should take Frankfort they could not possibly hold it a week; and if such an impossible event should occur as the fall of Nashville before the Texan savages, they could not hold it for a longer time than was necessary to plunder it, and perhaps to hang the Unionists and slaughter those who have taken the oath of allegiance. But the damage they may do to the States in which they operate, and to the Union cause in those States, is incalculable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Irruptions in the Southwest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Irruptions in the Southwest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/667ca468-0f85-5207-b5df-1e2f441d1a14,648,nyt://article/667ca468-0f85-5207-b5df-1e2f441d1a14

Not having enough money to ride out in the cars, he walked, and on the way, stopped at one of the houses used by signal men, to get a light for his cigar. Finding the man asleep, he stole a flag used for signaling trains to run slow, and put it in his pocket.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ACCIDENT ON THE NEW-JERSEY RAILROAD.; ROAD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ACCIDENT ON THE NEW-JERSEY RAILROAD.; ROAD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9bdc02c5-d2e4-5ab2-aca6-5ea2d1180206,351,nyt://article/9bdc02c5-d2e4-5ab2-aca6-5ea2d1180206

REASER was among the speakers at a meeting held to devise defensive measures. He said the City of Louisville can take care of herself, but the sympathizers with secession, the mischief-makers who rejoice in rebel successes and grow frantic with joy over Union reverses, will have to leave here, or behave themselves very quietly. We are getting tired of allowing them to go free on bond for good behavior, and then to insult us by their sympathy with the country's vilest enemies. Our country is a great, merciful and magnanimous country -- it can well afford to be so -- but, in trying times like these, magnanimity may cease to be a virtue if exercised on behalf of those who would rejoice to see an enemy in our streets, robbing our banks, firing our houses, and devastating our hearthstones. There is no use of multiplying words or holding parley with treason; the people will have the fullest guarantees that Secessionists shall not remain among us. Louisville wants none but loyal people in her midst when treason braves the field. We cannot consent to shake hands with traitors, and the security of our hearthstones is more sacred to us than is the blood of every Secessionist in Kentucky. He wished to use no harsh language or to advise any harsh measures, but there is an evil existing which demands an immediate remedy, and whatever is demanded as that remedy must be administered, let the blow fall where it may.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EXCITEMENT AT LOUISVILLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EXCITEMENT AT LOUISVILLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2a9913c-0618-52a6-aa7e-ed98db6feaf3,786,nyt://article/e2a9913c-0618-52a6-aa7e-ed98db6feaf3

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/19/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"DR. REA VS. THE KINGS COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY. -- This Society, as we have before recorded, was thrown into a spasm a few weeks ago at the narrow escape they had from admitting as a member a gentleman whose complexion is of the contraband standard -- one-fourth black. His application was referred to the censors, and they reported him duly qualified, and the Society was about to vote to admit him, when a gentleman having no respect for the nerves of those present and with scalpel in hand, laid bare the shade of the candidate's skin. The balloting was at once suspended and the ""subject"" laid upon the table as one of a too intricate nature to be manipulated upon without consultation and deliberation. At the next regular meeting, the case of Dr. REA was again called up and discussed, with closed doors, in all its various bearings, scientific and artistic, and was again referred to a Committee -- this time of three -- one of whom had favored the motion to admit the candidate, one who was equally opposed under all circumstances, and one who was upon the fence -- open to conviction. The Committee, on Thursday evening last, reported unanimously in favor of admitting the applicant to all the honors of the Society. Upon investigation they not only found that he was a skillful physician with a large practice, but that he was also a scientific man, and would be a great acquisition to the Society.

editorial on Pope's advance,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/19/archives/popes-advance-it-would-seem-that-gen.html,editorial on Pope's advance,"POPE is determined to justify the terms of the high-sounding address to his army, which he issued the other day. It is announced this morning that the advance of his command has entered the town of Gordonsville, at the junction of the Orange and Alexandria with the Virginia Central Railroad, seventy-six miles from Richmond, and one of the most important points in Eastern Virginia. Over the latter road, as the telegraph tells us, the Richmond rebels obtain three-fourths of their supplies; but not only this, it is also the great route which Stonewall JACKSON and other marauding rebels take in their incursions into the Shenandoah Valley, and in their rush back to the rebel capital again. The holding of Gordonsville also secures Washington from the dangers which perpetually beset that unhappy town. If again it be true that JACKSON is now on the North side of the Blue Ridge, he will find it hard work to get back to Richmond, even should our troops do no more than they have already done in destroying the railroad. Gordonsville is a point the importance of which has long been seen by every one; and if POPE did not contemn and laugh at bases of operations, it would be a real nice base from which to operate upon Richmond. This renewal of active operations against the rebels will greatly cheer and gratify the public; and we hope that the new General-in-Chief of the army will not find it necessary to put a stop to it, for the public are greatly in need of cheer at present.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""POPE'S ADVANCE.

MEIGS, of the firm of MEIGS & CO., Brokers and Bankers, at No. 50 Exchange-place, was robbed yesterday afternoon, in Wall-street, of the sum of $1,600 in United States Treasury Notes. From the evidence given by Mr. MEIGS, before Justice CONNOLLY, at the Tombs, we learn that he was passing along Wall-street, carrying two bags of gold, one upon each shoulder, $5,000 in each bag. The $1,600 in Treasury Notes were thrust into a side pocket of his coat. He had not proceeded far on Wall-street, before his attention was directed to three men, who seemed to be watching him very attentively, and following him closely. He immediately suspected their motive, and although both his hands were occupied in holding the bags upon his shoulders, he traveled on as rapidly as possible toward his destination, keeping a watchful eye upon the funds in his pocket. Very soon his three followers all brushed and jostled him as they passed, two upon one side and one on the other, and one of them very skillfully thrust his hand into MEIGS' pocket and took the $1,600 therefrom. They then all started to run away, but Mr. MEIGS, who had constantly kept his eye upon his money, saw which one of the three abstracted it from his pocket, and he thereupon pursued the guilty party as fast as his golden burden would permit. He traced him to a saloon just out of Wall-street, where the thief was arrested by Officer THOMPSON, of the First Precinct, and immediately searched, but no money was found him upon. Justice CONNOLLY committed him for examination. He gave his name as WM. CURTIS, but the Police say this is not his true name. The other parties, it is believed, have escaped with the stolen money.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8739fd05-330d-5fbb-acd4-6ffed99b2b8e,912,nyt://article/8739fd05-330d-5fbb-acd4-6ffed99b2b8e

It gives one a most vivid picture of one side of the war. You see there, as in so many other hospitals, what it is that has checked us at Richmond and may yet be our defeat. There they lie in the hospital tents, the most vigorous and the noblest young men of the country, from the slopes of the Alleghanies, from the forests of Maine, from the villages of Michigan, the mountains of New-Hampshire, from New-Jersey and New-York, and Massachusetts and Rhode Island, gathered up by chance from all regiments or fragments of regiments -- some eighteen hundred or two thousand of them. You enter an airy hospital tent; a young man, robust and ruddy, moves his body with an expression of pain, on his board-bed. He has ""the rheumatics,"" he says, in answer to your inquiry -- caught it in night work in the trenches at Yorktown; used to have to work with the pick or spade all night, often up to his knees in water, then get a bit of breakfast and a little sleep and go to other duty, and then again to spading at night. He cannot walk, because he is so lame, and yet he is not nineteen. He belonged to the -- New-Hampshire; they marched through New-York, he said, 1,000 strong, splendid fellows, and now you could almost number them on your fingers. ""Fever -- was it?"" said I.

Editorial on desertions by Union officers and men,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/19/archives/general-news.html,Editorial on desertions by Union officers and men,"By the arrival off Cape Race of the steamship City of Washington we receive advices from Europe four days later than by the Persia. The sales of cotton in the Liverpool market for two days amounted to 27,000 bales, the market closing arm at an advance of 1/4d. Breadstuffs were quiet, at a slight decline, and Provisions were dull. Consols were quoted at 92 1/8@92 1/4. The political news by this arrival is comparatively unimportant. Earl RUSSELL had announced in the British House of Lords that France had declined to enter into a treaty regarding the Slave-trade, similar to the one recently negotiated with the United States. He expressed the belief, however, that she would offer no objection to the exercise of its provisions. Rumors were still current that France would retrace her steps in Mexico. The Paris Constitutionnel says that proceedings against her will terminate only when the glory of the French arms is vindicated and money matters settled.

""Arguments!"" replied the other, ""I said nothing about his arguments. I told him first that he was Judas Iscariot, and next that he was Anti-Christ."" There could scarcely be a better illustration than this of the treatment of loyal America at the hands of her European censors. We are barbarians, cut-throats, madmen, idiots, steeped to the lips in hallucination and folly. We are attempting what is impossible, and what, if it were possible, would be extremely undesirable. Our patriotism is a sham, our love of freedom a delusion. Our finances are rotten, our army and navy are mere bloated symbols of incapacity. Epithets are exhausted in the bombardment of vituperation, so that absolutely new adjectives are invented to describe American unworthiness. The persistent repetition of untruth is said to persuade even the relator of his own veracity; and every one knows that if only plenty of mud is thrown, some of it is certain to stick. It would seriously appear that the foreign Press has been solely actuated by a determination to realize the force of these two apothegms. Our arguments arc rebutted by the simple logic of abuse, and, instead of being held up for the world's praise as patriots battling for their country's salvation, we are pilloried for its scorn as the types of everything which is mean and execrable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Foreign Censors Again.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Foreign Censors Again.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23e88a76-f45a-5185-96ad-b982cd436eab,769,nyt://article/23e88a76-f45a-5185-96ad-b982cd436eab

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/20/archives/a-refugee-from-texas.html,,"A few evenings ago we met with Mr. MORTON MORRIS, a gentleman who recently ran the Southern blockade to avoid the conscription act. He is the son of PASCHALL MORRIS, of Philadelphia, and for a number of years kept an agricultural warehouse at Galveston, Texas. His account is most entertaining, and the difficulties and dangers to which he was subjected, and which he so daringly and ingeniously overcame, speak well for his loyalty to the old flag. It was the second time he attempted to escape. When he returned after the first trial he found they had advertised him, but his return gave them confidence and in a measure paved the way for his final attempt. He left Galveston on the 11th of May, on the 15th the conscription act went in operation. When he arrived at New-Iberia, Louisiana, an order was telegraphed from Opelousas, the present rebel capital of Louisiana, not to permit any person to pass the lines. The route taken by him was opened since the blockade from Galveston to Houston, thence due east across Louisiana to New-Orleans by railroad, stage and boat. Innumerable inquiries were met with the reply that he was en route for the rebel army, and many most affecting messages were confided to him for sons and brothers serving in the secesh ranks. Arriving at Algiers, he was taken to Col. MCFILLAN, of the Federal army, who, after listening to his story, complimented him. He also received like praise from Gen. BUTLER, in New-Orleans. After spending three weeks there, he started for Boston, and from thence returned home. Mr. MORRIS states that ANDREW J. HAMILTON, of Austin, who, at the commencement of the secession movement, battled strongly for Union in Congress, is still a staunch and brave Unionist. With a small number of compatriots he for a long time defied secession in his own home at Austin, but becoming overpowered, he retreated to his ranche in the northwest part of the State, to which place his friends followed and clustered about him. SAM HOUSTON is living yet, a strong Union man at heart, but seems to have been broken down physically and in spirit by reason of our National trouble. In a Galveston company connected with the Lone Star Regiment, nine-tenths are Northern men; they were compelled to fight or starve. Two or three schooners run the blockade during a week, the Government vessels being to unwieldy that they can clear it easily. Their military bands consist of a drummer and fifer, both colored, and their National airs are ""Dixie"" and ""Donny Blue Flag."" Had Mr. MORRIS remained in secessia twelve hours longer he would have been drafted.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A REFUGEE FROM TEXAS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A REFUGEE FROM TEXAS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Chester (Pa.)

In proportion as silver coin disappears postage stamps will fill up the vacuum in the currency, and the aggregate of this new species of small change will adjust itself, and contract or expand its volume in proportion as silver coin is more or less scarce.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/20/archives/now-and-then.html,,"The two great mass meetings held in Union-square of April, 1861, and July, 1862, are commonly cited as having been similar in object, numbers and enthusiasm. It is customary to consider the late demonstration as a sort of copy or reindorsement of the first. Such, indeed, it may have appeared to unreflecting eyes, and also to eyes which, more reflecting, wished to see no change. Unquestionably there were many points of similarity. There were banners and cannon, music and shouting, masses of people and high enthusiasm, each and all in abundance at both meetings. Yet there existed between the two a radical difference. It was evident that popular opinion had undergone serious changes, and had made vast strides toward comprehending in their fullest sense the mighty issues depending on the present war. The meeting of last year expressed general indignation at the outrage put upon our flag at Fort Sumter, and a patriotic resolution to see that outrage expiated. It indicated surprise and sorrow at the misconduct of our Southern brethren, and breathed a hope that they would yet see the error of their ways. It avowed a determination to suppress the insurrection and enforce the laws, by the gathering of large forces and abundant means, to be employed in an extremely delicate, considerate and constitutional way. The Herald had only just made its ridiculous sommersault, and FERNANDO WOOD had barely got through insulting the President of the United States on his passage through our City to the capital. The adherents of these two respectable authorities had scarcely got over the bewilderment which the rapid changes going on around them had created. The mass meeting then meant a vigorous support of the Government in the prosecution of the war, within carefully-guarded limits and with a respectful deference for the ""peculiar institution;"" the mass meeting now means something quite different.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Now and Then.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Now and Then.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d8c7ad6-567d-5a1e-9ee2-49c761b1648c,702,nyt://article/9d8c7ad6-567d-5a1e-9ee2-49c761b1648c

In August, 1855, the relator, who was enciente at the time, came to live with the respondent as a domestic servant, and continued to live with her for eleven months. Soon after her arrival a male child was born to the relator, and immediately on its birth it was intrusted to a Mrs. Wright for a few days, but was afterward given by respondent for adoption to an unknown lady who lived in the country. On the 14th of November, 1856, a habeas corpus was issued by Judge Roosevelt requiring the respondent to show cause why the child should not be given up. The case was immediately referred for examination into the facts, but after the filing of the referee's report, as there appeared no satisfactory result, an order of court was granted in April, 1858, to the effect that an attachment should issue, unless the respondent should set forth, in an amended return, to whom and by what authority she parted with the child. It was alleged for the defence that the child was given away by the free will and at the request of the relator. The matter rested here until September, 1861, when another order was issued, to show further cause why an attachment should not issue against the respondent. Testimony was again taken, but nothing further was elicited about the person to whom the child had been given, or as to the child's whereabouts at the time. The relator was determined not to let the matter rest here, and accordingly, on Friday last, applied for an attachment against the defendant, who, it was alleged, was an abortionist by profession. Proof to that effect was offered by the counsel for relator, in one of the respondent's own advertisements in the Sunday Times of July 13, but the Court refused to admit the evidence.

Upon this affidavit, a warrant was immediately issued and placed in the hands of Officer POOLE, of the Fifteenth Precinct, who proceeded to the residence the accused, No. 195 Sixth-avenue, where he arrested WINSLOW, and after considerable search the officer succeeded in recovering all of the stolen property. The prisoner was then conveyed before Justice KELLY, and asked what he had to say to the change preferred against him. He replied that he was guilty, and said that he would live and be raised back in Washington for trial.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/21/archives/local-intelligence-beekman-hill-methodist-church-a-model-edifice.html,,"The Beekman Hill Methodist Church has just completed its new Sabbath School Hall, the finest in the City, which was duly dedicated, yesterday, with appropriate services. The building is situated on Fiftieth-street, between First and Second avenues, on the rear of four lots, measuring 105 by 130 feet. It measures 40 feet by 108, and is two stories high. The lower floor is set apart for infant class-rooms, Bible class-rooms, Minister's study, a kitchen and tea-room, to be used on festival occasions, Secretary's and Librarian's rooms, and a fine Young Men's reading-room. The main Sunday School Hall on the second floor is 76 by 38 feet in size, with 25 feet ceiling. The plastering, cornicing, coping and general finish of the interior are in the utmost good taste. Including the organ-loft, there are seats for about 1,200. The light at night proceeds from two circular clusters near the ceiling, with about forty jets each, fitted beneath concave reflectors. This not only sheds a brilliant light throughout the room, but is less trying to the eyes than side-lights or chandeliers, and affords an efficient aid to ventilation by a current which is caused to rush past the burners through an aperture in the roof. The building cost 12,000 exclusive of the ground. It is in contemplation to erect in the course of about two years, a fine church edifice on the front of the lots. The society has been formed eighteen months. Rev. JOHN S. MITCHELL, D.D., is the present pastor. The services yesterday morning were conducted by the pastor, assisted by Rev. Mr. PALMER, who made the prayer, and Bishop JANES, who preached the sermon from Matt. v.,13: ""Ye are the salt of the earth, &c."" The choir led by Dr. MITCHELL, jr., is excellent, and has the assistance of a fine organ. Rev. J.P. NEWMAN was called to preach the afternoon sermon, and Dr. STEVENS in the evening. The attendance was large, and the contributions in aid of the church liberal.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Beekman Hill Methodist Church.

Will any one raise an eyebrow on being told that paper that might be turned so excellent account in the composition of cartridges is made into folio and duodecimo volumes -- that metal that might be moulded into bullets is run into type? Surprising as the fact indicated may seem, it is a fact nevertheless. Books are yet written and printed -- whether they are read or not is another matter, and wholly concerns the publishers. From this singular activity of presses and pens, we infer that the time has not yet arrived when every one neither too old nor too young to read -- including the unfortunate minority that don't know how to -- shall have gone to the war, though we fancy that that time rapidly approaches. It certainly requires, considerable stoicism to sit down to a tale of imaginary woes and sorrows while one great wall in going up from the sick and wounded in the swamps and trenches before Richmond; an incredible amount of apathy to sit leisurely down to a book under the shade of a green tree while the nation is sending out a great heart-cry for reinforcements to her shattered legions. It is more than probable that those who busy themselves with lesser literature will lose occasional chapters in the glorious history we are new writing in letters of fire on pages that can never fade nor perish. And we must confess that we turn from the long, long list of killed, wounded and missing, in the morning paper, to contemplate the bread and buttery desperation of some mythical man or hypothetical woman, who suffered from dyspepsia and called it love, or talked an incalculable amount of nonsense and called it passion, with a feeling quite as nearly approaching disgust as impatience. But there are duties in life that ever obtrude themselves, often at inauspicious and [???] moments, and even the all-occupying war forms no adequate excuse for neglecting them. To lighten our labors as much as possible, in some instances the publishers have sent us neat and appreciative notices of their books, ready written -- ave, and printed -- to hand. For the most part they are ingenious hole puffs, technical in form and expression, yet graceful as muslin sleeves in their entirety. The only possible objection to using them is found in the positive psychological tact that we all like to have an opinion of our own, formed in ulter ignorance and with total disregard of and for what others may have said or thought on the same subject, and spoken in our words. For this reason we offer a few notices of new books, -- not to influence the popular judgment, but simply as an expression of individual opinion.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/787379d7-ba1e-5da7-83d6-791d492e7f86,2586,nyt://article/787379d7-ba1e-5da7-83d6-791d492e7f86

He meets frequently persons who are ruined by the calamities of the war. They never weep, or wring their hands, or tear their hair. One man, from whom the Secessionists of Missouri had taken cattle and crops and all the fruit of the labor of years, merely remarked in a quiet way, while he picked his teeth with a bowie-knife, ""Yes, they have been kinder rough with me!"" That was all -- he had nothing else to say. Mr. Trollope thinks a genuine American never complains and never despairs. Whatever happen, in the external world, says Mr. T., ""the man is always there."" In these qualities of hopefulness and independent manhood of our people lies the great confidence which we all possess of the speedy recovery of the country from the calamities of this civil war. Political economists have frequently presented it, as one of the proofs that the wealth of a people is in labor, more than in accumulated goods -- the remarkable recovery of countries which had been desolated by war.

From France we learn that Admiral DE LA GRAVIERE had left Paris for Cherbourg, to embark for Mexico, and it was asserted that Gen. FOREY was also to embark for Mexico on the 20th inst.

Editorial on 1st anniversary of battle of Bull Run; editorial on collection procedures; Editorial speculates on outlook for Union after war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/21/archives/necessity-of-a-short-war.html,Editorial on 1st anniversary of battle of Bull Run; editorial on collection procedures; Editorial speculates on outlook for Union after war,"It is not to add a shadow to the present hour of National gloom that we recall the fact that this day, the 21st of July, is the Anniversary of the Battle of Bull Run, or, more properly speaking, of Manassas. That affair, in fact, has now become a matter of history upon which we speculate without a feeling of passion, or a thought of National discredit. We can clearly trace the causes of our disaster; and we can see how, as things went, it was unavoidable. The courage of our army, as a whole, on that occasion, is unimpeached; and we have, in our National calendar, no finer heroes than many of the officers and soldiers who fought and fell on that day. The consequences of our defeat on that field, too, we now clearly see. It has been the means of prolonging the war until now. It gave the South time, which to it was all-important. It gave it nearly a whole year in which to consolidate its power unmolested; to fix and settle its so-called Government; to raise an army five or ten times as great as it then had; to unite, by necessity or force, the public sentiment of the entire South, and to crush out every vestige of Unionism; to raise provisions for the support of its army; to obtain warlike supplies from abroad, or from its own soil and manufactories; and, in short, to present such a defiant front as it yet shows to the Nation. Had our arms achieved victory on that day, and had our army marched onward to Richmond, and scattered the rebel host, we believe that it would virtually have ended the war, and that the nation, after a brief struggle, would now have been enjoying peace. Prolonged resistance in the Far South at that season, and under such circumstances, would have been out of the question; and the masses of the Southern people would have regarded secession as an abortion, and would have returned to the Union after administering justice to the false prophets who had betrayed them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Necessity of a Short War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Necessity of a Short War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/895c6bad-9a76-54d7-98f2-c7286ad901a1,1097,nyt://article/895c6bad-9a76-54d7-98f2-c7286ad901a1

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/22/archives/general-city-news.html,,"TWO MEN KILLED, AND ONE FATALLY INJURED. BY THE FALL OF A SCAFFOLD. -- About 10 o'clock yesterday A.M., an accident occurred at the northwest corner of Avenue B and Third-street, whereby two men lost their lives, and a third was so much injured that his life is considered hopeless. The men were painters, engaged in painting a four-story house on the corner above mentioned, and for the purpose of enabling them to paint the upper part of the building, they had erected a scaffold even with the third story. The fastenings, owing to some defect, suddenly gave way, and precipitated them all to the pavement. The names of the persons killed by the fall are CYRUS BEAK and JOHN SHIELDS. JAMES BEAK was so seriously injured that his physicians said it was impossible for him to live beyond to-day. In addition to the injuries received by the fall upon the pavement from the third story, it appears that a number of spars and planks fell upon the unfortunate victims, and that they were thus bruised and mangled in a horrible manner. Officer MCCOLLOUGH, of the Seventeenth Precinct, was promptly on hand, and by his orders the timbers were speedily removed from the bodies of the men, and the attempt was made, under the directions of the officer, to convey them to the Hospital. They first attempted to remove Mr. CYRUS BEAK, but they had proceeded only a short distance before it became evident to all that he was breathing his last. Officer MCCOLLOUGH then directed the men who acted as bearers to take the injured man to a neighboring drug-store, but he expired just as they were about entering the latter place with him. Just before he died he exclaimed to Officer MCCOLLOUGH several times, ""Oh my wife -- oh my family."" The deceased has left a wife and two or three children, who reside at No. 298 Second-street, where the inquest was held. The verdict of the jury was that deceased came to his death from accidental causes. An inquest was also held upon JOHN SHIELDS, who died soon after the accident. A large number of witnesses testified that the catastrophe might have been prevented if proper care had been exercised in the erection of the scaffold.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/021baf9e-7cfa-5f0a-8ccd-d12cede8a962,1322,nyt://article/021baf9e-7cfa-5f0a-8ccd-d12cede8a962

The great mass of the people are discouraged and disheartened. And the reason of it is that they have lost faith in everybody and everything except their own exhaustless resources and their own indomitable purpose to crush the rebellion and preserve the life and unity of the nation.

The news is in some respects important. The result of the fighting before Richmond is treated as a severe National reverse by the entire English Press, and as insuring the safety of the rebel capital. The Times is of the opinion that the rebel army is strong enough to hold its position in Virginia for a time which may be indefinitely prolonged. The new American Tariff excited much attention and much hostility. The Liverpool Post thinks it will be looked upon as a measure tantamount almost to a declaration of war. Lord PALMERSTON had declared, during some remarks in the House of Commons, that there was no intention of withdrawing the British troops from Canada. It is now understood that France intends to prosecute the war against Mexico with the requisite vigor to insure success. The Paris Patrie asserts that she will never treat with JUAREZ, but that when the French army has entered the City of Mexico the Mexicans will be consulted, and their wishes scrupulously respected. The date of Gen. FOREY's departure for Mexico is doubtful, but there appears to be no doubt that the army which he is to command will comprise several divisions of infantry, and a proportionate number of batteries. The awards of prizes in the Great Exhibition have been made before a crowd of some 100,000 persons. Notwithstanding the paucity of her display America figures quite conspicuously among the prizes. The Liverpool cotton market had suffered a slight depression, but had recovered again. Breadstuffs were firm but quiet, and Provisions were flat.

"Editorial on large concentration of Union troops at Cumberland Gap, east Tennessee",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/23/archives/the-union-column-at-cumberland-gap.html,"Editorial on large concentration of Union troops at Cumberland Gap, east Tennessee","When, in the early part of this year, the rebels evacuated Bowling Green, and the various divisions of our troops in Kentucky followed them southward, this column was left in Southeastern Kentucky, for the purpose of capturing the rebel stronghold at Cumberland Gap - which had been regarded as probably the most formidable and valuable strategic position in the South - and afterward penetrating into East Tennessee. The column remained, doing various work and with varied fortune, in the hilly and desolate regions in Eastern Kentucky during the whole of the Spring, and till well on in the present Summer. At the beginning of last month it was still on the Northern side of the Cumberland Mountains. At length, on the 18th of June, Gen. MORGAN, its commander, and a very able and gallant officer, obtained possession of the long-coveted Cumberland Gap, by one of the most difficult and scientific operations of the war, but which, on account of the more immediately important news we were at that time receiving from Virginia, was almost entirely overlooked by the Press. He, for a time, so manoeuvered his troops, that the enemy at the Gap could get no clue whatever to his purposes; and when, finally, having made a terrible march of a hundred miles, over mountains heretofore considered impassable, he fell upon their rear, they fled in confusion, and the Southern Thermopylae, which a thousand men might have successfully defended, fell into his hands. It was universally supposed by those who had followed up Gen. MORGAN's movements, and understood the military and political situation in that section of country, that he would at once push on to Knoxville, the capture of which would have been equivalent to the possession of nearly the whole of East Tennessee. The retention of the Gap was of vast importance to the rebels, as the means of keeping us out of East Tennessee; but the position once in our hands, it was of value only as the gateway to further conquests. Gen. MORGAN, however, with his whole force, still remains at Cumberland Gap -a force which, though the rebels overestimate it when they state it to be 20,000 strong, is yet of very considerable numbers, and is amply able, with a little of the assistance near at hand, to take military possession of all of East Tennessee. He remains there in obedience to orders.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Union Column at Cumberland Gap.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Union Column at Cumberland Gap.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/67061211-dbcd-55ee-818b-e0d8d90e5593,757,nyt://article/67061211-dbcd-55ee-818b-e0d8d90e5593

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/24/archives/our-prisoners-to-be-released-at-last.html,,"-- We trust there is no mistake as to the truth of the Washington telegram of this morning, which announces that Gen. DIX has made an arrangement with the rebels for an immediate and general exchange of prisoners. A similar announcement has been made several times before; but there have been delays, postponements, difficulties and obstructions of various kinds in carrying it out, and in the mean time the Union prisoners have lingered month after month in the dungeons of rebellion, while hundreds of them have died of neglect and harsh treatment. The principle of exchange has now been accepted by our Government, and there is no reason, if the rebels are willing, as they seem to be, that there should be any delay in carrying it out. The large numbers of our sick and wounded, in particular, who were captured by the rebels on the Peninsula during the late battles, should be attended to immediately. Some of our self-sacrificing Surgeons stayed behind with them to wait upon them, as far as possible; but we have learned that there is still a great deficiency of proper medical and surgical attendance. If all of those who can be removed without danger were brought within our lines at once, enough of the surgeons would doubtless remain to take care of the poor fellows who may be too far gone or in too much suffering to endure removal. We have about twenty thousand rebel prisoners now in our hands, mostly in the Northwest, where they have been well taken care of during the hot Summer months; while of our men the rebels cannot have altogether more than half of that number. We believe, however, that the return of these eight or ten thousand men would be the means of inducing twice or thrice that number to join the ranks of the army at once. If the telegraph be correct in saying that an arrangement has been made for an immediate exchange, we hope that the arrangement will be immediately carried out.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED AT LAST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED AT LAST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df5e2470-7022-5e14-a20c-10eff2d66c78,338,nyt://article/df5e2470-7022-5e14-a20c-10eff2d66c78

Editorial on modern iron-making providing new elements in warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/25/archives/modern-ironmakingnew-elements-in-warfare.html,Editorial on modern iron-making providing new elements in warfare,"The present results of unproved iron-making, with reference to what ought to be the principal business of this people until the rebellion is crushed out, are of the highest importance. The great want is stronger material for armor-plates, artillery and heavy ordnance, and cheaper war materiel in general -- the chief cost being in iron and steel -so that more of it can be afforded. There is in the Exhibition at London a cast-steel locomotive-tire, which, unlike the thirty or forty thousand locomotive-tires running in America, was never a pig of cast-iron, nor a puddle-ball, nor an ingot of wrought-iron, nor a bar. In a quarter of an hour from the time it had trickled from the iron ore, it was a cast steel hoop without a weld, and only needed rolling in a tire-mill to be ready to run. A large number of tires, made by this Bessemer process, are running in Europe. The ordinary tire requires from five to eight heats, and sets of manipulations. This required two; which explains the wonderful cheapness of the process. An unforged ingot of this steel, 14 inches in diameter, is broken, to show as perfect a fracture and as perfect solidity as ordinary hammered steel, and several 24-pounder guns, and a 50-horse crank shaft cast from it, and the 6,410th ""direct steel "" ingot, (18 inches square,) made by BESSEMER, are exhibited; which shows the scale upon which it has been worked. Its quality is illustrated by a variety of specimens, for instance, a railway rail, 40 feet long, is twisted cold into a spiral, and a bar five inches square is folded together like a pocket-rule, all without fracture. This metal is not only shown, but has been used for several years in the form of saws, chisels boiler-plate, cannon, shafting, &c.; and its success is complete. It is made in England, Sweden and Germany, and is about to be made even in India. But there was never a pound of it made in America, or used by our Departments, or contemplated in the immense Government iron-works lately discussed by Congress, as far as we are aware.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Modern Iron-making-New Elements in Warfare.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Modern Iron-making-New Elements in Warfare.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/85f2fc82-41c8-51b6-bf31-4cc5a3e2bf8e,672,nyt://article/85f2fc82-41c8-51b6-bf31-4cc5a3e2bf8e

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/25/archives/the-true-policy-of-punishment.html,,"One remarkable peculiarity was noticed by all in the grand Union-square meeting, and is an evidence, no doubt, of general popular feeling, and that was, that all demands for the most unsparing punishment of the rebels, and for the most vigorous measures toward them, were met with the greatest applause. From every quarter we receive, ourselves, communications urging the most extreme penalties of the law on the treasonable States and communities. A universal confiscation of real estate, so that loyal settlers may occupy the deserted properties, the wasting of rebel fields and harvest, the armed occupation of their houses, and the appropriation of all property, are some of the mildest of the penal remedies recommended. In the meeting before referred to, one of our most benevolent and excellent citizens, calmly advised sending all the rebel inhabitants further South, and occupying their houses with our soldiers. All these strongly expressed feelings are good signs in one respect -- they show that the people demand vigorous action, and will sustain the Government in it. They prove that the popular instinct feels what has been thus far our mistake -- the not striking at our enemy's weakest point. Still, the time has come when sound statesmanship and practical Christianity should indicate some distinctions and limitations in this cry for punishments and revenge. It might as well be understood now as hereafter, that there are some things which the American people can do, and some which it cannot. Whatever be our wrongs received from the South -- and their number is infinite -- we cannot exterminate or make houseless and landless the whole five or six million whites implicated in this rebellion. The thing is simply impossible. If we begin an indiscriminate, universal policy of destroying rebel property, confiscating it, and ""sending women and children South,"" and the like, we merely excite every man, woman and child to a pitch of fury which would lead them to take to the mountains and swamps rather than submit, and which would call out a storm of wrath to which the rage of Europe, under NAPOLEON's exactions, was feeble. We must remember, ourselves, how many years it needed before the ashes over our burnt homesteads, in the War of 1812, cooled again. Not all the British victories or insults ever sowed such dragon-teeth of hatred as did their destruction of the public buildings of Washington and other towns. To let an army plunder buildings, or even occupy them -- to permit every soldier to grasp and gel as he likes -- is simply to demoralize our army, and enrage the enemy past any possibility of submission.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The True Policy of Punishment.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The True Policy of Punishment.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5ef2c23-dacb-5a67-a673-e2f3d5898e5a,902,nyt://article/a5ef2c23-dacb-5a67-a673-e2f3d5898e5a

" -- SEIZURE OF COIN, TOOLS AND MATERIALS. -Yesterday Sheriff FRANCIS, of Hudson County, Constables MCDONOUGH, of Hoboken, and MOONEY, of Bull's Ferry, made a descent upon a house in Guttenberg, on the Dallytown Road, and arrested a German named GUSTAFF BERLIN, together with a boy, on a charge of being engaged in the manufacture of bogus coin which has been very extensively circulated of late. After considerable search, they succeeded in finding a quantity of crucibles, several molds, a portion of a press, a lot of tools, and other implements and materials used in the manufacture of coin. A further search brought to light a quantity of bogus ten-cent pieces secreted in a match-safe, and another lot hid away in a closet; also, a small lot on BERLIN's person. The accused was taken before Justice POPE, of Hoboken, and committed to the County Jail to await trial. The articles used in manufacturing the coin were also seized. BERLIN's house is in the centre of about two acres of ground, which he cultivates in raising vegetables in daytime, and manufactured the coin at night.

"Editorial on inequities in new enlistment procedure; urges Federal Government, rather than states, set standard",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/26/archives/irregularities-of-enlistment-another-reform-needed.html,"Editorial on inequities in new enlistment procedure; urges Federal Government, rather than states, set standard","-- We can hardly credit the statement that comes to us through a Washington telegram, that the Government has determined to accept the Pennsylvania volunteers for nine or twelve months. And yet we can scarcely conceive that Gov. CURTIN, who, previous to his proclamation, had been to the Capital, and had an interview with the Washington authorities, could have issued his call for nine or twelve months' men without any warrant whatever. The experience in Pennsylvania, in fact, is a striking illustration of the ill effects of the system adopted by the Government in making the new levy through State instead of National organization. In consequence of Gov. CURTIN's proclamation for recruits on the short term, a large number had enlisted, when a few days ago the announcement came from Washington that there was neither law nor regulation that could allow the Government to receive volunteers on any other term of service than for three years or the war. However annoying this might be to the Pennsylvania recruits, it is undoubtedly the law of the case; and hence, as we said at the beginning, we can scarcely credit the report that the Government has resolved to permit these nine and twelve months enlistments to go on. There is no reason why any discrimination should be made in the case of Pennsylvania; and we are not prepared to think that the patriotism of that State, already so nobly proved, has declined to such an ebb as to ask for any such discrimination. The bounties and pensions provided by the Government are for those enlisting for three years or the war. They could not justly claim the same rewards who but offer their services for one year. Besides, there is no certainty that the lapse of nine or twelve months will see the rebellion wholly crushed; it is safe, at least, to assume that it will not. In that event, therefore, we should have all the trouble and risk of disbanding regiments and enrolling new ones, perhaps at a critical moment. Moreover, it is the purpose that the new enlistments shall be used mainly in filling up regiments now existing, but depleted by battle or disease. It is easy, then, to foresee the endless confusion and demoralization that must arise from this diversity in the terms of enlistment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IRREGULARITIES OF ENLISTMENT ANOTHER REFORM NEEDED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IRREGULARITIES OF ENLISTMENT ANOTHER REFORM NEEDED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/875432a6-067b-55fc-a841-01893c829c5d,430,nyt://article/875432a6-067b-55fc-a841-01893c829c5d

The room was by far too small to accommodate even half of the ten thousand who rushed to demonstrate by their presence their sympathy with the cause as well as with the noble sons of Erin who have so fearlessly thrown their lives into the breach to defend the land of the free from its traitorous assailants. The Armory was ablaze with light, and brilliant with the flags of Ireland and America tastefully disposed. Long before the hour for opening the meeting, the room was densely packed with a sweltering, but none the less enthusiastic, audience. The appearance of the band was the signal for a good-natured outburst of calls for Hibernian music of all kinds, and hearty applause greeted the musicians as they complied, and gave ""The Exile of Erin,"" ""St. Patrick's Day,' ""Garryowen,"" &c. The boys were in an excellent humor, and cheered the policeman who ordered the windows opened, the thirty gentlemen who helped themselves to water from the speaker's pitcher, and the reckless individual who threw up camp stools toward the platform, landing them on the heads of unfortunate bystanders. There were calls and hisses for ""GREELEY."" With the punctuality of a soldier, Gen. MEAGHER struggled toward the platform at precisely 8 o'clock, accompanied by DANIEL DEVLIN, SAMUEL SLOAN, RICHARD LALOR, JOHN SAVAGE and other gentlemen of note. The welcome of Gen.

The thief at once ran off at full speed, followed by Mr. TAGGARD, who cried, at the top of his voice, ""Stop thief! stop thief!""

The chase was soon terminated, however, by Officer WOOD, of the Tenth Precinct, who sprang upon his victim so suddenly, that the most of the crowd had no opportunity to see how skillfully the man was caught.

Editorial derides British criticisms; Editorial notes how political sentiments on slavery have fluctuated throughout world,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/27/archives/a-phenomenon-in-english-criticism.html,Editorial derides British criticisms; Editorial notes how political sentiments on slavery have fluctuated throughout world,"The time has passed in which the violent abuse by the Tory Press of England, of all things American, can produce much sensation here. The sting in the popular feeling in regard to England, was the disappointment of a noble but very youthful sentiment toward her. We had somehow very simply come to believe the talk of her orators about ""common blood, common liberties, common literature,"" and all that, and we had equally accepted, in penitent submission, as sincere, her severe rebukes of our great national sin. Foolish as it now seems, there had sprung up in our masses a certain ""sentiment"" toward Great Britain, and it probably did not enter the thought of one person in a hundred thousand, when the Rebellion for Slavery broke out, but that the whole moral weight of England would at once be thrown in our scale, and we should have the hearty sympathy of our kindred people. The revulsion, when the facts came out, may have caused here some undue expression of bitterness -- an excitement, however, honorable to the simplicity of our own feelings and to our former ideal of England. All that of course has passed now. We see as clearly as the most English of English journalists, the folly of our sentiments. We behold -- and will not again forget -- that nations have no sympathies; that in the great family of peoples, whether of ""common blood"" or most diverse blood, as in the great family of nature, the success in the ""struggle for life"" is only to the strong, and that power and success are alone considered in the relations of Governments. These have now become axioms here, as they must long ago have become in England. Therefore it is that the bitterest insult by English journals falls light as a feather, and the senile sniveling of BROUGHAM, or the mean contempt of RUSSELL, are now passed as the idle wind; and the only thing that concerns us, is that they should go no further. Deeds are the only things now from Great Britain that can cause us anxiety. Still, in the private relations with Englishmen, one is interested continually in the mental phenomenon of a national selfishness, become so ingrained as to be unconscious. These men tell us with the most naive candor that a disintegration of large communities into many small, is the latest politico-economic axiom, and that two or three or four separate republics on the American continent are necessary for a proper ""competition"" of nations. They coolly exhort us to follow the purest political philosophy, to give up all hopes of greatness, and to permit whatever separation each of our communities would prefer. ""So they would act toward Canada."" They are ""impartial observers,"" and their advice should be received with some respect. These are the honest views of private Englishmen, and they never for a moment think how they would act if the question of secession were brought to their doors, nor do they remember their own most vigorous and consistent public policy. It does not seem to be before their minds that England has stopped at nothing in the past -- has sacrificed millions of treasure and priceless blood -- has held all Europe at bay -- has gripped the most distant peoples by the throat, and plundered the weak rich, and bullied the strong -- merely and solely that she might retain her Imperial power and position among nations; and all this, and much more, she would do and bear again for the same object. Should India rebel, should Wales secede, or Lancashire revolt, she would pour out her stored wealth like water -- her green fields would be drenched in blood, her cities burnt, before one of these events would be allowed to be consummated in peace. And yet scarce any Englishman ever thinks of the analogy, when American secession is before his mind. To his secret instinct, the whole war here is simply ""a brawl"" between ""vulgar foreigners:"" a riotous fight of low Democrats for power, on one side, and ""niggers"" on the other; and the world (that is, British manufactures) would be much better off if both were well beaten and exhausted, and certainly forever separated. This is literally and truly, we believe, the sentiment of four-fifths of the middle and upper classes of Englishmen toward America. Of course, there is no sympathy in it, but there is also none of the usual effort for even an apparently generous and intelligent understanding of a terrible foreign difficulty; no putting themselves historically or politically in our places, to get at our stand-point.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Phenomenon in English Criticism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Phenomenon in English Criticism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09caad12-0233-5f5b-8c1b-a2c55ffa59c2,879,nyt://article/09caad12-0233-5f5b-8c1b-a2c55ffa59c2

Vallot, L'Aguin and Fagon, reviewed","The above is the title of a most curious and interesting book, just published by M. LE ROI, the Librarian of Versailles. We have here, from authentic sources, a daily record ot the health of the Grand Monarque from his earliest infancy to the year 1711, that is to say, till within four years of his death. All his diseases, ailments, indigestions, vapors and disordered fancies are here chronicled in most minute detail, together with a full description of the purges, emetics, tonics, ointments, plasters, lavements and surgical operations which were from time to time administered, used, employed, performed and resorted to, for the purpose of keeping alive, solacing, comforting, cherishing and beautifying the proudest sovereign of his own or almost any other age. If ""no man,"" as the proverb says, ""is a hero to his valet de chambre,"" who shall be a hero to his physician? Fortunate is it for the memories of many heroes of antiquity, that their physicians have transmitted to posterity no such diary as that which now paints with photographical accuracy, to gratify the curiosity of the profane vulgar, the bodily infirmities of Louis XIV. Fancy the physician of ALEXANDER, who saved his life when he imprudently took a cold bath in the Cydnus, publishing a prognosis and diagnosis about his godlike master at every stage of his fabulous march through Asia. Fancy ANTONIUS MUSA, who received the honor of a statue, for curing AUGUSTUS of a dangerous illness, having left a note-book describing, day by day, the miseries of the sick chamber of the great valetudinarian Emperor. We know, in a general way, that JULIUS CESAR had the ""falling sickness,"" and SHAKESPEARE imagines him calling out like a sick girl, ""Give me some drink, Titinius;"" but there is no medical record of what he said and did when he was seized with giddiness, what piece of furniture he caught hold of to steady himself with; how often the fits recurred, how long they lasted, and what treatment was used to relieve him. All this and much more is imperturbably told by M. LE ROI about LOUIS XIV., who played with vertigo all his life. The publication of this book is in itself a sign of the times and a mark of progress. But a few years ago such disclosures would have been thought politically dangerous, as tending to diminish the respect of the vulgar for that ""divinity which doth hedge a king."" Only so recently as 1846 LOUIS PHILIPPE's Minister, M. DE SALVANDY, positively prohibited the Duke DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD LIANCOURT from publishing ""an account of the last illness of LOUIS XV.,"" and, at the last moment, the review which had the paper in type, was obliged to substitute something else for it.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEW PUBLICATIONS.; JOURNAL OF THE HEALTH OF LOUIS XIV.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/27/archives/our-military-position.html,,"There are abundant signs of cheer in looking over the broad extent of the military field at present. In the first place, there is cheer in the fact that we have now a Soldier at the head of our armies. We may now expectunity and directness of purpose, harmony of action, and a proper seizure and use of all the means and agencies of war. We may expect -- and it is to be hoped we will not expect in vain -- that there will be promptitude, speed, and decision in movement; that not a day will be lost, nor an opportunity missed. There is cheer in the fact that this commander has such an army, or armies, already formed and equipped to his hands. We have praised this army much and often during the past year, and we have not a jot to abate from any of our words now. It is still a superb -- an unequaled army. There have, undoubtedly, been popular exaggerations as to its numbers -- based, however, in the first instance, on official misapprehensions which were given to the public. It has been decimated, too, by battle, by disease and by work in the trenches. But, apart from exaggeration, and making all allowance for losses of every kind, we have still between three and four hundred thousand men in the field -- armed with the best weapons and supported by rifled cannon. There have been disappointments, it is true, that this great military force has not before now completely trampled down the rebellion, captured Richmond, and carried our flag from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. But the popular expectations were based on misapprehension as to the actual and possible power of the rebels, and a want of knowledge as to what the phrase ""crushing out the rebellion"" really meant. There is, however, as we remarked on a previous day, a positive gain, if not cheer to us in the fact that we now know this. We have seen, measured and wrestled with the foe in his full strength and ferocity; and though we did not completely overcome him in the grand encounter, we rose from the work with a consciousness that it was within our power. There is cheer in the fact that this power, which lies with the people, has now been called out to a greater degree than ever. We know that if Gen. MCCLELLAN had had fifty thousand more soldiers last month, the rebel host would assuredly have been overcome, Richmond would have fallen, and DAVIS and the remnants of his army and Government would probably, by this time, have been as far South as South Carolina. Had he that number of additional troops to-day, he would bring the campaign in Virginia to a speedy and triumphant end. All over the land the men are enlisting now to fill up the ranks; and the three hundred thousand volunteers called for, when once under arms, will give us the additional strength which the late battles and movements show that we need for our work. In the fact that the North has plenty of men able to take the field, there is an assurance of triumph; and in the fact that they are forthcoming there is a sign of cheer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Military Position.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Military Position.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff97c5be-297d-5f38-9078-cc9a3daebe83,1067,nyt://article/ff97c5be-297d-5f38-9078-cc9a3daebe83

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/28/archives/general-city-news.html,,"A PROBABLE HOMICIDE IN ESSEX-STREET. -- About 2 o'clock, yesterday morning, a serious stabbing affray occurred in Essex-street, between Broome and Delancey, during which a German baker of the Tenth Ward, named ADAM CHRISTMAN, was cut in the neck and shoulder so severely that no hopes are entertained of his recovery. Officer ACKERMAN, of the Tenth Precinct, arrested three men, named AUGUST KNOOP, FREDERICK SEICKEL and ADAM BURGER, who are supposed to be implicated in the affair. The account of the affray, as given by Officer ACKERMAN, who was in the immediate vicinity, is, that CHRISTMAN and a friend of his were passing along Essex-street, and when about opposite the brewery of Mr. KUNTZ he saw CHRISTMAN and his friend in an encounter with the three men who were arrested. During the melee CHRISTMAN threw a lager-bier glass at one of the men. which struck him upon the head, and inflicted a serious wound. The officer then Interfered and took CHRISTMAN into custody. While he was in the act of making the arrest, a knife in the hands of one of the parties was thrust forcibly toward him, but fortunately it struck his club, and he was thus saved from being wounded. On the way to the station-house, CHRISTMAN seemed weak and faint, but it was not until they arrived at the latter place that the prisoner fed senseless through loss of blood. It was then discovered that the man had been dangerously [???], and for a time it was believed that he was dying. Medical aid was soon [???], and shortly afterward he was conveyed to the New-York Hospital, where he now lies in a critical condition. Coroner NAUMANN visited him yesterday, at the re-quest of Justice STEERS, for the purpose of taking his deposition, but after consultation with his physicians, who say that his life depends upon his being kept quiet, it was deemed best to postpone the investigation. Officer ACKERMAN, while searching in the neighborhood of the place of the affray, found a dirk-knife, which is no doubt the instrument with which the offence was committed. The [???] arrested were yesterday taken before Justice STEERS, at the Essex Market Police Court, and after a preliminary examination, they were committed to await the result of the injuries.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/414b8223-196a-5211-acff-415bc28454e2,1637,nyt://article/414b8223-196a-5211-acff-415bc28454e2

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/28/archives/health-matters-in-the-army.html,,"As our readers will testify, we have hammered away at different times on sanitary improvements in the army, till the patience of the public must be nearly exhausted. A year ago, we did our best to impress upon the Quartermaster-General or the Surgeon-General, the indispensable necessity of a train of mule ambulances to our army. We urged them on the ground of humanity and of economy. At the very time one of the articles was in press on this subject, the wounded were left on the field of Mill Spring, many of them to die, because ambulances could not possibly reach the place, so bad were the roads. With the mule ambulances, one man and two mules can get off four wounded men. In every battle on the Peninsula, there have not been half ambulances enough, and usually two horses and two men have been needed to carry away two wounded. How many of our brave fellows would have been saved to the country in the late week of battles, had the army possessed this train of mules. The camp police, too, has beer, a subject on which much has been written in our columns. We have called attention to simple practical means for preserving the health of an army -- the enforced cleanliness of the men, the strict covering of refuse and garbage and filth with fresh dirt, the airing and drying of tent-floors, the drainage and best exposure for camps, and other like matters. We have argued strongly against the received army rations as being adapted to our former condition, when troops were scattered over such vast territory and were composed of trained soldiers; we showed that even with them, scurvy was fearfully prevalent, and that for our volunteers less fat and more acids were needed -- smaller rations of pork and more of vegetables or other luxuries. We pressed the claims of tea as an army ration, equally necessary with coffee, and perhaps more useful in the Northern climate -- the latter producing too much laxity of system.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Health Matters in the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Health Matters in the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b3ac8d0b-7272-5510-bc11-1197e6af1abe,783,nyt://article/b3ac8d0b-7272-5510-bc11-1197e6af1abe

British press observations,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/29/archives/how-england-would-enjoy-secession.html,British press observations,"Before we venture to presage the conduct and demeanor of the Americans in this new trial of their faith in their destiny and in themselves, let us think for a moment what would be our own feelings under similar circumstances. We need not try the question by any hypothetical test. Like every great community formed in the course of time by the confluence of races and the conjunction of kingdoms and provinces once separate from one another, our own unity as a nation has been more than once threatened, and more than once has the heroic instinct of greatness raised us above the time-serving folly of tampering with or tolerating a political schism. We need not even appeal to the history of other times for an illustration. In our own day the inhabitant of one-third of the United Kingdom, provoked by the neglect of their just local grievances, threatened political secession. Legislative independence was openly avowed as the object of millions of men, and in the united Parliament itself the purpose was avowed and maintained. The seceding portion of the empire was declared to be politically overborne by the remainder, and its social condition was said to be peculiar and distinct, not understood by the rest, and requiring separate laws. The terms of the Union were declared to have been violated, and the spirit of the compact to have been broken. Geographically, the line of separation between the two islands was deeply and indelibly marked; and the lapse of time -- not half as long as that which has sanctioned the American Confederation -- was not sufficient to obliterate from the minds of those who would have rescinded the Union with Ireland the vivid recollection of the state of things that existed previous to that act. Theoretically it was argued by the Irish Secessionists that if free to marry, they had a right to divorce on grounds of neglect and cruelty. The injustice and the neglect were admitted unreservedly by the best and wisest of our own statesmen. But while they pleaded for redress they told the Repealers of Ireland that the Union they were resolved to maintain at any hazard. Among the liberal statesmen of Great Britain there was on this point an unanimity as entire, a determination as unwavering, as among the most conservative of their rivals. On every other question of modern politics, domestic, colonial, foreign, municipal, imperial, financial, they differed again and again; but on this one great, vital, and essential question, they never differed. WELLINGTON and GREY, PEEL and RUSSELL, LYNDHURST and BROUGHAM, GRAHAM and PALMERSTON, all agreed that, come what might, the Union must be maintained, the integrity of the realm must be preserved. In one of the most brilliant and effective speeches ever delivered by MACAULAY, after reminding the Irish on how many questions the Liberal party had fought with them side by side, as they were ready to do again, he thus warned them of the infatuation of seeking to dissolve the Union: ""The Repeal of the Union we regard as fatal to the Empire, and we never will consent to it; never -- though the country should be surrounded by dangers as great as those which threatened her when her American colonies, and France, and Spain, and Holland, were leagued against her, and when the armed neutrality of the Baltic disputed her maritime rights; never -- though another BONAPARTE should pitch his camp in sight of Dover Castle; never -- till the four quarters of the world have been convulsed by the last struggle of the great English people for their place among the nations.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How England Would Enjoy Secession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How England Would Enjoy Secession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London News, July 14', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'July', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d59465b-1603-58e5-b64a-ce51f95fc38f,793,nyt://article/1d59465b-1603-58e5-b64a-ce51f95fc38f

Editorial doubts intervention by France and Great Britain; says it would be to their disadvantage,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/29/archives/the-intervention-scare-again.html,Editorial doubts intervention by France and Great Britain; says it would be to their disadvantage,"Our European letters this morning are big with portents of intervention. Our correspondent at Paris, always well poised and well informed, is satisfied that the vast naval and military preparations of France, ostensibly directed against Mexico, are ultimately aimed at the United States. It is with a view to apossible contest with the latter, growing out of the Mexican botchwork, if not out of some direct act of friendship and support offered to the South, that the Emperor is about to crowd his cuirassed steamers and ships-of-the-line into our harbors, and thus be prepared for all eventualities. England, servile to the Imperial policy, is obliged to make a similar disposition of its squadrons, in readiness to back NAPOLEON in any quarrel he may provoke. Our London correspondent, constitutionally less cautious, is still more positive that all England is rapidly hastening to the conclusion that the war can only be terminated by forcible intervention. The aristocratic party, touched with the sufferings of the masses, clamors for an enforced peace. It only remains for the suffering masses to be tricked into a concordant clamor, for the cry to become too unanimous to be resistible, and accordingly the entire energies of the London Times, Post and Herald are concentrated upon an effort to satisfy the starving workmen that their calamities are not only due to Northern pugnacity, but that the North, so far from exhibiting any symptoms of remorse, actually glories in the agonies of Lancashire and Lanark. These labors, it is assumed by our correspondent, must presently be successful in arraying the whole British people in favor of the South and intervention.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Intervention Scare Again.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Intervention Scare Again.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/355006e2-e632-5e14-ad8c-669659c2f62e,894,nyt://article/355006e2-e632-5e14-ad8c-669659c2f62e

This is the case across the broad Western waters. Mr. LINCOLN has all the markers in his own hand. Gen. JACKSON makes a bull's-eye, and up goes the signal which telegraphs to all Europe a shameful miss. Gen. FREMONT makes a solemn shot, which never rings against the target, and from the other end of the range the flag of success waves triumphantly. There were a hundred targets at Wimbledon, and there are almost as many in these closely United States of America; but Mr. LINCOLN and his subordinates hold the markers at their mercy, and the reports of the scores have no relation to the facts of the shooting.

Two or three other correspondents write on the same subject. One traces the nasty phenomenon to the ""great purifying house of the Manhattan Gas Works, wherein the gas is passed through lime, etc.,"" and asserts that the whole vicinity is constantly poisoned by the fumes. Another says the stench proceeds from the sewers which empty into the East River in the vicinity of Sixth and Eighth streets. These sewers have become filled with mud and other material, until the water flows into the streets through the sewer openings, filling the gutters with a black and filthy liquid, which lies in the hot sun until it evaporates, poisoning the atmosphere and scattering the seeds of disease and death broadcast over the City. There is evidently a combination of causes in the production of the offensive result.

Since entering on his new command, Gen. POPE hasscarcely had time to make any decisive demonstration in that quarter, but he has been by no means idle. A state of thing entirely different from that which existed under the old dynasty has been inaugurated. The prominent rebel sympathizers, in the vicinity of Fredericksburgh, have been seized and placed beyond the power of doing further mischief. The cavalry has been released from its former service of simply guarding the rebel property of the neighborhood, and applied to the use for which cavalry is intended. Two detachments have already penetrated far down into the turbulent heart of disloyal Virginia, spying out the land, and awakening the enemy to the fact that they have an agile foe to contend with, and cannot occupy themselves wholly with offensive operations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MOTION IN THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MOTION IN THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c22ab29a-b7d4-50ee-87ec-c45709641092,499,nyt://article/c22ab29a-b7d4-50ee-87ec-c45709641092

"The following facts, derived from unquestionable authority, may serve to illustrate the danger incurred by Federal officers who seek to entice or corrupt the slaves of our people. One of our citizens having missed a valuable slave woman, made inquiry for her, and ascertained that she was in the service of an officer of one of the Federal regiments. He proceeded to the boarding-house of the officer, and there finding the woman, asked if she was not ready to go home. The woman replied that she was, but that the Federal officer, in whose service she was, would not permit her. The citizen then saw the officer, and received from him assurance that the woman would be sent to him. This promise was not kept, and our citizen being disgusted with the double-dealing and bad faith of the officer, laid his complaint before Lieut. WEITZEL, who manifested great indignation against the officer, and requested the citizen to see Gen. BUTLER. The wife of our citizen undertook the mission to Gen. BUTLER, and after some difficulty, succeeded in obtaining an interview with him. Gen. BUTLER immediately took the matter in hand, and sent a guard to the boarding-house where the slave was harbored, had the officer who so harbored her arrested and sent to jail, and on the interference of a Chaplain of one of the Federal regiments against the arrest of the woman, had his Reverendship also arrested and placed in confinement. The girl was sent home to her master, with the request that she should not be cruelly punished. This course on the part of the General commanding is calculated to put a stop to an abuse which must produce quite as much trouble to the Federal authorities as to our own citizens.

We frankly confessthat we do not understand it. We hope the Health Officer has been incorrectly reported. We are utterly unable to reconcile the statement purporting to have been made by him, with frequent personal assurances of his understanding of the law of 1859, by which our people have been persuaded the Health Officer would be guided, should the emergency ever arise requiring his action. If our correspondent has read the Gazette leader of last Wednesday, he will see by the statement of Dr. GUNN that we were correct in our surmises of the intent and meaning of the resolution of the Commissioners of Health, which has excited so much severe animadversion in New-York -- by which, we said truly, that the public and the Emigration Board had been misted. We have correctly exposed the strategy of Mayor OPDYKE. He never intended that yellow-fever patients should be sent to Ward's Island; but having conferred with Dr. GUNN, and having agreed with him in regard to the concealed interpretation of the resolution, that resolution was made public, and everybody supposed, as did the Commissioners of Emigration, that nothing short of a transfer of the Quarantine to Ward's Island was intended; whereas it was the reopening of the ""Quarantine Hospital and five others on Staten Island,"" for yellow fever patients, that was to be the consequence of the resolution, in case the desired effect was not produced upon the Commissioners of Emigration. While we cannot concur with Dr. GUNN in the line of argument he has seen fit to adopt, we congratulate him that the action of the Commissioners of Emigration, in providing the floating hospital, has relieved him from the necessity of a practical application of it. Our people have, for three year past, flattered themselves that these hospitals were forever closed against [???] diseases.

These people -- loyal, of course, in their feelings, and inclined to aid our cause, as well as eager for liberty -- have everywhere entered our lines and intrusted themselves to the honor of the Government. Some have labored in the camps; some have been servants of officers; others have merely wailed until occupation could be assigned them, or they have tilled the ground under the protection of our armies. No complaint has yet been made either of their industry or their faithfulness to the National cause. It would be a shame beyond any on the catalogue of national basenesses if any of these poor creatures, through our reverses, should be abandoned to their ancient masters. It would be a living death to them. Torture and floggings and punishment, and possibly execution under horrible agonies, would be their fate. They are the nation's freedmen -- intrusted to the nation's honor.

Article on increased counterfeiting of paper currency,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/30/archives/counterfeiting-statistics-of-frauds-on-our-paper-currency.html,Article on increased counterfeiting of paper currency,"There are very few persons, if any, in the United States, who can truthfully declare their ability to detect at a glance any fraudulent paper money. So numerous are our Banks, and so varied the tricks of the counterfeiter, that even professional detectors of bad bills, brokers, bank tellers and others in the constant habit of handling large sums of money, are frequently imposed upon. Our ""Counterfeit Detectors"" have, within the last few years, increased in size, until their proportions rival our Family Bibles, and generally compel much more studious perusal. If a man offers a bill in payment for anything, it is a signal for the production of the inevitable volume. The merchant wades through the long list of ""altered,"" ""counterfeit,"" ""spurious,"" ""old plate,"" ""broken bank,"" and a hundred other frauds, and if he fails to find a description of the proffered bill, concludes that it is good. Then if change is given, the purchaser must borrow the book and go through the same tedious process, in his turn to prevent being imposed upon. So rapidly are these frauds in paper money produced, that in all our large cities the aid of the police and the telegraph is called into requisition to protect the merchant. Even the types and the printing-press, the police and the telegraph, are frequently too late for the shrewd counterfeiter, and in defiance of them all, the City is often flooded with a worthless issue before citizens can be put upon their guard.

The circumstances of the case are as follows: Complainant entered a Court-st. car to ride to the ferry, and having no change tendered the defendant a $1 bill from which to take his fare. The Conductor refused to change the bill, and ordered defendant to leave the car. Not moving quickly enough to suit the conductor, that official facilitated the egress of defendant by a shove, a blow and a kick, landing him in the street while the car was in motion. The Justice, in passing sentence, took the opportunity to say that he had himself observed a great deal of brutality on the part of conductors towards passengers, and intimated that while justified in removing a passenger for nonpayment of fare, no unnecessary violence should be used. In this case, he said, the complainant had been pushed to the street while the car was in motion, and if no blow had been struck, the forcing of a man from a car while in motion was of itself an assault and battery.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-07-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe1c8b7a-82d9-5395-8bc0-afafc4464d06,702,nyt://article/fe1c8b7a-82d9-5395-8bc0-afafc4464d06

Possibly these declarations command somewhat less of confidence than similar assurances did some months ago, for they have been made to do duty too often within the last year to be quite as good as new. The people cannot forget that every new General has advertised the world that, with his accession to office, the era of imbecility had passed away: nor is it surprising that the notice should command somewhat less of confidence with every fresh instance of its repetition. Still, the country is steadily, though slowly, bringing itself up to the task of confiding in the purpose of the Government to prosecute the war to a speedy and successful end. The appointment of a skillful and experienced Soldier to command the army, has done more than any other circumstance to lift the cloud of gloom that was rapidly settling down upon the public mind; for it gives us reason to hope that the Government sees at last the weak point in its contest with the rebellion, and that it has the courageous self-distrust to apply the remedy. It is from no lack of money or men; it is not from lack of courage or of good conduct in the field; it is from no failure on the part of the people, that our past misfortunes have arisen. We have placed power enough in the hands of the Government to have crushed the rebellion long ago.

Mr. LINDSAY made the motion for mediation, but after a very full discussion, withdrew it at the request of the Government. The Paris Moniteur had published a meagre and rather gloomy dispatch from Gen. LORENCEZ, as to his position in Mexico down to the 11th June. The General claims that his communication with Vera Cruz had been reestablished, but he had received warning that he was to be attacked on the following day by Gen. ZARAGOSA, at the head of 10,000 men. The dispatch is said to have added to the apprehension felt at Paris. On the Bourse the Funds fell 1/4 per cent. from no other apparent cause.

We may rely upon it that Dr. BRECKINRIDGE will have a leading part in any movement for maintaining the Union in Kentucky. He has been from the beginning one of the staunchest, ablest and most effective supporters of the Union in that State; and the position which she has held, and the services she has rendered to the Government are due in very large degree to his zealous and indefatigable labors. He is a writer of great argumentative as well rhetorical ability and has long ranked as confessedly one of the foremost orators in the whole country. While he has always distrusted the wisdom of the political action of the Republicans and other opponents of Slavery in the North, he has never aided or countenanced in any way the Pro-Slavery projects which have culminated in the rebellion. And no man anywhere has denounced more unsparingly than he, or shown up more clearly and strikingly the enormous moral guilt, as well as political wickedness, of those who are now engaged in attempting to destroy the Union.
