Editorial on US Government relations with Indians based on report by US Interior Dept,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/03/archives/department-of-the-interior.html,Editorial on US Government relations with Indians based on report by US Interior Dept,"-- IMPORTANT SUGGESTION REGARDING OUR GOLD AND SILVER LANDS. -- The report from the Department of the Interior (Secretary SMITH) and the accompanying reports from subordinate bureaus, such as the Land Office, the Indian Bureau, and the Pension Bureau, will be perused with interest. They contain, all of them, highly valuable information. The Pension Bureau has now become a far more extensive and important organization than ever before; the Indian Bureau, too, has had heavy duty and grievous labor during the year; but the business of the Land Office has steadily continued to decline, owing to the decrease of immigration and the passage of the Homestead law. The most interesting portion of Commissioner EDMUNDS' report is that which is devoted to a discussion of the relations between the financial condition of the country and the gold fields of the public domain. The facts and speculations he furnishes in regard to the present and prospective yield of gold from the far West will astonish those who have not paid special attention to the subject. For the present year the yield of precious metals will undoubtedly be $100,000,000 at least; and within ten years the annual product must reach two thousand million dollars in the precious metals alone. The Government should, of course, secure a handsome revenue from these mineral lands, and Commissioner EDMUNDS discusses this point with force. He does not recommend any measure for the sale of the mineral lands, but advises the retention of the fee in the United States, and that they be held open to the free occupation of all our people, subject only to a nominal annual license, and such monthly, quarterly or annual moderate percentage upon the product as shall be prescribed by law. A limitation as to the quantity which may he held by any person is also advised, with the guarantee that such quantity may be retained so long as the location shall be occupied, worked and payments duly made to the Government. This will furnish a permanent basis of revenue to the Government. We hope this important subject will at once be taken up and legislated upon by Congress.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Indians, American', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1689ec0d-f9da-5a44-a533-a3f26b06258c,357,nyt://article/1689ec0d-f9da-5a44-a533-a3f26b06258c

Hostilities the States, may be apprehended in the Spring with the Sioux of Dakotah, the most powerful tribe on the continent. He sketches at length the intrigues of the rebels with the various tribes, and the measures adopted by Gen. HUNTER for the relief of the refugees, the state of affairs in New-Mexico and California, and then turns to the consideration of the recent troubles in Minnesota. He states that the origin of the difficulties, as well as it can be understood from the imperfect facts yet reported, seems to have been a dissatisfaction with the payments. These had been reduced by the necessary subtractions from their annuities of the sums needed to pay for the depredations lawless Sioux had committed. This reduction had caused much complaint, and the Indians could not be made to understand its cause. Finally it was decided, so threatening had become their demonstrations, to make the last annual payment in full. In order to do this, it was necessary to defer the payment beyond the usual time, till certain needed appropriations should become available. About the usual time of making the payment, bands of the Sioux, without previous notice of the Agent's readiness to pay, (which they always received heretofore before assembling,) assembled at the Agent's residence, and in the most threatening and insolent manner demanded their annuities. Troops had to be ordered out to protect the Agency, and it was only after the most positive assurances of speedy payment that they were induced to disperse.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INDIAN AFFAIRS.; REPORT OF COMMISSIONER DOLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INDIAN AFFAIRS.; REPORT OF COMMISSIONER DOLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24c0bc5d-7351-540d-a3c8-9d47788f34fd,1110,nyt://article/24c0bc5d-7351-540d-a3c8-9d47788f34fd

Editorial lauds establishment of ambulance corps,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/03/archives/the-wounded-in-battle.html,Editorial lauds establishment of ambulance corps,"-AN AMBULANCE CORPS. -- We are glad to learn that it has not only been determined to raise an ambulance corps for our army, but that the thing is now well under way, and will be available, to a large extent, in the first engagement that may take place in Virginia. Heretofore the care of the wounded who fell in the field has devolved upon their comrades by their side. When a man has fallen, the two others nearest to him have been accustomed to bear him to the rear, where he was put in charge of the surgeons. In such sanguinary battles as we have often had, where regiments have been doubly decimated, this system has almost entirely broken up the lines; for many of those who go to the rear with a wounded man never return; and if they do return, it is only to confuse still more the ranks which their absence has already confused. A regiment of four hundred men, with fifty wounded, can thus retain in steady action little more than half its strength. An army surgeon informs us that at the battle of Cedar Mountain, as doubtless at many other battles, this mode of operating produced the greatest disturbance in regiments, and almost entirely broke up one brigade.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WOUNDED IN BATTLE--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WOUNDED IN BATTLE--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96f4509d-2657-5ad4-a352-746e66c3a20d,375,nyt://article/96f4509d-2657-5ad4-a352-746e66c3a20d

"A German Festival, to raise funds for a German Hospital, was held on Monday night, in the hall on the corner of Broadway and Fourth-street. A want has long been felt for a hospital for German immigrants who reach this country sick, friendless, ignorant of the English language, and otherwise wrong side up. The efforts to build this hospital have thus far been made, almost wholly, by the German mechanics and ladies.

It is always unpleasant to draw comparisons, as it is difficult to avoid doing so. We may say briefly that Mr. JOHN GILBERT was excellent as Andrew Wpie, and made his exit in the last act with much of the force of his predecessor. Mr. FLOYD as Adolphus, was all that could be desired, and in the introductory scene with his tutor, displayed the nicest perception of youthful gaucherie. Mr. LESTER WALLACK was, of course, admirable. It is unnecessary to speak of the other characters except in terms of general praise.

Editorial on success of German opera in NYC; compares Italian opera,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/03/archives/matters-musicalitalian-and-german.html,Editorial on success of German opera in NYC; compares Italian opera,"The elasticity of the American temperament, its easy transition from gloom to gaiety, its happy faculty of forgetting the evil of the day in the event of the evening, are just now singularly illustrated in the uniform and remarkable prosperity of all the places of Metropolitan amusement. In the olden times the Muses hung their heads when strife was in the land; now they are friskier than ever. The success of the theatres alone would not be remarkable. They can adapt themselves to the exigencies of the moment; if it is war, they can reflect the valor of the combatants, the heroic deeds of the brave; if it be commercial ruin, they can preach on the evil effects of stock-gambling, and so on through the catalogue of national disasters. But with the higher class of entertainments it is widely different. Music, in particular, appeals to that nice balance of the intellectual powers which in its ultimate condition is called taste.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/05/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"THE MOUNT PROSPECT INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.-- A Fair and Festival in aid of the Mount Prospect Industrial School was commenced at the Academy of Music Wednesday evening, and was continued yesterday. Some five years since, the benevolent ladies of the neighborhood of Grand and Atlantic avenues, where the institution is located, conceived a plan to improve the condition of the poor children of that vicinity by establishing a school, and as an inducement to attend, they provided them with one meal a day, and furnished each with decent clothing. The school was first opened in a stable, but it is now held in a fine building, erected at a cost of $5,800, and all paid for. The school has thus far been supported by the residents of the neighborhood, and this is the first time that an appeal is made in a public way. There is also connected with the institution a Bible-class for the parents of the children attending school, to which some 30 or 40 adults belong. The males have formed themselves into a band, now numbering 8 or 10 members, who have, during the past year, made commendable progress in the musical art. The band was present last evening, and played a number of fine airs. The number of children in the school is about 100, all well cared for, and with a good prospect that, under the influence of the ladies having them in charge, will become good members of society. A large number of useful and fancy articles were on exhibition at the Fair, and from appearances last evening, a considerable sum will be realized before the close this evening. The officers are: Mrs. S.B. Jenkins, First Directress; Mrs. H.P. Messenger, Second Directress; Mrs. J.W. Camp, Secretary; Mrs. A. Smithers, Corresponding Secretary; Mrs. M.A. Welch, Treasurer, and 30 managers.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/69adaccc-ff3b-53a4-88a8-5772206fd386,742,nyt://article/69adaccc-ff3b-53a4-88a8-5772206fd386

The proceedings of the meeting, and particularly toward its close, were grand and thrilling. We cannot, perhaps, describe the thing better than by saying that it was characteristically American; or, closer still, that it was peculiarly New-York-like; and especially, after the style that characterizes all the action of the enterprising and wealthy mercantile classes of the commercial Metropolis of the country. After the speeches and resolutions, which were all both humane and businesslike, a brief letter was read from the eminent shipping house of Messrs. N.L. & GEO. GRISWOLD, which contained the following sublime sentence: ""As an earnest of our desire to further this cause, in behalf of ourselves and others, owners of a new ship now in Boston, we tender her entire capacity, 1,800 tons, for the conveyance of the supplies, and our services, if needed, to forward them free of charge for freight."" The meeting at once tendered thanks for the generous offer, and Mr. DODGE stated it was virtually a contribution of $20,000 to the fund. Another letter was read from a gentleman who did not wish his name mentioned, which closed no less eloquently than the first one: ""Thank God!"" said the writer, ""we have bread and to spare, and they will not say, 'I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat.' Will you add to your list one thousand barrels of flour, from one whose loaf will taste the sweeter for sharing it with a famished brother, and brand it -- UNION."" After the reading of this letter, the same munificent anonymous donor who had sent it, handed in, as an additional contribution, seven one-thousand dollar United States Treasury Notes, but he still desired his name should not be mentioned. Mr. DODGE desired that the firm of which he is a member might be put down for five thousand dollars; Mr. JOHNSTON, the Secretary of the meeting, offered twenty-five hundred; Capt. MARSHALL, two thousand; BABCOCK BROTHERS, two thousand; six other individuals or firms gave a thousand dollars each; and several sums nearly as large were offered from other donors -the names of all of whom will be found in our report of the meeting. The amount collected in a few minutes -- independent of the offer of the ship and the thousand barrels of flour -- reached $26,200.

Some of these, in respect to the best means of raising Money for the prosecution of the War, and looking to the establishment of a system of voluntary banking under Federal authority, are mere repetitions of his previous Annual Report. He adds, to be sure, to his banking scheme the suggestion of making all local or State Banks which consent to a registered circulation on the pledge of United States stocks at the Department in Washington, Banks of deposit for the Treasury. In doing this he would not repeal the Sub-Treasury system, but simply hold out an inducement for banking under National authority, by the employment of the National stocks as the basis of security. A privilege to this tenor was voted by the present Congress as early as the 5th of August. 1861, before the suspension of specie payments; but, after due consideration. Mr. CHASE declined to avail himself of this clause in the supplemental Loan act of that date, beyond leaving with the Banks the avails of his loans made, in gross, for a short time, and then transferring them in specie to the Sub-Treasury. He never checked to the public creditors or the disbursing officers of the Government directly upon the Banks, and as the provision on the subject was left to his choice or discretion, it was never made part of the machinery of the Treasury. The provision now stands virtually repealed by the suspension of payments in specie.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/70bb0765-bba4-5dfe-87d0-e00f4d5e51fb,989,nyt://article/70bb0765-bba4-5dfe-87d0-e00f4d5e51fb

BANKS set sail on Thursday, on his long talked of Southern expedition. He takes with him, so it is said, some 20,000 soldiers, more or less, with subsistence stores and war munitions of the lighter kind; but no horses or heavy artillery. Gen. BANKS was about five weeks in New-York, fitting out his expedition. He met with innumerable and unexpected delays; and the interest in his movement, which was very lively when he reached here, almost died out before he got away. The General worked with patient and indefatigable zeal in his enterprise, carefully avoiding all public displays, and keeping the secret of his destination with modest and masterly silence. He has been rewarded with final success in his tedious preparations, and is now, with his prow turned Southward, buffeting the waves of an inhospitable coast, to meet at length, perhaps, when his haven is reached, a more inhospitable reception.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Expedition of Gen.

SYLVESTER ARMSTRONG, of Plainfield, for an alleged misdemeanor in being concerned in a disturbance which took place last Summer between the Union men of New Providence and a nest of Secessionists that infest that neighborhood. The Union men had called a meeting to respond to the President's last call for 300,000 men. This meeting the Secessionists determined to break up, and accordingly called another meeting at the same sime, and in the immediate neighborhood of the Union meeting. So violent was the conduct of the ""secesh"" that the Union men finally became indignant, and taking Mr. ARMSTRONG on their shoulders, carried him to the platform from which CHAUNCEY C. BURR, a notorious Secessionist, was holding forth, from whence he proceeded to deliver a strong Union speech. So atrocious were some of the sentiments uttered during the [???] that a Col. CROMWELL, of Gen. GRANT'S army, who was present, mounted the platform, and drawing a revolver, solemnly declared that he would shoot the first man who should repeat such language, adding that he was paid by the United States to shout rebels. The affair created considerable excitement at the time, and the men whose disloyal schemes were thwarted vowed revenge. This they now imagine they have secured, in the indictment of Mr. ARMSTRONG, through a jury which it is stated was packed by the Sheriff of Union County, who is a well-known sympathizer will their views. It is hardly probable they will venture to press the matter to a trial, than which the Union men could desire nothing better. The same Grand Jury indicted for the so-called [???] Col. CROMWELL, who, however, having left but a few days since for Luka, will not, it is probable, be much disturbed [???].

FLOYD, commanding the militia of Camden County, informing me that on the 4th day of this month three companies of negroes were landed in St. Mary's, who, after insulting the few ladies remaining there, and taking everything they could lay their hands upon, retired to their gunboats without the slightest molestation. On the same day all the salt-works in the county were destroyed except two, which by this time have capacity to turn out twenty-five or thirty bushels per day. Unless protection is afforded these must soon share the same fate. The people on the coast possess large numbers of cattle, hogs and other stock. The enemy leave their gunboats, kill and carry off stock without opposition. The Colonel asks for an order to call out the militia for three or six months, and says he can muster about thirty to forty. Adjoining counties upon the coast could add to the number enough to make a considerable force, who are well acquainted with all the localities, and could on that account act more effectively against the enemy than the like number of men taken from any other part of the State.

About daylight the Royal Mail Steamship Company's Steamship Avon, lying at the Middle Wharf, tore down part of the wharf, dragged her anchors, parted her hawsers, and went on shore. About the same time, the British brig Bolivar, lying at the same wharf, parted her moorings and struck the beach. Neither of them could be got off. The Avon took in a million of dollars in specie the evening previous, but it had all been recovered after the gale abated. The United States brig Bainbridge dragged her anchors to within a few fathoms of the reef. Her guns, spars, stores, &c., were all thrown overboard, and on Sunday her officers and crew abandoned her; but as she still held on, they took possession of her again on Tuesday. Other vessels were also seriously damaged. The gale was accompanied by very heavy rain. which caused the waters in the interior to rise so as to overflow the railroad track at different places for miles; at some points it was ten feet above the track.

""In his profession he acquired not the slightest distinction, but was known by the soubriquet of Picayune BUTLER"" -- a nickname which, the Courrier neatly translates by the phrase ""that worth-a-sous BUTLER."" The epithet, says M. XAVIER EYMA, the accomplished writer of the biography in the Courrier, originated in this way: ""Mr. BUTLER had made himself the redresser of grievances of workmen against their masters, suggesting grievances where none existed. For this 'assistance' the working men clubbed together, and paid him a certain weekly sum, a picayune salary -- a revenue of centimes as we would say on this (French) side of the Atlantic."" Than which statement of our able and astute Gallic cotemporary, it would be impossible to find anything more rigidly exact and truthful.

The deceased was a messenger, employed by the Commissioners of Charities and Correction, and on Friday last he was arrested upon the charge of embezzling letters, which he had been sent to deposit in the Post-office. Mr. GOULD was a man of considerable ability. In the Mexican War he lost an arm, and subsequently became considerably reduced in circumstances. Soon after coming to this City he applied to the Commissioners of Charities and Correction for aid, whereupon he was admitted to the Almshouse. Here, by his diligence and honesty, he soon gained the confidence of the officials, and they appointed him a messenger, which position be held for a number of years. Among his other duties, was that of taking letters to and from the Post-office. On Thursday last he was suspected of having retained letters committed to his care, and Officer GILMORE took him into custody. On Friday he had an examination, and was on the same day sent to the Tombs by the United States authorities. While on his way thither, in charge of a Deputy Marshal, he was imprudently allowed to enter a drug-store. Upon his arrival at the Tombs, Mr. SUTTON, the Warden of the prison, at the request of the prisoner put him into a cell alone, not suspecting that the latter intended to make any attempt to take hiss own life. Yesterday morning however, when an officer came to his cell, ho was found in a State of stupor. An examination showed that he was poisoned, and was sinking [???]. Upon his person were found a few small articles, and about half an ounce of gum opium. The poison was procured at a drug store in Pearl-street, on the pretence that it was necessary to deaden the pain in the stump of his amputated arm. GOULD died at about 11 o'clock, despite all the efforts used to counteract the effects of the deadly narcotic. Remorse and shame at the situation in which he found himself, after all the kindness which the Commissioners had extended to him, are the only reasons which can be given for the commission of the suicide. Dr. [???] made a post mortem examination of the body last evening, and found traces of the poisonous drug in the stomach. Coroner WILDEY will hold an inquest upon the body to-day.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c94f3273-f820-5376-83e1-19b1005e2f4d,1193,nyt://article/c94f3273-f820-5376-83e1-19b1005e2f4d

No less than one hundred and twenty persons, it is alleged, mostly Italians, had banded themselves together to take their stations along a new Boulevard about to be opened by the Emperor, and assail him with bombs, one after the other, as he passed, until he should certainly be slain. The story was narrated by our Paris correspondent yesterday, and is also given with entire positiveness in the Paris correspondence of the London Star, while a similar report in certain German States has created no little uneasiness among the bankers and stock operators. The plot, according to our Paris correspondent, was frustrated by its being revealed to the French Government by an American Captain. The opening of the Boulevard, for which the Emperor had made the grandest preparations, was postponed; the conspirators were placed under arrest, and the life of the Third NAPOLEON is once more, at least temporarily, safe. It is a matter of prime necessity with despots to keep from the people all knowledge of such affairs.

RICH, who claimed to be a Captain in the Confederate Army, and desired a pass into the land of secessia. The gentleman wore an overcoat which the Admiral, without saying ""by your leave, Sir,"" unbottoned, and displayed to the Marshal's gaze the uniform of a Confederate Captain as the best proof, in the absence of his commission, of the genuineness of his friend's claim. Admiral GREGORY then went on to state that he found himself unwittingly placed in a very unpleasant and delicate position with regard to Capt. RICH, and he thought his duty to the Government demanded that he should lay the case before the U.S. Marshal, and leave him to deal with it as he should think best, or as he might be instructed by the Government. The facts were these: At the breaking out of the rebellion, Capt. RICH was a Captain of Marines in the United States Navy and was stationed on board the 74 gun ship Pennsylvania at the Gosport Navy Yard, Norfolk, Va. He had for several years previous to that been an intimate friend of Admiral Gregory who, when he was stationed on the coast of Africa, appointed him one of his staff officers. Among the many resignations of officers in the United States Navy, at the commencement of the rebellion, he did not recollect of seeing Capt. Rich's name, but the Captain now informed him that his resignation was tendered in due form, but had probably been burnt up with the Pennsylvania which was soon after destroyed by the rebels at the time of the burning of the Gosport Navy Yard. The Admiral said he had never been able to ascertain what had become of his friend, Capt. Rich, and had supposed him long since dead, until about two months ago. when to his surprise, the Captain called upon him here in New-York and stated that he was a Captain in the Confederate Army, had been taken prisoner at the battle of Antietam, carried to Fortress Monroe to be exchanged, and that while there he received a letter from his father, who is a farmer in New Hampshire, informing him that his mother lay at the point of death, and imploring him, her only son, to hasten home that she might look upon his face once again ere she passed into eternity. On representing these facts to the government officers at Fortress Monroe, he was permitted to come North on his parole, and was then on his way to New Hampshire.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A SECESH CAPTAIN IN DURESS.; A Doubtful Customer.

His speech, some four months afterwards, when on his mission from the Confederate Congress for war-funds, though more subdued in some respects, yet abounded with confidence. He declared that ""cotton is the tremendous lever by which we can work out our destiny under Providence,"" and vouched that ""one thing is certain -- in some way or other the blockade will be obliged to be raised, or there will be revolution in Europe.""

A memorial from Gov. MORTON, of Indiana, praying for an increase of soldiers' pay, was referred to the Military Committee. Mr. HALE gave notice of a bill to abolish the grade of medical officers in the navy. A resolution making inquiries regarding the number and ranks of Aid-de-Camps, was adopted. The Secretary of War was instructed to report to the Senate the number of Major and Brigadier-Generals now in the service. The Military Committee was instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the more effectual suppression of the rebellion, and securing tranquillity in the State of Maryland. The call upon the Secretary of War for the correspondence relating to the Army of the Potomac was extended so as to embrace all its operations. The resolution relating to the arrest of certain citizens of Delaware, was called up and debated, but not disposed of. The Bankrupt act was taken up as the special order, but was informally laid aside. Mr. DAVIS, of Kentucky, offered a joint resolution proposing certain amendments to the Constitution, to alter the mode of electing the President and Vice-President. It was ordered to be printed. The Bankrupt bill was then again taken up, and made the special order for Thursday, the 18th inst.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/10/archives/the-situation-in-mississippi.html,,"From the Cincinnati Gazette, Dec. 8. We have full confirmation this morning of the evacuation of Grenada, Miss., by the rebels. A private dispatch from one of our correspondents states that Gen. GRANT's army had concentrated at that place. The expedition from Helena commanded by Gens. Hovey and C. C. WASHBURN, had succeeded in cutting the Mississippi Central Railroad south of Grenada, and subsequently advanced upon and took possession of the latter place. The rebels, unable to move the rolling stock, destroyed the cars and locomotives. There are no positive advices as to the position of the rebels, but we are left to infer that they retreated to Columbus, Miss., southeast from Grenada, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. From this point they still have railroad communication, via Meridian and Jackson, with Vicksburgh; or they can get around to East Tennessee and join BRAGG. It has been intimated heretofore that the rebel armies, if they should find themselves unable to operate separately, with the prospect of success, would abandon either the Mississippi line or East Tennessee, and unite against ROSECRANS and GRANT. Their failure to offer resistance to GRANT so far would indicate that there has been no junction in Mississippi, as it would also that PEMBERTON is not strong enough to meet GRANT. However, it is impossible to tell, from the course that has been adopted by the enemy, what the rebel plan is. If PEMBERTON has gone to Columbus, GRANT must follow him, for a rebel army cannot be allowed to remain there, with our army even at Grenada. From Columbus they could, if not pressed, easily pounce upon Corinth. Gen. GRANT, in order to protect his communications, must, as he moves south, drive the rebels before him. The situation in Mississippi is getting more and more interesting. The gunboat fleet will now soon be heard from.

BROWN, who is charged with procuring an abortion upon CLEMENTINA ANDERSON, and thereby causing her death, has brought up the proceedings at the Coroner's inquest before Judge McCUNN on a writ of certiorari, for the purpose of cross-examining the witnesses, who testified on that occasion, and effecting if possible, the release of his client, or his admission to bail. The first cross-examination was held at Judge MCCUNN's office on Saturday last, on which occasion AUGUSTUS L. SIMMS, who was the principal witness against Dr. BROWN at the inquest, was subjected to a long cross-examination, mainly with reference to his intercourse with Miss ANDERSON previous to her going to the Doctor's. The evidence of SIMMS was mostly unfit for publication, and had little pertinency to the charge against Dr. BROWN, although it developed a depth of villainy and heartlessness on the part of the witness which is rarely equaled. The examination was resumed yesterday at Judge MCCUNN's office, when SIMMS was again put upon the stand, and his cross-examination continued. His testimony, yesterday referred principally to his interviews with the father and other relatives of Miss ANDERSON, during her last absence from home, and did not differ in any material point from his evidence before the Coroner, all of which has been already published in the TIMES. In answer to a question, whether he considered his conduct at these interviews, in deceiving Mr. ANDERSON with regard to his daughter's whereabouts, honest and honorable on his part, he replied that he did not know as it was honorable, but it was done at her request. To a question whether, during the last three years, he had seduced a girl in this City who worked on a sewing-machine, he gave an emphatic ""No."" He was then asked whether he had had any difficulty with such a girl, to which he replied that he did not know what that had to do with this case. On being instructed by the Judge to answer the question, he said, ""No, it is not worth talking about."" The examination was here adjourned to 3 o'clock this afternoon.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Eighth-avenue Abortion Case.; PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION BEFORE JUDGE M'CUNN."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Eighth-avenue Abortion Case.; PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION BEFORE JUDGE M'CUNN."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b3fdd8d0-0168-50c6-b0a4-9efa51fd79fc,357,nyt://article/b3fdd8d0-0168-50c6-b0a4-9efa51fd79fc

She soon returned, and upon opening the door the oldest child (MARY ANN) ran screaming toward her, her clothes then being on fire. The other child (ELLON) sat on the floor, and the almost frantic mother soon discovered that her dress also was in a blaze. The flames were soon extinguished, but the little ones were so fearfully burned that they died in a few hours afterward. In her examination before Coroner COLLIN, Mrs. MCCLAIR testified that on going from the house she left a pot of soup on the fire, and in her opinion the clothes of the eldest child caught fire while she was stirring the soup. There being no help at hand the child, in her frenzied state of mind, ran to her younger sister, whose clothes she set on fire. This is the only explanation Mrs. MCCLAIR could give relative to the fatal burning of her children. The screams of the victims after their clothes took fire, were heard by others in the house, and an effort was made to enter the room to learn the cause, but the door was locked, and so remained till the mother returned.

The increase in the price of nearly every thing which the great mass of the community have to buy is attributed in a very large degree, whether justly or not, to the inflation of the currency caused by the issue of United States notes, which are made a legal tender, -- and the extent of this increase in prices, or what is the same thing, this depreciation in the Government currency, is tested by the premium on gold. At present it is measured bysaying that gold is worth 132 1/2 per cent., when judged by the standard of United States legal-tender notes. The universal hope is that this upward tendency in prices will be checked. Persons who rely upon salaries or fixed incomes, find the existing state of things especially burdensome, inasmuch as the money they receive is worth nearly one-third less than it was when specie was the standard of value. Naturally enough, therefore, the whole community is anxious to know whether the Government intends to increase the evil, by still further issues of paper money, or to check it by returning, as rapidly as the necessities of the Government will permit, to a specie basis.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Currency--Gold and United States Notes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Currency--Gold and United States Notes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Currency', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/315aee6c-2345-5171-91c4-fd8fb98320f1,1030,nyt://article/315aee6c-2345-5171-91c4-fd8fb98320f1

They are both strong, unconditional Unionists. The Delta says that Mr. FLANDERS is a native of New-Hampshire, but has resided in New-Orleans for thirty years. He was among the first to welcome Gen. BUTLER upon his arrival in May last, and is for the Union at any cost. His chief opponent was Mr. BOULIGNY, the staunch Unionist from the same district in last Congress, who received, however, only 136 votes, against 2,184 for Mr. FLANDERS. The other successful candidate, Mr. HAHN, is a lawyer by profession, of German descent, who has lived in New-Orleans since boyhood, and was a stout Unionist through the darkest hours of secession madness.

Yesterday morning the movement for crossing the Rappahannock commenced, and last night the city of Fredericksburgh was in possession of our forces, with comparatively trifling loss.

One hundred and forty-three pieces of our artillery then opened upon the city, and the fire was responded to by the rebels, but without much damage. The city was set on fire in several places by our shells. The attempt was then again made to finish the bridges, when the enemy's sharpshooters again opened, and compelled a retreat. Finally, volunteers to cross the river in small boats to dislodge the enemy were called for, and sprang out of the ranks by thousands. Only a hundred, however, were selected, who crossed the river in the most dashing style, drove out the Sharpshooters at the point of the bayonet, and captured a large number of them, who were brought over the river and secured. The bridges were then completed, and the city was immediately occupied by our forces, the rebels being driven back to their defensive works, Meantime Gen. FRANKLIN was also engaged in the construction of bridges about three miles below the city, in which work he met with but little opposition. He did not cross, however, until he heard that the city was in our possession. The gunboats were also engaged in shelling the enemy about fifteen miles below, where they had collected in considerable force.

The telegraphic details of the work of yesterday are few and brief, but they exhibit fine maneuvering, splendid bravery, and, so far as the first ahd most difficult operation was concerned, success. The previous night had been all bustle and activity among the troops, for it was fixed that they should cross the Rappahannock, in the face of the foe, in the morning. Before the dawn of day, the pontoons were at the river side, a hundred and forty-three pieces of artillery gaped toward the city, and the whole army, musket in hand, was prepared to rush over as soon the bridges were built. At five, the construction of bridges began, and shortly afterward the enemy opened a murderous fire upon the engineers from the houses of the town. At six, BURNSIDE ordered all the artillery to be opened upon the place, and at seven the heavy guns of the enemy replied to ours. The fire continued for two or three hours, and our engineers were driven from the bridges. Another attempt was at once made, and the rebel infantry, aided by artillery, again opened on our men. Between one and three o'clock, the fire slackened, and all our batteries were once more placed in position, numbering now 176 guns. At a given signal, they again opened, but the rebel sharpshooters could not be driven from their hiding-places, and the bridges could not be constructed till they were driven away. Volunteers were now called for to cross the river in small boats and storm the enemy's position. Hundreds of gallant men at once stepped forward as a forlorn hope, and a hundred of them were chosen. Under cover of artillery they crossed. With fixed bayonets they rushed upon the enemy, and took a hundred and one of them prisoners. At half-past two the bridges were completed and our troops swept across to the south bank of the Rappahannock.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Operations Begun.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Operations Begun.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d37e378a-0991-5cce-bb73-4cfb4e002979,461,nyt://article/d37e378a-0991-5cce-bb73-4cfb4e002979

It was recalled to mind how news had been withheld from the public after every disaster our army has suffered during the war -- how the people had been treated as fools and babies who could not endure at first the full exhibit of disagreeable facts, and how, after equivocations, denials, contradictions, absurdities and falsities of all sorts we had frequently finally been led into the secret that our army had had a deadly battle with the rebels. The statements made in authorized dispatches of Thursday night, that a battle must open in the morning, were also noted, and one Washington telegram that came in the Philadelphia papers announced positively that fighting would be resumed in the morning, and even stated that our army would be ready to engage the enemy by eight o'clock! The assertion that we could get no news because the telegraph was so busily engaged in bearing dispatches to the Government, was unsatisfactory, as every one knew that in the twinkling of an eye it could convey the half-dozen magic words that would be necessary to give the public assurance. There were rumors that FRANKLIN's Corps, being isolated three miles down the river, had been fallen upon by the rebel right wing, which was known to be very strong, and cut to pieces; and the assertion in the Washington telegram to Philadelphia, that these stories ""were all false,"" went far to make them believed by a large portion of the public. There were hundreds of other uncheerful rumors created out of nothing and nursed into monstrous magnitude in the darkness and silence of Press and telegraph, but it is not worth while to prolong their existence by giving them print.

J W Greene statement on his role in alleged attempt by Davis to negotiate peace with Lincoln,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/13/archives/the-peace-proposals-statement-of-j-wesley-greene-concerning-an.html,J W Greene statement on his role in alleged attempt by Davis to negotiate peace with Lincoln,"On Wednesday morning, Oct. 22, 1862, while engaged at my employment as an ornamental japanner, in the shop of Mr. JOHN DUNLAP, dealer in tinplate, sheet iron, brass, copper, c., and manufacturer of japanned tin-ware, , southwest corner of Market and Second streets, Pittsburgh, Penn., I was called upon by a gentleman who said he was a Baltimorean, and, having learned that my wife was from the same city, and I myself somewhat acquainted there, he took the liberty to call upon me for the purpose of spending a half or three-quarters of an hour in friendly chat. I expressed the pleasure it would afford me. As the subject of the war was, as it now is, the chief theme of conversation, ours very naturally turned upon it, and very soon glided into matters connected with the Mexican war. By some apparently casual remark I was led to speak of service rendered by myself in that war, and of my having there made the acquaintance of Mr. DAVIS, now President of the Confederate States. My visitor very soon made himself aware of the fact, that, while politically I was opposed to Mr. DAVIS, personally I was friendly. He then stated that he had been recently in Richmond, and had seen and conversed with Mr. DAVIS, who mentioned me to him; and he desired to know if be might talk confidentially with me as a messenger from Mr. DAVIS. I replied that that would depend upon the nature of the communications he had to make. If he desired to enlist me in the service of the Confederate States, in any capacity, he had better not say anything; but, if such was not his desire, he might speak freely. He then distinctly stated that he had no written communication to me from Mr. DAVIS -- he not deeming it prudent to be the bearer of such a thing; but that Mr. DAVIS greatly desired I should go to him at Richmond, immediately. At such a request I was surprised and amazed. I inquired, what for? My visitor asserted he did not know, and persisted in the assertion. I asked him who he was, when he gave his name as HORACE N. WILSON, formerly connected with the Detective Police in Baltimore, but now a resident of Richmond. I greatly feared, on hearing this announcement, that some trap was being laid for me, or some trick about to be played, which might place me in an equivocal or embarrassing position. But I soon became reassured, as the consciousness was aroused within me of having never, by word or act, occupied for a moment a false or disloyal position toward the Federal Government, or of having performed any act which the Confederate Government might have deemed of sufficient importance to revenge. I was unprepared for an answer then, and so said to Mr. WILSON. I told him he might call again in the afternoon, and that he might rely upon my secrecy. He went away, and on his returning, about the middle of the afternoon, I questioned him closely as to his knowledge of Mr. DAVIS' object in sending such a strange request, compliance with which would be attended with so much peril. All knowledge of the object he denied, as before; but scouted the idea of peril, if by that I meant risk of personal safety. I told him it was that; when he undertook to convince me I need have no fears. He then intimated that it might be productive of good to the whole country, though in what way he professed not to know; and finally wound up by saying that, if I hesitated through fear, he thought Mr. DAVIS was mistaken in the estimate he put upon my promptitude and bravery. He said Mr. DAVIS had spoken to him of the deliberate coolness and dauntless courage which I manifested in Mexico. These complimentary remarks, artfully thrown in just as I was feeling the sting of the former ones, decided my mind. I resolved to accompany him and run the risk. On the ensuing morning, I started with him for Richmond, by way of Wheeling, Staunton and Charlottesville. We arrived in Richmond on Sunday morning, the 26th; and after putting myself in order, and eating breakfast, I was conducted to Mr. DAVIS' presence.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PEACE PROPOSALS.; Statement of J.

Soon gaining MURRAY's confidence, the latter displayed his stock of card photographic pictures and stereoscopic [???] some of which were of the most obscene and infamous character. This exhibition was sufficient, and at a given signal from the pretended purchaser, in rushed Detectives ELDER, McCORD and RADFORD, and not only arrested MURRAY, But seized his contraband goods.

It was one of the absolute necessities of the War, besides being the proper and timely exercise of the National power to regulate Commerce and the Currency. The Act, of course, practically converted the Gold and Silver in circulation, previous to the Bank suspension, into mere articles of traffic or merchandise. They were no longer required in the settlement of ordinary domestic debts. Congress, however, very wisely pledged the public faith to the continued payment of Gold for the semi-annually accruing interest on the Public Debt of the United States, of all classes and descriptions. The amounts necessary to meet this important requisition, were levied upon the Foreign Import trade, by stipulating that all Customs Duties must be paid in Gold after the issue of United States Notes of July 17, 1861, which bear upon their face a recievability for all public dues, is exhausted. This period is now very near at hand. The subsequent receipts in Gold, exclusively from Customs, will greatly exceed the Public Interest accruing after February next. Already the Treasury has negotiated, without trouble, for a loan of Gold to pay the January interest, something less than $4,000,000, in anticipation of the Spring revenues from the Custom-house, and after the reimbursement of this loan, there will be no question of the ability of the Customs Duties to bear the Interest charge upon the entire. Public Debt, taxing the extreme total to which it is estimated by the Secretary it may reach, if the war be continued for the ensuing year and a half. The mercantile demand for Gold for this object, after it sets in, will be both gradual in its nature and comparatively moderate in amount. And the whole will at once return to the market through the periodical disbursements on the Public Interest, these being well distributed at present through nearly the entire twelve months.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'United States Notes and Gold.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'United States Notes and Gold.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Currency', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/635a4c2a-1f85-5c8d-9f89-b8d6b9a12093,1135,nyt://article/635a4c2a-1f85-5c8d-9f89-b8d6b9a12093

"speaks, Boston, on Emancipation Proclamation; Phillips again speaks on war, Boston",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/14/archives/a-lecture-by-wendell-phillips-the-presidents-proclamation-and.html,"speaks, Boston, on Emancipation Proclamation; Phillips again speaks on war, Boston","The tenth lecture of the Fraternity Course was delivered last evening before a large audience by WENDELL PHILLIPS. The lecturer was received with applause, and said that although be had spoken quite often, recently, on the although of the rebellion, he should not apologize for taking the same topic for this lecture, since he had never found audiences either this winter or last, who had listened cheerfully to any other subject. He would occupy the time in speaking of the proclamation and the message of the President. The message belonged to the past, the proclamation to the present and future; the message was a word, the proclamation a blow; the message was a bugle to summon the camp to surrender, the proclamation a mine whose explosion would scatter the camp into the air, and carry death and confusion to our enemies; the message was like the address of our fathers to the tyrants of Great Britain in 1774, the proclamation was the Declaration of Independence on the fourth of July. 1776. [Applause.] The dictates of history would accord to ABRAHAM LINCOLN honor or affix a stigma to his name, but when his acts were done the people would experience their practical results in the same proportion with him. The future and the prosperity of the nation was ours as well as his. No public officer could complain that his acts were criticised. ""Paint me as I am. with every seam and every wrinkle,"" said CROMWELL to Sir CHRISTOPHER NEELY, ""or you get not a penny from me."" So we had a right to scrutinize every action in the rebellion, and no man had a right to complain if his conduct was looked into or his services refused. One great weakness overhung our great national effort. It was concession, compromise, conciliation. In '87 our fathers made compromise to a wicked and unjust institution, but this was no reason why it should hold its own now. Loaded dice never gained a fortune in spite of me skill of the gambler. The Southerner found that although the Constitution was on his side, he had no chance in the right against free speech and free labor. He demanded something beyond, and he received it. The North had never begun any resistance until the 22d of September, 1862. As an instance of the feeling which once existed in Massachusetts, he spoke of SAMUEL DEXTER, who had offered in the House of Representatives an amendment to the hill of Mr. JACKSON, of Georgia, that no person should be admitted, us a citizen of the United States until he had renounced all patents of nobility, a clause that no man should be admitted who owned slaves. For this he was defeated in this State at the next election. Men had fought with their hands tied by the well-understood agreement that Slavery was not to be interfered with, but liberty must take its chance. CALHUON came into the Senate and WEBSTER replied to him with his feet tied by compromises to the Constitution, and his hands fettered by the interests of State-street. The lecturer then went on to speak of further points in the history of Slavery. He then declared his intention or speaking of President LINCOLN, although his purpose, he said, was not to blame him. It was as well to remember the saying of HORACE MANN that the difficulties which reformers had to meet, was that God could wait and men could not, and also the fine words of VICTOR EMANUEL, that it was wiser and braver to wait at the fitting time than to dare. The excuse, the palliation, the justification which lie under these maxims belongs to the President. We must be governed by the old proverb, ""never praise the day till evening."" It might be asked how could ABRAHAM LINCOLN succeed when he was chosen President of the United States by a party who were half-Southern in their feelings. No other man wholly national could have been chosen. Unless the Republicans had yielded half way to the convictions of the South, they never could have carried the election. Mr. PHILLIPS here left Mr. LINCOLN, and proceeded to speak of the reason why foreign minds had been prejudiced against us. It was our own fault, and was owing to the lenient view which we had all along taken of Slavery, and was the result of the conversation of Americans who bad been abroad. He then drew illustrations at some length from the history of other countries, and said that what the STUARTS had been to England, centralization to France, the power of the Church in Spain, and division in Italy, Slavery was to our country. He alluded to the conduct of the Republicans in office, which he considered weak and unsatisfactory. They had not been able to rise to the exigencies of the crisis, and in playing debate had lost sight of the death-struggle of the nation. He urged the emancipation of slaves as a war measure. He did not care to talk of the capture of Richmond. Taking Richmond was not like taking Washington. He did not take much stock in the the ""on the Richmond"" cry. The rebels had an itinerant capital, which they moved at their pleasure from Richmond to Montgomery. Let us set free the two millions slaves, he said. Let us take out the keystone of the Southern arch by raising an army of colored men. The speaker then returned to Mr. LINCOLN, who, he said, was afraid to strike the blow which every boy in Massachusetts would tell him was right. The President was bred in Kentucky, and and had come covered with Kentucky cobwebs, and with his boots clogged with Kentucky soil, which would be known everywhere, whether it traveled to Chicago or to the White House. Around him, too, were group counselors, every one of whom with one exception, avowed himself in favor of conciliating and submission. Let us make a nation of ourselves -- a separation of fifty or a hundred years was better than the Union with even Delaware for a Slave State. Not even a single bitter bondman should poison the air of America. [Applause.] He continued at some length with his animadversions upon the Cabinet, and was particularly bitter against Mr. SEWARD. He would not say that Mr. SEWARD was not honest, although the honesty of a statesman was among the undefined and inexplicable mysteries in which SOUTHEY had classed woman's idea of manly beauty. He would ask, however, if a respectable and wealthy house in this city should place a half idiot at the head of the firm, how long would they probably stand? He hoped Congress would strengthen the President in his resolution. Let them ask him if he had not a proclamation somewhere in his desk which declared that on the 1st of January, 1863, every man should be free. Let then make him swear to stand by that, and then let them agree to follow it up themselves. Let them demand of the President not merely to sound the bugle, but to lead the hosts.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A Lecture by Wendell Phillips.; THE PRESIDENT'S PROCLAMATION AND MESSAGE.

Dr. BROWN was present, but appeared to take little interest in the proceeding. The examination was conducted by Mr. H.L. CLINTON, counsel for Dr. BROWN, and was confined to the medical men who attended the post-mortem examination and testified at the Coroner's inquest. The object appeared to be to show that the death of Miss ANDERSON was not necessarily caused by an abortion, or indeed that there was any positive evidence that an abortion had been procured. The first witness was Dr. THOS. C. FINNELL, who made the second post-mortem examination, and who gave his evidence in a remarkably clear, prompt and intelligent manner. The details are not proper for publication, but the substance of his testimony was that the post-mortem developed evidences of an abortion having been produced, in the altered condition of the womb, the intense congestion of the parts, and the abscesses that had formed as a result of the inflammation. The immediate cause of death, he said, was pymenia, or poisoning of the blood, resulting from the abscesses which were superinduced by the inflammation. The fact that the deceased had been pregnant was also shown by the enlarged breasts, the areola, and the enlarged glands upon its surface. He described a large number of instruments which were shown to him at the Station-house, as belonging to Dr. BROWN, most of which he said were not such as are ordinarily used by physicians and surgeons in their regular and legitimate practice. The post-mortem was conducted in the presence of Drs. Ranney, Tucke, Connolly, Galen Lieutenant [???].",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Eighth-avenue Abortion Case.

If he continues to reiterate this statement long enough, there is hardly a doubt, that some of the twenty thousand men and officers who are now said to be absent without leave, will finally get indoctrinated with the notion that quitting the army without the knowledge of their superiors is an objectionable practice. But that his weekly denunciation of it through the newspapers will put a stop to it, there is not the least probability. He has as yet given no indication of any intention of punishing it in any way beyond striking the names of offenders amongst the officers from the army list. Upon the officers this will doubtless produce some effect. Some of the absentees will be stimulated by it into joining their regiments, and some who intended to become absentees whenever the opportunity offered, will be deterred by it into resigning themselves to the performance of their duty. But that the country will gain by the infliction of this penalty we greatly doubt. Any officer who needs to be threatened in this manner in order to keep him at his post, is, in nine cases out of ten, unfit for it, and would benefit the service by quitting it. If he has so little zeal and so little pride, and so little love of the work and of the cause, that nothing but the fear of losing his commission prevents him from abandoning his regiment, the regiment is sure to be better without him; and any order which simply calls him back, after a month or two or three of disgraceful shirking, and puts him in his old place with credit unimpaired, reputation untarnished and pay untouched, is an injury both to the army and the country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Evil of Desertion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Evil of Desertion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e872eac-51e1-571a-bae3-aad2b0d3c9f5,1176,nyt://article/3e872eac-51e1-571a-bae3-aad2b0d3c9f5

The morning opened with a dense fog, in the midst of which Gen. REYNOLDS' corps, on the left, advanced, and at 9 1/4 o'clock engaged the enemy's infantry. Seven minutes afterward the rebels opened a heavy fire of artillery, which was responded to by our batteries' though the firing was necessarily much at random, owing to the fog. This, however, soon afterward cleared away, and an unobstructed view of the rebel position could be had. It was determined that the first ridge of hills occupied by the enemy's works must be carried by assault, and this duty was assigned to Gen. FRENCH's Division, supported by Gen. HOWARD's. At ten minutes before noon our troops advanced to the works, but when within musket range, were met with such a terrible fire of musketry that they were forced to fall back. Reinforced, they again essayed the task, but were again driven back by the terrible fire of artillery and musketry now concentrated upon them. The firing was then continued at longer range until after dark, no other attempt being made to storm. On the left, where the attack was commanded by Gen. FRANKLIN, our troops were more successful. After a hard day's fight the Rebels were driven back about a mile, with heavy losses. At one time the enemy advanced to attack, but were handsomely repulsed, with the loss of between four and five hundred prisoners. Our troops slept at night where they fought during the day. Our losses were severe, including Gens. JACKSON and BAYARD of Pennsylvania, killed, and Gens. VINTON, GIBBONS, KIMBALL and CALDWELL, wounded, besides numerous line-officers killed and wounded. Yesterday there was no fog. At daylight there was a heavy fire of artillery and infantry in front of the first line of works, and also in front of Gen. FRANKLIN's Division, down the river, but it slackened in about an hour, and continued only at intervals until noon; and the indications were that no decisive battle would be fought on that day, unless the rebels should bring on the engagement. During the night and forenoon they considerably extended their works, and strengthened their position. Our wounded were all removed from the field and cared for, but the dead who fell near the enemy's works, still remain upon the field, the rebels firing upon all who attempted their removal during the night.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/86d71344-7630-506a-bd7b-cf37c51e4e1b,1168,nyt://article/86d71344-7630-506a-bd7b-cf37c51e4e1b

The Judiciary Committee was instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing that any loyal citizen who has sustained damage from the troops of the States engaged in the rebellion, may set off such damages against any claim or demand against him in any action at law by any such rebellious States, or the agents or trustees of such States, etc. The resolution relative to the arrest of certain citizens of Delaware, was then debated until the adjournment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONGRESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONGRESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e800a78-3d16-5a3c-b635-c9369949d499,570,nyt://article/5e800a78-3d16-5a3c-b635-c9369949d499

From the day of Gen. BUTLER's capture of that rebel city, the Count found his position extremely disagreeable. Many things that he had previously been in the habit of doing -- such as manifesting his intense sympathy with the rebellion -- he found no longer practicable. If it had only been no longer politic, he could have got along with the difficulty. But Gen. BUTLER was a rude and vulgar man, who regarded treason as a mortal State offence, who held the robbery of mints and arsenals of the Government to be a terrible crime, and who consequently had not the slightest consideration for the more refined and educated principles of Count MEJAN, who, while deriving the right to exercise his office from the American Government, thought it not amiss to encourage and aid the traitors who were aiming to destroy it. Gen. BUTLER would not allow this. Hence the Count was mad. Nay, more, he was vexed -- indeed angry -- and resolved to have Gen. Butler removed! It was a big contract -- as well as a modest one -- but the Count thought himself equal to it, as a letter of his, written on the 30th of May last to M.

Could it be that there was a hitch somewhere in the carrying out of the plan of operations? Could it be that there was no such plan as the grand one of which we had had intimations, and which had furnished a theme for public eulogy for some days? Could it be that BURNSIDE had learned from his so-called reconnoissance that the enemy's works were too strong to be carried by assault? Was it possible that the accounts we had had by telegraph of Saturday's battle were grossly false, and that our army had suffered a disastrous repulse on that day, instead of meeting with the hopeful degree of success which had encouraged the public.

This is equivalent to declaring that black men map be citizens of the United States, and that the dicta to the contrary in the Dred Scott case are incorrect. We say the dicta and not the decision itself. The majority of the Court never decided that colored men cannot be citizens. What they decided was, that the record showed a disability on the part of DRED SCOTT to maintain the suit, because he was no citizen -- nobody but a citizen being allowed to sue in a United States Court. Only three of them, TANEY, WAYNE and DANIEL, held that he was not a citizen for the reason that he was a blackman. The other members of the majority forebore to touch this point, and confined themselves to the argument that SCOTT was no citizen, because the record showed him a slave. MCLEAN and CURTIS held that the record did not so show, and that his being a black man, simply did not make him any the less a citizen.

editorial calls movement Southwest perplexing; questions whether it is a reversal,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/17/archives/retrograde-in-the-southwest.html,editorial calls movement Southwest perplexing; questions whether it is a reversal,"We confess to a total lack of appreciation of Union strategy in the Southwest. The telegraph tells us briefly that Gen. SHERMAN has returned to Memphis, Gen. HOVEY has returned to Helena, Gen. GRANT pauses at Oxford, Miss.--and ""an immediate advance is not expected."" Gen. HOVEY was famously gazetted quite recently for having captured Grenada, Miss.--one of the most valuable railroad centres of the rebels. But sober truth overslaughed this cheerful bulletin and killed it. Gen. HOVEY's Cavalry did not come within six miles of Grenada, which might have been taken, if our officers had possessed the audacity. Of the famous expedition of Gen. HOVEY, from which we had been led to expect so much, the telegraph presents this morning the following tame and spiritless conclusion: ""The results of the expedition sum up 160 rebels killed, wounded and captured; and our loss, 34 killed, wounded and missing."" For an expedition, numbering, according to report, twenty thousand men -- that traveled twenty miles or more by water, and marched seventy-five miles by land into the enemy's country, crossing two rivers on the route, and aiming at a vital point of the rebel country -- we must say the above fruits do not seem large.

THE PENALTY FOR EJECTING A PASSENGER FROM A RAILROAD CAB:--The case of RICHARD HARGET against the Brooklyn City Railroad Company, was tried in the Brooklyn City Court during the present week. The plaintiff, who is a colored man, brought an action against the Company for having been expelled from one of their cars. He had no change and offered a dollar bill. The conductor either could not or would not make change, and ordered the plaintiff from the rear platform, upon which he was standing. The plaintiff refused to get off and was forcibly ejected. He then got upon the front platform, from which he was also ordered, and finally driven off by the driver. The difficulty occurred in one of the Court-street cars, near Joralemon-street, about the time the Railroad Company commenced refusing to change bills. The question whether passengers should provide themselves with change, or whether the Company is bound to make change in reasonable amounts, was therefore also involved in the case. The case was given to the jury on Tuesday evening, and yesterday morning they brought in a verdict of 6 1/4 cents damages for plaintiff.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b755a87e-3d6f-5d24-b9af-5d3ea20b5123,336,nyt://article/b755a87e-3d6f-5d24-b9af-5d3ea20b5123

"-- In response to a communication upon this subject, which appeared in the TIMES yesterday, we learn that the printers have already furnished the Treasury with $220,000,000 of demand notes, in denominations of one, two, five, ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred, and one thousand dollar bills. Of the postal or fractional currency, we understand nearly four millions have been supplied.

His first attempt upon this subject gave promise for the second, and well repaid were those present last night for having affronted the biting cold on their way to the crowded Academy. As upon the first lecture, Mr. JONES amused his hearers of his having watched the progress of the rebellion unprejudiced, and with a full determination to arrive at great conclusions. As an ardent lover of liberty, he could but condemn DAVIS and his compeers, who were fighting, he said, for no holy cause, for no independence, as before the struggle they had these full and untainted. In indignant terms he changed upon the rebels that they were waging a war to ensure the existence and spread of the accursed institution Slavery, and he pronounced their cause a damnable one. He urged a continuance of the struggle, until the rebellion were crushed, even should we be forced to accomplish this purpose to destroy the South. He attacked the laxity and want of decision of the Administration, hampered as it is by personal and petty schemes, bribery and corruption. He called upon the people to rise in their great power, and put aside the wretched politicians, who sacrifice the welfare of the nation to their own advancement; and he urged that, as a great people, we no longer show fear of European intervention, but that Mr. SEWARD announce to France and England that mediation meant war, and that we should answer any demands upon us with our Monitors; that five hundred pound balls were heavy arguments, much more likely to convince than Mr. SEWARD's letters. Mr. JONES dwelt forcibly upon the fact that our struggle is one which concerns directly all the oppressed and tyranized of the world -- that our defeat would rivet their chains, while our triumph would hastan the date of their delivery.

Editorial explores Union mistakes to date,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/19/archives/on-to-richmond-still.html,Editorial explores Union mistakes to date,"We have tried, and for the moment failed. But no time should be lost in trying again, on some other line. We cannot afford to lose the Winter in idle repining. Our armies, in all probability, will never again be so strong as now. Volunteering has substantially ceased. Conscription seems to have about finished its work. Every army, without new recruits, constantly and rapidly grows weaker by disease, even without battle. Moreover, the time will soon come when the term of enlistment of many of the soldiers will expire. There are two large classes in the army -- the two years' men enrolled at the beginning of the war, and the nine months' men called out by the Proclamation of last Summer -- who soon will be no longer available. Our Government is bound ever to bear in mind that there is this very important difference between itself and the rebel rulers: it can have no soldiers except for limited periods, while they, practically liberated from all control of law, can force their rank and file to serve as long as they please. It is specially bound, then, to use its present soldiers while it has them. Even if their places could be supplied with fresh volunteers, which is by no means certain, it must take long and valuable time to organize and discipline them --- a disadvantage the rebels are mainly free from, for the personnel of their armies will remain nearly the same throughout the war, however long it may be continued. We repeat, then, that we must waste no time in vain regrets. Action must still be the word.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'On To Richmond Still.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'On To Richmond Still.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/91d077a2-f85d-5c28-abcb-c3d17ed19e0c,961,nyt://article/91d077a2-f85d-5c28-abcb-c3d17ed19e0c

The transport Niagara, as the telegraph has already informed us, which left here a few days ago with five hundred soldiers, had to put into Philadelphia to escape destruction; and on examination, her cross-timbers were found to be a mass of black-rot. Our South Carolina correspondent yesterday described the condition of the ship Thames, also of the Banks Expedition, which put into Port Royal on the 10th in a disabled condition, and was there surveyed and condemned. The report of the Examining Board was, that she was altogether unseaworthy. ""Her timbers,"" wrote our correspondent, ""in some places, were found to be placed three feet apart, and she was built up above the water-line with 1 1/2-inch pine plank, without any ceiling.

It may be that the battle was undecided after the ten hours' engagement of Saturday, and was renewed next day by our army with greater success; or it may be that the dispatch of the rebel commander deviated slightly from truth and from the facts.

"Personal security is not to be numbered among the blessings which foreigners enjoy in Japan. Whatever disposition the Government of the Tycoon may have to protect them, there can be no doubt that the Princes and their followers regard outside barbarians with aversion, and avail themselves of every opportunity to give vent to their animosity.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/21/archives/the-latest-outrage-in-japan.html,,"Personal security is not to be numbered among the blessings which foreigners enjoy in Japan. Whatever disposition the Government of the Tycoon may have to protect them, there can be no doubt that the Princes and their followers regard outside barbarians with aversion, and avail themselves of every opportunity to give vent to their animosity. The latest instance of this, and perhaps the most wanton and outrageous that has yet occurred, has been narrated by the Yokohama correspondent of this paper, and occurred on the 14th of September. A party of English, consisting of three gentlemen and one lady, left Yokohama on horseback, to visit a temple in the vicinity of Kawasaki. They had arrived midway between Kanagawa and the place of their destination, without meeting with accident of any kind; but there they unfortunately encountered a Prince and his retinue, who brusquely ordered them to turn back. This they immediately proceeded to do. Hardly, however, had they commenced their retrogade movement, when they were fiercely assaulted by the armed followers of the Japanese Chief. The lady, a Mrs. BORRADALE, had her hat cut from her head by a stroke of a sword, and owed her life to the fleetness of her horse. Two of the gentlemen -- Messrs. MARSHALL and CLARKE -- were severely wounded, yet succeeded in reaching the American Consulate in Kanagawa. But the fate of Mr. RICHARDSON, the remaining member of the party, was more tragic and terrible. Faint from loss of blood, he was unable to keep his seat, and fell on the road insensible. On recovering consciousness he begged for a drink of water. There was, however, no good Samaritan there to minister to the wants of the dying stranger. Far otherwise. A noriman, or native carriage, passing at the time, its occupant, seeing a wounded man sitting on the wayside, asked what was the matter. ""Oh, nothing,"" responded some of the bystanders, ""he is merely a foreigner."" Whereupon the inhuman wretch descended from his vehicle, drew his sword, and completed the work which the retainers of the Prince had left unfinished. The corpse of the murdered RICHARDSON was dragged some ten or twelve yards off the road, where it was subsequently pointed out to a party of Europeans and Americans, who came to seek it, by a youth who had been an eye-witness of the last act of butchery. When found it was covered with matting, and horribly mangled and mutilated. Such, according to our correspondent, and confirmed by the Japan Express and Herald, are the leading facts of this shocking catastrophe. A Singapore journal, evidently in the interest of Col. NEALE, the British Charge, who has given great offence by his want of sympathy with the sufferers, attempts to apologize for the conduct of the Japanese, by alleging that the Europeans, in obstructing the way of the procession, were violating one of the social customs of Japan, which allows no person to intrude upon the thoroughfares when a Prince and his train are to pass. This view of the matter cannot, however, exculpate the assassins, or take from the atrocity of the outrage. For, notwithstanding the existence of such a custom, Mrs. BORRADALE and her friends were guiltless. The Prince who contemplated the procession was bound to notify the Government of his intention, while the Government was bound to give notice to the foreign Consulates or Legations. Now, in the present case, no notification of any kind had been given either to the Government or the foreign representatives, and therefore none of the individuals who composed that fatal pleasure party could have had the faintest conception that they were committing any breach of etiquette in riding forth to visit Kawasaki, or that, by so doing, they were performing an act which might have cost them all their lives.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Latest Outrage in Japan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Latest Outrage in Japan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d5b4b73-ea4b-5b74-8f7d-d6578f9413a9,828,nyt://article/0d5b4b73-ea4b-5b74-8f7d-d6578f9413a9

It would seem as if no previous respectability, no station in society, no position, no reputation prevented any one who became touched with this fatal heresy of secession from losing all regard for truth; and more than that, such men seem to lose all regard for common sense, and give the public no credit for any knowledge of facts or power of reasoning, and make statements, not in the heat of a verbal discussion, but coolly, and in writing, which every one who has any memory of the events of the past two years knows are utterly false. Think, for instance, of BUCHANAN's written, deliberate statement that FLOYD had never stolen any public arms at all! which Gen.

AVEERSON, a dentist, residing at a boarding-house, No. 26 Clinton-place, was arrested yesterday, and brought before Jusitce KELLY, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, on three charges of deadly assault with a knife upon his landlady, Mrs. RICH, and two other persons. The facts of the case, as they transpired upon the examination before the Justice, yesterday, are these: Dr. ADDINGTON was complained of by some of the lady boarders in the establishment as having been guilty of taking improper liberties with them, and when this intelligence reached the ears of the hostess she at once took steps to put an end to the scandal. The latter keeps an extensive and somewhat private boarding-house at the number above indicated, and she very naturally felt that the reputation of her house was at stake, when stories, of this nature were put into circulation by her own boarders. She therefore applied for counsel to her brother-in-law. Mr. CHARLES W. MILLER, a boarder in the house, and it was finally concluded that the best way would be to wait upon the objectionable boarder at once, and inform him that his presence there was no longer required. Mrs. RICH, accompanied by Mr. MILLER, went to ADDINGTON's room. The latter, upon being informed of the conclusion to which Mrs. RICH had arrived, seized a long knife lying upon his table, and with it struck the lady in the face and also on the right arm, thereby wounding her very severely. At this stage of the affray. Mr. MILLER, her brother-in-law, interfered, when the gallant Doctor stabbed him in eight different places on the head and body. Some of the wounds are very serious, and may possibly prove fatal. About, this time MILLER's wife interfered for the protection of her husband, when the desperado struck that lady in the breast with his knife, and then stabbed her on the nose, just between the eyes. After having glutted his apparent thirst for blood in this manner, he fled from the house, but was very soon afterwards taken into custody by Officer JONES, of the Fifteenth Precinct. Dr. SANGER was called in, and dressed the wounds of the injured persons, none of which are considered dangerous, with the exception of those inflicted upon MILLER. The prisoner had a preliminary examination, yesterday afternoon, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, during which he stated that he was 42 years of age and a dentist by occupation. As to the question of guilt he had nothing to say. Justice KELLY committed the accused to prison upon three separate charges of felonious assault.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Serious Stabbing Affray.; ARREST OF A DESPERATE DENTIST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Serious Stabbing Affray.; ARREST OF A DESPERATE DENTIST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ed830a4-1d8a-5084-bdf3-edee59f01681,434,nyt://article/5ed830a4-1d8a-5084-bdf3-edee59f01681

Mr. SEWARD has been the right-hand man of the President from the day of his election until now. He has had, in great measure, the shaping of the policy of the Government, beside the management of what has been, on several occasions, its most important and difficult Department.

Are the people fully alive to the great losses they are liable to suffer through the Postage Currency? And is the Government doing any part of its duty for our protection against the threatened losses? It has already been stated that the Postage Currency notes have been counterfeited. We were about to write successfully counterfeited, but it is a burlesque on success to impute it where there is no difficulty of achievement. It seems that the style of Postage Currency bills furnished by the authorities to the people, was adopted without the slightest suspicion that a value was to be attached to the notes, which might lead dishonest persons to attempt their imitation -- so vile is the paper used and so common and unskilled the designs of the print. Probably there is not a town of twenty thousand inhabitants in the Union that cannot turn out an engraver who can duplicate the plate of any Postage Currency note now in circulation.

Sigel testifies,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/22/archives/article-3-no-title-testimony-of-gen-franz-sigel.html,Sigel testifies,"During the operations on the Rappahannock I was under the direct orders of Gen. Pope, cooperating with Gen. McDowell. After the engagements at Freeman's Ford, Sulphur Springs and Waterloo Bridge, I received an order from Gen. Pope that my corps were attached to the command of Gen. McDowell. I regarded myself under his orders from this time until after the battle of Bull Run. I cannot give the exact date of the engagements without the papers. I cannot give the date when I went to Harper's Ferry and Winchester. We arrived at Harper's Ferry about the 6th of June, and I marched the same day to Winchester. I arrived at Culpepper on the 9th of August, during the battle of Gen. Banks at Cedar Mountain. After the battle of Cedar Mountain my corps marched to Robertson River and Crooked Creek. We left this position in the middle of August, and marched by [???] River to Sulphur Springs, and from this to Rappahannock Station, where we joined Gen. McDowell's Corps. On the 24th of August we were at ----- Bridge, and on the 27th in Warrenton. On the 28th we marched from Gainesville toward Manassas, Gen. McDowell following the First Corps -- my Corps -- which was at that time the first. I do not know how far Gen. McDowell followed my movements from that day. I had orders to march to Manassas, and took the shortest road I could find. This was on Aug. 28. During the march from Gainesville to Manassas I heard firing to lay left. I marched toward that point and formed in line of battle, when I received orders from Gen. McDowell to march to Manasses. When my advanced guard arrived at Manassas it was reported that there was no enemy there; that the enemy had retreated to Centreville; I therefore sent my Aid-de-Camp to Gen. Pope to get permission to march to New-Market. He then directed me to march to Centreville. On this march, when we arrived near New-Market, I met a detachment of the enemy, which I attached immediately, and advanced toward Grovetown. During this engagement we heard firing on our left, which I supposed came from part of Gen. McDowell's corps. It had become dark, and my camp pen that night was on the heights near Mrs. Henry's farm, near Grovetown, when, on the morning of the 29th, I received direct orders from Gen. Pope to attack the enemy, which I did about 5 o'clock in the morning. I did not know where Gen. McDowell's Corps was at that tone, nor where any other troops were, except those of the enemy. During the 29th, and toward noon, when all the troops of my corps were engaged with the enemy, I received a dispatch from Gen. Pope, saying that Gen. McDowell and Gen. Porter would attack the enemy's, right flank, and would come on on my left; and that we had probably to go back to Centreville that night, to get provisions. This is what I remember; I can probably find the original dispacth of Gen. Pope. I do not know whether any attack was made by Gen. McDowell, or when his troops arrived on my left, because I was too much occupied on the right, where the battle was principally fought. I did not see Gen. McDowell during that day, until 6:30 P.M., when I saw Gen. McDowell and his staff arriving. On the next day, the 30th August, I did not know where Gen. McDowell's Corps was, and did not sec Gen. McDowell during the whole day, as much as I can remember; but I knew that Gen. Reynolds' Division was on the left of our line, or near the left of our line, on the 29th and 30th. On the 30th of August, when Gen. Porter made his attack on the centre and was forced to retreat, I received a dispatch, which I believe was transmitted to me by an officer of Gen. McDowell's Staff, but the dispatch was written by Gen. Porter, as much as I can remember. In this dispatch, it was said that probably the conflict would end fatally, and that Gen. McDowell should push my corps forward. I did not receive an order, but made all preparations to assist Gen. Porter or to take his troops up, who were at that time coming out of the woods by squads. I did not receive any order from Gen. McDowell during the day. I have also to add in regard to the connection between the corps and that of Gen. McDowell, that when at Sulphur Springs Gen. Pope wrote to me that Gen. McDowell would assist me in supporting him at Waterloo Bridge; but I did not see any troops of Gen. McDowell's there, or some miles from that point; and at Waterloo Bridge, on that same day I received an order through Gen. McDowell, of which one page was missing, so that I did not know what my orders were. I immediately sent to Gen. McDowell for orders, but he answered that he could not give me any. Allow me to say that I sent to McDowell for instructions, because I am not sure that when I received the order from Gen. Pope that my corps was attached to that of Gen. McDowell's, but I can find it our. The officer whom I had sent to Gen. McDowell then proceeded to Warrenton Junction to find Gen. Pope; he returned nearly at dark with an order from Gen. Pope for my corps to march to Warrenton that night which I did. When the corps was at Warrenton with the main force, and I came in with the rearguard at two and a half o'clock A.M. on the next morning, I met an officer of Gen. McDowell's at the entrance of the town, who deliverer me a dispatch in which it was said that I should force with my corps the pass at Waterloo, on that same morning, which was an impossibility. I state this to show that I received an order from Gen. McDowell on that morning. When my corps had arrived at Gainesville I received an order that night from Gen. McDowell at three o'clock in the morning, saving that I should march to Manassas. I asked the orderly when he had left Gen. McDowell, and he said he had left him two hours ago -- although the headquarters of Gen. McDowell were not more than two hundred paces from my quarters. Those are the principal facts which I can give you.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 3 -- No Title; TESTIMONY OF GEN.

"We were standing, the other day, in Barnum's Museum, looking at the male and female Esquimaux and the little picaninny, and talking to Capt. Hall, the distinguished Arctic explorer, who brought the strangers down with htm. Among the topics of conversation were the handsome dresses of skins of Arctic animals worn by the Esquimaux, and Capt. Hall gave us some very interesting information in regard to the polar bear, the white polar fox, the seal, and other animals from which the adventurous hunters manage to derive subsistence for themselves and to supply luxuries to others. Speaking of polar bears: ""They have some very fine specimens of polar bear skins now in the City,"" said the Captain. We remarked that we had occasionally seen one, burarely one large enough or fine enough to be worthy of special notice. ""Eh, havn't you, though?"" said the Captain; ""Well, just put on your hat and light one of these cigars, and go out with me for only a few steps, and see if we cannot find a few."" We followed his directions and went out with him to Broadway, expecting to be introduced to some kind of ""Fur Company"" or other, Marvel of marvels! he merely led us down the sidewalk a few steps, and into KNOX's, No. 212 Broadway, corner of Fulton-street. KNOX was busy selling hats and chatting with customers, and the Captain led us down the counter, past piles of what seemed to be Arctic fox skins, and showed us a skin suspended from the top shelf on the Fulton-street side. ""There,"" he said, ""there is one of the very largest and finest Polar bear skins I ever saw, and I have seen many thousands."" We examined it. It was really a marvel in size and quality -- pure cream white, without a spot or blemish, and enough to make the very soul of a fashionable sleigh rider content. But that was not all. The Captain, who seemed to have paid several visits to ""KNOX's Arctic Regions"" previously, showed us others of those superb bear skins, of nearly the same size and value. Then he showed us such a wilderness of other rich Arctic furs, fox, lynx, sable and otter, as we had thought could not be found nearer than Siberia or the Hudson's Bay Territory, and concluded by calling our attention to a splendid assortment of Buffalo Robes, trimmed in the handsomest manner, and many others without trimmings, tanned so as to shed water like a mackintosh, and especially fitted for keeping dampness and eventual rheumatism out of the legs of soldiers who sleep upon the ground. The Captain informed us, speaking of this, that the Indians of the far Northwest never have such an ache as rheumatism, no matter how much they sleep upon the damp ground, owing to the fact that they always sleep upon the impervious tanned skin of the Buffalo. By this time, and looking around to see what a splendid collection of Ladies' Furs, of all styles and qualities he had in his boxes ready for the visits of the fashionable, we became aware that KNOX really kept the most extensive fur store in the City, in addition to his extensive trade in head coverings. We had long known him as the leading Hatter in the City, keeping one of the very largest assortments of Hats, Caps, Fur Caps and Soft Hats always on head in the cool season, as well as Panamas and other light Hats in Summer, and making Dress Hats to order with a rapidity and skill to which no other manufacturer could pretend. But we had no idea, until Capt. Hall opened our eyes, how extensive and choice was his stock of Furs -- ready, apparently, to accommodate all tastes and all pockets. KNOX himself, meanwhile, was about half the time busled in seiling Military Caps to officers who continually came dropping in; and from the conversations held between one and another, and which we occasionally overheard, we learned that he had a peculiar reputation through the whole service for furnishing blue Cloth Caps, both for army and navy, of such excellent dyed-in-the-wool material, that while those from other makers became gray and dingy after being out in the rain a few times, those of KNOX never faded, and come back looking about as bright as when they went away. Then we took a general look around the establishment and studied the Fall and Winter styles of Hats, more curved in the brim, and with more bell to the crown than they have before been for a long period, and unmistakably French in their whole appearance. Then he had a short chat with KNOX himself, who is quite as much an object of interest as any object he has in his collection, being an unmistakably earnest business man, who thinks that every man should devote his whole energies to the profession he has chosen, and who believes (with good reason) that the mission of a man who makes a better Hat than his neighbor, is just as important and just as noble as that of the man who preaches a better sermon, or the other man who makes a more telling speech. Such men as KNOX, who buld up a business like his, with probity at the bottom, and enterprise and taste furnishing the superstructure, are among the reliable features of an unreliable age, and we cannot pass them by without a word of appreciation when we happen to meet them, All these things impressed us more than ever with the fact that KNOX's, No. 212 Broadway, corner Fulton-street, is as much of an institution as the City Hall, or the Museum itself; and so, bidding good day to the Arctic Captain -- who ordered a new Fur Tippet, and carried it back to the Esquimaux woman to delight her heart on Thanksgiving Day -- we had our measure taken for the new Winter Dress Hat we had been so long intending to order, and came away, intending at the time to put KNOX before the people in precisely this manner.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/24/archives/communicated-arctic-regions-on-broadway.html,,"We were standing, the other day, in Barnum's Museum, looking at the male and female Esquimaux and the little picaninny, and talking to Capt. Hall, the distinguished Arctic explorer, who brought the strangers down with htm. Among the topics of conversation were the handsome dresses of skins of Arctic animals worn by the Esquimaux, and Capt. Hall gave us some very interesting information in regard to the polar bear, the white polar fox, the seal, and other animals from which the adventurous hunters manage to derive subsistence for themselves and to supply luxuries to others. Speaking of polar bears: ""They have some very fine specimens of polar bear skins now in the City,"" said the Captain. We remarked that we had occasionally seen one, burarely one large enough or fine enough to be worthy of special notice. ""Eh, havn't you, though?"" said the Captain; ""Well, just put on your hat and light one of these cigars, and go out with me for only a few steps, and see if we cannot find a few."" We followed his directions and went out with him to Broadway, expecting to be introduced to some kind of ""Fur Company"" or other, Marvel of marvels! he merely led us down the sidewalk a few steps, and into KNOX's, No. 212 Broadway, corner of Fulton-street. KNOX was busy selling hats and chatting with customers, and the Captain led us down the counter, past piles of what seemed to be Arctic fox skins, and showed us a skin suspended from the top shelf on the Fulton-street side. ""There,"" he said, ""there is one of the very largest and finest Polar bear skins I ever saw, and I have seen many thousands."" We examined it. It was really a marvel in size and quality -- pure cream white, without a spot or blemish, and enough to make the very soul of a fashionable sleigh rider content. But that was not all. The Captain, who seemed to have paid several visits to ""KNOX's Arctic Regions"" previously, showed us others of those superb bear skins, of nearly the same size and value. Then he showed us such a wilderness of other rich Arctic furs, fox, lynx, sable and otter, as we had thought could not be found nearer than Siberia or the Hudson's Bay Territory, and concluded by calling our attention to a splendid assortment of Buffalo Robes, trimmed in the handsomest manner, and many others without trimmings, tanned so as to shed water like a mackintosh, and especially fitted for keeping dampness and eventual rheumatism out of the legs of soldiers who sleep upon the ground. The Captain informed us, speaking of this, that the Indians of the far Northwest never have such an ache as rheumatism, no matter how much they sleep upon the damp ground, owing to the fact that they always sleep upon the impervious tanned skin of the Buffalo. By this time, and looking around to see what a splendid collection of Ladies' Furs, of all styles and qualities he had in his boxes ready for the visits of the fashionable, we became aware that KNOX really kept the most extensive fur store in the City, in addition to his extensive trade in head coverings. We had long known him as the leading Hatter in the City, keeping one of the very largest assortments of Hats, Caps, Fur Caps and Soft Hats always on head in the cool season, as well as Panamas and other light Hats in Summer, and making Dress Hats to order with a rapidity and skill to which no other manufacturer could pretend. But we had no idea, until Capt. Hall opened our eyes, how extensive and choice was his stock of Furs -- ready, apparently, to accommodate all tastes and all pockets. KNOX himself, meanwhile, was about half the time busled in seiling Military Caps to officers who continually came dropping in; and from the conversations held between one and another, and which we occasionally overheard, we learned that he had a peculiar reputation through the whole service for furnishing blue Cloth Caps, both for army and navy, of such excellent dyed-in-the-wool material, that while those from other makers became gray and dingy after being out in the rain a few times, those of KNOX never faded, and come back looking about as bright as when they went away. Then we took a general look around the establishment and studied the Fall and Winter styles of Hats, more curved in the brim, and with more bell to the crown than they have before been for a long period, and unmistakably French in their whole appearance. Then he had a short chat with KNOX himself, who is quite as much an object of interest as any object he has in his collection, being an unmistakably earnest business man, who thinks that every man should devote his whole energies to the profession he has chosen, and who believes (with good reason) that the mission of a man who makes a better Hat than his neighbor, is just as important and just as noble as that of the man who preaches a better sermon, or the other man who makes a more telling speech.

"Yesterday was another eventful day in our iron-clad navy. The United States steam battery Montauk left this City, her commander, Capt. WORDEN, receiving a perfect ovation on his departure. As early as 10 o'clock A.M. crowds of persons endeavored to obtain admission to the Navy-yard to witness the departure of the gallant officer, and his new Monitor. All were kept outside, however, save a favored few. Steam was got up on board the Montauk at an early hour, and Admiral PAULDING was informed at 10 1/2 that she was about to leave. Officers then thronged the wharf, and when Capt. WORDEN arrived each took a warm farewell of him. The scene was most affecting. Prophecies of great events, and fresh laurels soon to be won, were heaped upon him. On board the receiving-ship North Carolina the enthusiasm of sailors, both recruits and old salts, was so marked, that the commanding officer ordered the rigging to be manned, after which three rousing cheers were given for the hero of the Monitor.

Editorial on Grant retreat and lack of action in Tennessee,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/24/archives/grants-army.html,Editorial on Grant retreat and lack of action in Tennessee,"The war news continues to come in unfavorably from the Southwest. From the day of Gen. GRANT's pause at Oxford, Mississippi, the rebel reaction against his movement has been manifest. Gen. HOVEY's expedition against Grenada came to nought because it was a cooperating demonstration, only lacking in the vital element that it failed entirely to cooperate. There was no communication between GRANT and HOVEY, and the former did not know that the latter had been near Grenada until HOVEY returned to Helena and reported the fact via Cairo, Columbus and Holly Springs! Cooperation between commands thus distant and isolated is a remarkable idea.The grand combination between GRANT, SHERMAN and HOVEY that promised so much in the matter of clearing the State of Mississippi of rebel armies and opening up the Mississippi River, having ended so unsatisfactorily, it became a very serious question with some, whether any forward movement of our whole forces had been really intended. But we see no reason to doubt that the general advance was meditated, and that it has been arrested for causes not given to the public. In no other way can we excuse Gen. GRANT for the present position of his army. He abandoned Jackson, Bolivar, Corinth and Grand Junction -- all very valuable strategic points in and for West Tennessee, which were strongly held by his troops, and in which positions he was able to keep his communications easily open with his base at Cairo. He was likewise able to keep the rebel troops pressed down into Mississippi. The citizens of West Tennessee being thus delivered from Confederate authority were rapidly returning to their senses, resuming their ordinary avocations, engaging in trade and taking steps to elect members to the National Congress. Conventions were held, and nearly every county in West Tennessee was well represented by Union delegates. Candidates of sterling loyalty were nominated, and it seemed likely that a formal return to the Union of all that part of the State would soon be witnessed. But as soon as Gen.

At the cemetery gate the party were met by the Trustees who donated the land, and were escorted by them to the plot specially sat apart for the purpose. It is about fifty feet square, and handsomely situated on high ground, nearly at the crest of a hill, and overlooks, a large portion of the surrounding country. Near by are graves with headstones bearing dates as far back as 1650, at a spot that was used long after, as well as long before, the Revolution, as a family burying-ground, by the early settlers who occupied the farm of 120 acres, now converted into a great cemetery. The appropriateness of such a contiguous position to this spot for the Union soldiers' resting place was recognized and commended by all the visitors. Having satisfied their curiosity here, the party were conducted by Mr. D. CAROLIN, the Secretary of the Cemetery Board of Managers, to the residence of Father JOYCE, situated a short distance off to the eastward, and within the cemetery grounds. There the entire party were hospitably entertained by the Rev. Father, who paid a high compliment to the Common Council for their liberality in providing for the wants of the families of volunteers. Aldermen Ottiwell, Farley, Reed, Mitchell, Henry and Boole, and Councilman Jones made remarks in response to various sentiments, some personal and others complimentary to the Municipality of New-York, offered by other gentlemen of the party, and all gave the due meed of praise to the cemetery authorities for their liberality and patriotism, in being the first, and, so, far, the only donors to the Corporation of a burial plot for the Interment of the patriotic dead. The gift, it should be added, was originally intended only for the benefit of such Catholic soldiers as might die in the hospitals of the City, but the more liberal condition of including all Catholic soldiers of New-York, falling in the war, has since been added to the terms of the donation.

"A melancholy case of suicide, by shooting, occurred on Monday morning at the private boarding-house, No. 240 West Thirty-second-street. The victim was a young man named EDWARD TOMLINS, aged about 19 years, and was regarded by all his friends and acquaintances as a young person of good moral character and promising business habits. For nearly two years past he has been employed in the store of Messrs. T.S. YOUNG & Co., wholesale clothiers, No. 120 Chambers-street. Upon his entrance into that establishment, he came highly recommended to his employers, and be soon exhibited such a marked talent for business, and was withal so apparently conscientious and honest, that his employers were induced to repose the most implicit confidence in him. He had not been long with them before the whole charge of the books of the firm were intrusted to his care, and for several months past he has acted as their cashier. In the latter position, large amounts of money passed daily through his hands, and many workmen were weekly paid by him -- he making the entry of such payments in the books of the concern in such a manner as best suited his purposes. During the last four months, his employers and others noticed, with some surprise, that the young man was very extravagant in dress, and also in some other respects, but, strange as it may appear, they did not for a moment suspect that he was robbing their money-drawer. Their idea seems to have been that their fast clerk was living beyond his means, or perhaps that he was in the receipt of money from his parents. One thing was very certain in their judgment -- the young man could not afford to indulge in all the luxuries and extravagances by which he surrounded himself upon the paltly sum of $300 a year, which was the salary paid him by this firm. He was seen morning after morning to come to his place of business in a carriage, and when the labors of the day were over a carriage awaited at the store door to convey him to his boarding-house; and yet such was the confidence with which this firm trusted young TOMLIN's, that it never occurred to them to examine the cash-book or drawer, to see whether or not their confidence was misplaced. But the 1st of January was drawing near; the time was approaching when as the habit is with all thorough business men, the accounts of the year would be overhauled, and all errors, whether of head of heart, on the part of the book-keeper and cashier, would be brought to light.

"The members of the Ninth New-York Cavalry, Col. SACKET, were rejoiced yesterday at the return to camp of some twenty of their companions, who were captured at Haymarket in October last, while conducting a train of provisions to Thoroughfare Gap. By some mismanagement or misfortune, we at that time lost eight teams, and had thirty odd soldiers taken prisoners. But for the fact that a portion of the rebels wore blue overcoats, as it was, our men might have destroyed the train and escaped, after seeing the immense superiority of the attacking force. The returned prisoners state that they were hurried off to Warrenton, and thence to Richmond. They were in Warrenton at the time our troops, under Gen. STAHL, advanced upon that place, a few hours after their capture; and, in their opinion, the town might have then been easily taken and the train and soldiers recaptured, as the rebels had an inferior force in every respect, and for cannon there were only two 12-pounders and 6-pound shells only were used in them. Some of these shells exploded within a few feet of the guns and killed and maimed a number of rebel soldiers. The soldiers speak in the highest terms of their treatment while prisoners -- that is, they fared quite as well as their captors did, who lived mostly upon flour and bacon, and these were the only articles issued as rations. The rebels were quite inquisitive as to the number of Union troops in the field, and as to their supply of clothing and provisions, and seemed to be astonished when told that there were a plenty of troops, and clothing and provisions for them. They saw no large force of troops on their way to or in Richmond. Below Richmond they saw a fort -- supposed to be Fort Darling -- which they look upon as a very small affair, mounting not more than ten guns. On every hand they saw evidences of want and destitution, and all with whom they conversed expressed a strong desire to see the war terminate at once. The President's Emancipation Proclamation was everywhere alluded to as an outrage, and they could not see why it was Mr. LINCOLN desired to interfere with their slave property, for it was all the means of support they had.

Mr. PEARCE was born in Alexandria, Virginia, on Dec. 10, 1805. He graduated at Princeton College, in 1822, with the highest honors, and then took up the study of the law. He did not resign himself entirely to the arduous duties, of his profession, for the possession of ample means enabled him to indulge his taste for agricultural pursuits, and he gave up much of his time to them. In 1831, he was elected a member of the Maryland Legislature, and from 1835 to 1839, and from 1841 to 1843, three terms in all, represented his district in Congress. In 1843 he was elected to the United States Senate, and has ever since continued to be a member of that Body; a large part of the time he has acted as Chairman of the Committee on the Library. Mr. PEARCE has also held the post of Professor of Law, in Washington College, Chestertown, Pa., and for a number of years was a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/67c5633f-4ca8-5226-8d33-a62933ab94d7,186,nyt://article/67c5633f-4ca8-5226-8d33-a62933ab94d7

"The Ninth New-York Cavalry boasts of a Lieutenant named BLY, who took a distinguished part in the recent reconnoissance to Berryville. In my account of that affair, I omitted to state one incident worthy of mention, particularly as it illustrates a nice sense of honor manifested toward an enemy by a gallant soldier, and an esprit du corps reflecting credit upon the officer and the branch of the service to which he is attached.

Our men in advance used their weapons as best served their purpose, with the exception of Lieut. BLY, who only used his sword. In one instance, he pursued a rebel officer for nearly two miles. The speed of their horses was so nearly equal that Lieut. BLY could only get near enough to reach the point of his sword within about six inches of the officer's head, and it required all the stretch there was in him to do that. Each spurred their horses on at the top of their speed -- one determined to escape, and the other equally determined to cut him down. Thus they rushed on, over hills and through valleys, streams and mud-holes. Lieut. BLY occasionally making an unsuccessful cut with his sword, and expressing his disgust each time, in the most emphatic terms imaginable, that his weapon was not six inches longer, the rebel officer all the time dodging and twisting, and spurring on his horse. The road had been made soft by the melting of a small covering of snow that had fallen the night before. The mud and water was scattered by the horses in every direction, covering man and beast and everything else near. Eventually all of our advance reined up except Lieut.

"About two months ago an Israelite, giving his name as Mons. EDREHI, and wearing the full uniform of a Captain in a French Zouave regiment, arrived in this City, and stopped at the Prescott House, attracting a great deal of attention by his appearance, almost every day promenading Broadway in his gay uniform. In a short time his ostensible errand became known. He introduced himself to the most prominent Jews in this City, and represented that he had just arrived from Algeria where the regiment to which he claimed to be attached was stationed. Owing to some difficulty between the Emperor of Morocco and the Jewish inhabitants of that country as he stated, the Emperor oppressed the Jews most grievously, and levied a heavy tribute on them, amounting to some hundred thousand francs. In case this sum was not paid within a certain time, the Jews were to be banished, or otherwise punished. He also represented that the Jewish community there were in great distress and destitution, and consequently unable to pay the sum required by the oppressor. The community determined to apply to their co-religionists in other countries, and had delegated this gay Zou-Zou to travel to Europe and America and make collections among the benevolent Jews for the purpose of liquidating this heavy burden put upon their brethren in Morocco by a despotic ruler. The soldier told his piteous story in such a manner, and was supplied with such apparently genuine credentials, that he met with greater success than he could have anticipated, and the Jews, ever willing to respond to a call from a portion of their people in distress, received the delegate from Morocco very kindly, threw their houses open to his visits, and contributed liberally to the object of his journey. Appeals were made in the behalf of the supposed distressed people by the Jewish clergy, and in a short time Mons. EDREHI collected over $3,000. During this time, however, certain parties, partially distrusting the story of the Algerian, opened a correspondence with the Board of Deputies of British Jews in regard to the Morocco gentleman and his mission. Letters were received in this City that Mons. EDREHI was evidently an impostor, and his story a base fabrication from beginning to end. This somewhat opened the eyes of those who had been so basely imposed upon. In the meantime, however, the bird had flown, he having announced his intention to visit the principal cities of the vicinity.

The entire result of the expedition, and its victorious battles, was that FOSTER ""tore up the railroad, burnt the ties and destroyed the rails and telegraph."" This is rather small fruit, certainly, compared with the promise we had yesterday, and compared with the heavy losses we sustained in the four victories. The battles were well fought, and undoubtedly were victories for our arms; but we think that if the object of the movement was merely to cut the telegraph wires, and tear up some rails, that a properly organized secret expedition of a dozen men, or a cavalry raid after the style of STUART and HAMPTON, might have accomplished as much, without sacrificing a single life. The dispatch states that the destroyed wires and rails ""cannot again be used"" -- which is quite likely; but it remains to be proved that the rebels cannot put up other wires and put down other rails in a shorter time than was occupied in this expedition. We have no doubt that, if when Gen.

Article on high price of paper caused by Civil War; Article on causes of present high prices of paper,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/25/archives/the-rise-in-the-price-of-paper-to-the-editor-of-the-newyork-times.html,Article on high price of paper caused by Civil War; Article on causes of present high prices of paper,"The recent rapid advance in the price of paper has elicited much comment, and some of the daily papers in this City have attributed this advance to a combination among the manufacturers and dealers in paper in connection with the ""Paper Maker's Association."" An article in your columns a few days since shows that you have fallen into this error. A brief explanation of the causes of the present high prices of paper may interest your readers and correct much misapprehension upon this subject. For some time before the war began the paper market was depressed, mainly from over-production, and for many months afterward the tendency was to still lower prices. This state of things was less disastrous to the paper makers in consequence of the low price of stock. The revival of business and the increased demand for paper for Government purposes, gave prices an upward tendency, and created a greater demand for rags and other stock used by paper makers. There are few branches of manufacturing where the raw material forms so large a per centage of the whole cost as in the manufacture of paper, especially of the quality used by the newspaper press. The ordinary annual production of paper in the United States for several years, is estimated at not less than 100,000 tons. To produce this quantity of paper would require more than 150,000 tons of stock, so great is the waste in manufacturing. This stock comes mainly from the following sources: 1st. Domestic rags saved by careful housewives. From this source paper makers obtain at least 65 per cent, of the whole quantity used. These rags are chiefly of cotton fabric. 2d. Foreign rags, both linen and cotton; from this source is obtained from 10 to 12 1/2 per cent 3d. Rope and bagging used in baling cotton, and the refuse of raw cotton from the cotton mills; this is estimated at about 10 per cent. The balance is made up mostly from old canvas and straw. This statement shows that domestic rags, with rope, bagging and cotton-waste, furnish about seventy-five per cent. of all the stock used in the manufacture of paper. Non-intercourse with the Cotton States has cut off the entire supply of rope, bagging and cotton-waste. The high price of cotton has greatly abridged the consumption of cotton goods. Old garments have been patched and worn which have heretofore gone into the rag-bag, and it must be borne in mind, that one million of men now in public service wear no cotton. Consequently, alarge percentage has been cut off from this source. A new and unlooked-for competition has sprung up for the better quality of cotton rags from the manufacturers of colton goods and batting. Paper makers soon found that rags were becoming scarce, and they naturally began to look ahead, fearing that they might be unable to get stock for their mills. The demand being greater than the supply, prices advanced, and, as a consequence, the increased cost of paper raised the price. This alarmed the large consumers of paper, and they thought it necessary to look ahead. Thus, a combination of circumstances created great activity in the rag and paper market, and stock went up from 100 to 300 per cent. Foreign rags have advanced at least 100 per cent. Not less than 35 per cent. of the advance in the price of paper can be attributed to the depreciation of the currency and the Government Excise tax. The alarm of paper makers and paper consumers has doubtless been instrumental in causing a more rapid rise than would have otherwise taken place. The rag collectors and smaller dealers throughout the country refuse to sell, holding for higher prices. Some of the journals in this City which complain of the ""combination of paper makers,"" to protect themselves against higher prices, have, by their own purchases, given an upward impulse to the market which they little dreamed of. The paper markets deprecate this state of things as much as the consumers. No branch of business is benefited by such violent fluctuations, and many of the men who are charged with combining to create a paper panic have large contracts to supply at former prices, while they have to pay the present high rates for stock, and consequently are suffering large losses. Paper makers have been and are now, free to buy stock and sell paper at just such prices as they choose without the control of the Paper Maker's Association or any combination of paper makers or paper dealers connected therewith. The only resolution passed at the meeting of the ""Paper Maker's Association,"" relating to prices, was not obligatory, but simply a recommendation in regard to two or three qualities. Those prices were based upon the value of stock at that time, but the market soon advanced 50 per cent. above the rates named. But even it there had been an agreement in reference to prices, it would have given no just ground for complaint. Nothing is more common than such agreements. The proprietors of the newspaper Press have had conferences upon kindred topics, which afford a high precedent. Many of the writing-paper manufacturers, some months since, in view of the excise tax and the advance in stock, agreed to an advance in prices, and no one thought or criticising their action.

"A young German named THEODORE MANHEINS, has been arrested by Detective J.C. KINNER, of the Merchants' Independent Private Police, upon complaints lodged with him by the merchants of Park-place, Chambers, Reade and Murray streets and Broadway. Young MANHEINS was recently employed as a cutter in one of the large tailoring establishments on the west side of the town, from which he was discharged for having stolen a pair of shears. Having acquainted himself with the signatures of various firms, he turned his attention to another branch of tailoring, that of purchasing the goods. He drew orders upon firms for samples of goods, and presenting, these orders represented that he would call again and take several cases of goods, but that at the time he would take several pieces of goods as a sample. The card ran well. He thus purchased many pieces of valuable goods from Messrs. HOYT, SPRAGUE & Co., of Park-place; HAVILAND, LINDSLEY & Co., of Chambers-street; WEAVER, RICHARDS & Co., of Reade-street; LEE, BLISS & Co., of Broadway, and others. His orders purported to have been drawn by LONG-STREET, BRADFORD Co., Broadway, PAINE & CARHART, and others. For some time Detective KINNER had been watching for this rare bird, and the merchants had arranged to give their detective officer the earliest information. A day or two since, MANHEINS presented an order at the warehouse of Messrs. LEE, BLISS & Co., when he was at once detained and surrendered to an officer, who took him to the 6th Ward Station House. On his person were found many pawn tickets, leading Captain DOWLEY to regard him as a dishonest person. The Captain gave him lodging during the night, and in the morning took him before Justice CONNOLLY, by whom he was committed. Counsel sued a writ of certiorari, and took the case before Judge MCCUNN, and owing to the non-appearance of witnesses he was discharged.

The counsel for the city, when the case was opened to the jury, called the attention of the Court to the 39th section of the new city charter, passed by the last Legislature, and which, as he claimed, relieved the city from all claims for such injuries. The section provides that the city ""shall not be liable for any nonfeasance or misfeasance"" of ""any officer of the city"" of duty imposed upon him by the act in question, but ""the remedy of the party Aggrieved for any such nonfeasance or misfeasance"" shall be by mandamus or other action against the officer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LIABILITIES OF CITY GOVERNMENTS--A CASE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LIABILITIES OF CITY GOVERNMENTS--A CASE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f993ca80-45b2-51e1-b99b-cd5ef5815b45,470,nyt://article/f993ca80-45b2-51e1-b99b-cd5ef5815b45

Under the able direction of the Principal, H.A. VENTRES, and his officient assistants, the school has enlisted the particular interest of the friends of education in the community. It had been whispered among the scholars for several days that something of interest to themselves would transpire, in connection with a visit from their nearest neighbor. Prof. WM. B. BRADBURY, author of the popular series of Sunday School music-books, but the exact nature of the exercise seems to have been as well kept a secret as the destination of the Banks Expedition. On the afternoon of Wednesday, at a given signal, the scholars marched from the school house to the lecture-room of the Presbyterian Church, which was soon filled by them and their friends. Prof. BRADBURY introduced the ceremonies by speaking pleasantly of the goodwill maintained between his family and all the scholars during a ten years' residence opposite the school, and declared his determination to give them another testimonial of his friendliness and interest in their progress in knowledge whereupon Golden Showers began to fall in every part of the room, until each scholar and friend present possessed a copy. Then the National Flag, which had been patriotically hung at one end of the room, was lifted and fifteen pairs of skates appeared in view, which Mr. BRADBURY distributed to the fifteen boys and girls who stood highest on the merit roll. After a unanimous vote of thanks to the donor and some appropriate remarks by Rev. H.F. SMITH, Pastor of the Baptist Church, with a few declamations and some good singing, the exercises closed and the scholars dispersed with high anticipations of a ""Merry Christmas.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7a06302a-ec30-5b1b-8993-1db877fa41ef,802,nyt://article/7a06302a-ec30-5b1b-8993-1db877fa41ef

It is certainly not out of veneration for GORTHE, for the dialogue of the Teuton Shakespeare is seldom used. Long before GOETHE wrote, the play was a favorite with showmen. Performed before gaping mobs of peasantry by those early actors, the marrionettes, (alas! there are some wooden artists yet) it taught its little lesson of life, and raised its small voice against the danger of wisdom and the pride of learning. The great poet borrowed liberally from the machinery of the puppet show -- and have his followers not done the same? A few years ago the work returned almost to its original conditions. The marrionettes, however, were members of the Ronzani ballet troupe. The aged Faust pirouietted with learned velocity, sold himself to the Devti with a cheerful caper, and waltzed smilingly to perdition by the side of a somewhat exposed Marguerite. That men betray and women are lost is indeed so trite a story, that it may be told by the toes as well as the mouth. The only wonder is that it is told at all, seeing that the telling seldom pays expenses.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a7445905-36ae-5307-a5b8-cf39483c405e,1314,nyt://article/a7445905-36ae-5307-a5b8-cf39483c405e

At present, so far as Great Britain is concerned, it is only too evident that the changes we have found necessary in our customs duties have given her no just ground of complaint. The British trade with our Northern ports has not fallen off. On the contrary, it has in several important points received considerable increase.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/27/archives/new-publications.html,,"--There is inexpressible pleasure, a singular feeling of satisfaction, and the content of a gratified longing, in plunging the thirsting buckets of the brain deep down into the wells of past ages, and bringing them up brimming with the lucent legendary waters that gather in the tombs of slumbering centuries. At the bottom of these wells we do not always find truth, but mere bold veracity is not always the great desideratum, nor does it always present itself as the sum of human happiness to the inquiring mind. Courts of law occasionally dispense with it for convenience's sake, and he were an ambitious and unreasonable fool indeed, who insisted upon its presence in his amusements as well as in his councils, and applied everything brought before him to its inexorable test. Shadowy fictions are oft times infinitely preferable to a stern embodiment of facts. Readers of a subsequent period will have more pleasure in stories of the battles now raging than do we of the present. Deeds of arms gather magnitude as centuries crust upon them, and with that magnitude interest grows. It is quite probable that the Knights of King Arthur's Table, and the Peers and Paladins of CHARLEMAGNE's Court, were held as lightly in their day as we estimate our own Colonels and Captains. But the helmets of Launcelot and Tristram; of Orlando, Rinaldo, Astalpho and Ogier the Dane, blaze brightly amid the golden mists of the mediaval ages, surrounded by a halo of dazzling glory. So with their loves. More of interest attaches to Launcelot and Genevieve than any one in the United Kingdom can muster for the approaching marriage of the Prince of Wales, or any one in this disunited country feel in hymeneal crises in Mr. LINCOLN's Cabinet. These remarks -- not strictly relevant perhaps to the book itself -- are suggested by The Legends of Charlemagne: or, Romance of the Middle Ages, published by J.E. TILTON & Co., of Boston. Mr. BULLFINCH, the author, is already known to the public by two previous works, ""The Age of Fable"" and ""The Age of Chivalry,"" to which the volume before us forms a most fitting corollary. The Court of CHARLEMAGNE is one with which the public generally is not familiar, and to the popular mind CHARLEMAGNE himself is more of a puzzle and a problem than even LOUIS NAPOLRON. Mr. BULLFINCH introduces us to the grandson of him surnamed the Hammer, and to the Peers and Paladins, who to him stood in the light of crown jewels -- quite as valuable, and infinitely more useful -- in a series of legends gathered from all available sources --chiefly, the Italian poets and the ""Romans de Chevalrie"" of the Comte de TRESSAN. He makes us familiar with Malagigi, the magician, who stood on such good terms with demons that one always stood ready to his elbow, saddled and bridled, ready to mount or to be mounted, or in any way to do his bidding. And the reflection forces itself upon us, what a capital Prime Minister Malagigi would have made. Of course it is impossible to read of the achievements of Binaldo putting thousands of Saracens to flight by the might of his unaided arm, without longing for his services in our army as Chief of Cavalry, or something of the kind -- though granting we had the man, it might be difficult to get him appointed to a command, or confirmed. But political influence judiciously directed might manage this, and then, with his sword ""Duvindana,"" and Malagigi deposed for the moment from the office of Secretary of State or of the Interior, to attend to such little necessaries for marching armies as supplies and pontoon trains, STUART's prestige would fade into utter insignificance, and the strategy of LEE and JACKSON be shorn of their glory. But why turn with eager eyes to the shadowy vision of Rinaldo, albeit, belted and helmeted, he looks out from the clear, beautiful page before us?

There was much good feeling evidenced, and an entire absence of bickering of any kind. Mr. THOS. C. FIELDS, of the Twelfth Ward, presided, and was made Chairman of the delegation. After remarks by Messrs.

Editorial surveys military prospects at year's end,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/27/archives/the-military-prospect-at-the-close-of-the-year.html,Editorial surveys military prospects at year's end,"The aspect of military affairs at the close of the year is not very brilliant, at least on the surface. In its last month, we have suffered our severest repulse, and the old Army of the Potomac is, as at this season last year, checked in the advance upon Richmond by a powerful foe in front. Our army operating in the rear of Richmond, too, under Gen. FOSTER, has just made a retrograde movement, which it would be folly to represent as anything but a very serious setback -- a setback, too, which is likely to make future operations on the same line much more difficult and hazardous than they were before. Along the line of the seacoast and the Gulf all that can be said is, that nothing now is less cheerful than things were in the Spring. We have gained but little there during the Summer and Fall, and the small operations that have taken place, though they may have annoyed the rebels, have resulted in very little permanent gain to the Union cause. In the Western field, where nearly half our entire army is scattered, the prospect for the opening year is not very cheerful. The army of Gen. ROSECRANS seems to be utterly paralyzed at Nashville, and its advance into East Tennessee is now checked by the largest army which the rebels have ever had in that State. The army of Gen. GRANT, in Northern Mississippi, is virtually cut off from its base of supplies, and the rebels, as appears from the accounts we now daily publish, are operating with audacity on every side of him. The Mississippi River is still closed against us, and though it is to be hoped that the military and naval expedition now preparing to open it up will be successful, yet it is liable to all the chances and hazards of war.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Military Prospect at the Close of the Year.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Military Prospect at the Close of the Year.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7b9ea81-d041-583d-a688-bb50c7bd1ca4,867,nyt://article/b7b9ea81-d041-583d-a688-bb50c7bd1ca4

That opinion, very long and elaborate, is now published in full. The subject is analyzed with great keenness and thoroughness, and the conclusion that color is not a bar to citizenship, under the Constitution, seems to be irresistibly established. The Attorney-General elucidates with great success that citizenship does not necessarily involve a legal capacity to hold office or cast votes; that it simply means such a membership of the body politic that there is a reciprocal obligation of allegiance on the one side and protection on the other. The Constitution, in using the term ""natural born citizen,"" uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle common to all nations, that the people born in the country constitute the nation, and that every individual of them is prima facie a citizen. The Constitution, in not excluding the free man of color from the pale of citizenship, must by implication, the Attorney-General holds, comprise him, and entitle him to protection, in return for allegiance.

At first -- that is, for a very few weeks -- there was, at least, a show of honesty in drawing the exceedingly liberal bounties offered to men to enlist; and, at that time, when a man enlisted he was taken to the quarters of the company or regiment into which he had enlisted, and there kept. That course, however, was not long generally pursued. The men, when enlisted and having received their bounties, would ask for a ""pass"" for a few days, to regulate their family affairs and to spend the bounty money for what themselves of their families needed. This seemed proper enough at the time, but experience proved that many of the men thus let go did not return, and were, in consequence, marked as deserters. The system was then commenced by many officers of retaining a large portion of the bounty, on granting a pass, in order to insure the return of the enlisted man. Those who had enlisted with the intention of going to the war, returned, of course, and claimed the remainder of their bounty money. But there were many who did not; and it is, at least, remarkable that of those who did not return very few have been arrested. Of the (about) six thousand men who received the bounties in the City of Brooklyn, and the immensely larger number who received the bounties in this City, it is not believed that much more than one-half are now connected with the army by reason of their first enlistment. In this connection it is proper to say that the charge of giving passes to men, while withholding the principal portion of their bounties, and taking no other measures to insure their return to camp, does not, of course, apply to officers whose desire to fill up their companies and regiments was paramount to every other. But, nevertheless, the fact is notorious among officers and privates that an immense amount of money has been taken from the resources for bounties, and that the men credited for receiving it are reported ""missing.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS.; Great Swindling in the Payment of Bounties to Soldiers.

Editorial sees Nashville area endangered; Editorial on Anti-Slavery Party in Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/28/archives/the-antislavery-sentiment-of-england.html,Editorial sees Nashville area endangered; Editorial on Anti-Slavery Party in Great Britain,"Two of our City cotemporaries, wide as the poles asunder on almost every other point, agreed lately in expressing their opinion that the Anti-Slavery Party in England had always inveighed against Slavery before the war, for the express purpose of bringing about a dissolution of the Union; and has taken to defending and palliating Slavery since the war begun, for the purpose of making a restoration of the Union impossible. This is the opinion of the Tribune, and the World triumphantly concurs in it. The attitude of England toward the Secessionists is, however, a phenomenon of sufficient interest to prevent its being disposed of in this remarkably easy and off-hand way. This mode of explaining it is precisely that to which a ""pot-house politician,"" as DICKENS paints him, or the editor of an Arkansas weekly journal, as we all know him, would be likely to resort. There is no error into which weak and provincial wits are so apt to fall in endeavoring to solve political mysteries, as that of applying to the conduct of great masses of men the same rule used in calculating the aberrations of a defaulting clerk, or of a dissipated cobbler. And very frequently philosophers, whose range of vision has been very much wider, labor under the same delusion. All England has, for the last year or two, been sitting at the feet of Mr. JAMES SPENCE, of Liverpool, and receiving from his lips the explanation of every incident of the great civil war in America. The basis of that gentleman's theory of our troubles is the hypocrisy -- arrant and unblushing hypocrisy -- of the Republican party in their professions of hostility to Slavery. He says they not only do not dislike Slavery, but have never disliked it, and have used it simply as a party cry, in order to get the gentle and patient South into their power for purposes of spoliation and insult. The worst of all this is, that he has got a large portion of the English public to believe him; and it is evident that some of our political instructors here give us credit for similar stupidity and credulity, when they inform us that the Anti-Slavery fever in England was simulated in order to cover a fiendish design upon the American Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anti-Slavery Sentiment of England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anti-Slavery Sentiment of England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/079fd8da-8aff-5abf-9459-5eb09177356f,1123,nyt://article/079fd8da-8aff-5abf-9459-5eb09177356f

Tom Thumb, who, it says, is but 26 years of age, and has amassed enough money not only to render himself, but his mother, two sisters and a younger brother independent. ""His habits,"" it says, ""are unexceptionable, and his intellect and general business ability are such that he personally attends to his own finances, and transacts all the business appertaining in leasing his houses, loaning his money on bond and mortgage, and looking after his estate in general. He owns a fine yacht, bearing his own name, which he sails himself with as much as nautical skill as any 'old salt' who sails out of Bridgeport harbor. He also keeps a fine pair of Shetland ponies and a splendid fast horse for his own driving, as well as a highly-trained pair of hunting dogs. His rifle and fishing tackle were of course made expressly to suit his diminutive size, and he is a very successful sportsman. He killed several deer which traveling West last year. A few months since the little General was made a Freemason. He has already taken three degrees, and expresses a determination to ascend the mystic ladder until he has reached the top round. Although Gen. Tom Thumb has always led a life of excitement, and twice after retiring to private life has felt compelled to exhibit himself again, to keep off the ennui, he remarked to the writer of this article last week, while quietly twirling his elegant little moustache, of which he seems quite proud, that he hoped one of there days to get married, 'in which event' he added, with a roguish look, 'I guess that the cares of a family, added to my ordinary duties, will give me enough to occupy my attention and prevent the necessity of again seeking the excitement of a traveling exhibition!'

Cutting, lying opposite Bedloe's Island, which resulted in the death of the second mate, named THOMAS HUTCHINSON. The crew had been shipped that afternoon, and the ship was on the eve of taking her departure from this port to Liverpool when the melancholy occurrence took place. HENRY OLIVER, the sailor who committed the offence, was arrested by the Harbor Police soon after the affair took place, and held to await an investigation. The circumstances, as gathered from the officials who made the arrest, are as follows: A difficulty between HUTCHINSON and OLIVER had occurred during the previous afternoon, while the vessel was getting ready for sea. In the course of the altercation OLIVER had remarked that he would strike the second mate. At about 9 o'clock in the evening, the crew in the forecastle became quite boisterous, and HUTCHINSON, the deceased, as an officer of the ship, went down to see what was the trouble. When the latter arrived there, it is said that he began to abuse OLIVER, who at this time was lying in his bunk, and the former repeated the taunts and threats used by him in the previous difficulty. During this altercation HUTCHINSON, it appears, struck OLIVER several blows while the latter was in his berth. OLIVER at once drew a revolver and fired two shots in quick succession, the balls taking effect in the head and body of the mate. The victim died almost immediately. Capt. TODD, with a posse or men, boarded the vessel, and took into custody the offender, and also the other members of the crew as witnesses.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Homicide on Board the Ship Francis B.

We are all in the dark now as to the army of Gen. ROSECRANS. We only feel sure that it is strong enough to take care of itself, provided it has food enough to subsist on. But just here is the doubt. It is believed that Gen. ROSECRANS has not advanced upon the rebels at Murfreesboro, because the railroad to Louisville was not equal to the work of supplying his great army. He was supposed to be waiting for a rise in the Cumberland River, so as to be able to use that stream in supporting his advance. If this be correct, the position of Gen. ROSECRANS -- now that he is out off from Louisville -- is not a comfortable one. It will not do to evacuate Tennessee in order to feed his army.

From Aspinwall the news was borne across the Isthmus to Panama; and from Panama, conveyed north along the Pacific coast several thousand miles to San Francisco; and from San Francisco it is sent back toward the East, four thousand miles overland, to New-York City.

BANKS on assuming command. The first duty assigned to Gen. BANKS is the opening of the Mississippi, in conjunction with the expedition going down the river from Cairo, and already a portion of his forces had gone to Baton Rouge and taken possession of that city, and preparations were being made for an attack on the rebel fortifications at Port Hudson, fifteen miles above -- unless, indeed, the rebels had already evacuated that point, which was rumored in New-Orleans when the Potomac left. A report was also in circulation that Vicksburgh had been evacuated; but this is probably an error, as we should ere this have heard of such an occurrence by way of Memphis and Cairo. The change in Commanders in the Department -- which, by the way, now includes Texas -- of course created considerable excitement in New-Orleans. Gen.

The novelty of this picture consisted in its having a likeness of the respective gentlemen, inclosed in a wreath worked out of their hair. This novel piece of work was executed by the wife of Rev.

editorial on replacement,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/12/29/archives/the-black-flag.html,editorial on replacement,"The legislation of all the Slave States, even in time of peace has, so far as related to slave property, been of a very desperate character. In it all the ordinary restrictions imposed by humanity, civilized usage and sound principles of criminal jurisprudence, have been entirely disregarded. The one great object of the slave code has been to strike the greatest possible amount of terror into slaves and ""Abolitionists;"" and for this purpose cruel and unusual punishments have always had a preference. Cases occurred too, every year, in almost every county, in which the law, sanguinary and ferocious as it was, was found too slow or too mild to satisfy public feeling, and the mob was left to work its own wild will by burnings alive and torturings of greater or less atrocity. If we had chosen to conduct the war with religious respect for Slavery, and had cautiously forborne to meddle with it, this savage policy might, perchance, never have been put into force against us. Not that the Southern mob would not have devised it, for the propriety of hoisting the black flag has been a subject of discussion and commendation in the Southern papers ever since the battle of Bull Run; but the leaders were too wary to resort to it, as long as our intentions touching the ""institution"" were harmless.

Both being persons of intemperate habits they often quarreled and during their troubles HEENY would beat her in a brutal manner. Last Tuesday evening, while engaged over their cups, they had an angry altercation concerning the right of possession to a bank-book; and after HEENY had struck and badly cut his sister about the face, he dragged her to the top of the stairs, and giving her a violent push, hurled her headlong to the bottom. Not content with this murderous act, he ran down stairs, and, in the most inhuman manner, stamped upon her prostrate form; and when remonstrated with for his brutality, HEENY replied that she was drunk. The woman then being quite insensible, HEENY flung her across his shoulder, with the intention, as he said, of taking her to the Station-house.

On reassembling, the veto massage of the Mayor, on the resolution appointing 162 Commissioners of Deeds, overruled by the Councilmen the day previous, was called up for action. Mr. BOOLE thought the objections of the Mayor were inconsistent, because it would be quite in impracticable matter to settle the legal difficulty respecting the excess of appointments by limiting the number of new appointments. The most feasible plan of adjustment -- and the one which the Common Council would strive to have carried out -- was to have a law passed legalizing the acts of all the appointees. Such a law would set at rest all questions of doubt concerning the acts of Commissioners of Deeds in the City, since their number has exceeded 300. The Board concurred in overruling the veto. No further business of importance was transacted.
