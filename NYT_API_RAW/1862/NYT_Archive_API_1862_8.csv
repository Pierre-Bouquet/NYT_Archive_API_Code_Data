The order was recently made at the General Term, as will be remembered. Counsel for the plaintiffs asked the Court to postpone the matter until the September General Term, that the plaintiffs might be enabled to apply for a stay of proceedings and the continuance of the injunctions until the appeal about to be taken in the case is settled. Counsel thought, that as the interests involved were so vast and important, as well to private parties as to the public, the Court should lay the matter over until after the vacation. Besides, the Supreme Court of this District had pronounced against the validity of these grants, by a large majority; Justices STRONG, ROOSEVELT and CLERKE, had declared the original grant in the case of the Ninth-avenue void, and Justices DAVIES, HOGEBOOM and LEONARD had held like opinions. Counsel also thought, although Justice SUTHERLAND in the recent decision at the General Term had concurred with Justice WELLES, who pronounced the opinion of the Court, that his case was still rather one of conviction than of conversion. In ordinary cases where irreparable damage and mischief would result unless the hands of parties were stayed, the Court would interfere where final judgment could be obtained without delay. This was one of those cases calling for such an act of the Court. The decision was rendered in this case in the middle of vacation, more than a year after argument, at a time when counsel were absent -- plaintiff's counsel having no information that the decision was to be rendered. The other parties, it seemed, were present, or at least some of them, at the rendering of the decision. Counsel made some comments on the keen olfactories of the grantees, who, it appeared, knew in advance every move to be made in respect to these roads as well as in the Courts or in the Legislature.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; The Railroad Cases Settlement of the Orders and Appeal Therein.

The new act has been repeatedly reprinted, but always with swarming errors. The synopsis now offered embraces the entire body of existing duties, whether named or not in the new law, and is, we flatter ourselves, digested with so much judgment, accuracy and regard to convenience, and printed with such fidelity as to give peculiar value to its columns.The careful study of this paper is suggestive of several things beyond the probable price hereafter of linseed and Cambrai laces. Of this principally: the advanced rates are due, not to any discrimination adverse to English or French commodities, but wholly to the exigencies of our own domestic condition. It is important to have this point clearly fixed in the mind, for nothing strikes the eye more frequently in the columns of European papers in the interest of secession, than the ascription to our Government of resentful motives in adopting the present policy of elevated duties. The charge is grossly unjust; but so persistently has it been urged by the agents of secession, and repeated by their sympathizers in England and France, that it has come to be a principal rock of offence. We are charged with not only waging wanton war upon the South to induce it to submit to protective tariffs, but with having used protective tariffs to punish the European Powers for too hastily acknowledging the belligerent rights of the South, and in other ways lending the rebellion aid and comfort.The tariff has been subjected to alteration for no reasons not strictly connected with the demands of revenue. The war found the Treasury wholly dependent upon the Customhouse. So far from any internal system of revenue being in existence, the mere necessity of such a system had never been contemplated, and, in fact, had never even been suggested or advocated by any of our statesmen. To abandon at once our old methods, and enforce new ones called into being at a moment's notice, was, of course, out of the question. The alternative was to make the most of the weapons we held; and, as the tariff was our principal weapon, and was losing its efficacy, prudence suggested higher duties. They were twice elevated last year; not to damage England or France, or to send grief into the hovels of Manchester and Mulhausen, though both these results necessarily followed the legislation. It was simply one effort out of many to preserve our national integrity, which is the admitted first law of national existence. The Southern blockade, which withheld cotton from the foreign spinner, was a terrible, if not a mortal blow at the wealth and welfare of France and England. But who, because it entailed these evils, has been malignant enough to found upon it charges of deliberate hostility to those countries on the part of Mr. LINCOLN and his Administration?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Tariff Its Effect upon our Foreign Relations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Tariff Its Effect upon our Foreign Relations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73df9266-6086-57f8-aecf-569d88b46da6,579,nyt://article/73df9266-6086-57f8-aecf-569d88b46da6

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/01/archives/military-matters-in-brooklyn-the-second-senatorial-district.html,,"The recruiting business has increased so rapidly during the last few days, that the Senatorial Committee appointed by the Governor, for the Second District, feel warranted in proceeding at once to raise the regiment as originally premeditated. The Committee held a meeting on Wednesday night, when the subject was discussed in all its bearings, and all present were of opinion that with proper effort a regiment could be raised in a very short period of time. Capt. ANTHONY CONK, late of the Brooklyn Fourteenth, has been selected as a proper person to take command of the new regiment, and he was busily engaged all day yesterday in making the preliminary arrangements for recruiting. Dr. HALL, member of Assembly from Jamaica, was before the Committee for permission to join the regiment with a company he is now raising -- having already some twenty-five or thirty men. Permission was granted, and the Doctor expects to have his company the first that is mustered into the service. Hon. SAMUEL S. POWELL was appointed Treasurer of the Committee, and WM. M. THOMAS' PHILIP H. GROGAN and JOHN H. FRENCH were appointed as an Executive Committee. STEPHEN H. CROWELL, JOHN H. FRENCH and DEMAS STRONG, with the Chairman and Secretary of the Senatorial Committee, were appointed as a Committee on Finance, to raise money to defray the necessary expenses of raising the regiment. It was decided to make such arrangements that each recruit, by making an allotment of a portion of his pay, shall secure the payment of the same, on the first day of each month, to his family during his absence. This is an important matter, as heretofore the troops, through the ignorance of officers, have been paid very irregularly, and the families of soldiers have suffered in consequence of not receiving regular remittances. Under the proposed arrangement, the wife of a soldier will receive the allotment regularly the first of each month, whether the soldiers are paid monthly or not.

"The present situation of the army of Gen McCLELLAN most certainly looks unfortunate, if not precarious, from this distance.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/01/archives/our-army-on-the-james.html,,"The present situation of the army of Gen. MCCLELLAN most certainly looks unfortunate, if not precarious, from this distance. Our information as to the precise location of the various rebel forces opposing it is not very clear or minute; but we understand, at least, that the enemy still maintain their lines south of the Chickahominy, in MCCLELLAN's rear; that they are massing heavy bodies of troops (with what object does not appear) on the opposite side of the James; that they hold the line of the same river, between him and Richmond, and that either bank is studded with forts and batteries next to impregnable; while below him, both sides of the river again are in their hands for some distance -- how far we have not been told. Our naval contingent has not yet been troubled to any extent by rebel batteries between Hampton Roads and Harrison's Point; but we have had intimations not a few that the rebels are building earthworks and planting batteries under cover of the woods and other natural safeguards, which may suddenly open upon our fleet with most dangerous results. We have now to keep a strong and active naval patrol, night and day, shelling the banks at every suspicious point; but the insecurity of this, under the circumstances, is apparent to all. MCCLELLAN's lines of communication -- his only line, that by the James River -- is thus rendered precarious; and his position, though originally a strong and valuable one -- and still strong for defence, against a land attack -- is one whose present availability for the purpose for which our army is on the Peninsula, is more than dubious. It would be quite impossible for him, even with a largely augmented force, to advance from it against Richmond, for he has but one practicable route, along the north bank of the James, and that could not well be more impracticable than it now is -- as there are elaborate earthworks and forts, covering all the defensible positions upon the thirty miles of ground between Harrison's Point and Richmond.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Army on the James.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Army on the James.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f65b5141-c538-5b12-a919-f191be09d2e8,840,nyt://article/f65b5141-c538-5b12-a919-f191be09d2e8

Editorial urges safeguards against boiler explosions in ships,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/02/archives/boiler-explosions-government-ships-and-remedies.html,Editorial urges safeguards against boiler explosions in ships,"Fires, collisions, shipwreck, and all the results of bad engineering, come round in turn. If common disasters did not pale before war, this would be known as the boiler-explosion term. Seeing that the Government has nearly three hundred steam vessels of its own; that the most momentous issues may hang on the safety of either of them, and that it can at little cost do what individuals will not -- ascertain the cause and cure of a terrible and frequent disaster -- boiler explosions -- the attention of some board or bureau should, be at once directed to this inquiry. At length the information is at hand by which the proper direction of inquiry and definite results may be ascertained; and any further delay in settling this question is inexcusable. Recent discoveries, and the narrowing down of the list of possible causes, by actual trial have placed the great fact almost within reach. Some of the highest authorities are already satisfied. In the first place, the lately received theories of explosions appear to be exploded themselves. That electricity or any gas that can be generated in a boiler cannot account for its explosion, is settled by repeated experiment. A popular theory is ""low water."" It would be just as explicit to say ""water."" Low water is not an exploding power -- it is only a circumstance. When the heating surfaces are allowed to get red hot, other phenomena, may indeed occur. The steam in the steam-room may be superheated. But it appears to be a mathematical fact that there is not sufficient heat in this steam, when heated nearly to redness, to vaporize enough water to cause an exploding pressure. Or, water may be suddenly vaporized upon a red-hot metallic surface. But it is an experimental fact that there is not heat enough in all the metal thus overheated to make the steam pressure required for an explosion. Again, it is urged that explosions are only exaggerated ruptures, and that all boiler bursting is attributable to want of strength to carry ordinary pressures, with their normal variations. But the results of the two phenomena are totally different. A rupture is always in the weakest part, and just large enough to relieve overpressure. An explosion shatters everything -- strong and weak alike.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Boiler Explosions, Government Ships and Remedies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Boiler Explosions, Government Ships and Remedies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1dbf7332-6185-5143-8b7c-2721b85216f0,869,nyt://article/1dbf7332-6185-5143-8b7c-2721b85216f0

Editorial on pro-secession sentiments in Canada; Editorial sees reasons for optimism in Union cause,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/02/archives/the-union-cause-in-canada.html,Editorial on pro-secession sentiments in Canada; Editorial sees reasons for optimism in Union cause,"It is not surprising that we should see in the public sentiment of the Canadian Provinces traces of that same hostility toward this country which crops out so manifestly now and then in England. There are so manyen there who are but temporary residents, looking forward to a speedy return to England whence they came -- so many men who are dependent upon the Home Government for place and power -- so many whose habit of mind has always been to look to England as the source of power and excellence, and to English judgment as the sole arbiter upon all questions, that no other state of things could have been expected. Moreover, from its nearness to our soil, and the ease of communication with us, Canada has become the abiding place of shoals of Secessionists. Southerners who could not get through our lines, or preferred not to encounter the privations of a life in rebeldom, and Northern traitors, who have found their own region too hot to hold them, have all gathered upon our Northern border; and there they stay, watching every movement at the North, and doing all in their power to work us ill, to foment jealousies of us among the people, and to increase that hostility which the influences which come across the water had already set on foot. And hence it is no wonder that even among a people so near us as the Canadians, and who have so good opportunities for knowing the rights of the controversy in which we are engaged, and for judging of the results of our success or our defeat, there are to be found most erroneous views, most hostile judgments and most malignant falsehoods. Secession bears no different fruit there from what it bears elsewhere, and its sympathizers are no different there from what they are elsewhere. If our readers wish to see how malignantly, with what utter disregard of truth, with what utter lack of logic, and what intense twisting and wrenching of facts, a sympathizer with secession can write, they need not go so far away as to search the columns of the London Herald. Let them read any leader in the Montreal Advertiser on our affairs, and they will find what they want to perfection. We have rarely seen more lies in the same number of lines than we have found in its editorial columns.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Union Cause in Canada.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Union Cause in Canada.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4076d4da-a180-5f2d-8d7d-906063989060,1064,nyt://article/4076d4da-a180-5f2d-8d7d-906063989060

It is difficult to conjecture what is anticipated by Gen. MCCLELLAN's army. Isolated in a hostile country, with enemies swarming in every bush, bivouacked in every grove, latent behind every point of vantage, outnumbering our diminished force three to one, -- so daring as to capture a schooner in mid-river where the water is covered with National vessels, and so active that their batteries present themselves daily at some new spot on the bank; with all these intimations that the rebels have not laid down their arms, or offered an armistice, it might be supposed that our troops could not be surprised by any attack -- that our Generals would always be prepared and on the watch. An attack from the very quarter whence this was made has certainly been anticipated by the people at large, and has, in fact, been for several days a principal source of public anxiety. There has seemed to be no reason why the enemy -- holding the entire south bank of the James, and able to bring his artillery and mortars to bear upon the National encampments and gunboats -- should not shower a storm of shot and shell into our lines at any moment.

Another cause was, the injuries that Wagram had sustained by the accident in the three-mile-heat race with Idlewild on the last day of the meeting, preventing him from again encountering that celebrated mare until he was entirely recovered; and as the second meeting of those two famous racers was regarded with the deepest interest by the Boston patrons of the turf, it was deemed advisable to postpone Mr. CASSADY's complimentary testimonial to the Fall, when the exciting contest between the two horses will add to the eclat of the meeting.

But the Coroner who has the case in charge does not believe that any murder has been committed, but to the contrary, believes the story of the proprietor of the place, whose statement is confirmed by another witness -- that the trunk in which the hands were found, was brought to his place to be stored two years ago, and that the blacksmith knew nothing of the contents. Unfortunately the blacksmith is a negro, and the semi-secesh Press are endeavoring to raise a hue and cry about the matter which the facts so far as they are developed do not warrant. One of these presses describes the hands as evidently belonging to ""a hardworking girl"" -- they might have added an Irish girl, as was done with such results in Chicago, and not to fan the growing excitement they have created in the minds of some of the lower class of Irishmen against negroes; while another Press, doubtless to furnish fuel and fire the ""conservative"" heart, describes the hands as ""soft and delicate, and must have belonged to a lady.""

On his arrival he was shown to the chief officer's quarters, and subsequently inspected the ship's battery. The commandant's official barge also bore the American Admiral's white flag at the fore. When Admiral PAULDING had concluded his visit, the Stars and Stripes were sent to the foremast-top of the Frenchman, and immediately the famous salute, which will be recorded when there is no HIRAM PAULDING among our Admirals, was fired with remarkable precision. Every ear at the Navy-yard was all attention to the number of guns. ""One, two,"" down to ""fifteen,"" were counted by dozens of persons. When the last gun went off, the cry, ""Hurrah for the navy! there's an Admiral in it at last!"" was reechoed from mouth to mouth.

Editorial proposes US send grain to Great Britain and Ireland as famine relief,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/03/archives/american-intervention-in-foreign-af-fairs-no-longer-avoidable.html,Editorial proposes US send grain to Great Britain and Ireland as famine relief,"-- Disguise the fact from ourselves as we may, the time has certainly arrived when American intervention in the affairs of Europe has become a necessity. Ireland is starving. England, her natural ally and protector, is powerless to help, for she herself is rapidly approaching a similar unfortunate condition.

Editorial on women's role in war; Editorial proposes ways to handle traitors; Editorial holds Union too slow in winning war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/03/archives/the-women-and-the-war.html,Editorial on women's role in war; Editorial proposes ways to handle traitors; Editorial holds Union too slow in winning war,"One of the features of this civil war, which, it is to be hoped, will not escape the notice of the historian, is the part women have taken in it. Probably the greatest peculiarity of American society is the kind of equal sympathy which women have in all the earnest affairs of the men. Whatever folly our public declaimers may have uttered year after year on ""Women's Rights,"" practically, the women of America have ""rights and privileges"" in all that man does, and feels, and possesses, through the best medium -- her sympathy. During all the long contests of principle which preceded this war, and of which it was the legitimate fruit, it is not too much to say that the great body of the women of the Free States stood firmly on the side of liberty and justice. The women, far more than the men in the North, have always been, in feeling and instinct, opposed to the Southern ""sacred institution."" When the war broke out, though acting the true part of women in calming rather than irritating hot passions, their loyalty to the Government showed itself as even more fervent, if less noisy, than in most of the men. With silent zeal and eagerness, they sat themselves down to intense and constant labor in preparing what should soothe the fevered pulse of the poor sick soldier, or should bind up his wounds, or administer to his health, or relieve the monotony of his desolate life in the hospital. Everywhere throughout the land, in distant mountain vallies, in farm-houses, in city palaces, in the West and on the seaboard, the little circle of American women met to ply with nimble fingers the needle for the camp and the hospital. Not being able to risk their own lives, they seemed to feel that too much could not be done for the brave men who were risking all for their common and beloved country. The vast stores of articles, the innumerable boxes of lint, the bales of shirts, drawers and clothes of every kind, the rolls of bandages, the quantities of jellies, wines, cordials, and comforts of every description, which have been sent on to Washington to the Sanitary Commission, or to individual regiments by our women, surpass belief. Wherever a hospital happens to be established near a Northern or Western city, the bounties poured out on the sick soldiers by fair hands are beyond all computation, and the only trouble seems to be that the poor men receive too many good things rather than too few. Happy the wounded private soldier who is carried to a Northern hospital. The wealthiest and fairest of our ladies are only too glad to relieve his hours of suffering. And what if this be sometimes overdone, and, as in the much laughed-over instance of a poor private in our Park hospital, he be asked by fourteen different ladies in one morning, ""if they could wipe his fevered brow."" We may be sure that the abovementioned private enjoyed it, and that these attentions of pretty and refined women are the payment which these brave fellows most of all value for their patriotic services. As we have no medals or crosses of honor, or titles, or ranks, for distinguished services, the flattering and kind attention of a grateful people takes their place. We need not speak of the noble and self-sacrificing deeds of our women as nurses and attendants on the sick at the seats of war -- many of them leaving the highest positions and comforts to work in the hospital-ship, and to bind the wounds and wash the sores of our poor soldiers; others writing their last letters, or attending to the last messages of love at death; and doing all this, not merely to our own men but to enemies -- to the rebel wounded as well.

FOX and J.W. LINGARD. Mr. GEO. L. FOX and LINGARD were formerly co-partners in the management of the New Bowery Theatre, but a misunderstanding between the managers led to a dissolution of partnership, Mr. FOX agreeing, so it is affirmed by Mr. LINGARD, not to appear for one year on the east side of Broadway in any theatre or place of amusement. Mr. FOX accordingly opened the New Olympic, late Wallack's Theatre, on Broadway, and a brief season closed up the house. The Old Bowery Theatre was shortly afterward secured, and the management announced as ""FOX,"" but whether it was GEORGE L. FOX, or his brother, CHAS. K. FOX, no one could discover, Mr. LINGARD, it is said, kept on the alert for the appearance of GEORGE L. FOX, but he was not down on the bills. The season closed, and the Old Bowery, after a thorough renovation and redecoration, was opened a week ago. Yesterday large placards, pasted upon brick piles, fences, old buildings, and theatre boards, announced the following fact: ""G.L. FOX appears to-night at FOX's Old Bowery Theatre."" This led to the issuing of an injunction, on the application of Mr. LINGARD, who placed the papers in the hands of JOHNY MATTHEWS, a brother of the late PAT. MATTHEWS. The first piece on the bills, ""La Tour de Nesie,"" passed off with success, and the comic pantomime of the ""Schoolmaster,"" in which G.L. FOX was announced to enact the part of Master Bobby, followed. The pantomime had not proceeded far, when MATTHEWS rushed upon the stage and attempted to serve the injunction upon G.L. FOX. The intruder was instantly seized by CHAS. K. FOX, and the two clinched and fed upon the stage, rolling one over the other into the orchestra, amid the greatest excitement manifested by the audience. A moment afterward CHAS. K. FOX appeared on the stage (MATTHEWS having been ejected from the house) minus his wig and other theatrical trappings, and motioning for silence, spoke substantially as follows:",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Exciting Scene at Fox's Bowery Theatre.; ATTEMPT TO SERVE AN INJUNCTION UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF GEO.

"A Columbia (Tenn.) correspondent of the Louisville Journal, under date of the 21st ult., says Gen. NEGLEY detailed ten men from WOLFORD's Regiment and sent them out on a scout one day last week. As they returned on Thursday morning, some fifteen miles from Columbia and five beyond Mt. Pleasant, the two in advance were fired upon by some thirty guerrillas. They returned the fire, which checked the enemy for a moment, and they dashed past them toward our camp. The other eight, being some distance in the rear, fell back to the nearest house, and dismounted and secured their horses and awaited the advance of their foes. A large force soon made its appearance, and our boys opened fire upon them from the house, driving them back out of sight. They appeared again and again, and volley after volley was fired from each side. Neither, however, were near enough to do much damage, but two of the enemy were seen to fall, and were carried off by their comrades, and several more evidently wounded. They then got a woman, living near the place, to bear a flag of truce to our boys, and carry a note demanding their surrender. The note stated that their force was sixty in number, and that further resistance would be vain; but, it they would surrender, they would be well treated and paroled as prisoners of war. Lieut. ROBERTS refused to surrender, and all the men agreed to stand by him. He sent back word that ""they belonged to the First Kentucky, and that WOLFORD's Cavalry never surrendered, nor had any accepted parole as yet, and that they would do their best, and abide the consequences."" Firing again commenced on both sides, but our boys became more careful of their ammunition, only firing an occasional shot, to let them know their determination to fight to the last. This was kept up from 9 o'clock in the morning until perhaps 3 in the afternoon, when the enemy disappeared, no doubt anticipating the approach of reinforcements. Gen. NEGLEY sent two companies, under Capt. ALEXANDER, to their relief, but, before they came in sight the guerrillas had disappeared. Thus, for some six hours, did the gallant eight resist a force of sixty, and, without hope of reinforcements, they resolved never to surrender. Gen. BUELL has issued a special order congratulating the National soldiers engaged on their brilliant conduct, and contrasting it with that experienced by the troops who surrendered so ignominiously at Murfreesboro.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/04/archives/a-gallant-affair.html,,"A Columbia (Tenn.) correspondent of the Louisville Journal, under date of the 21st ult., says Gen.

We are sure our readers will rejoice and take courage. But Mr. VALLANDIGHAM is not too sanguine. He sees that it will take some time and some labor, that something has got to be done before that goal is reached. And what do our readers suppose it is that must be done to attain that end? Fill up the last call for volunteers? Take Richmond? Destroy Stonewall JACKSON? Make Vicksburgh an inland town? Hang JEFF. DAVIS? Overrun all the Gulf States? Break down the military despotism which now rules over them? Emancipate the negroes? Carry out the confiscation act? Adopt a more stringent military policy or a more lenient one? None of all these things are necessary in the view of the Ohio patriot. The one thing needful is far different. It is not anything to be done in the military way. Labor and money spent in raising armies and training soldiers and preparing munitions of war are all thrown away, he thinks. Nor is it anything to be done in rebeldom. Things are all right there, you see. There is nothing there which interferes with the restoration of the Union. Take Mr. VALLANDIGHAM's word for that. We all who desire that restoration, must cease at once all these mistaken efforts which we are making, and, following the advice of this wise and honest statesman, turn our attention to ""annihilating the Northern Abolition Party,"" for this he assures us is the only way to a restoration of the Union. Let us see to it that the Republican-Union ticket which is to be nominated at Syracuse, is defeated. Let us elect FERNANDO WOOD, Mayor, or Governor, or United States Senator. Let us all take the Journal of Commerce, and none of us read the TIMES, or the Tribune, or the World, or the Evening Post, or the Independent, or the Commercial advertiser. Let us see to it that no one shall be appointed in the Customhouses or the Navy-yards who does not spell negro with two g's. Above all, let us read all Mr. VALLANDIGHAM's speeches, and by all means keep him in Congress instead of in Fort Lafayette.

"-The Committee on Enlistment of this City have issued a series of recommendations to the people, which we published yesterday. Among them is one which is worthy of repetition. They urge that ""it is a plain and imperative duty of the National and State Governments, without an exception, to organize, arm, equip, and make ready for service the whole militia of the States;"" and that ""it is the duty of every able-bodied man to arm himself and unite with some military organization, or if there be none convenient, to form with his neighbors a rifle club or other military association for drill and exercise in arms."" This is a good suggestion, and we trust it will be acted upon by the people at once. There are a hundred thousand fighting men within a radius of three or four miles around the City Hall. While it would do them all personally a great deal of good, it would add immensely to the military power and safety of the City and the nation to have them drilled in ordinary military tactics, and in the use of weapons.

But with such a tremendous force as this State and her sister Free States could put under arms, actually prepared and ready to use those arms, there would be no doubt of the issue of this war, and little danger of any others. It would take but little time from those whose time is already fully occupied.

He says that on the night of the 22d, a flag of truce came in from the rebels, and, through a mistake, some four or five on each side were killed outright or seriously wounded. The bearers of the flag were allowed inside of the pickets to the camp of Col. MUNDY, who sent them to Gen. MORGAN.

MUNDY, who said his orders would not permit him to go any further. In the meantime one of the soldiers out on duty saw the party and informed Gen.

While the country demands that the rebellion shall be crushed, the Government seems content with preventing or postponing its triumph. We have gone on the principle that it would die out of itself, -- that every day's delay was equivalent to a Union victory, -- and that so long as Washington was not captured and the Army of the Potomac was ""safe,"" the progress of the war was satisfactory. Our Government has been acting on the defensive from the beginning. We have governed our conduct by the conduct of the enemy. When they have increased their numbers we have increased ours. When theirs were supposed to be exaggerated we have stopped recruiting. Thirty days have elapsed since they drove back our army in front of Richmond, and satisfied the country that they outnumbered us two to one. From that day to this every railroad in the South has been swelling the numbers of their army, -- thousands and tens of thousands already organized, armed and in readiness for action, pouring in from every part of the Southern States, until now no one doubts that they have a force in Richmond three times as great as we can bring against them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future of the War The Government and the People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future of the War The Government and the People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc0a6434-a5c4-5111-b6c5-dced85f38fb3,1480,nyt://article/dc0a6434-a5c4-5111-b6c5-dced85f38fb3

Burr has again got himself into trouble in New-Jersey by ventilating his rebel sympathies too freely. Recently he announced a lecture in a rural neighborhood named Pascack, when, as we learn from a correspondent of the Paterson Guardian, he vehemently counseled resistance to the collection of taxes for sustaining the Government, and in various other ways displayed the cloven foot. This was too much for the loyalists of the place, and the lecture was brought to an abrupt termination after the fashion thus described: ""The fellow at last unmasked a battery, which, judging from the volley at once directed to the speaker, must have been a heavy one, though it was evidently manned by volunteers who as yet had never had much practice at the business. Soon, however, the engagement became general along the line, and eggs flying thick and fast, burst in alarming proximity to the speaker, till the brave Chauncey ordered a hasty retreat, double-quicked himself out of a back passage, got into a wagon he had in readiness for such service, and retreated in great disorder, and not even doing as much as to stop and bid a fellow good-bye.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fba05b75-0578-5003-94f7-3d020b76e597,1257,nyt://article/fba05b75-0578-5003-94f7-3d020b76e597

She left Aspinwall on the 26th of July. Her treasure list foots up nearly a million dollars. Our correspondence, giving details of intelligence from the United States of Colombia, and Central and South America, will be found interesting. There had been some excitement on the Isthmus, arising from reports, apparently well founded, that a large body of men would soon make their appearance at Panama, ""to aid the Governor in quelling the spirit of insubordination recently displayed."" We interpret this as signifying an attempt to drive out the small body of troops dispatched thither some weeks ago by President MOSQUERA. Another excitement was produced at Panama by an order from the Bishop to take all the valuable ornaments and jewels from the churches and deposit them in some safe place, to prevent their falling into the hands of Gen. MOSQUERA, should he issue an order for their confiscation. There was a general outcry raised when the valuables were being removed from the Church of Santa Ana, the women turning out in great force, and threatening to offer resistance. A party of about, fifty soldiers, belonging to MOSQUERA's garrison, seized the muskets and ammunition belonging to the police force of Panama, on the 22d, removing the booty to the barracks. The reason assigned for that step was to guard it from being stolen by the conservatives. A number of the police had previously gone to Veraguas to join the Governor, who is now collecting a force at that place. From rumors afloat it is not improbable that Panama will soon be declared under military government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1f0e4493-0133-58f1-b2d3-4674399a360d,1138,nyt://article/1f0e4493-0133-58f1-b2d3-4674399a360d

The conclusion of the whole matter, then, is simply this, that the best system of harbor protection is that which includes both fixed and floating defences.

Than followed a succession of amusing sports, sack-races, climbing poles, gymnastic feats by the Turners, &c., and in the evening a superb concert, embracing the following programme: WERER's Jubilee Overture: The Chorus of Houris, from SCHUMANN's ""Paradise and the Peri,"" executed by the ladies of the New-York Sing Academie; a National Quodlibet, by KUNTZE, in which the Rheinische Saengerbund, the Uhlandbund, the Turner Liedertafel, and the Sing Academie Maennerchor united; A Hunting and Harvest Chorus for the Four Seasons, by HADYN, performed by the male and female chorus of the Sing Academie; and the Steuben National March, by KRUEGER, dedicated to the Seventh Regiment, N.Y.S.V., sustained by the entire musical force.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Relief for the Families of Soldiers.; GERMAN FESTIVAL AT JONES' WOOD."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Relief for the Families of Soldiers.; GERMAN FESTIVAL AT JONES' WOOD."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0dc5708-a20d-577f-9e3d-c6535d231e58,325,nyt://article/a0dc5708-a20d-577f-9e3d-c6535d231e58

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/06/archives/brooklyn-military-matters-how-the-order-for-drafting-is-received.html,,"The order authorizing the Governors of States to draft men for the war was the chief topic of conversation among our citizens everywhere yesterday, and the order was variously received. The ""Butternuts"" declared that it was another Republican ""outrage"" upon the free people of America, but far the greater portion of the people hailed the order with delight, as indicating that the Government intended for the future to prosecute the war with vigor to a speedy end. It was very generally believed that the draft in this city would call into service about two out of every three men subject to perform military duty; but with most people, going to war had no terrors, now that a vigorous policy was to be adopted. To relieve the minds of the timid, however, we will state, upon competent military authority, that the draft, if one is made at all in this city, will be a very light one -- 4,000 men will be about the quota of Brooklyn -- 2,000 uniformed militia, and about 2,000 of the ununiformed militia -- which will hardly make an appreciable difference in the population. But the place to see the real effect upon the ""Butternuts"" was at the City Clerk's Office, in the City Hall, where, for the small sum of twenty-five cents, the obliging clerks furnished every man that came along with a sworn statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the affidavit-makers, they are not fit subjects for military duty, and therefore not liable to be drafted. As drowning men are said to catch at straws, so did these poor fellows catch at this sum chance of escaping the fearful drafting ordeal. These certificates are not worth quite so much as the paper they are printed on; nevertheless, they were purchased in large numbers at twenty-five cents each. Hundreds of the ""Butternut"" tribe assembled in and about the City Hall at an easily hour in the morning, and the moment the Clerk's office was opened, and from that time until 2 o'clock P.M., the Clerk and his assistants were busily engaged in making out the much-coveted ""certificates.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN MILITARY MATTERS.; HOW THE ORDER FOR DRAFTING IS RECEIVED GREAT RUSH OF ""BUTTERNUTS"" TO THE OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK A DRUMMER CREATES A PANIC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN MILITARY MATTERS.; HOW THE ORDER FOR DRAFTING IS RECEIVED GREAT RUSH OF ""BUTTERNUTS"" TO THE OFFICE OF THE CITY CLERK A DRUMMER CREATES A PANIC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/316c1d01-14ce-52b4-906d-13bfb330a7b6,713,nyt://article/316c1d01-14ce-52b4-906d-13bfb330a7b6

He was wounded in the leg, but refused to leave the field long enough to have his wound dressed. He was in all the subsequent battles, including that of Malvern Hill. At the battle of Bull Run, last year, Mr. Harmon was First Lieutenant, but his Captain, now Maj. C.C. Gardiner, was sick, and the command of his company, devolved upon him. His regiment was the last to retreat on that memorable occasion. Regiments and companies were scattered, but Mr. S.M. Harmon got his company back to Washington safe and in order. He was in the battles of West Point and Fair Oaks, and his men and superior officers represent that he is a very brave and skillful officer. His company was recruited in Allegany Co., New-York State. As one who has done his duty so nobly, honorable mention is done for public justice, but also to gratify the numerous friends of his company in this State.

The question of putting Canada in a state of defence had again been debated in the House of Commons. I was generally contended that there was no danger of an invasion by the United States. Lord PALMERSTON closed the debate with the announcement that England had sent all the troops to Canada that she could, and that it rested with the Canadians to supply deficiencies. There was rather a general disposition manifested to leave Canada out in the cold. The French Admiral DE LA GRAVIERE, had embarked for Mexico.

The Circassian was captured in the vicinity of Havana, which port she claimed as her destination, by the United States gunboat Somerset. The papers found on board distinctly proved that her cargo was intended for the port of New-Orleans, then under strict blockade, and it was consequently condemned at Key West by Judge MARVIN, but transferred to New-York as the latter was considered to be much the better market for the goods.

Editorial on rush on NYC City Hall to file draft exemption papers,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/06/archives/a-word-to-exempts.html,Editorial on rush on NYC City Hall to file draft exemption papers,"BEWARE OF SHYSTERS. -- The rush or persons to the City Hall, for the purpose of filing exemption papers in the County Clerk's Office, has brought a flock of shysters to that locality, who have, for the past few days, driven a thriving business in exploiting the ignorance and credulity of the thousands who are now going on the errand just mentioned. It is fancied by many that every one, whether coming under the conditions that make him liable to military duty or not, is obliged to file exemption papers. Accordingly, hundreds and thousands, who are entirely out of the question of military duty or drafting (such as foreigners, persons under eighteen and over forty-five years of age, etc.,) are, under this false impression, running to the City Hall to do what they imagine to be their duty in the premises. These are eagerly seized by the shysters, who literally by hundreds invest the stairs, passages, subterranean lobbies, halls, rooms, etc., of the City Hall, and are either cajoled or coerced into some corner or chamber, (it is fortunate if the luckless ""subject"" escape being scrambled for by half-a-dozen of these creatures.) where exemption papers, for which the sharks charge from two to four shillings, are made out for them. They are then referred to the County Clerk's room, where they are swindled out of an additional shilling for a farcical ""filing."" Three-fourths of the persons who for the past two or three days have visited the City Hall are of this character; that is, persons who are not only ""exempt,"" but not liable for military duty or drafting at all, and who consequently are under no call to file any affidavit whatever it is only those who are technically ""exempt"" (who these are may be seen in an article on the subject in another column) that are required to do this. As for the others, they need not concern themselves in the least about the matter. Unless they are ""able-bodied white male citizens, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five"" they do not come within the provisions of the law at all, and even if drafted would immediately be relieved on proving non-liability.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A WORD TO EXEMPTS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A WORD TO EXEMPTS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc846daa-4825-51af-bd6a-31ae3e733654,394,nyt://article/fc846daa-4825-51af-bd6a-31ae3e733654

That adaptability to circumstances -- that readiness to accept a social or political change (a point of character which may be considered almost peculiar to the people of the United States), was never more strikingly exemplified. The only excitement openly manifested is by the foreign population. To them -- that is to the British and lush portion of their -- conscription is a sound of dread. Great Britain, in modern times, has never been engaged in a sufficiently important straggle on land, to require a levy en masse of her population, or even a recourse to forced enlistments. She had in the war with France, though, to press men into her naval service -- because it was at sea that she maintained the combat between the two countries. The press-gang is thought of to this day with honor, and the Briton believes his freedom from the conscriptive system of his despised French neighbor, the most conclusive corroboration of the truth of his perpetual assertion that he will 'never, never, never be a slave!"" It is with feeling of consternation, therefore, which to the American are inexpressibly ludicrous, that all late or existing subjects of Queen VICTORIA look upon our draft. They, are thoroughly convinced that it is the death warrant of our free institutions, and the sure siga of impending ruin to the country, Nothing can be more amusing than to hear them discuss the matter in their usual places of resort -- especially when this is done under the exciting influence of ""half-and-half."" Of course we refer only to the Briton of imperfect education. The next most amusing thing is their rush upon their overwhelmed and obliging Consul.

It is really an oppressive revelation to be in the neighborhood of Bowlinggreen, and have to tell every other person you meet that ""that is the place he wants; the building there with a portico and two stone lion guarding the front door."" There is not the slightest fear that Uncle Sam will kidnap his transatlantic cousins: but the cousins are insanely nervous upon the subject, and insist upon having enough papers to justify Lord PALMERSTON in sending over a fleet to blow New-York out of the water, if a single one of them suffers even the outrage of being called upon by Major PINCKNEY.

"The news we have had from Gen. MCCLELLAN's army, the last three or four days, shows a more cheering and hopeful condition of affairs than has existed since the battles of June. The vigor which Gen. HALLECK has brought to the conduct of the war is beginning to give forth its first fruits. The army is represented as being in as good condition and spirit now as ever it was. The men do not seem to be at all affected by the depression of feeling which has prevailed so extensively in the North; and their devotionto, and faith in their commander is as great as ever it was -- if we may credit the all but unanimous testimony of correspondents. The army's confidence and courage has doubtless also by this time been vastly augmented by the news of the prodigious musters of troops called for by the President, and by the way in which these calls are being responded to by the people. Our gallant soldiers will now sec that they are not to be left to wage hopeless battles with an enemy whose strength is twice or thrice as great as theirs; but that hundreds of thousands of comrades are hastening forward to stand by them shoulder to shoulder in their future contests. The order of the War Department peremptorily commanding all absentees who are capable of duty to return at once to field service, has already added to their strength hundreds of officers and thousands of men; and has had the best effect upon them. The employment of blacks as laborers has relieved them from a good deal of the excessive fatigue duty to which they have heretofore been subjected; and they sec that it is only the beginning of a policy which will relieve them from unendurable labors, and save to thousands of them life and health. Their sanitary condition is greatly improving, owing to their healthier location, the addition of vegetables and fresh meals to their diet, and the general improvement in spirits and prospect of active service. They see also that the large and splendid army of Gen. [???], or soon will be, in a position where it can act as a cooperating force; and that his movements forbid that they should be compelled to lie much longer on the sultry banks of the [???], watching against the as adults of a desperate and overpowering foe. More than all these in their good effects upon the soldiers, have been the daring and successful reconnaissance's made by detachments of the army within the past week. The first expedition toward the rebel line since Gen. MCCLELLAN reached the James, was mode a week ago to-day, when a force was sent northward, crossed the Chickahominy, penetrated as far as Gaines Hill, and found that, in that direction, there was no enemy for a distance of nearly twenty miles. This was followed, on the next day, by the expedition to the south side of the James River, which was altogether successful, and has resulted in the occupation, by Gen. PORTER's Division, of the high grounds on the south bank, from which the enemy menaced our encampment, and in the discovery that the rebels had no great force south of the Appomattox. Again, this morning, we learn of a series of reconnoissances, under the immediate direction of Gen. MCCLELLAN, made on Monday and Tuesday of this week, in the direction of Richmond, reaching to within ten miles of that city, and, after a series of brisk skirmishes, ending by the encamping of the reconnoitering parties upon Malvern Hill. The telegraph jubilantly announces that ""the Army of the Potomac has again assumed the offensive;"" and though as yet it necessarily does this on a small scale, it is sufficient to greatly encourage the troops, while the results and the discoveries made are highly gratifying to the country. The army is now all ready, in case the enemy should attempt to make an attack; and is eager for sufficient reinforcements, so as to be at once the attacking party.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/07/archives/movements-around-richmond.html,,"The news we have had from Gen.

He says: ""What I said was substantially this: That whilst this war was prosecuted for the putting down of rebellion, and the maintenance of the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was,' the Democracy would freely shed their blood, and liberally give their money, but so soon as it ceased to be a war for the suppression of rebellion, and became an Abolition war, no Democrat would be found willing to volunteer. I further remarked that the Government in all probability would make a draft for soldiers, and that that drafting would be in the hands of Republicans; that the party would want to keep Republicans at home to vote, and want to send Democrats away so that they could not vote, and that no fair draft would be made; and that if any Democrat believed that he had been fraudulently drafted, he would refuse to go, and that then a file of soldiers would be sent after him, and that under such circumstances he would resist, even at the point of the bayonet, and that in this way civil war would be brought upon us in Ohio. Not one word was said as advising resistance, but all was told as a vision of what would be future events. Now, Mr. Editor, let me repeat, as a warning to the Republicans, that no unfair or fraudulent drafting will be submitted to.

It was most desirable that Parliament should not separate without some distinct statement being made of the intentions of the Government as to the defence of Canada. It was their right and duty, as it was the right and Interest of the Canadians, to know what were the intentions of the Government in view of the possible If not probable dangers of the approaching Winter. In the first place, he would wish to know whether the Government considered that Canada was exposed to any danger. If not, why were 12,000 British troops retained in that colony; and if there was danger, to what did they look for defence against that danger? The noble lord at the head of the Government had urged upon the House the duty of protecting the country against invasion, but in respect of Canada, which was more vulnerable�, he had not urged any precautions either in this country or in the colony. At the commencement of last Winter, 12,000 British troops were sent out in great haste to meet an apprehended danger, and to enable Canada to prepare her means for self-defence. There was no Quixotic intention to defend Canada by means of forces sent from this country, nor to exempt the Canadians from military service; but the aid was sent to assist and to encourage them in preparing their own means of defence.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEBATE ON THE DEFENCE OF CANADA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DEBATE ON THE DEFENCE OF CANADA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a785d3b-2a12-53ce-9c4a-2c79e28ece14,3256,nyt://article/0a785d3b-2a12-53ce-9c4a-2c79e28ece14
Editorial on current lull in war,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/08/archives/multiply-the-incentives.html,Editorial on current lull in war,"""A peerage or Westminster Abbey,"" said NELSON, when he first descried the French fleet at anchor in the Bay of Aboukir. Fate was propitious this time, and the brave Admiral won the title which he bore till the fatal day of Trafalgar. But valued as was the distinction bestowed by his grateful country, it was probably not more highly prized by NELSON than was the simple copper medal, bestowed in acknowledgement of surpassing courage and devotion, by certain sailors and marines who helped to win the Battle of the Nile. Prize money is a capital thing in its way, and few honest tars object to receiving it; but the indestructible token of a nation's gratitude, which they may carry through life, and bequeath to their children, is a prize which money cannot buy, and which, to some natures, is the more powerful incentive. It is a silent but perpetual witness in favor of the character and worth of the wearer; and long after the prize money is scattered to the winds, its appeal has gained aid and asylum for the veteran, when decrepid age has left him no other resource.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Multiply the Incentives.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Multiply the Incentives.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d38ffb4-9b2d-5251-ac84-24ffee6b2ea9,620,nyt://article/0d38ffb4-9b2d-5251-ac84-24ffee6b2ea9

The people of Canada are pointedly told that it is of no sort of consequence to the English Government whether they remain a component part of the Kingdom or not. Now, Canada is one of the largest dependencies of the English Crown. It has cost the mother country many millions of pounds to hold and fortify it. It has cost many millions more to build railroads and canals, and immense bridges, to develop it. It has cost larger sums still to guard it against apprehensions of American cupidity, and to settle international quarrels growing out of the Northeastern boundary, the burning of the steamer Caroline, and the capture of the Confederate envoys by Capt. WILKES. Canada, from having been a poor and sparsely settled Province, has grown to be a respectable and comparatively prosperous country. It has never been of any pecuniary value to the British Government, but now is in a fair way to become so, if the population has intelligence and energy to make available the vast improvements that British wealth has introduced among them. It is just at this moment that English statesmen declare to the world that the retention of Canada is not an object of their desire, and that the people of Canada may assume their independence whenever they think proper to do so.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future of Canada English Insincerity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future of Canada English Insincerity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6afcd20f-1e41-51d3-9b15-78e12f6281c0,852,nyt://article/6afcd20f-1e41-51d3-9b15-78e12f6281c0

Alderman KANE offered a resolution directing that the same privileges be granted to Catholic ladies to teach children in the Almshouse as are extended to ladies of other denominations. Considerable discussion ensued, when the whole matter was laid over for future consideration. The object of this resolution is to divide the children into two classes, those of Catholic parentage to be taught exclusively by Catholic teachers, and those of Protestant birth to be taught by Protestants, instead of being taught together alternately by Protestants and Catholics, as at present.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e534244-5bfc-5a74-a85d-8e04a3d8baf1,538,nyt://article/9e534244-5bfc-5a74-a85d-8e04a3d8baf1

Of this serious decrease, more than nine-tenths was due to the falling off in the trade with the United States.

The boys who do business there will not tolerate anything that has the least squinting toward secesh, and they have a way of treating sympathizers with treason, which, though not quite so barbarous as the treatment dealt out to Union men by the rebels, has nevertheless proved quite effectual hitherto. Whenever a secession blower appears among them, they immediately chuck him into a barrel that has been used for keeping fish, and put another barrel of the same kind over his head. If the weather is warm, the fellow generally comes out a good Union man, in about five minutes; if it is cool, it sometimes takes longer, but never more than half an hour. Yesterday, a gray-headed butcher, named DIEBOLD MILLMAN, who has got himself rich by selling meat to loyal citizens, took it into his head to turn traitor, and began cursing the Government in the most approved secesh style. He ""would see them (the Government) d -- d, before he would allow his sons to join their d -- d Union army."" He soon had a large crowd of listeners around him, which only appeared to exasperate him still more, until finally his harangue became so violent and outrageous that the boys considered his case beyond the fish-barrel treatment, and began to talk seriously about hanging the old rascal. At this juncture, a policeman made his appearance, and, to save further trouble, arrested the speaker, and took him to the United States Marshal's Office, whither he was followed by about 50 persons, all ready to swear to his treasonable utterances. The Marshal being absent at Washington, the prisoner was taken to the Police Headquarters, and after remaining a short time in custody, he expressed his willingness to take the oath of allegiance, and denied that he was any other than a good Union man. As for his sons, whom he was charged with swearing that he would not allow to enlist, he said they had already enlisted in the Eighth Regiment. In view of these facts, and the apparent sincerity of his penitence, he was conducted before Commissioner WILMOT, when he took the oath of allegiance, and was allowed to depart. Whether the market boys will let him off so easily is uncertain, but should his secesh ever break out in a new spot, it is believed that the fish-barrel remedy will prove a ""ready relief.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; A Washington Market Butcher Blows Secesh, and Takes the Oath of Allegiance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; A Washington Market Butcher Blows Secesh, and Takes the Oath of Allegiance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5119e531-c182-5553-8d86-e2592ced984b,421,nyt://article/5119e531-c182-5553-8d86-e2592ced984b

The testimony adduced went to show that JOSEPH BARROW, alias Welsh, but familiarly known as ""Tipperary,"" a sailor belonging to the ship Dreadnaught, the deceased, and 'one or two other men, got into a right while partially intoxicated, and during the altercation MAGNER was stabbed. Directly after the fight, BARROW said to JAMES COLLINS, of No. 50 Oliver-street, then standing near, ""Let's get out of this -- I stabbed that man,"" and at that time COLLINS saw BARROW take a knife and put it into his pocket. BARROW then left, and at 3 o'clock the following morning applied for admission to the house of CHARLES MILLER. Being impatient, he burst in the door, and violently assaulted Mrs. MILLER. He then said, ""I have cut one man to-night, and will cut another before I leave this house."" At that time, Sergeant DE VOURSNEY, of the Fourth Precinct, came up and accosted BARROW, and took a sheath-knife from him. The prisoner was subsequently sent to Blackwell's Island for the assault on Mrs. MILLER, and after the death of his victim, Sergeant DE VOURSNEY, by order of Coroner COLLIN, proceeded to the Penitentiary and brought him down to await the result of the inquisition.

Editorial decries practice of conferring high military commands on civilians,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/09/archives/civilian-commanders.html,Editorial decries practice of conferring high military commands on civilians,"-- AN INJUSTICE TO OUR SOLDIERS. -- We are sorry to see the practice so largely continued of conferring high military commands on civilians, who know nothing whatever of military affairs, and who have not had even an hour's experience in the battle-field. Our past experience ought to have warned the Government against the fatal consequences of such a course, and there is less excuse for it now than ever before. There are scores and hundreds of subordinate officers in the Army, Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, Captains, Lieutenants, Corporals and Sergeants, who have won distinction by actual service in the field, --- who have led their men into the hottest of the fight, and done their duty with noble and conspicuous valor. These men are entitled to promotion, and the good of the service demands that they should receive it. Nothing can be more discouraging to such men than to see others put over them in high command, who have done nothing whatever to earn it, and nothing whatever to show their fitness for it. This system of political favoritism has been the bane of armies at all times, and has done enough already toward ruining ours to have arrested the attention of the military authorities. Gen. HALLECK ought to put a stop to it. A judicious and careful system of just promotions, not confined to the higher grade of officers, but carried all through the army and into the ranks, would do more than anything else to infuse military ardor into our troops, and make our armies formidable and effective.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CIVILIAN COMMANDERS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CIVILIAN COMMANDERS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/887c1854-349f-50cb-8516-757e67240c6b,260,nyt://article/887c1854-349f-50cb-8516-757e67240c6b

MCCOOK is one of the most melancholy and disastrous events of the war. There is not a single circumstance to redeem it from classification among the most wanton and savage butcheries that ever occurred in a civilized country. The General was a helpless invalid -- moving in an ambulance painfully along a highway. He came to a place of refreshing shade and cooling springs, and rested awhile to alleviate his sufferings. His name and rank became known to those who witnessed his stopping, and when he moved again it was soon found that his ambulance was followed by a treacherous foe skulking in the woods. They pursued till a place of convenient seclusion was reached, when they rushed upon the defenceless soldier, overturned his conveyance, and shot him as he lay helpless, pleading for life. A more cold-blooded and fiendish murder was never perpetrated by barbarous Indians than these guerrillas of Northern Alabama have been guilty of, and it is not surprising that the most intense excitement is stirred up in the West wherever the facts become known.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MURDER OF GEN.

The wasteful and sanguinary contest in America is generally regarded with angry impatience, for the suicidal folly of the Federalists is almost as provoking as the wanton injury which their policy inflicts on neutral foreigners. The respect which is due to heroic resolution and warlike aptitude has by degrees induced the great majority of Englishmen to withdraw their active sympathy from the baffled invaders, and at least to admire the indomitable resistance of the South. The dissentients apologize for their favorite Democracy on the ground that, in its extremest need, it has been unable to secure the services of a statesman, a general, or even of an honest man; but impartial observers cannot but suspect that there must be something wrong in the constitution of a society which deliberately submits itself to the authority of swindlers, of bullies and of charlatans. In the beginning, both parties had a plausible ground of quarrel, and bystanders are consequently influenced rather by the character and conduct of the disputants than by the merits of the original controversy. The Federalists have, from the first, had the questionable advantage of telling their own story, and of suppressing the statements and arguments of their opponents. The result is, that they have convinced all Europe of the incapacity of their Government, and of the hopelessness of their enterprise. By excluding foreign imports and by preventing the export of cotton they have, to the utmost of their power, identified the interests of England and France with the establishment of Southern independence; and in tolerating Gen. BUTLER's extravagant proceedings they have gone far to make recognition a point of honor as well as a measure of apparent expediency. Nevertheless, Mr. LINDSAY's motion was properly rejected by the House of Commons as unadvisable or premature. There is no room for simple mediation as long as the belligerents have no common basis of agreement. The South will only treat on the assumption of independence, and if the Federal Government were willing to concede the indispensable condition, peace would already be made. It would be idle to propose to the seceding States a mere revision of the Constitution; and the North, if it were prepared to accept separation and the frontier of the Ohio, would require no umpire to settle the terms of the unpalatable arrangement. The use of mediators is to save the honor of litigants who desire an adjustment, and not to enforce the abandoment of incompatible pretensions.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Impolicy of Intervention in the American Quarrel.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Impolicy of Intervention in the American Quarrel.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Saturday Review', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c087ac3b-39b4-5f98-889b-998e1335ead3,1505,nyt://article/c087ac3b-39b4-5f98-889b-998e1335ead3

It is truly surprising to see with what tenacious perversity these men cling to an alliance at best only founded on a corrupt expediency, and continue to glorify as an indispensable good the institution which no one of average intelligence and honesty could ever regard as better than a necessary evil. This alliance between the Slaveholders of the South and a clique of greedy demagogues at the North, has had full sway for a great many years, and we are now reaping its legitimate fruits. It can never exist again, for the storm which these men have evoked will not subside but with the utter destruction of the Republic, or the immolation of Slavery as a political power.

The most polished scholars mingle with the rude democracy in their warlike gatherings, excite them to heroism and self-denial by their example -- and with them join the army. Rich and heavy merchants march through the streets, bearing aloft the Star-spangled Banner, with their clerks and employes following in their wake; and after contributing lavishly of their wealth to the cause, enter the ranks. All party issues are forgotten -- all classes are fused together -- all interests are made to give way before the one overshadowing interest.

The order of Mr. STANTON, suspending travel in view of the draft, is practically impossible. Not only shall the outgo of foreign travel be stopped, but all intercourse between immediate neighborhoods is prohibited, and the existence of an invisible boundary line, between counties and States, is an insurmountable barrier to communication. We need hardly refer to the dweller in that anomalous house, which standing where the boundaries of New-York, Massachusetts and Connecticut converge, is in three States at once, and of which the owner cannot go from his dining-room to his parlor without incurring the Stantonian penalties. It is sufficient to name Mr. A., whose residence is in Jersey City, and whose place of business is in New-York, and who cannot pass from one to the other without liability to arrest; or Mr. B., who must pine in the solitudes of Brooklyn, because to visit his office in Wall or Water-street is exposure to untold punishments. With these daily duties the Secretary of War blunderingly interferes. Men who see the greedy Tax bill in the future, and groan at the probable effects of the tariff; men who have the possibility of a draft drawing them away for nine months from the thrifty prosecution of their vocation, are suddenly stopped from those pursuits upon which their uncertain future is intimately dependent.

"It is be regretted that in writing Ravenshoe Mr. HENRY KINGSLEY had so much time and paper at his disposal. For had he less of either, or simply a sufficiency of both, he would have made a better book.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/11/archives/new-publications.html,,"It is be regretted that in writing Ravenshoe Mr. HENRY KINGSLEY had so much time and paper at his disposal. For had he less of either, or simply a sufficiency of both, he would have made a better book. The story is well told, but theteller forgets that his hearers are not immortal, and have other duties to perform in life besides listening. And so he talks on against time, very much to his own amusement, undoubtedly, but greatly to the weariness of the reader. As the story progresses the plot becomes so complicated that one rather fears the author himself will not be able to untangle it. And gradually, too, the situations become so improbable, that we fancy the author is endeavoring to practice on our credulity; this very naturally begets a feeling of intense indignation on the part of the reader -- a feeling, however, which turns rather to the author's advantage than otherwise, as it keeps one from going to sleep at this prolix juncture, despite the many persuasions to slumber. The hero, Charles, is introduced to us in the first place as a sensible young man, full of life and spirit, and we like him. But subsequently he reveals himself as a complete muff, an incorrigible ninny. The moment that trouble comes upon him he sinks down into his shoes, as though his spine were of jelly instead of bone, and with the instincts and education of a gentleman persuades himself that his destiny in life is to be a groom; that, because birth did not bring his talents in a damask napkin, nothing remains for him but to bury them under a dunghill. But he isn't unfortunate, after all, if he only know it. By a double-shuffle-and-cut of the cards the author turns up his hero as trump, and the rightful heir of Ravenshoe after all. A pretty loving wife, and a fortune, await Charles if he can only be found. But he wont be. He hides himself under all manner of disguises, and in all corners of the kingdom, and Mr. KINGSLEY comes to his aid, prestidigitating him about in the most remarkable way. The young man is a pea, and Mr. KINGSLEY plays the part of a thimbie-rigger -- nowhere is the little joker to be found. Detectives are put on his truck, but fail to find him; little boot-blacks almost betray him, but not quite; and, finally, when discovery seems inevitable, he is whistled away to the Crimes to figure as one of the Light Brigade in the charge of Balaklava. It is coming this prestidigitorial display that the render's wrath becomes excited, and not his curiosity. All participating in this game of Hide and Seek behave so like consummate fools that one's only desire is to catch Charles and his friends -- the author included -- and knock their beads together until they become sensible, and go to work in a rational way. The perpetual game of cross purposes that is played provokes one. The excellence of the story in other respects [???] that the plot had not been simplifies and the hero permitted to fail into the open arms of his friends earlier in its course. [???] to pronounce Ravenshoe a book that would be good if it were not so long, long if it were not so good.

Being intimately acquainted with Gov.

I am also acquainted with the Hero of San Jacinto (Sam Houston.) His oldest daughter at this time is not more than fourteen or fifteen years old, and, at the time of the secession of the State, was not married. He states that Sam Houston was brought before the Legislature on a charge of treason, and that he made a speech against them and secession. ""The Secessionist rose and gathered about him, and for a while nothing was heard but pistols shots are the clanking of knives? This statement above is all false. At the time the Governor was deposed of his office, there was a meeting held on the grounds of the Governor's mansion. The Governor, also Gen. Hamilton, member of Congress, made very violent speeches against Secessionist and traitors. Hamilton, pointing to the Capitol said, 'There you will find the traitors,' upon which dozens of pistols were drawn, but not a shot was fired, nor was the 'clanking of knives' heard. This was the only time during the sitting of the Legislature and Convention that there was any extra excitement. The wound this Rev. C.H. Clark alludes to having received must have been invented for the occasion of making money out of the audience he was then addressing.

Within that time our strength has gradually been growing, until now it is double what it was at the opening of last month. Our army in Virginia -- taken as a whole and in its different Departments -- has been enabled to plant it-itself in far more favorable positions, as may be seen by observing the movements of POPE and BURNSIDE, to say nothing of MCCLELLAN; the cooperation, if not concentration, of separated columns, has been rendered practicable; the spirit of our troops has been improved; and our naval force has been greatly strengthened.

official report on death; Article on press of Great Britain,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/11/archives/the-english-press.html,official report on death; Article on press of Great Britain,"It is not an easy matter to decide how far the newspaper Press of any country represents the national feeling. Journalism in France, if not inspire, is, to a great extent, coerced by a rigid censorship, while, in most other European nations, public opinion is either too feeble to find expression through such a channel, or the Governments are too powerful and despotic to brook its inevitable opposition. But we must look to Great Britain to discover how far it is possible to distort journalism so as to rob it almost entirely of independence while still retaining the mask of free thought and free expression. Cliquism and caste are the controlling influences of the English Press, the almost sole exception to this rule being the ""kept"" papers -- an expression used in England to define the status of those journals which are supported, not by an honest circulation, but by this or that designing politician, and used, necessarily, to further his own immoral purposes. Nor is it difficult to account for the existence of such a state of things; indeed, it would be hard to show how it could be otherwise. Education, even of the commonest description, is there confined to the few, and intelligence can be claimed but by the ""upper classes"" of the nation. The English people know nothing of what is passing in the outside world unless it be through reports of occasional debates in Parliament, which they seldom if ever read, or the foreign correspondence of their papers, which possesses no interest for them. The newspaper Press of Great Britain is written for and sustained by the aristocracy and the upper portion of the middle classes, and, most naturally, it chimes in with their opinions and prejudices, however inconsistent may be its facts and deductions. Of late years, however, the progress of enlightenment, and, above all, the enormous increase of taxation, have awakened Englishmen to the necessity of reliable information upon passing events; the penny papers have started into being, and, within half a dozen years, have gone far toward reforming public sentiment on most questions. These papers may now be numbered by scores, and it bodes nothing but good to England and her people that the politics of these journals are progressively democratic. No wonder that the House of Lords long refused to consent to the repeal of the tyrannical Paper Duties; without such repeal the English oligarchy knew full well that penny papers were an impossibility, whilst the removal of the impost presaged indubitably a continued agitation of reform, and an increasing contraction of the usurped privileges of the aristocracy.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The English Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The English Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NEWS AND NEWSPAPERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1268c89-fd31-5886-9af6-3d2201f221db,1906,nyt://article/e1268c89-fd31-5886-9af6-3d2201f221db

In this City nearly twelve hundred men have been enlisted in five days, a majority of them electing to serve in the old regiments; but a goodly number preferring to take their chances of winning glory and advancement in the new. About 150 were mustered into the service at the White-street office on Saturday, and as many more were taken up to the various encampments in the neighborhood of New-York for enrollment. The whole available population, of young men seems to be at last in earnest about the matter. There is evidence of a real appreciation of the emergency which the country is called upon to meet; and, so far as the Empire City is concerned, there will be few attempts made to shirk the responsibility. At the rate at which enlistments are thus progressing, there can be no doubt that, before the period arrives for drafting, the full quota of the State will have, volunteered; that is the quota the State is expected to furnish of the 300,000 men required by the President for use during three years or the war.

The able-bodied patriots who can possibly leave for the war, are already in the field of action, and have thus far everywhere rendered a creditable account of themselves. There are hundreds of subjects of a draft yet, who remain behind loitering their time away, for the most part in idleness and utter indifference to the demands of their country. The firder for a ""draft,"" as might have been anticipated, has created among the latter class quite a panic, and for the first time since the rebellion commenced, they begin to realize not only that their country is at war, but that the Government is in earnest, and points significantly to them for that assistance which they so justly owe it. Quite a number of these lukewarm youths have already left their accustomed haunts for a more congenial climate, taking the North Star as their guide, and some of them have been so fearful of being caught that they have deemed it expedient to leave between two days, as for instance, a young gentleman left Blue Point the other day, much to the gratification of a fellow whose loyalty is frequently questioned by those who knew him best, but to the utter disgust of his loyal friends and relatives. But it is believed that such cases of skeddadling are rare even in Suffolk County. The stronger nerved intend to brave it out, and there is quite a numerous class, also, who are watching their pockets. This class is composed of hardy young farmers, too young to be subject to a draft, but nevertheless possessing more nerve and muscle than many who are several years older. These chaps are awaiting the demand for substitutes, when they expect to make their weak kneed neighbors' blead handsomely.

The general supposition was that the most stringent precautions had already been taken to prevent the spontaneous flight of a very large proportion of the community subject to draft, or believing they were -- which is pretty much the same thing. We believed that those extremely patriotic and astute citizens who contemplated escape via Canada, Europe, and anywhere else, were effectually cornered, cabined, cribbed and confined, and we who were subject to the draft, and didn't propose to run away, were glad of it, for it lessened our chance while it did not detract from our patriotism. But it seems there was a loophole left, after all. Mr. KENNEDY, our amiable Superintendent of Police, had, in the kindness of his heart, construed the order prohibiting skedaddling, as not interfering with the regular California trade. He was aware of the geographical necessity for passing through a foreign country to get to California, but in the kindness of his heart, as hereinbefore mentioned, determined upon a liberal construction of the order, and had about made up his mind to let the passengers go in peace. Indeed, as late as 10 o'clock A.M., the steamer being about to sail at 12 M., precisely, the worthy Superintendent declared that the passengers might go, nem. con., and accordingly they packed on board, bag and baggage, lug and luggage, tickets in hand, and supposing all was right. But a change came o'er the spirit of their day-dreams, in the shape of a posse of police, who without ceremony cleared the ship from stem to stern, of every man not an employe, who had not a passport. Of course, nobody had a passport. They had many of them inquired before purchasing tickets, and had been informed that there would be no detention. Ono passenger averred that he had a telegram from Secretary SEWARD to that effect. The discomfiture was general and the indignation universal; but what could not be cured had to be endured -- if not with a good grace, certainly with a bad one.

On the Hamburg steamers they greatly outnumbered any and every other nationality. Some of these were naturalized citizens, who were departing on bona fide trips of business or pleasure in the Old World. Many were attracted by the peculiarly interesting state of affairs in Europe, and others were going out to look after matters connected with the great Rifle Shooting Festival at Frankfort-on-the-Main. But a large majority of the proposed voyagers was made up of a class of petty speculators, fourth-rate traveling dry goods clerks, speculators in wine, cigars, and the various other commodities which Europe supplies. Another set consisted of men who, neither professing nor desiring to owe allegiance to the country, have yet been perfectly willing to seek shelter here, where they could pursue their avocations at great profit to themselves, and often to the great loss of more patriotic residents. These were among the men who have speculated in ""panics,"" and have materially assisted in depreciating our markets, running up the price of specie and running down the value of Government stuck. They and the class previously mentioned have everywhere, even among their own countrymen, been noted for their high-backed sneering at everything in the country they were robbing, and scornful denunciations of American military affairs. Yet now, when their exalted wisdom might find a chance for our enlightenment, they, with as much cruelty as alacrity, leave us in the lurch.

It was the nomination of rival candidates for the office of Governor of the State of North Carolina. As the canvass progressed the cloud grew larger, until it not only overshadowed the State, but casts its gloom even toward Richmond. One JOHNSON, a politician of the South Carolina school, an aristocrat and fire-eater, became the candidate of the original Secessionists of the old North State. He was opposed by Col. ZEBULON B. VANCE, a Union member of Congress two years ago. But VANCE, though a Unionist up to the date when North Carolina was dragged out of the Union, seems to have yielded to the heresy of the times, and ""followed his State"" into the ranks of treason, for he raised a regiment of volunteers, and is now serving in the Confederate army near Richmond.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Cloud in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Cloud in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'North Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e6d0bcc-e9af-5af8-a9b5-100b9c239790,876,nyt://article/3e6d0bcc-e9af-5af8-a9b5-100b9c239790

"SHOOTING AFFRAY IN GRAND-STREET -- A POLITICAL DISCUSSION ENDS IN BLOOD -- ARREST OF THE GUILTY PARTY. -- Mr. JOHN BENNETT, proprietor of a drinking saloon on the corner of Green and Grand streets, was shot in his own house, about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, by a man named JOHN VARIAN. The latter was in the saloon, and had been drinking. A discussion arose relative to the conduct of the war, and was carried on between VARIAN and a man named VALES, when the former was forcibly ejected from the saloon. Upon getting outside he drew his pistol and fired twice, evidently with the intention of shooting Mr. VALES. The first shot passed through the door and lodged in the floor. The second took effect in the head of Mr. BENNETT, who had just come from behind the bar, and was proceeding toward the door. The ball entered first above the right temple, and passed out at the top of the head. The wounded man fell to the floor, from whence he was taken up stairs, and three physicians sent for. The physicians pronounce the wound a highly dangerous one, but think there is a probability that it may not prove fatal. Detective KING, who was passing on Broadway heard the report of the pistol, and immediately ran down Grand-street. VARIAN stood in the street, and upon seeing the officer coming toward him, took deliberate aim, but before he could fire the detective was upon him, and had wrenched the pistol from his grasp. The weapon is a revolver of the largest size -- six-barreled and self-cocking. VARIAN was taken to headquarters. He states that he was a member of the First Fire Zouaves, and that he took this pistol from a member of the Black Horse Cavalry, at the battle of Bull Run. He says he is 27 years of age, a native of New-York, and that he is a single man. He is locked up at headquarters. The Police know him well, and say he is a pickpocket.

editorial speculates on Jackson's movements,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/13/archives/object-of-jacksons-movement.html,editorial speculates on Jackson's movements,"-- Now that under cover of the darkness of Monday night. Stonewall JACKSON has suddenly retreated and recrossed the Rapidan, the purpose of his passage over the stream and advance in a northerly direction, giving battle to BANKS' corps on Saturday last, appears evident. He wished simply to get a blow at part of Gen. POPE's force before the whole of it was concentrated, and cripple it as much as was in his power. He threw forward 20,000 men against one-half that number of Union troops, fought a battle, which was not as successful, perhaps, as he anticipated, and went back. He may have made the retrograde movement, perhaps, quicker than he intended, because of the reported approach of Gen. BURNSIDE in his rear, and the sudden massing of troops by POPE in his front. But he escaped, it seems, in time to save himself, and has succeeded in placing himself in a position where reinforcements are much easier got than they would have been at Cedar Mountain. It is a misfortune that he has effected his escape -- a still greater misfortune than it was that he was permitted to come and bring on a battle. But there is good chance still that he may yet be cornered by the combined efforts of POPE and BURNSIDE. While it is important to prevent any great reinforcements reaching him from Richmond, it is still more important that he be not permitted, in case of any sudden emergency on the Peninsula, to rush back with any part of his force to Richmond. The operations in Gen. POPE's Department at the present time are of vital significance. The stake is greater than appears on its surface; the forces on both sides are large, and the commanders among the ablest in either service. We have POPE, SIGEL, BURNSIDE, BANKS and MCDOWELL, with a large number of the most dashing inferior officers; while the rebels have JACKSON, HILL, EWELL and others. From the character of the men in command on either side it is not likely that there will be any long period of delay or inaction. We hope that it will be possible for our army next time to be the attacking party, and with superior numbers, and not give the rebels the advantage in both particulars, as has generally been the case in Virginia.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""OBJECT OF JACKSON'S MOVEMENT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""OBJECT OF JACKSON'S MOVEMENT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4790012-6fb5-5878-8f89-32a73e17af4f,391,nyt://article/d4790012-6fb5-5878-8f89-32a73e17af4f

There seems to be every probability that those who escape the draft will from this appreciation of wages, be well able to bear the pecuniary burdens which the vigorous prosecution of the war may impose upon them. There can be no doubt that the subtraction of so many working men by the vast body of volunteers which this City has furnished, has damaged business, but the evil has been to a great extent remedied by the wonderful adaptability of our people to varied employments. If a man found he could not make a living by making ladies' shoes, he soon learned to make army shoes; If he found the manufacture of spectacles decreased, he could apply his knowledge of the use of tools and machinery to the construction of arms; workers in leather soon learned to make army equipments, and builders of looms and printing-presses found little trouble in applying their skill to the creation of iron-clad gunboats.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEFICIENCY OF LABOR.; Effect of the War Upon Mechanical Industry.

They were sent, and as soon as they appeared before the Secretary, he handed one of them a neat little package, upon which they retired and opened the mysterious envelope, when, to their surprise, they discovered a fifty-dollar Treasury note for each one of them. -- Washington Star, 15th.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PATRIOTISM OF SECRETARY SEWARD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PATRIOTISM OF SECRETARY SEWARD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ecb3774-fb16-535f-bcff-1c575c09e894,107,nyt://article/3ecb3774-fb16-535f-bcff-1c575c09e894
" -- A POPULAR FALLACY REMOVED. -- Gen. SICKLES, in his speech in Brooklyn, last evening, took occasion to sweep away a fallacy which he finds possessing the minds of laboring men of the North, especially those of foreign birth, and which he regards as one serious obstacle to enlistments. It seems that it is a current belief with them that the war will ultimately end in emancipation, or at least in the liberation of so many blacks that they will crowd our Northern cities, and, by glutting the market with thews and sinews, greatly lower the demand for and value of the labor of our white working population. They are loath to help on such a result. In rebutting this notion, Gen. SICKLES did not think it necessary to touch on that cure of the anticipated evil which the President so strongly favors -- namely, the deportation of the Blacks -- and which he but a day or two since presented with renewed earnestness to the deputation of colored men that waited on him. Even if not a negro should be taken out of the country, Gen. SICKLES sees that there are inherent laws, climatic and economical, that would effectually forever prevent the Northern immigration of the freed negroes. Indeed, so great would be the demand for labor, under the combined influence of free production and the increasing demand for the Southern staples, that it would not only absorb all the blacks at the South, but draw to itself all those now in the Northern States. Negroes naturally prefer the climate of the South; they are here only to escape from Slavery, and would seek the South by choice if they could find freedom there. Nothing could be more cogent or more just than this position, and we are glad Gen.

ALBERT C. MAGGI, arrived at Jersey City on board the Sound steamer of the Stonington line, Plymouth Rock. A large concourse of people lined the decks, and as the regiment disembarked to take the Philadelphia cars, the air shook with the cheers of the throng. The regiment is one of the finest in the service, and although it has been raised and organized within a very few weeks, is already a model of discipline and drill, as well as of equipment. Its headquarters was at Camp Stanton, near Lynnfield, in the Old Bay State. The Colonel of the regiment is an Italian by birth, and served for some sixteen years in the army of Sardinia. He also claims to have accompanied and fought side by side with the patriot GARIRALDI in his South American campaigns. Having rapidly acquired here the reputation of an accomplished soldier, Col. MAGGI has found little difficulty in recruiting his regiment up to the Government standard, and he now again takes the field to renew the honors he so gallantly won as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Twenty-first Massachusetts Volunteers at the storming and capture of the rebel defences on Roanoke Island. The position he held in the Twenty-first Col. MAGGI attained by sheer merit, rising from the ranks almost at a stride.

St. George sent Mr. WALLER and HARRY WRIGHT to the bat, against the finest bowling and fielding which has been seen in any match for a long time, and before they were parted, Mr. WALLER had scored fifteen, by some very pretty play. 3 3s and a 2 being among his figures. Messrs. CONGREVE and WALKER in turn retired, and Mr. GIBBES succeeded, and before he and HARRY WRIGHT parted company, HARRY had placed 70 on the telegraph by good cricket to all parts of the field, in which was a splendid drive for 6, a 5, 2 4s. 7 3s, and 3 2s; his brother -- young GEORGE WRIGHT -- succeeded, and entirely disappointed the hopes and expectations of all but the opposing side, as he was caught at square leg from a ""slow,"" it being a very fine hit.

To briefly sum up the result, it may be said that the bowling and fielding of HOLLEY, from Oswego, who came with HAMPSHIRE to New-York to play in this match, was first rate, as was that of HAMMOND, SUYDAM and SADLER. HAMMOND's fielding was very fine; STACEY's long-stopping was remarkably good, considering he had dislocated a finger early in the match. After a substantial dinner had been done justice to by a large party of the cricketers and their friends, Queens County sent HAMPSHIRE and HUDSON to the wickets, neither of them doing anything: Mr. HALL and BYRON got together and made a stand for a short time, when the former retired and HAMMOND showed some fine play, and in company with SADLER, were not out when the stamps were drawn: BYRON having been caught in splendid style by GEORGE WRIGHT, from a slashing hit to long on, his figures being a 3, 4 2s and 3 1s got by spirited play.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Cricket Match.; ST.

The Memphis Bulletin thus details the experiences of one Mr. Greenwald, a dry-goods merchant or that city, who was captured by the guerrillas when they made their raid upon Brownsville. It says: ""Mr. Greenwald states that when taken he was suffering from sickness. On stating this fact to the commander of the expedition. Capt. Faulkner, a wagon and hay to he upon was procured for him, and a blanket laid over him. Each night of the march a bed was procured for him in some house. On the Thursday following his capture, they reached Senatobia in Mississippi, which he was taken before Jeff. Thompson, who treated him politely, and directed him to be taken to Gen. Villipegue at Abbeville, beyond Holly Springs. On arriving, the General examined the case, and also the cases of Mr. French, of Denmark, and Mr. Ware, of Kentucky, who were arrested along with Mr. Greenwald. He decided in each case that the parties had not been guilty of selling cotton to 'the enemy,' and that their money should be restored to them and themselves set free. Mr. Greenwald's money, amounting to $2,610 in gold and silver, and $5,000 in other money, was returned to him, and he was allowed to return home. It had been reported to Mr. Greenwald's friends that he was handcuffed and harshly treated; he states that on the contrary he was treated with kindness and courtesy during the whole of his captivity.""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cfc2a047-ad52-5ac0-9a40-43bba70a4d5f,1968,nyt://article/cfc2a047-ad52-5ac0-9a40-43bba70a4d5f

It would seem that the community is possessed with that groveling quality of a sordid mind which hates superiority, and would ostracize genius, as the Athenians did ARISTIDES. One might believe it would not be unpleasing to the popular taste if some enterprising person could invent a machine for stunting intellectual development, after the fashion of idiotic barbarians who flatten the heads of their children.

A stranger to that Continent visiting the Old World, after acquiring some knowledge of its peoples and national characteristics, will assuredly expect to discover the jewel among those stolid islanders who pride themselves on the antiquity of their institutions, and whose political principles Lord PALMERSTON so well described in his anecdote of the two rival beer-house signs -- ""The Old Hats,"" and the ""Old Old Hats."" Our traveler would strangely deceive himself. It is precisely in that country, of all others, that consistency is not to be found, and to such an extent has it been ignored or scouted, that its very opposite -- expediency -- has become a political virtue. Looking around the British forum, it is almost an impossibility to point out a statesman, or prominent politician, whose opinions on most questions have not changed since his entrance into public life; a change, too, be it understood, amounting not to a modification merely, but to an absolute and radical alteration. The Hon. Mr. STANLEY, leaping frantically upon the table of his Club, and threatening the House of Lords if the Reform bill were not permitted to become a law, and the Earl of DERBY, the leader of the Tory obstructives of Great Britain, appear at a distance like different individuals. The Earl, however, is merely an example of men of all parties, for we find politicians of the stamp of ROEBUCK radical in their youth, and not merely conservative, but actually pro-Austrian in their old age. We might run through the long list of English statesmen, and furnish our readers with a laughable record of such examples, the only exceptions being men of the Cobden stamp -- precisely those who wield the least influence on public affairs.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'English Consistency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'English Consistency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e28ecca-4d51-5757-9c8a-5241dd49ee92,1211,nyt://article/5e28ecca-4d51-5757-9c8a-5241dd49ee92

These truths are sufficiently evident; but their consideration has not been sufficiently powerful to deter us from military expenditures on a most collosal scale, involving an outlay in a given period for which history furnishes no precedent. The analogy thus existing between the conduct of a nation and that of an individual, will be found to be consistent, if traced through the successive stages of cause and effect to the most distant and ultimate conclusions.

The Customs revenue or this country has seldom been so heavy as it promises to be this year, a variety of causes being in operation to produce this effect. First of these is the tariff imposed by the last Congress, which is sufficiently high to produce a large revenue whenever the importations are not unusually light, and which is not so exorbitant as to act as a prohibitory law. The effect of its operation has been manifest, since the 1st instant, in the largely increased revenue of the port. which has, in fact, been greater than it was during the latter part of July, when everything tended to its augmentation. Notwithstanding the fact that all the importers who owned merchandise in bond were then endeavoring to pay the duties thereon and gain possession before the new rates were put in force, the receipts not once or twice equaled those of last Thursday and Friday.

Whenever spoken to on the subject. I have always encouraged my people to enlist in defence of their country. I have discouraged them from trying to avoid a draft --and that any of them have thought of doing so, I know only from rumor -- and have always told them that they have enjoyed the protection of the Government and ought to be ready at all times to defend it.' He also staled to me some facts which it may not be proper to give in detail, but which I refer to, as evidence of the loyalty of the Bishop. The substance is this: The day previous he received a letter informing him of a rumor of a movement on foot, in a certain part of the State, among Irish and French Catholics' contemplating resistance to the proposed draft. He immediately wrote a letter to the Catholic priest in charge there, (the letter was mailed a few hours before this conversation,) saying to him --"" if there was any truth in the rumor -- to discourage this movement in every possible way, and to impress upon the Catholics there a sense of their duty to obey the Government and laws of the country; that their conduct might be that of good and loyal citizens.'""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2600453b-95c0-5340-8749-9e7b10a98643,862,nyt://article/2600453b-95c0-5340-8749-9e7b10a98643

It has been foreseen that the trying moment for Italy would be that when GARIBALDI should see fit to move on some new enterprise which VICTOR EMANUEL would be constrained to oppose. Hitherto, GARIBALDI has held his sword obedient always to the word of il re galantuomo. While in the memorable campaign that won Italian unity and independence, GARIBALDI repeatedly took the initiative, yet the movements themselves were always of a kind that the Turin Government could either openly approve or secretly wink at. Much of the success, indeed, of the Italian war of independence was owing to the admirable manner in which the genius of CAVOUR was able to harmonize the fiery zeal of the Republican leader with the needs of an enlightened and practical statesmanship. And if a difference of views at times seemed on the point of producing collision between the soldier and the statesman, to the honor of GARIBALDI it is on record that he invariably surrendered his individual plans to the end that the great cause itself might not suffer. There is, indeed, no trait in GARIBALDI's character more lofty than the generous self-abnegation with which his own most cherished purposes were more than once yielded up at the request of his King.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Italy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Italy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/41acc542-7ca8-5f74-b2bc-a5b92c1086d2,1051,nyt://article/41acc542-7ca8-5f74-b2bc-a5b92c1086d2

They say that a mass meeting was held before the recent battles, and it was debated whether or not they should burn the city. JEFF. DAVIS had moved his family away, and HAXALL, a wealthy man and large mill owner, who made an address, recommended that as JEFF. had nothing of any value in the city but his trunks, he had better take them and go. The Mayor JOSEPH MAYO, however, said they would die rather than surrender the city -- they would fight to the last. This seemed to he the feeling of the meeting, although many of the property owners would have much preferred to see the city taken than to have it laid in ashes. The rebels strained every nerve to make the best show of their strength, and even sick men in the hospitals, who could hardly walk, were brought out to fill up the line of battle.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""AFFAIRS AMONG THE REBELS.; REPORTS FROM RICHMOND.

The prevailing report is that the deceased (who was an Italian,) married an Irishwoman, the daughter of his stepmother, against the remonstrance of his parent. The deceased was in the service of the United States as a musician, and stationed at Fort Hamilton. Yesterday the father and an older brother visited the place and invited the deceased and his wife to take a walk. They walked into the woods near the Fort, when the subject of the marriage was brought up and a quarrel ensued, resulting in the father shouting his son twice. There is another report, also, that the deceased made an attack upon his father with a knife before the latter [???]. The deceased was 23 years of age. The elder, MENALI is a goldsmith by trade, and resides at No. 150 Concord-street. The other son present, and who, it is alleged, participated in the quarrel, resides in New-York.

They had not, and were anxious to know the purport of it. They were informed that the order was a direction to the Police authorities to arrest all lawyers who attempted to obtain the release of soldiers upon writs of habeus corpus, and commit them to Fort Lafayette. The legal gentlemen were dumbfounded and astounded both; they wondered what monstrous wrong the Secretary of War wouldn't be guilty of next, and, forgetting the interest of their client, hurriedly left the premises, to find the order and see whether it was properly verified.

BRECKINRIDGE is ambitious to illustrate in his single person all the vices which can make a Vice-President and a traitor detestable. It is only a day or two ago we printed a dispatch from his pen, in which he claimed a victory at Baton Rouge, and represented the Union command of Gen. WILLIAMS as cut to pieces. The story was a good one, though halting in certain of its members, as in the circumstance of the bulletin bearing date ten miles away from Baton Rouge, a point reached, it seemed, ""without disorder or loss"" on the part of the victors. It was at once notable that victors are always presumed to hold a battle-ground secured by their prowess, especially when the ground is a strategical point for the all-important possession of which the fight was challenged, and which can hardly be said to be reoccupied by an army which, after a brief combat, marches away at top speed, only pausing when the vanquished cease, after a chase of ten miles, to harass its rear. But Gen. BRECKINRIDGE is ill-seasoned in arms. The military vocabulary may not be at his finger ends; or, in his confidence of victory, he may have shared the fatuity of Gen. TAYLOR, who never knew when he was beaten. Indeed, the cotemporary dispatches by way of Grenada not only placed the rebel General in possession of the town, hut sent the ram Arkansas to play a formidable and triumphant part in its capture. Whatever, therefore, the discrepancy of details, the result from all the various sources of evidence was the same. The rebels had occupied Baton Rouge after a battle of proportions more or less stupendous. The battle was certified to by the sign-manual of BRECKINRIDGE himself, and the occupation attested by the Grenada Appeal.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Defeat of Breckinridge at Baton Rouge.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Defeat of Breckinridge at Baton Rouge.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/535bb8d0-7d5f-588a-ba12-956c274a7abd,774,nyt://article/535bb8d0-7d5f-588a-ba12-956c274a7abd

Last week more men in this City were added to both old and new regiments, than it would have been considered possible to raise in the time, even during the great uprising of a year ago. Yesterday recruits enough came in to form a regiment, and, for several days now immediately ensuing, may be expected to respond to their country's call with unexampled alacrity. But the quota to be supplied from the City and County of New-York, and the adjoining County of Kings, is of itself a small army, and great exertions will have to be made to avoid a resort to drafting for the purpose, at least of filling up the ranks of the second 300,000 demanded by the President. The first requisition will almost certainly be satisfied before the 22d inst. by volunteering alone, and between then and the 1st of September a considerable surplus will be found that can be credited to the account of requisition number 2; but, unless an extraordinary enthusiasm be, in the meanwhile, evoked, there must assuredly remain a deficit of several thousand to be supplied by conscription. Enlistments ran up as high yesterday, in New-York and Brooklyn, as seven to eight hundred; but they must for the next fortnight average a thousand, or drafting will be indispensable. A great deal is anticipated from the excitement which will follow the series of stirring war-meetings for which arrangements are in comes of preparation, and one of which comes off to-day at Fort Greene, Long Island. The presence of the gallant CORCORAN, too, it is confidently calculated, will have an immense effect upon his brave fellow-countrymen, who will undoubtedly flock in thousands around him, should he, in his new quality of General, be authorized to unfurl the green banner of another Irish Brigade.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY MATTERS IN THE CITY.; VOLUNTEERING AND THE DRAFT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY MATTERS IN THE CITY.; VOLUNTEERING AND THE DRAFT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/594996c3-f800-5ab0-86d0-6d4474523f00,603,nyt://article/594996c3-f800-5ab0-86d0-6d4474523f00

Parliament debates question of corresponding with Confederate Comrs,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/19/archives/american-affairs-in-parliament-debate-in-the-house-of-lords-on-a.html,Parliament debates question of corresponding with Confederate Comrs,"On the 5th of August Lord CAMPBELL rose to move for copies or extracts of any correspondence which her Majesty's Government had received from Mr. MASON, the Southern envoy, relating to the acknowledgment of the Confederate States of America by Great Britain. He said, as the Government had already laid before Parliament, in the first number of the papers on America, the dispatch of Col. MANN and Mr. YANCEY, demanding the acknowledgment of the Southern Confederacy in 1861, and had also laid before Parliament a dispatch of Mr. MASON at the beginning of the present year on the blockade, there could be no technical objection to present any correspondence of a later period. It was well known that the Southern envoys, both in London and in Paris, had recently demanded the acknowledgment of the States they represented, and of which the power to defend their capital against an invading force was in the last days of June triumphantly asserted. In one sense, indeed, the paper would be useless; they could do little to enhance -- so strong was it already -- the conviction which appeared to pervade society and Parliament that the war ought to end in separation of the Northern and the Southern Powers. It was not too much to say that no class or party in the country any longer desired to see the reconquest of the South and the reconstruction of the Union. The unanimity might be traced to many different causes. It was owing in some measure to the seasonable flood of light which Mr. SPENCE, in his well-known work, had thrown upon the subject. It was owing in a still greater measure to the speech of the noble lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, on the 10th of March, in which he told the world that separation was the issue of the struggle which he contemplated, and that at a period not distant from the time when he was speaking. It was owing also to the labors of enlightened men in the House of Commons, of whom Mr. GREGORY had been the most conspicuous. But still more should the unanimous desire for separation and aversion to reconquest in this country be traced to the conviction that the interest of the negro race would be promoted by the former and retarded by the latter; that the area of Slavery must be limited when separation happened, and would most likely be extended if reconquest unhappily occurred. These papers were not wanted in order to give new force to that conviction, but that they might throw light upon the course which Great Britain ought to follow amid the dangers which surrounded her in consequence of this civil war. The first danger of Great Britain, viz.: the possibility of Southern subjugation, and all the evils it involved, might be, perhaps, dismissed as a remote one. The second danger, which arose from the continuance of the war -- the manufacturing distress it must occasion -- was far more serious and distressing. So long as the war continued, a scarcity of cotton must be apprehended. If, indeed, the American supply were utterly and finally extinguished, the means would not, perhaps, be wanting to replace it, but so long as the American supply was constantly impending on the market, they could not hope to get a large amount from Africa or India. And who should say what degree of social or political disorder might not follow manufacturing distress if it extended over four years or upward! Another danger for Great Britain, more likely to remain unnoticed, but not less easy to describe, was that, if the war should end in separation, before this country had merited alliance from the Southern Power, Canada was exposed without an adequate defence to at least a possible invader. If Canada was unable to support a numerous militia, if Britain was unable to send large armies to her succor, what defence could they rely on except a firm ally upon that continent, prepared at any moment to cross the frontier of the Power by which an unjust attack was made upon our dependency? Suppose Great Britain held aloof completely in the present Autumn, while the other Powers of Europe, swayed by the French Government, employed their moral force to terminate the war in Southern Independence. In two months Canada might be assailed and Great Britain be without the least support on that Continent. If, however, Great Britain had united with the other Powers of Europe (after showing every observance to the Government at Washington) in acknowledging the independence of the South, she would not be unsupported in America when separation happened. Since modern Europe came into existence no civil war had ended in the sovereignty of the insurgent Power until that Power had been recognized by neutral States, giving an example to the State which aimed at its reconquest. It was not till Portugal had been acknowledged by Great Britain 25 years that Spain consented to acknowledge her existence as an independent Power. It was not till long after nearly all the Governments of Europe had acknowledged the United Provinces of Holland, that Spain gave up the hope of reabsorbing them. The same circumstance applied to the United States, the South American. Republics, to Greece, to Belgium and to Italy. The acknowledgment by neutral Powers had always preceded the acknowledgment of the Power which first endeavored to control the insurrection. It way not too much to lay down as a principle that, war must go on against an insurgent State until neutral Powers had acknowledged it. The war for a reconquest could not be abandoned while neutral Powers sanctioned its continuance. The whole question as regarded acknowledgement appeared to turn upon the moment. If other Powers of Europe were prepared, had England a right to count upon a better one? Operations of gunboats were retarded by the dryness of the navigable rivers; operations on land by the fearful heat and the diseases it engendered. Richmond was no longer menaced. Securities at New-York had undergone a great depreciation. The war, as far as they could judge, had lost its hold on popular opinion. The Abolitionists who followed Mr. Sumner had ceased to give at their support. And if many of the most reflecting men believed that in December and January last Europe lost an opportunity of taking that step without which the war could scarcely end, and which would then, perhaps, have closed it, with what decision and dispatch ought not a new conjuncture which invited to such a mode of acting to be made use of? There was this difference between the present and the former opportunity. In January the Federals had never been victorious in battle, and, however resigned to separation, however hopeless of reconquest, might still prolong the war in order to recover their prestige and repair their military losses. How the greater balance of success was likely to extinguish such an obstacle! But if the present moment were abandoned what were they to wait for? Before granting the extrication they must owe to Europe and to us, were we to wait until the Southern forces were again aggressive and triumphant; until the invaders were invaded, until the avengers were the victims, until the Northern States were overrun, and until Washington was occupied -- until, at least, its Government had encountered new humiliations, losses and disasters at the hands of the people whom they had rashly undertaken to chastise and to subdue? At least England was hardly justified in waiting for new reverses to the Federals, unless it was the only conduct in which the other Powers of Europe would support us. In that case, no doubt, they were entitled to pursue it. Perhaps the noble Lord the Secretary for Foreign Affairs would describe such a case as being the real one. If not, his silence would explode it. The noble Lord concluded by moving for the correspondence.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN PARLIAMENT.; Debate in the House of Lords on a Motion for the Correspondence with the Rebel Commissioners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMERICAN AFFAIRS IN PARLIAMENT.; Debate in the House of Lords on a Motion for the Correspondence with the Rebel Commissioners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cfe5c63-7efc-5a04-bab5-8959ead73c52,2781,nyt://article/8cfe5c63-7efc-5a04-bab5-8959ead73c52

But both return -- the one from his diplomatic mission to Europe, the other from his exile in a Southern prison, (where, too, he found a mission of his own -- that, namely, of illustrating how a patriotic soul can add dignity even to prison walls,) -- soldier and priest, we say, both return to exercise their peculiar influence in aiding the work which Heaven has given the Nation to do.

It was a splendid sight such a grand triumph of engineering skill, commenced over three years ago, in the time of profound peace, and now finished in spite of the desolating war which has darkened so large a portion of the land. It was the more significant as an illustration of the lightness with which the stern hand of war has yet touched the face of the North. Owing to more pressing demands upon the City funds, the Common Council failed to appropriate money to fittingly celebrate this era in the history of the City, but the popular interest was none the less lessened, and many thousand citizens of all classes, ages, and sexes, assembled to view the first gush of croton into the great lake. Precisely at 3 o'clock, the President and Chief Engineer of the Croton Board, members of the City Government, and other invited guests, were assembled at the North Gate-house, and, together with many privileged ladies admitted to choice seats, eagerly awaited the great event of the day. All eyes were turned upon Mr. CRAVEN, the Chief Engineer, and the imagination fondly pictured the grandeur of the scene when, amid huzzas and booming cannon, music and general rejoicing, the word should be given for the rush of waters. How the crowd trembled for the adventurous hundreds who were exploring the very bed of the reservoir, up to the months of the water-gates, to see all that was to be seen. How many tender people feared that somebody would be engulphed in the flood, while all eagerly awaited the signal. The signal was, however, known to but few. Mr. CRAVEN had stationed ten men at the water-gates, one man at the flag-staff, and a gang of men at the junction gate-house. Exactly as the hour and minute hand of the best time-piece on the ground pointed to 3 o'clock. Mr. CRAVEN quietly said.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR NEW RESERVOIR.; The First Flow of the Croton into the Great Central Park Lake.

Editorial on rumor Jackson is advancing on Potomac River,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/20/archives/stonewall-jackson-again.html,Editorial on rumor Jackson is advancing on Potomac River,"-- A rumor was current yesterday at Washington that Stonewall JACKSON, leaving the front of Gen. POPE, had passed into the Shenandoah valley, and was rapidly advancing upon the Potomac. The tale was inherently probable. A raid along the Valley is a favorite pastime of the prayerful partisan; who, besides, is under engagements with the inhabitants of the district to celebrate harvest home in their company. Not to have heard from him for a week is a sign of mischief. We may be sure he is not inactive, or at all ignorant of his opportunities. If it be practicable to flank POPE, march upon and capture the capital, or carry the war to Harrisburgh, JACKSON knows all about it, and doubtless loses not a fragment of time in making necessary preparations. What his hand finds to do he is apt to do swiftly and mightily.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STONEWALL JACKSON AGAIN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STONEWALL JACKSON AGAIN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/315e2486-461d-5e6b-a4cf-bcc22b390927,401,nyt://article/315e2486-461d-5e6b-a4cf-bcc22b390927

The growing necessity of having in this City, the great financial centre of the country, a sufficiently commodious edifice in which the business of the Sub-Treasury could be transacted, induced the authorities at Washington to sign a lease with the owners of the Merchants' Exchange, by which the use of that building was ceded to the United States. The intention has been to use the building leased for the business of the Collector, Naval Officer, Surveyor, Appraisers, and other officers of the Customs, and to devote the old Custom-house on the corner of Wall, Nassau and Pine-streets, to the use of Mr. CISCO, the Sub-Treasurer. The apartments occupied by that gentleman at present, were found entirely too limited, the immensely increased business of his office having rendered it necessary to employ an additional clerical force.

We have it in every variety of form, and on both sides of the Channel, in the Press, on the platform, in the Legislature and in the Cabinet. The prorogation of Parliament having put a stop to the outpourings of the collective wisdom of England, the members have carried the all-abserbing topic into the popular assembly PAM. has been making a speech on the subject to the cutlers of Sheffield, though all we are told of its character is that it advocated non-interference in American affairs. This is certainly a notable circumstance, as it shows the Prime Minister is openly committed to a neutral policy during the recess of Parliament. It has been urged by some, who think they see further into a millstone than other people, that the real danger of intervention would be when the close of the session of Parliament should leave the Cabinet free to act on its own responsibility. But here we have its head coming before a popular assembly and frankly counseling a continuance of the same neutral policy which England has hitherto held. Coming on the heels of the recent debates in the Lords and Commons, and the Queen's speech on the occasion of the prorogation of Parliament, it should be a sufficient quietus to the croakings of intervention which some find a mysterious pleasure in giving forth. With this official reassurance from Lord PALMERSTON, nobody probably will care a straw for the outgivings of ROEBUCK, who is reported to have followed the Prime Minister in a speech, urging the claims of the rebel Confederacy to be such as entitled it to recognition by England as an independent Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England, France and the Confederacy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England, France and the Confederacy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d728380-83b7-5bdd-879e-909bcd6b8bd6,843,nyt://article/2d728380-83b7-5bdd-879e-909bcd6b8bd6

"-- The Richmond Dispatch of last Saturday urges upon the Rebel Congress, now in session, the absolute necessity of extending the Conscription Act to all persons within the ages of sixteen and fifty-five years -- the material between eighteen and thirty-five being now exhausted.

"FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EMBEZZLED BY A NEW-YORK CLARK. A case of embezzlement of considerable interest, owing in part to the amount involved, was brought before Justice BRENNAN yesterday afternoon at the Lower Police Court.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/21/archives/general-city-news.html,,"FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EMBEZZLED BY A NEW-YORK CLARK. -- A case of embezzlement of considerable interest, owing in part to the amount involved, was brought before Justice BRENNAN yesterday afternoon at the Lower Police Court. The offender is a young Scotchman, aged 23 years, named CHARLES W. BANKS. At the time of the commission of the offence he was in the employ of Mr. CORNELIUS DE LAMATER, iron merchant in West Fifteenth-street. Last Monday his employer handed him a check upon the New-York County Bank for the sum of $3,500, and also another check for $2,000, all of which BANKS was requested to draw and return to his employer. The day passed, and the clerk did not return. On Tuesday, BANKS not having made his appearance, the employer began to grow uneasy about his money, and be therefore dispatched Mr. PAYE, his foreman, in pursuit of the delinquent clerk. The latter was traced to Tarrytown, Nyack and Piermont, on the Hudson. At the last-named place, it was found that at a late hour on Tuesday evening, BANKS had taken the cars of the New-York and Erie Railroad for the West. Mr. PAYE continued his pursuit, and at Middletown, in Orange County, where the pursuer stopped to make inquiries, the absconding clerk was found secreted in an upper room of a hotel. He was immediately taken into custody by Constable ADAMS, of Middletown, and upon a search of his person and effects being made, the sum of $4 795 was found, the most of it in bills of the New-York County Bank. Yesterday he was brought to New-York, and after a preliminary hearing before Justice BRENNAN, he was committed to the Tombs in default of $5,000 bail. He has confessed his guilt, and says that it is the first time that he has been guilty of the commission of any crime. After he had obtained the money from the bank, and before leaving the City, he changed his clothes, put on a red shirt and military cap and boots, and had his hair and whiskers cut off quite close. The unfortunate young man had been about two years with Mr. DE LAMATER, and hitherto, so far as is known, his reputation has been good. He says that after he left the City he became so nervous, bewildered and conscience-stricken that he did not know what course to pursue. He therefore wandered around from place to place upon the Hudson and vicinity, until he was captured.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5609a889-4d3b-57b5-a503-7a07c14814b5,881,nyt://article/5609a889-4d3b-57b5-a503-7a07c14814b5

The statement is hardly news. For all practical intents and purposes, the City has been under martial law for the past ten days. It has had a Provost-Marshal, a Provost Guard, the free transit of passengers has been interrupted without a resort to any legal forms, and men have been placed under arrest for saying in private what could do no possible harm if proclaimed from the housetop. These interruptions of the common law privileges and immunities of the person, can only be justified, if justifiable at all, by the military code. They find no warrant under civil authority. Next week, in view of the draft, it may be necessary to give new stringency to the present restrictions. Cowards and traitors will find their names drafted, and may attempt to escape; mobs may be fomented by the concealed labors of rebel sympathizers; the service of the draft-notices may require, in some instances, the exhibition of more than ordinary force. To guard against such mischievous contingencies, it may be proper to be thoroughly armed at all points, and authority should perhaps be given, even to the irresponsible extent of martial law, to those who are charged with the preservation of public order.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Martial Law in New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Martial Law in New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f24528f-8f83-595a-964a-7b294aa63168,893,nyt://article/8f24528f-8f83-595a-964a-7b294aa63168

Editorial lauds NYC police for raising military regiment to be called Metropolitan Guards,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/21/archives/the-metropolitan-guards.html,Editorial lauds NYC police for raising military regiment to be called Metropolitan Guards,"-- It was a capital idea, first suggested by Secretary SEWARD, to take advantage of the Police organization for the purpose of raising a regiment in this City. It is obvious, at a glance, what an admirable ready-made engine of recruiting the Police force is eligible to be turned into. Each patrolman becomes a recruiting sergeant, each station-house a recruiting station; and thus at one stroke the Government obtains in this City alone a couple of thousand active efficient enlisting officers and forty or fifty rendezvous for recruits, and all, too, without the expenditure of a dollar. The mattter, however, was not allowed to remain a mere idea, but steps were immediately taken to give it practical effect. The success has already been so great that not only is one regiment now under formation, but a second one has been begun, and both are filling up with great rapidity. These regiments, to be called the Metropolitan Guards, have their rendezvous, the one on Riker's Island and the other on Staten Island; and the first already counts 500, while the second has 300 men on its muster-roll. Indeed, so briskly is the business going on that it is now quite certain that a full brigade of Metropolitan Guards, composed of first-rate fighting material will be formed and ready for marching orders before the 1st of September.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE METROPOLITAN GUARDS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE METROPOLITAN GUARDS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4cb3821-5786-566b-9117-db5a32cc3397,410,nyt://article/a4cb3821-5786-566b-9117-db5a32cc3397

Such cordial greetings are rarely seen as here took place between old comrades, who had together braved the dangers of the battle-field, together fallen into the hands of a merciless foe, and together endured the hardships of Southern prisons. They were almost entirely representatives of the City regiments captured at Bull Run, who were subjected to all the barbarities which Southern malignity could invent, before the fortunes of War taught them that one side could capture prisoners as well as another. There were men who had for months lived in the foulest atmosphere, without sufficient food, and goaded to desperation by the taunts of unfeeling captors; men who had been wounded and now carried maimed limbs or honorable scars as mementoes of their devotion to the Union. But how changed since last they met? Many had so improved since their return that it was almost impossible for their old comrades to recognize them. But, a familiar expression, a cant word, a favorite allusion, a peculiar voice or a well known scar often recalled in a moment the dear memories of good fellowship.

On a former occasion it had been stated in that House that the United States squadron was actively engaged in enforcing the blockade on the coast of the United States; but, it appeared their cruisers had since been withdrawn, and they were now employed in blockading British ports. There could be no doubt, indeed, that the United States authorities had pressed, and were pressing to the utmost, without moderation or discretion, the rights which they might possess as belligerents, and he hoped the noble ford would give the House an assurance that this matter would not escape the notice of the Government; but that on the contrary, the most vigorous and earnest remonstrances would be made to the United States Government on the subject. He might also take that opportunity of referring to certain proceedings adopted by the Untied States authorities with respect to British goods at New-York. Hitherto it had been the practice to send British goods to New-York in steamers, and afterward to forward them in American bottoms to Nassau. It now appeared that the United States Government would not permit these goods to be exported from New-York unless the owners entered into a bond that the future owners of the goods at Nassau should not ship them either to the Confederate States, or to any port in communication with them. He hoped the noble lord would also give the House an assurance that this matter would be made the subject of a vigorous remonstrance to the United States Government.

Editorial on ship New Ironsides just completed at Philadelphia; Editorial on ship New Ironsides just completed at Philadelphia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/22/archives/prospective-naval-operations.html,Editorial on ship New Ironsides just completed at Philadelphia; Editorial on ship New Ironsides just completed at Philadelphia,"-- The magnificent mailed frigate New-Ironsides, of whose progress we have given details from time to time, is now fairly completed, and yesterday left Philadelphia in high spirit, and amid the applause of admiring citizens. She is an exceedingly formidable vessel, and, though not built on the Monitor style or theory -- the contract for her was given out prior to the Ericsson era -- she is constructed on the most modern and scientific principles, and is believed to be of the most serviceable build and on the most available plan for the kind of work to which she is to be assigned. What her first labor is to be is not known, as she sailed with sealed orders, and Mr. WELLES has not permitted it to leak out. The only thing stated is that she has gone in a southerly direction -- doubtless to operate somewhere between Chesapeake Bay and Galveston Bay. Ten days ago we might have thought she was going to do service in the James; but that is unlikely now. Is she going to Savannah, to fight the great ram Fingal and capture the city? or is she going to steam past Fort Sumter and into Charleston Harbor, for it is asserted that that is within her power? or is she going down to Mobile to challenge the ""ten iron-clad English rams,"" for beholding which an unhappy fabricator is now doing penance in Alton Penitentiary? or is she going to assist PORTER in capturing Mobile itself?

There can, however, be no doubt that the sympathies of the venerable chief ROSS, and of a large portion of his people, are with the National Government. For, from the year 1838, when they emigrated to their present location, as well as in earlier times, the paternal policy which the Government at Washington has ever preserved towards the Indians, stands in strong contrast with the outrages and exactions of Georgia and the other Southern States with which they are now in alliance. The Cherokees, at the time of the settlement of the Carolinas and Georgia, were a nation of fire-worshippers, who seemed endued with nobler qualities, and capable of a higher progress, both social and civil, than their Indian neighbors. They originally owned the whole of this mountain region, but their domains had been contracted, as some of their tribes had been induced to sell their lands. Changing by degrees their habits, and discarding their nomadic modes of life, they borrowed the civilization, and embraced the purer faith of the white man, and, cultivating agriculture and the arts of peace, they had become strongly attached to their rich and fertile fields, of which for centuries they and their fathers had held undisputed possession.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/22/archives/amusements.html,,"THE RAVELS AT NIBLO's GARDEN. -- GABRIEL RAVEL and company are having things pretty much their own way in the amusement line of business. They have dispelled the gentle dullness that pervaded the theatrical atmosphere up to the period of their advent, and once again delight one's eyes and ears with crowded audiences, uproarious laughter and genuine applause. Niblo's resumes its old-time appearance of Summer life and gaiety, and is again the most popular -- as it has ever been the handsomest and pleasantest -- place of public entertainment in the country. The Ravel people have had no occasion to produce anything that can be called a novelty as yet. They have simply revived five or six of the most popular pantomimes and ballets in their repertory, putting these upon the stage in their usual style of unapproachable neatness and good taste, and, with them, attracting as large a portion of the playgoing community as they can comfortably provide with seats. The only attempt they have made at a sensation has been the introduction of the wonderfully clever child -- known in private life as little JOHN HASLEM, and on the bills as ""Young America"" -- in perilous gymnastic feats, that no one, save the HANLONS, have ever, in the memory of the present generation, rivaled. This boy, who is, withal, one of the prettiest fellows that ever circled brows with acrobatic fillet, does things, which, tried by ordinary juveniles, would make the nervous system tingle with suppressed emotion; but which, achieved as they are by him with a certainty and ease that divest them of all symptoms of danger, inspire in his beholders feelings of unmingled admiration and delight. Without any RAVELS or preliminary dramatic performances, such as are included in the programme at NIBLO's, he alone might be relied on as a profitable exhibition; and, one of these days, if good luck carries him up to manhood with unfractured limbs, he will undoubtedly have an Academy of Music all to himself, as WILLIAM HANLON had, and make a fortune on his individual account.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd67952b-f182-532d-a058-a3cc4f522bf6,560,nyt://article/fd67952b-f182-532d-a058-a3cc4f522bf6

"If the letter of the late order from the War Department on the subject of enlistments be observed, no more Government bounties will be paid to recruits joining the new regiments now organizing, and recruits for regiments in the field have only another week's chance of obtaining the liberal bonus hitherto paid to every one volunteering.

"As the time for drafting approaches, all the evils inherent in the extravagant and diversified system of bounties offered by various sections begin to show themselves conspicuously. In Rhode Island the system has involved recruiting in such confusion that Gov. SPRAGUE has been compelled to call a special session of the Legislature for Tuesday next, to take the matter into consideration. We presume the difficulty in Rhode Island is of the same nature with that experienced in the other States. Volunteers rushed to enroll themselves in whatever town or county offered the largest premiums; and thus it happens that many districts from which large numbers of recruits have gone forth are credited with none over against their quota, their volunteers having enlisted elsewhere. On these, therefore, the draft will fall with great severity, as they will be compelled to raise the whole number of men to make up their original complement under both calls. We repeatedly set forth the danger of the very evils that are now being so bitterly experienced, at the time when the extravagant rivalry in bounties began, and urged the fixing of a uniform system throughout the whole country.

In Rhode Island the system has involved recruiting in such confusion that Gov. SPRAGUE has been compelled to call a special session of the Legislature for Tuesday next, to take the matter into consideration. We presume the difficulty in Rhode Island is of the same nature with that experienced in the other States. Volunteers rushed to enroll themselves in whatever town or county offered the largest premiums; and thus it happens that many districts from which large numbers of recruits have gone forth are credited with none over against their quota, their volunteers having enlisted elsewhere. On these, therefore, the draft will fall with great severity, as they will be compelled to raise the whole number of men to make up their original complement under both calls. We repeatedly set forth the danger of the very evils that are now being so bitterly experienced, at the time when the extravagant rivalry in bounties began, and urged the fixing of a uniform system throughout the whole country. Now that the failure to do so has got us into a complete muddle, it remains to be seen how our wise pates will get us out of it.

Many places of business were closed, and entire classes of our laboring population left their work en masse to join in the ovation. The multitude on foot, pressing on the line of procession and the point of reception, was numbered truly by the hundred thousand, and the sentiment pervading all was that of exultant pride in the man they had met to honor. The roar of artillery mingled with the not less inspiring shout of many voices to give to Col. CORCORAN a cordial welcome to his home, and to testify that with enthusiastic accord, he was crowned with the laurels he had so bravely won and so nobly wears.

"The Union Party in New-Jersey has set an example worthy of imitation elsewhere, in selecting as a candidate for the Governor's Chair a gentleman who is so little of a politician as to be hardly a partisan.

Such a circumstance must simply be accepted as an evidence that a division at the present time, and under existing conditions, would, in the judgment of the veteran tactician, be unfavorable to the development of his predetermined policy. Neither are we to suppose that the Presses which take their cue from the British Government, are actuated by affection for our own, when they protest against ""simple mediation;"" it only proves that the Ministry has indicated, in a manner which those writers understand, that the proposed legislative action is premature; that such action would only provoke the North without aiding the South; that the temper of the English people at large is still believed to be adverse to the upholding of a mere Slave Power, and that they must wait for more National disasters and a few more turns of the screw on the unhappy operatives of Lancashire.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'British Colonial Policy The Future of Canada.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'British Colonial Policy The Future of Canada.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/146768a0-dca9-5507-8189-3d3ce660d41b,1101,nyt://article/146768a0-dca9-5507-8189-3d3ce660d41b

J., on the 3d of September, proximo. It is stated by those who have the means of knowing, that much additional testimony, on the part of the people, has recently been discovered by the Police of this City. Aside from the deep mystery in which this murder has been enshrouded, the notoriety which has been given to it by the arrest of Mrs. MARKS and her sister, ALBERTINA PHLAUM, --, who hung herself while in prison,) -- and the large amount of money and diamonds, of which the murdered man was the owner at the time of his death, there are some questions of a scientific character, which will render the trial one of more than ordinary interest. The question as to the jurisdiction by the Courts of New-Jersey will, it is said, be brought up by the counsel for the prisoner, at the outset of the trial. The deceased was last seen alive in company with the prisoner on a Friday night, and the following Monday morning, his body was found in the Shrewsbury River, beyond the Highland Light-house, in the State of New-Jersey. Ex-Judge STEWART, as counsel for RADETSKY. proposes, as one part of his defence, to show that, as a matter of law, the finding of a dead body in the State of New-Jersey is only a circumstance going to prove that the death occurred there, but one which may be rebutted and overcome by evidence tending to prove that the murder was actually committed in this City or Brooklyn. This branch of the case will be novel and interesting, as the laws of the winds and tides of the Harbor of New-York, the Bay and the channel of the Narrows leading to the sea, also the laws of specific gravity of water and of the human body, and furthermore, the medical inquiry as to the decomposition of the deceased's person, are questions which it is proposed shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of ascertaining where, as well as by whom the murder was committed. Owing to all these circumstances, the forthcoming trial of RADETSKY will doubtless be one as full of interest as any which ever took place in Monmouth County.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Felluer Murder.

DAVIS, and no permits to leave the State were given, under any consideration, if, as in her case, the party applying was suspected of sympathizing with the North. From that time until now she has been constantly endeavoring, by every means in her power, to find some way whereby she would be enabled to leave the city inwhich she had suffered everything but death, and where she had sacrificed nearly all that renders life endurable. Being on terms of intimacy with many of the first ladies in the City of Richmond, she frequently expressed to them since the commencement of warm weather, her desire to go to some watering-place, for a few weeks, for the benefit of her health, and it was only by this plan, that she has at last succeeded in getting released from rebeldom. In company with three other ladies, two of whom had friends in Baltimore, and the other resided in Annapolis, she was at last permitted to leave the city. The party came down to Harrison's Landing under a flag of truce. After much suffering and hardship, which lasted for about five days, she at length foued herself among some of her Union friends in Baltimore, and from there she soon after proceeded on to this City.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CONDITION OF RICHMOND.; An Interesting Account of the State of Affairs in the Rebel Capital, as Given by a Lady who has Resided in that City for the last Two Years.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CONDITION OF RICHMOND.; An Interesting Account of the State of Affairs in the Rebel Capital, as Given by a Lady who has Resided in that City for the last Two Years.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/52183571-3397-533b-a860-f8ebf3ee0ec3,1989,nyt://article/52183571-3397-533b-a860-f8ebf3ee0ec3

There was some skirmishing on the way between our near guard of cavalry and the rebels, but with no serious losses.

A party of about twenty-five of the men, under the influence of liquor, got into a row among themselves, in which they freely used knives and other weapons, resulting in one of the officers, who was endeavoring to quell the disturbance, being severely stabbed, and several of the men frightfully cut.

Editorials lament report correspondents are to be expelled from military lines in East; Editorials deplore report that newspaper correspondents are to be expelled from military lines in East,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/25/archives/army-correspondents.html,Editorials lament report correspondents are to be expelled from military lines in East; Editorials deplore report that newspaper correspondents are to be expelled from military lines in East,"When Gen. HALLECK was in command of the Southwestern army in front of Corinth, he expelled all the correspondents of the Press from his lines, classifying them among the ""unauthorized hangers-on"" of his army. It is now given out that the same policy is to be applied in the East; and that those who furnish the public of the present day, and the public of all future days, with the record of the deeds and achievements of our army, are also to be expelled from the lines. This will produce several results. Of battles, sieges, and military operations of all sorts, of the details of life in camp, of the wants and feelings of the soldier, &c., the people will know nothing except what may be picked up by scribblers outside of the lines, or what may be furnished in official documents. It is true that this would neither be very lively nor veracious reading; but it would, in some respects, be better than nothing. In Europe, however, the act would have a very prejudicial effect upon the Northern cause. So far, the European journals have generally transferred to their columns the accounts of the different battles given by the correspondents of this and other American newspapers, accompanied by Southern versions from Southern newspapers. Some of these latter, given by army correspondents of rebel Journals, have been admirably written, particularly the Richmond Examiner's sketches of the seven days' battles on the Peninsula, which were copied all over Europe; and, had they not been offset by the army correspondence of the New-York journals, would have produced abroad a very contemptible opinion of the courage of our soldiers and the skill of our officers. If correspondents are expelled from the lines by Gen. HALLECK, of course Europeans will only see one side, and that the rebel side, of these things. For, unhappily, over there, they will not believe, even if they read, our official military documents. ""False as an official bulletin,"" is an old proverb; and the style in which some of ours have been commented upon abroad shows the estimate in which they are unjustly held. Besides, not one man in a thousand ever reads an official document of any kind. Our official military reports have been heavy, statistical, lumbering, one-sided, unpicturesque, written by men who know nothing of literary composition or effect, and whose principal aim is to glorify themselves -- generally as different as possible from the vivacious narratives of the ubiquitous Press correspondents. Of some of the greatest battles of the war, again, we have had no report whatever from the officer in chief command, as in the instance of the battle of Shiloh, concerning which Gen. GRANT has been steadily silent; while of the seven days' battles in front of Richmond, Gen. MCCLELLAN has given no report. Of course, we cannot expect Europeans to toil through the mass of reports of inferior officers -- even if it were possible for them to understand them. Just as little confidence is there in Europe in our telegrams; for it is known that the telegraph is under the supervision of the Government, and they cannot be convinced that Government is either impartial or credible. But the sketches of the correspondents are too life-like to be denied, too impressive to be argued about. If the army correspondents are expelled from the lines, and the European Press publishes only rebel accounts of battles, we cannot blame Europeans for vaunting Southern valor and despising Northern poltroonery.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARMY CORRESPONDENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARMY CORRESPONDENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NEWS AND NEWSPAPERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-08-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0661290-a355-5be1-8cf8-52975835c352,650,nyt://article/a0661290-a355-5be1-8cf8-52975835c352

The bodies under Gens. McCLELLAN and POPE, as well as the column of Gen. BURNSIDE from North Carolina, now form a mass, which, if not conpacted together, is within mutually supporting distance in each of its parts, and prepared to cooperate all together in case of emergency. The lines extend, or at the close of last week did extend, along the left bank of the Rappahannock, with its centre, under Gen. POPE, near to the point where the Orange and Alexandria Railroad crosses that river, its left extending down to Fredericksburgh, and its right stretching but a short distance to the north, if it may not be said to sweep in a thin and desultory line as far up as Strasburgh in the Shenandoah Valley. If the rebels choose to bring on another battle, it will be fought, we would fain hope, with the whole of our Virginia army -- a phenomenon which did not occur either in the great battle at Manassas last Summer, nor in the great series of battles on the Peninsula this Summer. At Yorktown, and Norfolk, and at other points in Eastern as well as Western Virginia, there are still small detachments of our taoops for garrison and defensive purposes; but, with these trifling exceptions, the whole of the grand army of the East is along the line which we have indicated. Gen. POPE fell back here last week from the Rapidan, or rather from Culpepper Court-house; and, during the same eventful week, the troops of Gen. MCCLELLAN have been hastening northward to the same point with all the rapidity possible to steam and innumerable transports. The different columns of the army are still, we suppose, under the command of MCCLELLAN, POPE and BURNSIDE, respectively, though the whole force is so near to Washington, and so immediately under the eye of Gen.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/26/archives/not-confirmed.html,,"-- It was very good news yesterday from POPE's army, that Gen. SIGEL had captured two thousand rebel troops on the Rappahannock, and Wall street was bright and stocks buoyant on the strength of it. Everybody hoped that the captives might be somewhat more tangible and somewhat less invisible that the ten thousand which POPE's cavalry ""bagged"" after the evacuation of Corinth. It is true it looked somewhat dubious that the capture, as reported, took place as far back as last Tuesday, while we had advices from along the lines on the Rappahannock as late as Saturday, which made no mention of such an important event; and it was also remarkable that the prisoners, instead of being hastened to Washington, should have been retained within POPE's lines for a week, when an attack on SIGEL's or any other corps was so imminent, and when they could not afford to be burdened with such a number of rebel prisoners. But still it was hoped the news was true; though, the balance of prisoners being still against us, this new haul would simply have been shipped back again to the dominions and the army of JEFF. DAVIS. In the evening, however, we were gently let down from our noonday hopes by the receipt of a dispatch which announced that ""the reported capture of two thousand rebel prisoners was not confirmed,"" and a still later telegram narrated that two hundred of our soldiers on the Rappahannock had been taken prisoners by the rebels. This was almost as much of a change in the facts as took place in the telegrams concerning the late battle of Cedar Mountain, which asserted that after the engagement the rebels had asked permission to bury their dead, when the fact wasthat we had to ask leave of JACKSON to bury our poor fellows. There is nothing gained by these authorized misstatements, that come so thick and fast from Gen. POPE's Department. If they hoist stocks up for a moment, they eventually and inevitably tumble public confidence down. Moreover, we cannot possibly equal the rebels in this style of fabrication, and it would be better that our telegraphic wires should not be defiled with it at all. It was so likely that Gen. SIGEL should do just such a thing as was reported of him, that its credibility was universally concurred in. We have no doubt that when the news reaches the gallant General, he will proceed to verify it in a manner which will be acceptable to the public.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOT CONFIRMED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOT CONFIRMED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/03186123-3eec-52d8-adf7-3cca25ecfaa8,421,nyt://article/03186123-3eec-52d8-adf7-3cca25ecfaa8

"-- The scheme officially proposed by President LINCOLN, and sanctioned by the last Congress, of beginning the work of colonizing, outside of the United States, the negroes free and to be freed in the progress of the war, is about to be carried practically into effect. Senator POMEROY has issued an address to the free colored people of the United States, and which has been approved by the President, in which he proposes, at as early a date as five weeks from this time, to take out to Central America a colony of five hundred colored persons, to be settled permanently in that country. The immediate point of their destination is to be Chiriqui -- well known from the late discoveries of gold mere -- in New-Granada, which is but a week's voyage from this port. They are to be carried out at the expense of Government, and supported for the first season at Government expense -- a small fund for this purpose having been appropriated by the last Congress. The sum required will be small, as they will be carried out in National vessels, while the country to which they emigrate is so fertile and so profuse in edible products of all sorts, that the only support required will be implements and seeds, and a temporary supply of provisions until the bursting soil can give forth of its bounty. Senator POMEROY has taken upon himself a difficult work; but he is a man both of energy and experience. We regard the scheme of deporting the four millions of Africans that are rooted in the Southern soil as utterly impracticable, but still the experiment of black colonies in Central America and elsewhere is well worth trying. The negro certainly has invitations and urgings enough to leave us, and small enough inducements to stay. Jamaica and all the British West Indies beg him to come; Hayti stretches forth her hands and implores his presence; the Danish West Indies softly woo him; Central America invites him with open arms; and even his old African home longs to get him back. Here he has but personal slavery, or social degradation.

An request was held upon the body yesterday, by Coroner RANNEY, when the following facts were disclosed. In the early part of the evening RICHARD S. DOWNING, the officers, with his [???] and son, a lad about ten years of age, made a call upon a sister of the deceased, named ELLEN CONNER, at No. 36 Cherry-street. While at the latter place, the deceased, at the request of her husband, sent out and obtained a quart of beer. When this had been consumed, the husband insisted upon her sending for another quart, which she declined to do, and assigned as a reason that she had no more money. DOWNING then became very much enraged at his wife, and before leaving the house he applied many vile and abusive epithets to her. About 10 1/2 o'clock, they left the house for their residence. JAMES DOWNING, the son above alluded to, was the only witness as to what transpired after this time. He testified upon the inquest, that while they were going down the steps of No. 36 Cherry-street, his father struck his mother a violent blow with his fist, and that he continued to abuse her in one way and another until they arrived at their house. As soon as they entered their room the father began to kick and strike the woman upon various parts of her body, thereby inflicting injuries so serious that she died. What adds to the brutality of the offence is the fact, that at the time the woman was enceinte, and the outrage committed upon her person while in this condition renders the offender guilty of a double murder. A post-mortem examination made by Dr. GALEN HUNTER, made it evident that death ensued from an injury to the placenta. The jury rendered a verdict to the effect that the deceased came to her death by violence at the hands of her husband. Upon rendition of this verdict, DOWNING, who is an Irishman, about 38 years of age, was committed to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; REOPENING OF COOPER UNION READING ROOMS.

This is done in this State by law, and the law of Congress exempts all who are exempted by State laws. We concur with the Post in doubting the justice or wisdom of such exemption. The ground on which it is granted is that the Quakers have conscientious scruples against fighting. But a legal concession to such scruples is, in fact, an acknowledgment that the laws requiring military service are fairly open to objection on moral grounds, -- in other words, that it is or may be immoral to require a citizen to fight for his country; and such a concession as this, it is not right for any Government to make.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EXEMPTION OF QUAKERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EXEMPTION OF QUAKERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/18584c20-104a-5626-8b0c-6703879e23a3,300,nyt://article/18584c20-104a-5626-8b0c-6703879e23a3

It is the executive of the thousand and one laws and regulations which have been decreed for the welfare of the community at large, and of each individual in particular. Unless the police be invested with peculiarly extended powers, it only reacts negatively upon the citizens, positively upon the criminal. For example, in America, so long as you or I behave ourselves decently -- and even here a considerable latitude is given in the interpretation of out conduct -- so long as we neither kill, rob, nor assault, so long as we are neither killed, robbed, nor assaulted, we may pass our entire existences without knowing a policeman save as a quiet individual who stands upon the corner of our street in a state of somnolent stupidity. To the criminal this individual is invested with peculiar terrors; he represents the avenging spirit of the law, and to the evil doer he is one who can cause to be inflicted a punishment more or less severe. Save in the great points of public safety, the policeman does not interfere with the well-behaved citizen in any wise. As regards the petty annoyances of our everyday life, these are matters over which we may watch ourselves. If our grocer chooses to mix plaster of Paris with the powdered sugar he sells us, the affair lies between ourselves and him. If our milkman delivers us cream containing 75 per cent. of pump-water, we are at liberty to discharge him. It requires a general outburst of popular indignation to effect the suppression of such an institution as distillery cow stables. Who would ever think of appealing to the policeman at the corner? We may drink our decoction of logwood, or our strychnined whisky, with impunity; we may even offer glasses of them to the policeman of our beat. We may tell him, if we choose, that they emanate from the distillery of J. Smith & Sons. All this is none of his business. Our infant children may die in their cradles from contaminated food; we ourselves may suffer from the mistakes of ignorant apothecaries' apprentices; the great social evil may stalk in rusty satin and rouge beneath the windows at which our wives and daughters dare no longer sit; but so long as there is no physical attempt at disturbing what is conventionally called the public peace; so long as there is no flagrant outrage to what are called public morals, the policeman quietly dozes against his lamp-post, and if, perchance, elected to a quiet neighborhood, may pass weeks in the passive fulfillment of his duties.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRENCH POLICE.; Its Duties as a Body Protective of Public Interests, and Conducive to Public Comfort.

"oughly as to leave little cause for complaint and less chance for evasion. It is the Judge-Advocate's intention to execute the duty assigned him with as small an amount of vexation or annoyance to the public as possible; but he means to execute rigorously for all that. He means to have upon his lists the name of every able-bodied citizen within the limits of his jurisdiction. If he can obtain those names by fair means, he will be highly gratified; but should stern measures be rendered necessary, he will not hesitate to resort to them. There is reason to believe that many attempts have been made to deceive and mislead the enrolling officers. Some of these attempts are temporarily successful. Yet they cannot be permanently so; and, when exposed, they will be the cause of trouble and unpleasantness to all who have been foolish enough to make them. The conscription law not only provides for the enrollment of able-bodied citizens, but it also provides punishment for those who seek to avoid the draft themselves, or endeavor to shield others from its legitimate effects. A case in point was brought under the Judge Advocate's cognizance yesterday. It seems that the book-keeper of one of the leaning gas companies, when called on for the names of the employes of the concern, furnished the enrolling officer with a correct list of names, but opposite the names put a number of fictitious addresses. The book-keeper was immediately arrested, and will speedily undergo examination. By way of facilitating the procurement of correct lists, it has been suggested that all the rolls shall be published, when it is expected that every one whose name is down will, on finding the names of persons he knows omitted, give information of the fact, and have it remedied. The suggestion is a shrewd one, and must have been made by an admirer of the amiable side of human nature.

This regiment, which will be known as the Thirty-eighth Messachusetis, has been rapidly recruited, chiefly in the extreme eastern counties, and is as splendid a body of men as ever New-England has yet sent to the war. There isn't a small or puny individual amongst them. They are stalwart, able-bodied fellows, every one of them, and of a different class from many of those who go from the large cities. They have not enlisted for the sake of the bounty, but from a higher motive of patriotism; from a deep conviction of the unrighteousness of the Rebellion, and with the firm determination to do their best to put it down. In the six weeks they have been in camp at Lynn, they have learned the advantages of discipline, and some of the rudiments of drill. Through the pressure on the Quartermaster's Department of Massachusetts, it has not been found possible to supply the whole regiment with uniforms and equipments. These, however, will be distributed on the regiment's arrival at Washington. But each man has an Enfield rifle of the very best description, and every one of them has a true soldier's heart in his breast, though his trousers may not be of the regulation pattern. There are 1,040 men in the Thirty-eighth, nearly every one of whom is American born, and of respectable family. Professional men are in the ranks, as well as farmers, artisans and clerks. The officers are all believed to be competent. The Colonel is now with the Eighteenth Massachusetts, from which regiment he is detailed to take command of this. The Lieutenant-Colonel was out with the Fifth Massachusetts Militia three months, and has lately been Major of the Twenty-second Massachusetts Volunteers, leading it through all the perils of the Peninsula campaign.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Arrival and Departure of Regiments.; THE THIRTY-EIGHT MASSACHUSETTS EN ROUTE.

She expired in a few minutes afterward. The body was examined yesterday afternoon by Dr. ROBINSON, Deputy Coroner, who gave it as his opinion, upon the inquest held by Coroner NAUMANN, that death ensued from a pistol-shot wound, in or near the heart. A sister of the deceased testified that she saw the prisoner and his wife nearly all day on Tuesday, and that in the evening, about 9 o'clock, she was present when the prisoner and deceased had a quarrel, during which the prisoner said to the deceased that if the latter said another word to him he would shoot her.

The news of the last few days from the vicinity of Cumberland Gap shows that the Union troops now occupying that stronghold ...  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/29/archives/critical-condition-of-our-army-at-cumberland-gap.html,,"The news of the last few days from the vicinity of Cumberland Gap shows that the Union troops now occupying that stronghold are placed in a condition of extreme peril by the recent movements of the rebels. The value of the position is to them incalculable; and it would appear that, encouraged by their recent successes in other parts of Tennessee and Kentucky, they are determined to make a great effort to recover a stronghold which was captured from them rather by skillful strategy and extraordinary labor, than by superiority of force on our part, or lack of spirit on the part of the rebels. According to our dispatches and correspondence from that region, the rebels have of late been quietly massing large bodies of troops on either side of the Gap -- 15,000 men on the south side, and 30,000 on the north side, it is said -- with the idea of capturing or destroying the small National force under Gen. MORGAN, which seized this formidable mountain stronghold, and has held it in defiance of the rebels for nearly three months. Their troops are occupying every available pathway to and from the Gap, with the idea of hemming our little force completely in; and an energetic letter from Parson BROWNLOW, which we publish in our present issue, states that ""our army at the Gap is already surrounded, and, if not speedily relieved, will be cut to pieces or forced to surrender"" from starvation. There is probably little danger of the rebels capturing the place by assault, unless they really have the enormous force attributed to them; for Gen. MORGAN has been busy at work, and has completed the artificial and engineering labor necessary for rendering the position as nearly impregnable as any place can be; and from what we know of the situation of affairs, our impression is that, even though Gen. MORGAN have not one-fifth of the number of troops which the rebels have brought against him, he can still defy and repel them from his American Thermopylae. The movements of the rebels, however, indicate that they understand and are acting on the policy that the only plan of capturing Cumberland Gap is by starving out Gen. MORGAN's forces. This is quite a feasible project, for all MORGAN's supplies have to be hauled in ox-teams, over a distance of a hundred miles in Eastern Kentucky, over and through a congeries of wild, savage and roadless hills and mountains, where a few rebel guerrillas would hold the wagons, their drivers and escort completely at their mercy. Already some of the teams have been destroyed by the marauders; and we judge that MORGAN's communications are now altogether cut off, from the fact that a rebel telegram, as well as BROWNLOW's letter, affirm that the rebels are in possession of Barboursville, in Kentucky, on the direct line leading to the Gap, and also that they have concentrated a force at a point called Flat Lick, twenty miles from the Gap, and have thus entirely cut off supplies. Our own telegraph, however, comforts us with the assurance that ""Gen. MORGAN is in no danger, as he has provisions and forage enough to last him thirty days;"" though it does not inform us what he is going to do after the lapse of the brief time specified. Thus, solitary and isolated, is this gallant soldier, with his little army, upholding the flag of the Union on these wild Cumberland mountain peaks; and thus is the very existence of his daring force imperiled by the rebels. The Richmond Dispatch of a very late date, in speaking of affairs in this region, says that the ""Confederate officers and men are fully alive to the opportunity of now striking an effective blow at the minions of Lincoln, and stirring news must he heard before many days from Cumberland Gap.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Critical Condition of our Army at Cumberland Gap.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Critical Condition of our Army at Cumberland Gap.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38611b67-867c-540d-b7ea-58ffd0314230,1104,nyt://article/38611b67-867c-540d-b7ea-58ffd0314230

A large number of witnesses were, examined during the inquest, but no testimony was elicited, going to show that the husband was the guilty party. The evidence, however, revealed the fact, that WEILER and his wife had, for a long time past, lived very unhappily together, and one witness gave evidence to the fact, that recently he had heard the prisoner threaten to shoot his wife. The showing verdict was recorded by the jury: ""The deceased came to her death by a pistol shot wound, but whether suicide or not the Jury are unable to determine."" Upon the rendition of this verdict the Coroner concluded to detain the husband, JACOB WEILER, until he could consult with the District Attorney as to whether the case was one in which [???] could be taken. The prisoner denies most emphatically that he shot his wife.

Of course some of the first blush of patriotic ardor faded away before the morning of yesterday; yet enough was left to prove that the meeting had, to a considerable extent, accomplished its mission, and that the eloquence of those who had appealed to their fellow-citizens from the impromptu forums around which the gathering took place, had not all fallen on stony ground, but that much of it had taken root and prospered, and would, in the fullness of time blossom into crops of armed men. The meeting would not have entirely failed of its purpose had only one man been induced to enlist for every speech that was made; for words are cheap and plentiful, and many of them may be expended profitably in the production of a single soldier; but there is no question that every speech produced its tens and its hundreds, and that the Union hosts will soon be regiments stronger for the healthful excitement that a few eloquent phrases uttered in season thus produced. And not merely in the way of immediate enlistments was the meeting fruitful. The appeals there made reached the pockets of those whose persons could not be given to the cause, and many a thousand dollars, donated to sustain the country's life, will have its date of gift from Wednesday.

On Tuesday night, the cavalry of Gen. STUART, for a third time in the history of the Summer campaign, made their appearance in the rear of the Union army. Manassas is between Gen. POPE's centre and Washington City. It was upon the Manassas station the rebels made their descent, in numbers stated -- probably with exaggeration -- at two or three thousand men, capturing a battery of New-York artillery, some empty cars, and destroying a serious amount of army stores. Such thorough workers, we may be sure, did not leave the railroad track and the telegraphic wire untouched; and we shall not be surprised if stories of the destruction of two or three important bridges should prove true. To the rest of the narrative, as sent us by straggling correspondents, we may give more reserved credit. It will turn out, we suspect, that the rebels did not burn the railroad bridge six miles nearer Washington; and that the panic-like story of their continuing to bold Manassas in strong force, is founded only in a frightened fancy. Nothing is less probable than that with a heavy body of MCCLELLAN's army threatening to flank their main body on the South of the Rappahannock, they would place a considerable force at Manassas, where it must certainly be cut off and captured. This view gathers strength from a later report of the army of POPE having assumed the offensive, and commenced its advance upon the enemy; a movement certainly not undertaken with a hostile army and broken communications in the rear.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Dash at Manassas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Dash at Manassas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f6c7eac-4a8a-55d0-bde6-72bdbe299215,590,nyt://article/9f6c7eac-4a8a-55d0-bde6-72bdbe299215

MITCHEL's speech was eloquent, enthusiastic, patriotic; for, as the people of New-York have had many opportunities of knowing in former years, his genius illustrates and glorifies whatever subject it may touch. But why, in this hour of tremendous peril to the nation's armies, is this accomplished, gallant and educated soldier, clad in his Major-General's uniform, haranguing a crowd in the highways of New-York? When the territory, the towns and the fields which he won from the rebels in Tennessee and Alabama are being rapidly regained by them; when the army which, under him, marched only and always to victory, is now engaged in less else but surrendering piecemeal to the rebels -- why is he not given back his command, that he may have a fresh opportunity to demonstrate that his style of strategy -- the strategy of activity and aggression -- is the true style, as it is assuredly the only one which will prevent the rebels from utterly extirpating our Southwestern armies in course of time, and carrying their raids up to the Ohio? We know there were certain charges made against Gen. MITCHEL; but they were so preposterous, so utterly false on their very face, that the authorities have refused to listen [???] Still, they have been sufficient to [???] out of the field, strongly against his will, for two or three months, during which time the rebels have invaded the region which he conquered, and of which he was formerly in command, and, according to the boast of the guerrilla MORGAN, have destroyed ten million dollars worth of military stores, captured forty towns, taken prisoner ten regiments of National troops, and spread dismay over two or three of the most populous States of the West. When MITCHEL was deprived of his command, he was on the very point of marching his army into East Tennessee, and had already made the initial movements for that end; now the liberation of that section has been apparently postponed until every white man there is drafted into the rebel army, and the loyal women and children are persecuted and plundered until they resign themselves to despair. When the Union army is so disgraced, and our soldiers suffer so severely from imbeciles, quacks and political Generals, it is certainly strange that Gen. MITCHEL, whose military record is one of the brightest which can be shown by any man in the service, should be exiled to New-York, where, in order to do some little work for his country, he is driven to the necessity of speechifying before an assemblage in the City Hall Park.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WRONG FIELD FOR A GALLANT GENERAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WRONG FIELD FOR A GALLANT GENERAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b06a0191-52df-5a56-a8a5-dbbef7014305,457,nyt://article/b06a0191-52df-5a56-a8a5-dbbef7014305

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/30/archives/military-matters-in-the-city-the-last-day-of-the-bounties.html,,"To-day -- Saturday, August the 30th -- is the last day on which any volunteer for the army -- whether into regiments new or old -- will be paid one cent of State or United States bounty. It appears to have been definitively decided at Washington and Albany that if a man had not sense enough already to make sure of his $92 or $63 by enlisting before the end of the month, it would be useless waiting any longer. The amount of bounties offered have been generous beyond all precedent. They have been so large that any man who required pecuniary inducements to make him patriotic must have been tempted by them. If the temptation has failed, still leaving the quota of New-York deficient, that deficiency must be made up by draft. The draft may not be put in force for two or three weeks yet, it is true, and, in the meantime, volunteering may go on; but it will be volunteering for love of country or desire of military adventure, and will not be encouraged by any special premiums from official sources. Some few regiments will, from private sources, continue to be assisted in their efforts to fill up; but private liberality can afford no such munificent aid as has hitherto come from the State and National Governments. Of course there is a class of men in business, or enjoying lucrative employment, who wish to serve the country willingly, but who nevertheless defer enlisting to the latest possible moment. To this class bounties are unimportant. They will come in before drafting begins, but at a time of their own choosing.There are, however, a great many men whose families want all the relief that can be obtained for them, and these men and those dependent on them will be sorry, when they find themselves absorbed by the draft, that they procrastinated so foolishly beyond the acceptable time. They will have no remedy, though, then. They will have no remedy if they lose the final chance offered them to-day. Any time before this 30th of August merges into the irretrievable past, they can enroll their names, and claim a snare of the bounties which have so long been fruitlessly held within their reach. Actual enlistment -- that is, ""mustering in"" -- will do on Monday; but names must be enrolled before this day is through. It is a question of a few hours; and on the enlistment or non-enlistment of a man within or beyond those few hours depends his securing for the immediate use of himself or family $92, if he join a regiment now in the field, or $63 if he join one of the new regiments now organizing. There are plenty of men who mean to volunteer.

Editorial on report McClellan will be given command on Army of Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/30/archives/gen-mcclellans-new-command.html,Editorial on report McClellan will be given command on Army of Virginia,"-- We have a statement from Philadelphia and from Baltimore that Gen. McCLELLAN has been appointed to, and has accepted, the command of the Army of Virginia. (The ""Army of Virginia,"" technically so called, is the army now commanded by Gen. POPE.) Gen. BURNSIDE. it is further said, in one dispatch, is to command the ""Army of the Potomac,"" and Gen. POPE the ""Army of the Rappahannock"" -- the latter being a new designation. We judge that all the National forces in Virginia must be reorganized before these changes of commanders can take place. Indeed, even now, the late commands of MCCLELLAN, POPE and BURNSIDE, have been fundamentally altered in their composition -- many of MCCLELLAN's divisions and brigades being with POPE, others with BURNSIDE, while MCCLELLAN himself has been assigned part of the troops of each of the last mentioned Generals, besides many of the new levies. One object of these changes is probably to distribute the veteran troops among each of the army divisions -- so that our whole force in the field may be made at once effective. Furthermore, after the peninsular experiment, the military authorities would certainly not give Gen. MCCLELLAN the chief command of the army he had there, on any other field of action. MCCLELLAN's new army will, most likely, be either the central column of the ""Onward to Richmond"" forces, or its reserve.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

We have given from day to day, as they have reached us, somewhat imperfect accounts of the important events which have occurred -- necessarily imperfect, because in most cases written at a distance from the scenes of operations. They have been sufficient, however, to give a general idea of the great movements which have been affected, and the series of skirmishes and battles which culminated on Thursday in the great struggle, of which we give an official account elsewhere. We yesterday morning published a dispatch from Gen. POPE to Gen. HALLECK, giving an official account of the battle of Thursday, which was ended by the darkness of night, and expressing the expectation that it would be renewed in the morning. In a dispatch dated yesterday, Gen. POPE states that a terrific battle was fought on Friday, on the old Bull Run battle-ground, with the combined forces of the enemy, lasting with continuous fury from daylight until after dark, by which time the enemy was driven from the field, which was occupied by our forces, who wore too much exhausted to push matters. Gen. POPE intended to pursue as soon as reinforced by FITZ-JOHN PORTER's corps, which was exported up during the morning. At the moment of closing his dispatch, however, word was brought to Gen. POPE that the enemy were in full retreat toward the mountains. What their chance of escape was may to inferred from the general tenor of our advices. The rebel force seems to have been pretty thoroughly surrounded, and it is difficult to imagine how it could escape capture or total annihilation. Gen. POPE estimates our losses on Friday at not less than eight thousand men killed and wounded, and the losses of the rebels at fully double that number. Our captures in this battle are said to be great. Their extent will probably soon be made known.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4a3986e-17cd-5656-a101-366b34a040d3,697,nyt://article/a4a3986e-17cd-5656-a101-366b34a040d3

"That was a disastrous moment last Winter, when the enlistments were stopped; regiments, with numbers nearly complete, disbanded; and contracts for the manufacture of arms cancelled. To-day Government lacks arms for even the first half of the 600,000 men called for. It is obliged to appeal to the several States to arm the regiments forwarded by them to the seat of war; and it will only be by the promptitude and success of the negotiations for arms in Europe, and the instant patriotism of the loyal States in transferring their supplies to Government, that the crisis can be met. Already, we learn, a dozen Government agents are scouring the English markets for Enfield rifles, their eager competition advancing the price seriously. But in this case ""price is no object,"" and we can congratulate ourselves that the deficient supply of weapons will be only momentary.

Extravagant anticipations are expressed that the full quota of this State will be raised by the 1st of September -- and certainly will be so if a little extension of time be but given. It is worth while to bring down these high-flown notions by a reference to the sober facts of statistics. Now, according to the latest official returns from headquarters in Albany, published two or three days ago, New-York State still requires 14,000 men to make up her quota under the first call for 300,000 men. The ratio for our State is, in round numbers, 60,000, and but 46,000 of these have been raised thus far. It is, perhaps, fair to calculate that the deficit of 14,000 lacking at the time of the latest returns will, with the stimulus to enlistments which the presence of Gen. CORCORAN inspires, be forthcoming by the 1st of September.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Why We Should Draft.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Why We Should Draft.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-08-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/efac3903-92dd-525d-ad21-5ed2d294906e,968,nyt://article/efac3903-92dd-525d-ad21-5ed2d294906e
