GOTTSCHALK, he is accepted by the public as one of the few artists who are the greatest of modern pianists. while the critic heartily indorses its judgment. This is on the score, [???] alone of his brillancy of touch and execution, but, also, of the quaint originality of his invention, and the musical delight with which it would seem to be conceived. We have been more specially induced to remark on this last from hearing the new dance, ""Reponds [???],"" which he produced for the first time, and which was rendered by himself and Mr. H. SANDERSON. This was merely a [???], the idea of which was derived from some of the Spanish dances with which he has been conversant among the Havanese Creoles. But how splendidly has he embroidered the original theme he had seized upon, and wrought it, with its quaint time, into one of the most deliciously poetical of dances. As you listen to him, the nervous lightness of the Creole girl and her partner flashes before you, and you improvise the romance which the dream of the composer has suggested. This piece was wonderfully rendered by [???], who was most ably assisted by SANDERSON, and deserved the [???] applause which was awarded it. We may also warmly [???] the [???] on BEETHOVEN's Sonata Patherique -- or rather the manner in which it was translated by him. Perhaps, the German admirers of the master might somewhat except to its excessive brilliancy. But we ourselves see no reason for not accepting [???] transition, even if it verges upon being a new reading of the master, any more than we might decline recognizing the merit of [???], because it does not resemble the [???] JOHN [???] formerly gave the [???] world. The [???] a Seville, which is a charming and quiet bit of musical embroidery, in which his fingers [???] [???], was on this occasion exchanged by him for ""The Funeral [???]."" We may mention than in [???] serving the encore for the overture of ""[???] Tell,"" arranged for two [???], Mr. [???], [???] spontaneous good feeling, responded to it by playing, with Mr. SANDERSON, who had performed the [???] [???] ""The Bridal Eve Polka,"" composed by the [???] the vocal start of the evening, although the new tenor, TOMBESI, assisted in the [???] with [???]. The ""Pardon de [???]."" although not heard by us by any means for the first time, was a vocal gem well worth the setting which it had in the remainder of the concert. [???] in our opinion, not so good in the salon as on the stage. However, as we have, as yet, heard him but twice, it is hardly just to him, while it is certainly unjust to the public, to give a decided opinion in either case. The audience,at all events, seemed to share our opinion.

Editorial proposes policy for rebuilding Union when war is over,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/01/archives/the-war-a-war-of-the-people-against-the-aristocracy.html,Editorial proposes policy for rebuilding Union when war is over,"The time has come, in the rapid progress of events, for the Northern people to consider seriously their policy of reconstruction. Victories on the battle-field, capture of forts and batteries, the surrender of large cities and the military occupation of States as large as European kingdoms, are all very well -- they are indispensable, but they offer no solution of the final question, ""How to reconstruct the Union?"" We shall, it is true, conquer the South; we shall break up her armies and take possession of her cities; we can hold her as a conquered province, but it would be as Russia holds Poland, or as England held Ireland in the time of CROMWELL. It might, indeed, be a necessary state of things, but it would be one very repugnant to American feelings, very dangerous to our own liberties, and unsuited to our institutions and our Constitution. It is necessary for us, if possible, to have an American Union again. How shall we bring it about out of this chaos of contending forces, and this storm of civil wrath and mutual bitterness? This is the important question for us now. The answer we believe to be found in the very conditions of the problem - a solution, too, of the most hopeful nature - What is it, this war? We must never forget that it is not a war of sections, nor of parties. It in a class war. It is an ambitious insurrection of a powerful aristocracy for themselves. It is a war of the rich, in the interest of the rich, and is really against the poor and the middle class. It is the gentlemen's rebellion. It arose with the upper class, it is borne by them, it is forced upon others by their power. They are offering their wealth like water for it. The Southern aristocracy are now a compact, absolute military despotism - such as the world has seldom seen - able with the energy, ability and means of a few hundred thousand men to control the lives and destinies of millions who have no heart or interest in the struggle. It will be noticed that the aristocracies of the world everywhere sympathize with this powerful class. A large portion of the aristocratic interest of England knows instinctively that the struggle in the United States is only a type of the contest waging in Great Britain between the few and the many. Every day reveals some new proof of the nature of our civil war - that it is a war of classes. We find, as one battle after another occurs, that the rank and file in the Southern armies have little interest in the struggle. They surrender by the ten thousand - they yield strong position's at the first motion of a charge - they give up forts add islands which might hold out for months - they desert and mutiny. Even their own papers state that men are forced into the army at the point of the bayonet. The private soldiers invariably assure our men that they would gladly take the oath of allegiance; they are sick of the war, and sorry that they ever went into it. But with the officers - ""the gentlemen,"" (so called) - it is quite another story. These are always determined and bitter. They hate the Yankee, they detest the Union. Whenever thay can, they burn their cotton, desert their homes, and abandon their estates. They have sworn an undying hostility to our Government, and neither peace nor pardon would mollify them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War a War of the People against the Aristocracy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War a War of the People against the Aristocracy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/391bd5cc-769b-5e1e-a7ce-55621ffdde49,1199,nyt://article/391bd5cc-769b-5e1e-a7ce-55621ffdde49,

"The news we receive from the rebels concerning New-Orleans is a remarkable medley, and the only fact that appears in it clear and certain is that the city is really in our possession.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/01/archives/the-news-from-neworleans.html,,"The news we receive from the rebels concerning New-Orleans is a remarkable medley, and the only fact that appears in it clear and certain is that the city is really in our possession. The fleet passed Fort Jackson just a week ago this morning, and by noon of next day it appeared before the Crescent City. A demand for the surrender of the city was immediately made by the commander of the naval squadron, which the rebel General refused to comply with; but immediately after his refusal, he and his forces evacuated the city, and fled northward by railroad, nearly a hundred miles. Commodore FARRAGUT, instead of opening fire upon the rebellious city, then entered into a correspondence with the civil authorities, the result of which is not told; but the terms of the dispatch we give this morning, dated Mobile, Sunday, indicate that the city functionaries were trying to induce our naval commander to ask them to surrender the city; and the only thing they seemed to fear was that he would not renew his demand. It is said that ""he promised the Mayor's Secretary, who visited the fleet by flag of truce, that he would make a renewed demand for the surrender of the city; but,"" alas ! ""he has not done so up to this hour, 5 o'clock"" (Sunday.) That certainly looks exceedingly like a parallel to the authentic tale of Capt. SCOTT's coon, whose anxiety to avoid the bullets of the huntsman led him to invite himself down from the tree -- a historical narrative, well known and much admired by all Orleanians. But if Commodore FARBAGUT had not repeated his demand for a capitulation by 5 o'clock, it is probable he did so by 5 1/2 o'clock; or, more likely still, the Mayor, waiving all needless ceremony in the matter, chivalrously took the initiative, and offered to give up what he knew he could not keep. For the Richmond papers, of Monday morning, definitely proclaimed to the startled rebels of the capital, and in the ears of JEFF. DAVIS himself, that ""New-Orleans was in the possession of the enemy."" The latest of our dispatches concerning the city is from Mobile, Monday, and that announces the evacuation of all the fortifications erected for the defence of New-Orleans on the lake in its rear -- so that, from the battered forte, sixty miles below the city, to the point to which LOVELL retreated, eighty miles above it, there was nowhere an enemy who offered any resistance. No mention is made in any of the dispatches of Gen. BEN. BUTLER, who was in chief command of the whole expedition, military and naval; and it is evident that he was not with the fleet when it appeared before the city, as, if he had been, the negotiations for capitulation would have been carried on by and with him, instead of Commodore FARRAGUT. It is very likely that FARRAGUT was waiting for his appearance from Friday, when the first demand for surrender was made, until Sunday night at five o'clock, when the second demand had not yet been sent to the anxious Mayor. It was understood, however, that Gen. BUTLER was to approach New-Orleans, with the Army of Occupation, by way of the Lakes, reduce the fortifications on their shores, and march to the possession of the City via the famous Shell Road; and this view is confirmed by our special dispatch from Washington this morning. If he reached his point of debarkation by Sunday or Monday of this week, however, as he must have done, be would find no hostile batteries or forts lining the shore, as the rebels themselves had destroyed them all; and the way would be clear for a triumphal march into the greatest city of rebeldom. By this route (i.e. by Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain) our vessels could keep up free communication with the city; and if the forts on the Lower Mississippi were not reduced, they will now be cut off from supplies, and a speedy surrender is inevitable. They were only of value as defences to the city: and that being in our hands, it is better not to waste powder on their destruction, but to preserve as much of them as possible for our own uses. But we shall have authentic de[???] concerning the whole affair before many days as a steamer was doubtless dispatched North as soon as the work was completed. In the meantime, the rebel dispatches we already have, leave no doubt of the fact that our force in actual possession of the city.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The News from New-Orleans.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The News from New-Orleans.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e5656c22-c514-5a89-bf48-1b56da9c60f8,963,nyt://article/e5656c22-c514-5a89-bf48-1b56da9c60f8,

Editorial on Union operations in Virginia Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/01/archives/operations-in-the-virginia-valley-the-progress-of-gen-banks.html,Editorial on Union operations in Virginia Valley,"-- The rapid advance of Gen. Banks down the Valley of Virginia has brought him near Staunton, the capital of the valley region. Situated as the place is on the Central Railroad, the control of that important line of communication is thus placed in Union hands, so that the progress of FREMONT on the west, parallel with Gen. BANKS' movement, will be secured from interruption. We are, of course, without knowledgeof the plans governing the course ofGen. BANKS, and equally, of course, can violate no rule in repeating the common impression, that the Southward march of this column will terminate at Staunton, and that following the line of the railroad through Rockfish Gap, Gen. BANKS will soon cooperate with the designs of Gen. McDOWELL in Eastern Virginia. The valley below Staunton is extremely broken by irregular spurs of the Alleghanies. There would be no profit in pursuing a long march through that difficult, country, on a path leading persistently away from the scene of active operations on the coast, without leading to the great battleground in the Southwest. The army, so misdirected, would a simply be so much strength lost, at a moment when all strength should be exerted in a decisive and final blow at the head of rebellion. A turn to the eastward may involve a contest for a passage over the Blue Ridge, where the rebel army will have capital natural advantage in making a stand; but this danger surmounted the whole of Eastern Virginia is at the feet of the Union General. From Charlottesville he may move directly on Richmond, simultaneously with McDOWELL: or, following the Orange and Alexandria road, he may seize Lynchburgh and the Tennessee Railroad. These temptations doubtless indicate the track to be taken by this enterprising Yankee General.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OPERATIONS IN THE VIRGINIA VALLEY; THE PROGRESS OF GEN.

It recites a clear and comprehensive narrative of the events which have carried the country into the vortex of revolution with the comment necessary to give a true interpretation to a history so pregnant with results, and so directly bearing upon the reorganization of party, and the future political condition of the country. The authors of this paper place the responsibility of the war, not directly upon the slaveholders, but upon the political leaders of the South, reluctant to part with the control of the National Administration. The election of Mr. LINCOLN was the signal of rebellion, not because it endangered the interests of Slavery, but because it placed the Government in Northern hands, with the patronage needful to perpetuate the possession. Against the political leaders of the South, the address would have all the penalties of treason directed; it calls for a moderate scheme of confiscation applicable to the slaveholder, as a too willing accessory to rebellion, but has no punishment to urge against the ignorant and deluded rag-tag and bob-tail of Southern society, who have composed the heroic armies of the revolt. The Administration of Mr. LINCOLN, both in its conduct of domestic and foreign affairs, meets wills the entire approval of the signers. They find it their duty to support the President's plan of emancipation, the policy of abolishing Slavery in the District of Columbia, and in general to lend their cordial concurrence to the conservative line of conduct which Mr. LINCOLN and his leading advisers have marked out for themselves. The restoration of the Union, the enforcement of the Constitution and laws, are the objects of the war.

editorial compares Yorktown now and at time of Revolutionary War,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/02/archives/yorktown-in-1781-and-1862.html,editorial compares Yorktown now and at time of Revolutionary War,"The army commanded by Gen. MCCLELLAN has now been before Yorktown precisely the period it took WASHINGTON to reduce that stronghold, in the memorable siege of '81. This period has been in both cases filled up in precisely the same manner -- the construction of lines of offensive works. To make the parallel complete, it only remains that the same result should follow the operations of Gen. MCCLELLAN as attended the preparations of Gen. WASHINGTON, namely, the surrender of the enemy's force. Three weeks WASHINGTON employed in weaving a web around CORNWALLIS at Yorktown. For three weeks has Gen.MCCLELLAN been doing the same thing for the present rebel force, on the grander scale and with the vastly more destructive enginery of modern warfare. When the British General saw what the American army had done, he realized that resistance was hopeless -- and surrendered. No general engagement took place between the two forces. WASHINGTON sacrificed no lives, except the few that were lost in the preliminary operations. His reduction of Yorktown was a triumph of pure military strategy. If it should turn out that Gen. MCCLELLAN designed to emulate his illostrious predecessor in this also? It would jump with that General's military method, and would certainly be a glorious triumph in the estimation of every right-minded man. And yet one scarcely ventures to desire that it should ho so; for malignity can go very far, and there are not wanting those who would make such, a bloodless victory the occasion for a renewed howl against a General whom they have determined at all hazards to defame. But whether it enters in to the plan of Gen. MCCLELLAN, that Yorktown shall fall into his hands as the ripe fruit of his strategic combinations, or whether he intends to had his vast force against the rebel line with a [???] that shall be the Atlantic coast to its foundations -- one thing is certain the crisis is impending; the gigantic preparations of the Commanding General are now complete, and any hour the electric wire may be freighted with intelligence that will be as decisive of the fate of the rebellion as the glorious tidings which WASHINGTON transmitted to the Continental Congress on the 18th of October, 1781, was decisive of American freedom and independence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Yorktown in 1781 and 1862.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Yorktown in 1781 and 1862.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/91f43091-d814-508a-b317-c9c77a10289c,1275,nyt://article/91f43091-d814-508a-b317-c9c77a10289c,

"There have been a greater numberof important events and actions during the month of April, just closed, than in any month of the war. It has been a month of great surrenders, battles and movements. It has been illustrated by the surrender of Island Number Ten and its six thousand rebel troops: by the surrender of Fort Pulaski and its rebel garrison; by the capitulation of New-Orleans, the New-York of the South, and all its rebels, excepting those who fled. It has been crimsoned by the bloody battle of Shiloh, and by a hundred minor engagements, fought along a line of fifteen hundred miles in extent, from Yorktown to Santa Fe. It has seen the splendid marc of [???] and the masterly movements of POPE. It has seen the advance of MCDOWELL to Fredericksbrugh, and the march of Gen. BANKS toward Staunton.

"GOTTSCHALK'S LAST CONCERT. - This concert is, after all, not to be the last which GOTTSCHALK will give in this City at present, as we were told upon entering the concert room, by one of the officials in attendance, that he is to give a positively last concert upon Monday next, a fact in which musical New-York, or the musical fashion of New-York, ought to rejoice; as from the character of the audiences he calls together, it is certain that he is the most fashionable, as he is the greatest, pianist now before the public. Seriously, indeed, in spite of the weather, he attracted such an audience last night, as in point of number, and musical quality and position, he ought to attract, and one which did full justice to the programme which he had provided for them. Among the most charming pieces which he gave was ""Illusions Perdues,"" although it was one which is undoubtedly lost in a large saloon and to the general composition of modern concert rooms. ""Repondi moi,"" which had been announced for repetition in consequence of its success when first produced, was, owing to the Illness of SANDERSON, performed with him by MUZIO. Under the circumstances, it was certainly as well rendered by him as could have been expected, and won for him the tangible honor of an encore with GOTTSCHALK. The Fantasia on the ""Lucrezia Borgia"" displayed all the originality of style that has always been so remarkable in the last-named artist - an originality so strikingly manifest that it is always as much a matter of uncertainty to himself as of doubt to those who are listening to him, what novelty of rendering he may choose to introduce in the pieces of his own composition which he may be singing to his hearers on the instrument. This renders them strikingly captivating to the audience, and will in some measure account for that singular sense of novelty which he invariably produces, even in those who are most accustomed to his manner and style of playing. It may be no more than matter of justice to say that in this concert, us in his preceding ones, he played upon a grand piano of GOTTSCHALK'S. CARLOTTI PATTI won applause for MUZIO by her singing of his ""L'AMOUR Polka.""

Seriously, indeed, in spite of the weather, he attracted such an audience last night, as in point of number, and musical quality and position, he ought to attract, and one which did full justice to the programme which he had provided for them. Among the most charming pieces which he gave was ""Illusions Perdues,"" although it was one which is undoubtedly lost in a large saloon and to the general composition of modern concert rooms. ""Repondi moi,"" which had been announced for repetition in consequence of its success when first produced, was, owing to the Illness of SANDERSON, performed with him by MUZIO. Under the circumstances, it was certainly as well rendered by him as could have been expected, and won for him the tangible honor of an encore with GOTTSCHALK. The Fantasia on the ""Lucrezia Borgia"" displayed all the originality of style that has always been so remarkable in the last-named artist - an originality so strikingly manifest that it is always as much a matter of uncertainty to himself as of doubt to those who are listening to him, what novelty of rendering he may choose to introduce in the pieces of his own composition which he may be singing to his hearers on the instrument. This renders them strikingly captivating to the audience, and will in some measure account for that singular sense of novelty which he invariably produces, even in those who are most accustomed to his manner and style of playing. It may be no more than matter of justice to say that in this concert, us in his preceding ones, he played upon a grand piano of GOTTSCHALK'S. CARLOTTI PATTI won applause for MUZIO by her singing of his ""L'AMOUR Polka."" We are unaware if this was the first time it has ever been given in this City or not, as the programme leaves it somewhat in doubt whether it is a novelty for the public or the lady.

The City retired to rest at night, however, no wiser, on this point, than it was after its breakfast of telegrams in the morning.

HALLECK; and, if the intelligence which the Department chooses to give to the Press may be credited, the most important and noteworthy thing in the Southwest at this moment is, that ""our army is well, in high spirits, and eager to meet the enemy."" From the South, however, there comes an item of news of greater military significance, if it be not of more importance.

The wishes of those who have been engaged in maturing this scheme were to build a theatre, and, in building it, to do away with two of the all abuses which has contributed, more than anything else, to the general failure of operatic managers. These were the free tickets held by the stockholders, and the immense extension of the deadhead branch of an operatic audience, which has, of late years, taken each an apparently firm root in the New-York Academy. For the last reason, as well as to reduce the current expenses of an operatic establishment to a more reasonable scale, it has been determined to erect the proposed Opera-House on a smaller scale than our present Academy. The site fixed upon is a very eligible one -- near Madison-square; and we apprehend that, unless difficulties arise in securing the ground, it will be almost immediately commenced; The proposed House will contain seats for about 1,000 or 1,600 persons, and it is understood that the auditorium will, with, of course, the exception of the parquet sad amphitheatre, be divided into boxes, containing four or six seats each. Two fine stores are to be under the theatre, on the ground-floor of the building, the rent of which will be reckoned on as a pert payment upon the capital invested -- the entire cost being calculated as averaging from $100,000 to $120,000. We need not point out that this house, when built, will be far more likely to pay the [???] as well as the proprietor or proprietors, from the mere fact that then will not be a large community of stockholders entitled to the best seats in the house, in that [???] class upon whom an opera manager has principally to rely for support. This fact alone, must give the lessee a far greater chance of success - we say this advisedly -- for in the term of year since the Academy of Music was first built, it would be difficult to point out a single tenant of that establishment, whose books would foot up at a positive gain. In truth, there can be no reason why [???] reasonably and economically managed, should not pay, and pay well, in such a wealthy City is New-York is, although it is here carried on without a subvention from the Government. But to effect such a result, the privileged classes who do not pay, must renounce their privileges or have them denied to them, and the house must be a size which will not allow it to appear empty when scantily filled by a merely paying audience, unless that audience is helped out by a large dead-head addition to it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Opera-House.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Opera-House.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Music', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e6e4b05-3909-5776-b932-2e7457f8381e,487,nyt://article/5e6e4b05-3909-5776-b932-2e7457f8381e,

Editorial on Southerners' tendency to lie about their strength,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/04/archives/value-of-the-rebel-lies.html,Editorial on Southerners' tendency to lie about their strength,"-- Oddly enough, the uniform success of all the expeditions directed by the National Government against the various rebel strongholds is, perhaps, in a considerable degree owing to the monstrous exaggerations indulged in by the rebels. No sooner is it conjectured that a certain point is aimed at by the National force than rebel report forth with endows the locality with every conceivable and inconceivable means of defensive and offensive warfare. Dark hints of untold resources of men, forts, ships and what not are given out: the spot is signalized as of all others the one they wish to have attempted, and the ""Yankees"" are gaily invited to hospitable graves. In consequence, the Government -- though of course perfectly aware of the rebel tendency to draw the long bow -- has yet proportioned the outfit of each important expedition just as though it would have actually to encounter the opposition intimated. The result is that our preparations have generally been overwhelming. The Fort Royal armada was on a scale out of all proportion to the task which really presented itself when it reached its destination -- namely, the reduction of a couple of imperfect earthworks, which yetwere sufficiently formidable to have seriously embarrassed a small fleet; while, at the same time, the presence of the powerful flotilla enabled us to take possession not only of Port Royal, but of the adjacent coast for a couple of hundred miles. Again, the Southern accounts of the enormous garrison at Fort Donelson led the Union commander to send thither a very powerful army, and when all was over, it turned out that the National force was really twice that of the rebels. Finally, there is every appearance that the capture of New-Orleans will prove a still more striking illustration of the same fact. The rebel imagination for months fairly exhausted itself in depicting the terrific character of the defences of that place. Nevertheless, if all they said had been true, their preparations would still have found more than a match in an expedition whose proportions may fairly be called gigantic. The rebels have to thank themselves that the Government has sent force enough not only to do up the New-Orleans business, but to clean rebellion out of the whole length of the Mississippi and its tributaries.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VALUE OF THE REBEL LIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'VALUE OF THE REBEL LIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6be66c66-7a0e-55be-aac0-5d65a9f55421,458,nyt://article/6be66c66-7a0e-55be-aac0-5d65a9f55421,

"Yorktown, which the rebels have repeatedly boasted could never be captured, is now in our possession, and the rebel army which lately occupied the intrenchments by which it was defended, are in full flight before the National army under Gen. MCCLELLAN. Various rumors have been in circulation during the past week, principals founded on the statements of deserters, that the rebels intended to evacuate the position, but it was hardly thought possible that the rebel leaders would risk such a movement. Evidence became very strong on Saturday, however, that they would do so, and on Saturday night, as will be seen from our dispatcher, the evacuation took place. Our troops immediately occupied the deserted works, and a large amount of camp equipage was found and guns, which the rebels dared not attempt to remove for fear of discovery. Gen. MCCLELLAN immediately threw forward all his cavalry and horse-artillery in pursuit, and took measures at once to embark troops on the York River, to be landed at West Point, on the railroad to Richmond -- Gloucester, in the meantime, having also been occupied by our forces. Everything inside the former rebel lines was found to be in the most confusion, indicating that the flight was hasty in the extreme. Seventy-one pieces of heavy artillery were found in their works, spiked, together with a large amount of ammunition, medical stores, camp equipage, tents, and the private property of the officers. Persons left in the town state that a large amount of ordnance stores was also thrown into the river, to prevent them falling into our hands. Our gunboats passed above Yorktown, and shelled the shore on the way up.

"The flight from Yorktown of the main body of the army of the rebel Confederacy indicates, beyond dispute, the breaking-up of the great rebellion which has so long menaced the Nation's existence and defied its power. Neither in any part of Virginia nor in any one of the Southern States can the rebels find a position as favorable for them as that which they held on the peninsula on which to try the issue of arms. They could bring into action here not alone their army, but whatever they had of a navy. They had not only their line of works extended across the peninsula from river to river, but, by land batteries, they commanded both of the rivers from each of their banks. They had their transports carrying supplies and reinforcements directly into their camp, -- their gunboats to act as guards and supports, -- the Merrimac, whose guns and the fame of whose invulnerability have echoed round the world; they were close to Norfolk, the military and naval arsenal of the South; hey were within convenient distance of the whole Southern system of railroads; they had within call all the slaves of the densest Slave section of Virginia; in short, whatever there is in the South of men, munitions, supplies, labor, or facilities of conveyance, could be put to more efficient use at Yorktown than at any other point. The position could not be flanked, and the rear was entirely open. There can be no doubt, too, that here was the great bulk of the Confederated rebel army. Beside the levies from Virginia, we have certain knowledge that there were here troops from South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, and, no doubt, also from all the other rebel States. The conscription law, which has been in operation in Virginia and throughout the South for over a month, has forced into service nearly the whole white population capable, of bearing arms; and as fast as regiments have been raised, they were sent post-haste, by rail and river, to Yorktown. To retreat from such a position, under such circumstances, is, in a military point of view, almost equivalent to giving up the campaign. At no other point is it possible for the rebels to bring into play one-half of the warlike agencies and facilities that were at their command here. Manassas itself was very far inferior as a defensive position to Yorktown.

"Our last intelligence from Mexico dissipates all doubt as to the fate of the coalition and the future policy of Spain. Gen. PRIM's nice sense of honor has rescued his adopted country from a very awkward position, and given the death-blow to a most unholy alliance.

What at a moment so critical could be the business between the French Emperor and the rebel chief? Was it in the interest of France, or of mankind, or, more strictly, of the American people, that these impenetrable negotiations were to be conducted? There was no fact, of course, beyond the bare visit to go upon. On a foundation so narrow, optimists were content to build nothing broader than an attempt to release the tobacco crop, stores of which had been bought, paid for, and housed in Richmond, on account of the French Government, but which the rebels declined to release, and the National Government to pass, if released, through the blockade. The object was thought not to be unworthy of a Minister Plenipotentiary. Of tobacco the Imperial Government has a monopoly. If supplies were wanting to the smoking and snuffing subjects of Imperial rule, it would be impossible to foretell the political, to say nothing of the commercial consequences to the Empire; and in this view the dispatch of a Prince of the blood-royal would have been justified by the urgent need.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Highly Important Disclosures The Secret of M.

"Of the partisan  rebel troopers who annoy the rear of our army in Tennessee, the most noted is a cavalry corps commanded by one MORGAN.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/07/archives/guerrillas-in-tennessee.html,,"-- Of the partisan rebel troopers who annoy the rear of our army in Tennessee, the most noted is a cavalry corps commanded by one MORGAN. This fellow began to figure while our army was in Central Kentucky last Winter, and since it moved southward he has been particularly active. He and his men turn up everywhere. Now they are reported as killing a picket; now waylaying and entrapping small detachments of our troops; now burning bridges, tearing up railroad tracks, scouring the country in every direction, plundering houses, frightening women and children, and mingling, on general principles, the occupation of rebel mosstroopers with that of bandits and marauders. He is the first genuine specimen of those guerrillas with which, when all other means of waging war fall, the rebels threaten, to devastate their own section of the country. His field of operation is mainly a narrow strip of country running north and south from Nashville to either border of Tennessee, along the line of the railroad which our troops travel in going south or north by Nashville. He likes particularly to commit his depredations tantalizingly near to the Capital, and says that he will yet have ANDY JOHNSON and other large game among his prisoners of war. We have already published a good many tale. of the fellow's doings, and some others are reported this morning. Last Friday he and his men made a sudden swoop upon a detachment of National troops stationed in the village of Pulaski, Giles County, Southern Tennessee, and, after a skirmish, captured four Union Captains, nine Lieutenants, an Adjutant, and about 250 privates, whom he spiked by putting them all upon their parole of honor. Three days afterward he suddenly turned up at the town of Lebanon, Wilson County, Northern Tennessee, nearly a hundred miles by the traveled route from the scene of the previous exploit; but this time the tide of battle turned against him. A large number of his men were taken prisoners, the rest routed, and he himself is said to be slain. This is the first time MORGAN is reported to be killed; and, it he has half as many lives as some other rebel chieftains in the Southwest, it need not disappoint anybody if he turn up again -- in time, at least, to be hanged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GUERRILLAS IN TENNESSEE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GUERRILLAS IN TENNESSEE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3bf4f7ee-9615-5e72-b528-3682bc1bb790,488,nyt://article/3bf4f7ee-9615-5e72-b528-3682bc1bb790,

MERCIER to the rebel Capital, and the nature and purport of his communications with the rebel leaders. We have intelligence this morning from Richmond, by way of Fortress Monroe, which tallies, in almost every particular, with our intelligence already published from Washington. The French Minister is said in Richmond to have freely declared to the rebelleaders his belief that their rebellion was a failure, and must soon come to an end; that the Emperor was sincerely anxious that the contest should be terminated as speedily as possible by their relinquishment of it; and that he (the Emperor) would willingly proffer his good offices as a peacemaker upon the basis of their reacknowledgment of the General Government's authority intact. All this was expressed to the rebel Government unofficially, and without in any way recognizing its authoritative existence. We think there need no longer be any doubt that it was for the purpose of letting the rebel leaders know what is now the opinion of the monarch who, a year ago, extended to their ""so-called Government"" the rights of a belligerent power, that the Imperial representative visited Richmond. In the event of a rebel defeat on the peninsula, we shall probably at once have proof positive that this is the real truth of a matter which has been the subject of so much speculation. If so, the American Government and people, as well as the rebels, will have a very grave question for consideration.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MYSTERY OF THE FRENCH MISSTION TO RICH; MOND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MYSTERY OF THE FRENCH MISSTION TO RICH; MOND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b345b84-4a17-5ae7-aa92-9e1a818eb746,265,nyt://article/5b345b84-4a17-5ae7-aa92-9e1a818eb746,

JOE JOHNSTON himself, and evidently intending to dispute his progress towards Richmond with all their power. There had been some brisk fighting, in which Gen. HANCOCK had taken two of the enemy's redoubts, and had repulsed EARLY's rebel brigade by a brilliant bayonet charge, in which our forces killed two rebel Colonels and two Lieutenant-Colonels, and captured one Colonel and one hundred and fifty other prisoners. Gen. HANCOCK's conduct in this affair is highly commended by Gen. MCCLELLAN. At the time of sending the dispatch our losses had not been ascertained, though they were thought to be heavy, as the fighting was very severe. Gen. MCCLELLAN expresses his belief in this dispatch that the rebel force is superior to his, and announces his determination to hold it in check while he resumed his original plan, temporarily suspended by the rebel flight from Yorktown.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bf94822a-2904-5043-904b-3e2f854f798c,652,nyt://article/bf94822a-2904-5043-904b-3e2f854f798c,

The vessel in question was seized under suspicious circumstances, off Charleston, on the 18th of March; and a portion of the crew having been removed, and a prize crew, numbering one Lieutenant and fifteen men substituted, the ship was ordered to Philadelphia for condemnation. Three of the original crew were left on board, the Captain, the steward, and cook. These three, before Cape Hatteras had been passed, executed a bold and ingenious scheme for recovering possession of the ship; and circumstances and the indifference of the prize crew favoring them, actually succeeded in overpowering and confining the officers, without alarming the crew, and in placing the hatches over the crew before any suspicion of the attempt had been excited. Enough of the captives to navigate the vessel and carry her safely to England were subsequently released upon parole. The heroism of the attempt, and still more its success, obtain the unqualified praise of the British Press, who are quite enraptured at the entire transaction.

His points are well taken, and lucidly stated; and in learning the difficult duties of the Grand Juror, the wayfarer, after hearing this admirably digested summary, can by no possibility err. But these are not the only things brought to light by the charge. Another trait of Judge MCCUNN's character is his persistence, when by logic or sophism he has wrought himself into a state of dogmatic conviction in his opinions; and this peculiarity is finely displayed in the presentation to the Grand Jury of his favorite view of Sunday Liquor laws, ""beverage, biberagium,"" and all. The Grand Jury has before it much work cut out for it by the rumsellers. The Judge was warranted in urging upon its attention not only the subject, but his legal prognosis thereof; and it now remains for Jury, Grand and Petit, to decide whether the Legislature meant to forbid the sale of rum of a Sunday, or to require it to be conducted in decency and secresy.

In answer to an inquiry as to how many men are in the army, Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, stated that the number was not known exactly, but he thought from 500,000 to 520,000. After debate the bill was laid over. The House bill to provide increased revenue was passed. A resolution was adopted instructing the Committee on Commerce to inquire whether any legislation is necessary relative to vessels belonging to loyal citizens seized and confiscated by the rebels, and recaptured at New-Orleans and other places. Mr. SUMNER, of Massachusetts, offered a resolution for the expulsion of Mr. STARKE, of Oregon, which was laid over. The House Committee, appointed to announce the impeachment of Judge HUMPHREYS, appeared at the bar of the Senate and fulfilled their mission. They received assurances that the Senate would take the proper steps in the matter. The bill to limit the number of Major and Brigadier-Generals was debated, but no conclusion was come to. Messrs. Clark of New-Hampshire, Collamer of Vermont, Harlan of Iowa, Cowan of Pennsylvania, Wilson of Massachusetts, Harris of New-York, Sherman of Ohio, Henderson of Missouri, and Willey of Virginia, were appointed the Special Committee on the Confiscation bill.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/08/archives/the-customhouse-revenue-of-the-last-month-the-tare-on-tea-important.html,,"Last month was another busy one at the Cus- tom-house, the cash receipts for duties amounting to $4,147,351, which sum is but little inferior to that re- ceived during the month preceding, the receipts for the two months amounting to nearly $9,000,000. These two months have been the most busy ones for a long time. The duties have mostly been paid on sugar, of which large quantities have been imported, and on tea, coffee and dry goods. Of tea, some very large and valuable cargoes have been imported this year, and the duties realised therefrom have contributed largely to the revenue. But, as the Treasury regulations with reference to the levying of duty on tea now stand, the Government loses each year a large sum of money to which it is justly entitled, and the loss of which only serves to enrich the importer. In 1799 a law was passed regulating the amount of tare to be allowed importers of various article. According to that law, tea, as it is usually imported, is entitled to an allowance of eighteen pounds per chest. This law, regulating the matter of allowances, was reaffirmed by the Secretary of the Treasury last year, when the passage of a tariff, levying specific duties, rendered necessary some regulations on this subject. The fact was not taken into consideration that tea from China comes packed in chests which weigh much less than they formerly did, the Quantity of lead used in lining the chests, and the weight of the wood of which the chests are made, being less. By forgetting this fact, and, in consequence, not regulating the tare as it should be regulated, the Government loses on each chest imported about $1, a loss which, in the course of a year, amounts to a large sum.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CUSTOM-HOUSE.; Revenue of the Last Month The Tare on Tea Important Regulation Issued by the Collector Decisions of the Secretary of theTreasury.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CUSTOM-HOUSE.; Revenue of the Last Month The Tare on Tea Important Regulation Issued by the Collector Decisions of the Secretary of theTreasury.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b712ec2-826e-5f47-bfa6-2b7558996b4d,1638,nyt://article/4b712ec2-826e-5f47-bfa6-2b7558996b4d,

The rebel mind had literally exhausted itself in its efforts to render the city impregnable. What other things could be thought or dreamed of, beside those which were provided? What could science, skill, or Confederate bonds do or procure, that was not done and procured? All that was thought to be necessary for the absolute security of the city, was to render the Mississippi River impassable, and the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain impossible for our fleet; -- and surely this had been thoroughly accomplished. Two of the means of defence and assaultwhich are particular favorites with the rebels -- stone blockades and torpedoes -- were impossible of application here.

BROWN, in company with Officer O'KEEFE, boarded the Columbia, yesterday, upon her arrival from Havana, and took into custody a young man who gave his name as JOHN WM. HAMMOND, upon the charge of being an officer in the rebel army. The officers immediately searched his baggage and found several sword belts; also, a beltplate, upon which the letters ""C.S.A."" were very handsomely engraved. The Surveyor asked him where his sword was, to which question the accused answered he did not know. After some delay it was ascertained that he had given it in charge to one of the porters. The porter was then found. At first he denied all knowledge of the weapon, but finally produced it from a dark, out-of-the-way place in the hold of the vessel. When the sword was brought to light, the young rebel officer began to tremble very violently, and, in a low tone, remarked to some of the bystanders that he was afraid he was in a scrape. The articles seized were given in charge to Collector BARNEY, and the prisoner was conveyed to Police Headquarters. He says that he is 28 years of age, and a native of Sullivan County, in this State. Several of the passengers who came on from Havana in the same steamer, state that the prisoner was very zealous in the advocacy of the rebel cause during the entire passage. It is pretty well known that he left this City some weeks ago with the intention of going to Cuba, where he hoped to fall in with a vessel about to run the blockade, and by this means to gain the soil of ""Secessia;"" but failing in this, he concluded to return to New-York. Another party, who appeared to be a companion of HAMMOND, was also arrested and conveyed to Police headquarters.",12,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTANT ARREST OF A REBEL OFFICER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IMPORTANT ARREST OF A REBEL OFFICER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7314fee0-bc46-5871-9031-cc50cf39607c,389,nyt://article/7314fee0-bc46-5871-9031-cc50cf39607c,

The following is a concise statement of the famous drift of this ship on her voyage of 48 days from Boston to Port Royal.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/08/archives/us-shipoftheline-vermont-particulars-of-her-voyage-from-boston-to.html,,"The following is a concise statement of the famous drift of this ship on her voyage of 48 days from Boston to Port Royal. The Vermont left her anchorage at President Roads, in Boston Harbor, about 7 A.M., on the 24th of February, in tow of two steamtugs, and proceeded to sea in company with the steamer Kensington, it having been the intention of the Navy Department that the latter vessel should accompany the Vermont, and, when practicable, tow her on the route. The Kensington made fast to the Vermont outside of Boston Light, both ships steering E. S.E. by compass, and continued to tow her during the day, the weather thick and foggy, and wind from the eastward, with evident indications of a change in the weather for the worse. About 7 P.M. the wind hauled to the N.W., and increased so rapidly that the contingency of the Vermont forging ahead and running down the Kensington induced the latter to cut the hawsers, and she passed her, flying before the gale. The wind increased, in violence, the ship then being under double-reef topsails clewed down, mainsail and foresail hauled up, and mizzen-topsail furled. About 10 P.M. it blew a hurricane, with snow and hail. The ship became unmanageable, broached to, and every sail was blown from the yards in succession. Land -- Cape Cod -- was then said to be seen by the Commander and coast pilot, on the Ice how. This discovery we believed was confined to them alone. Orders were given to let go both anchors; the starboard one parted at 150 fathoms, and the [???] brought up with one hundred fathoms chain, and dragged for one hundred miles, when the anchor and chain were lost. The order was then given by the Commander to cut away the masts, and the carpenter's gang commenced the work, when it was countermanded. The morning of the 25th found the ship a glare of ice, and badly crippled for want of sails, &c.; the precise position undefined, and weather bad in the extreme. At 3 A.M. of the 26th, the iron tiller gave way, near the socket; the rudder soon after wrenched itself from the stern-post, and was lost, inflicting, however, no damage to the stern-frame of the ship.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'U.S. SHIP-OF-THE-LINE VERMONT.; Particulars of Her Voyage from Boston to Port Royal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'U.S. SHIP-OF-THE-LINE VERMONT.; Particulars of Her Voyage from Boston to Port Royal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/83054d5a-d5fd-5517-a582-41051a667922,1331,nyt://article/83054d5a-d5fd-5517-a582-41051a667922,

McCLELLAN on Monday was too much for the rebels, and on Tuesday night they evacuated their new position at Williamsburgh, and continued their retreat toward Richmond, followed on Tuesday morning by our victorious troops. Gen. MCCLELLAN telegraphs to the War Department that the effect of Gen. HANCOCK's brilliant victory on Monday was to turn the left of the enemy's works, and our troops being reinforced the rebels were forced to leave with the utmost precipitation, leaving all their sick and wounded behind. We captured about three hundred uninjured prisoners and more than a thousand wounded -- proving the losses of the enemy to have been very severe. A subsequent dispatch from Gen. MCCELLAN, and the latest one from him, states that every hour proved our victory more complete, and that the enemy's loss was great, especially in officers. Our losses in HOOKER's Division on Monday are believed to be heavy, but are not yet known. Gen. HANCOCK gained his splendid success, however, with a loss of not over twenty killed and wounded. The latest we have from the Peninsula is a rumor received from Yorktown at Fortress Monroe, yesterday, to the effect that the rebels had left the direct line of retreat to Richmond, and had crossed the Chickahominy, destroying the bridges in their rear. This movement has been induced, probably, by the knowledge that Gen. MCCLELLAN has thrown a large force in their rear from West Point, at the head of navigation on the York River. This new line of retreat brings them near to the James River, on which our gunboats could do most effective service if allowed.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/95d76186-9c79-589e-b7f2-ff4c46e12aa9,1152,nyt://article/95d76186-9c79-589e-b7f2-ff4c46e12aa9,

The stage was occupied by a large number of clergymen and a num- ber of distinguished laymen, representing nearly if not every ecclesiastical denomination. Punctually at 7 o'clock Rev. RUFUS W. CLARK, of Brooklyn, Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements, in his most felicitous manner, introduced the Chairman of the meeting in the person of Rev. Dr. THOMPSON, who, in a few happy remarks, following his induction into office before the footlights, soon made the audience feel at home, and prepared the way, in a measure, for the good things in store for them. But there was a something, which, to a certain extent, seemed to east a gloom over all present, and particularly the speakers if we can believe their own statements, for each one in turn alluded to it, more or less directly. This feeling was produced by the neglect of the committee to supply the refreshments heretofore furnished at the annual meetings of the Society; and flowers for the ladies. Notwithstanding this drawback, all present will have occasion to remember, for a long time, the meeting of last evening. The Chairman introduced the speakers in the following order: Prof. HITCHCOCK, of the Union Theological Seminary; Rev. Mr. FOSS, of the Fleet-street M.E. Church, Brooklyn; WM. ALLEN BUTLER; Rev. J. EELLS, of the Church of the Heights (Dutch Reformed); Rev. Mr. HOLMES, (Congregationalist,) of Jersey City; Rev. Dr. EDDY, Baptist, Boston; and in the absence of HENRY WARD BEECHER, an acceptable substitute was found in the person of the Rev. Dr. STONE, of the Park-street Presbyterian Church, Boston. The speeches were sandwiched with hymns, sung by the whole audience, accompanied by an excellent band of music. Rev.

Our forces came up with them the second time about eight miles from Williamsburgh, where they attempted to make another a bud, but after a brisk skirmish fled. A large additional number of prisoners were captured in this encounter, and a number of deserters had come into our lines, who gave the most deplorable account of the condition of the rebel army, as evidenced be their own condition of physical exhaustion, A later dispatch states that the main portion of the flying rebels had succeeded in crossing the Chickahominy, and had destroyed the bridges in their rear; and that Gen. MCCLELLAN was temporarily resting his victorious troops on the east back. It is stated to have seen the general impression at Yorkstown that Gen. MCCLELLAN had thus got the enemy precisely where he wanted men. Not less than fifty steamers were meantime engaged in transporting troops up the York River to West Point, from which, place they were expected to proceed across the Peninsula, to intercept the rebel retreat. But most important of all is the intelligence telegraphed from Fortress Monroe yesterday, that at 6 o'clock in the morning the iron-clad war-ship [???], accompanied by the gunboats Aroostook and Port Royal, proceeded up James River toward Richmond, to intercept the flight, of the rebels in that direction. They passed the Day's Point Battery without difficulty, and, at last accounts, were far up the river.

The Convention listened to an address from the presiding officer, in which he briefly alluded to the progress made by the Typographical Union, which, not even the hated rebellion of the South had obstructed, and predicted greater success in the future than any enjoyed in the past. The Secretary read his annual report, in which he says that subordinate Unions have been formed and charters approved in several localities in the States, but in consequence of the very depressed state of the trade a moderate progression in this respect is chronicled. He had received no response to the letters sent to the Typographical Societies in the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New-Brunswick, with a view of bringing them under the jurisdiction of the National Union, in accordance with the resolution of the Nashville Convention of 1860. Financially, the Union has not suffered. The receipts were $662 87, and expenditures $598 33, leaving a balance on hand of $74 54. Of the per capita tax received for 1860, $1 75 was paid from Grand Rapids, $27 from Baltimore, $39 from San Francisco, and $8 25 from Cleveland; total, $75. Of the per centage tax, $469 81 was received from 33 subordinate organizations. The report was adopted. The Convention then proceeded to the election of officers for the ensuing year, with the following result: President, John M. Farquher, of Chicago; First Vice-President, W. A. Montgomery, of Boston; Second Vice-President, Jas. H. Walker, of Detroit; Treasurer and Recording Secretary, Thomas J. Walsh, of the New-York TIMES; Corresponding Secretary, Theo. Nagle, of St. Louis. The President announced the following Standing Committees. On Appeals -- Messrs. Briggs, Keech, Cowles, Amsbury, Nagle. On Finance -- Messrs. Herrick, O'Connor, Wallace, Adams, Oakley. On Subordinate Unions -- Messrs. Choate, Squire, D. W. Flynn, Kenneard, Slump. On Unfinished Business -- Messrs. Smith, McDonald, F.M. Flynn. On New Business -- Messrs. Slawson, Browne, Vought, Santee, Gray. On Returns -- Messrs. Gorman, Kelvey, Morris, Bailey, Eaton. Some discussion ensued upon the propriety of retaining the name of George McKay Luken, of Memphis, on the permanent roll, which it was finally decided should be done. An invitation to visit the Public Charities of the City, to-day, at 2 1/2 o'clock P.M., and attend a printers' reception this evening, at the New-York Typographical Rooms, was accepted. The Committee on Unfinished Business reported in favor of diminishing the per capita tax from 15 cents to 10 cents, to apply to all the rolls of Unions. A proposition to establish the principle of paying 7 per cent, on all receipts, gave scope for considerable debate, which resulted in the postponement of the Committee's proposition for consideration to-day.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""National Typographical Union.; SECOND DAY.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/09/archives/the-rebel-army-hemmed-in-important-naval-movement.html,,"The important news which we publish this morning, that the iron-clad man-of-war Ga- lena, and two gunboats, started up the James River early yesterday morning, with the object of cutting off the retreat of the rebel army southward, indicates a speedy and decisive issue to the campaign in Virginia. MCCLELLAN was pushing the rebels forward from point to point with such precipitate haste, that it was feared they might see that their safety depended upon an escape out of Virginia; and that, if they succeeded in effecting this, the campaign might be greatly prolonged, and transferred to a region where operations during the Summer would be exceedingly slow and difficult. It was desired by every one that the rebel army might be brought to bay at once, and compelled to try the issue of arms which it had first invited. -- Unless now it fly to the mountains as best it may, or effect a hocus-pocus retreat from Richmond over the railroad to Danville, and thence march into the Carolinas, it must fight on its present ground, and fight speedily. The gunboats will ascend the James River to Richmond, and probably capture the city, which would be nothing wonderful, since we have heard of the capture of New-Orleans. They can then go to Petersburgh, capture that place, seize the lines of railroad to Norfolk and to Weldon, and thereby completely isolate Norfolk, and control all the connecting lines of railway running South. If the rebel army be still between the Chickahominy and the James Rivers, they will hold it there until Gen. MCCLELLAN, who was on the right bank of the Chickahominy on Wednesday, can cross that stream, and, acting in conjunction with the large National force at New-Kent, on the line of the Richmond and West Point Railroad, can completely hem the rebels in, and compel a capitulation or a field fight. The Editor-in-chief of this journal, in a letter from the Peninsula, published on Wednesday, stated that if the rebel army crossed the Chickahominy, as he believed it would do, ""the only way to prevent its escape was by an advance of our gunboats up the James River."" In this morning's issue we publish the fact that the rebel army has actually crossed the Chickahominy; and it is pleasing also to announce, simultaneously with that fact, that the Navy Department has at last woke up to its duty, and put in operation the only means we had of preventing another rebel retreat.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Army Hemmed In Important Naval Movement.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Army Hemmed In Important Naval Movement.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0e10859-8e76-54be-bc54-50d79cdb4691,744,nyt://article/f0e10859-8e76-54be-bc54-50d79cdb4691,

Arizona runs along the northern line of Mexico for a good distance; it runs almost (and should run quite) to the Gulf of California, and it would be just the point from which to operate upon the rich but disorganized States of Northern Mexico.

"Thursday was a day of excitement at Fortress Monroe.

In former years, and even in the beginning of this war, the columns of our leading journals were crowded with editorials copied from the British Press. An able leader of the London Times on American affairs, a letter from the distinguished ""Special,"" articles from the Daily News or the Post, were scattered, by means of our Metropolitan Press, among millions of readers over the whole country. The London journals could be fairly said to have a nation of readers -- at least when treating of certain topics -- on this side of the Atlantic. Some of these articles were read from admiration of their literary cleverness, some as good specimens of English blundering on foreign topics, and many from a solid respect for the judgment of the nation, whose thoughts and sentiments they were supposed to represent. There was, too, a keen sensitiveness here as to the good opinion of the English people, and a certain want often of solid self-respect, so that we were extremely alive both to their praise and blame. All this had its advantages, as well as its disadvantages. If we showed rather too much youthful sensitiveness to foreign opinion, it was yet a fortunate thing for us that we heard of faults from a cool critic abroad, which we should never have heard from our own admirers at home. Besides, to the many in the Free States, laboring patiently to diminish and restrict a great wrong and abuse, it was a wonderful comfort and support to feel that the old heart of England beat manfully against Slavery, and that, whenever she had the opportunity, she would break over the barriers of national jealousy, and forget the profits of trade, in the noble cause of humanity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Emancipation of the Popular Mind.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Emancipation of the Popular Mind.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a9754ba-bf8d-512d-8c43-5e614e07531a,964,nyt://article/3a9754ba-bf8d-512d-8c43-5e614e07531a,

HOWES, of Boston, was found with his throat cut, in the rear of a lager-bier saloon, near the Coroner's office, in Centre-street. The blood was flowing very freely from the wound at the time he was discovered, and the victim was wholly insensible through lose of blood. Officer LANNIGAN, who happened to be in the vicinity, was immediately summoned, and guarded the house and premises until the arrival of Coroner COLLIN and his Deputy, Dr. ROBINSON. An examination of the wound was made by the latter gentlemen, who pronounced the man to be in a dying condition. Large quantities of blood were found in different parts of the yard, but, after a diligent search, the instrument with which the injury was inflicted could not be found. He was removed to the New-York Hospital, where at a late hour last night he was lying in a state of insensibility, and it was believed that he could not survive till this morning. From all the evidence given thus far there can be no doubt that it is a case of suicide. But little is known about HOWES except the facts that he was a Boston school-teacher; that he had but little money about him, and that for several days past he had been quite low-spirited.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89a4651f-ff2b-51de-b843-9c82f47d45a7,1049,nyt://article/89a4651f-ff2b-51de-b843-9c82f47d45a7,
"-- Gen. FREMONT is making a most excellent disposition of the forces under his command; and recent movements of his several divisions indicate speedy and important work in various sections of the Mountain Department. FREMONT has under him a number of the very best commanders in the field -- such men as the fighting MILROY; the discreet ROSECRANS; KELLY, the hero of Romney; the dashing Cox; the gallant BLENKER; CARTER, the indomitable East Tennesseean; and SCHENCK, every inch a hero Gen. KELLY has been serving along the line of the Grafton and Parkersburgh Railroad, in the Northern part of the State, repressing LETCHER's guerrillas, &c.; and a dispatch, this morning, announces that a detachment of his command has just defeated a rebel force of four hundred men at the town of Spencer. Gens. MILROY and Cox have been for some time on the east side of the Shenandoah Mountains, in Augusta County, driving the rebels from the mountain gaps, and advancing as rapidly as possible toward the railroad at Stanton. His position has been one of extraordinary hardship, the snow being still deep and the weather cold in the mountains, and he having almost daily encounters with detachments of Stone-wall JACKSON's rebels. A brisk affair with the enemy in this quarter also is reported this morning, in which four regiments were engaged, and in which SCHENCK, in one day, made a forced march of thirty-four miles, through mud and over mountains, to join MILROY. These two Generals were waiting for heavy reinforcements, which have probably reached them by this time; and it may easily be judged, from their present position, what is the point and which is the rebel force that is to be assaulted. The splendid German division of Gen. BLENKER is in FREMONT's command, and will doubtless soon be heard from. Gen. Cox has just made an exceedingly important movement up the New River, in the Western part of the State, or in the Kanawha Department, as it is termed. He has driven the rebels out of Greenbrier, Mercer and Giles Counties; and a dispatch from Gen. FREMONT, dated the 8th instant, announces that his advance had ascended the New River Valley as far as Giles Court-house, (now called Parisburgh,) in Giles County, which is only about twenty miles by turnpike from the line of the great East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. It may not be Gen. Cox's purpose to cut this important rebel highway; but as the question of the necessity of cutting it has been discussed for over a year past, and as Cox's column is now nearer to it than any National force has yet been, it would certainly be a capital thing to do. By seizing this railroad a way would be opened up for our troops to penetrate into East Tennessee, and relieve the martyred Unionists of that section. In East Tennessee itself, (which as far as Knoxville is in Gen. FREMONT's Department,) there is a brigade of troops -- loyal East Tennesseeans -- under Gen. CARTER, who are not far from the line of the East Tennessee Railroad, near Knoxville, and who will undoubtedly be prepared to cooperate with Gen. Cox should be move westward in that direction.

Editorial on NYC accommodations for sick and wounded soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/11/archives/sick-and-wounded-soldiers.html,Editorial on NYC accommodations for sick and wounded soldiers,"Large numbersof disabled soldiers are now arriving inthis City from the Peninsula, from North Carolina, and from other places on the Southern seaboard where there have been battles and sieges. We are happy to state that ample quarters and every possible convenience and comfort have been provided for them. The supervision of affairs is in the hands of Gen. HARVEY BROWN, late commander at Fort Pickens, and now commander of the forts in this harbor. These have been special hospitals provided for the New-England troops, while the soldiers from this and other States are accommodated temporarily, or till convalescence, in the Broadway Hospital, in Bellevue, in Park Barracks, at the Ladies' Hospital, and elsewhere. Some of the men are permitted to go to private houses, and hundreds of homes are offered for every sick or wounded soldier who might need one. Dwellings and apartments, owned or occupied by people in all ranks of life, have been thrown open; thousands of ladies have volunteered their services as nurses; profuse quantities of delicacies and comforts are proffered; and the most skillful physicians and surgeons are anxious to furnish their services gratuitously. Some time ago, before any provision had been made, a boat load of sick and wounded heroes arrived here from Newbern; and we called attention to their case, and to the imperfect hospital accommodations then furnished, and made an appeal to the public, and particularly to the ladies, in their behalf. The immediate response to that appeal was extraordinary, though not unexpected; and the work of preparation and beneficence did not end then, but went on, till how beneficence can go no further. Although the Government dues all, perhaps, that is really necessary, there are still some things which official authorities are apt to overlook or neglect, while there are kindnesses that only loving hearts and delicate hands can administer. There will be no lack of these while the war lasts; for New-York City, which has sent fifty thousand of its sons to do battle for the Union and the Star Spangled Banner, has a hundred thousand daughters equally willing to give their lives and their all for the same holy cause. There will be a large number of these wounded heroes arriving now every day. On Friday they came from Newbern; yesterday came some of the wounded at the gallant fight at Williamsburgh, and to-day or to-morrow we may receive the disabled at West Point. The men who marched so erect and proud through our City a year ago, amid the plaudits and shouts of the citizens and the waving of white cambric by fair hands, now come back after having received the baptism of blood, and with the honorable and glorious scars of battle upon their persons. The same fair hands now minister to their wants and sooth their sufferings, and the manly shout gives place to the manly tear of sympathy and act of charity. It is not given to all to die or to bleed for their country; but all may take part in the equally noble work of suffering with those who suffer. There will be much to be done this Summer, and New-York will show how grandly she can do it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SICK AND WOUNDED SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SICK AND WOUNDED SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/946677d7-87d0-5673-971b-ed6ff24e3062,536,nyt://article/946677d7-87d0-5673-971b-ed6ff24e3062,

This contempt had its foundation no doubt, in the views of Labor which prevailed in that region. Having once become general, there naturally sprung from it events whose tendency would be to increase that very contempt and hatred which had given them birth. Among these were prominent the very many instances of ill-usage or Northerners throughout the South, unredressed and unrebuked: the tarrings and featherings, and whippings and bullyings in general, which have so many times stirred the blood of those of us at the North who were not too deeply implicated in Southern trade or too dependent upon Southern politicians. But the effect of them has not been felt solely at the South, especially since the war began. There is many a man in the National army who bears burdens more readily, whose heart is made more bold, his blows more vigorous, his rifle more deadly by the remembrance of some such transaction, in which he was an unwilling participant. We are inclined to think that Gen. MITCHEL's march on Huntsville was not retarded at all by the memories of that railroad ride of his in Missippi a little more than a year ago, when, as our readers must recollect, he barely escaped being lynched as a Northern Abolitionist.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Personal Rights at the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Personal Rights at the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9a1c965a-3e7d-5ffd-bb15-b042a34eaedc,1065,nyt://article/9a1c965a-3e7d-5ffd-bb15-b042a34eaedc,

The sentiments of the prominent men of Virginia, thirty years ago, in behalf of emancipation, are well known and frequently appealed to in our discussions. But we are favored with such a testimony from Tennessee, forty-five years ago, in the shape of an address by the Manumission Society of that State, in behalf of freedom, published in 1817, after two public deliveries of the same before the Society. We find it in ""The Iron Platform,"" a series of political tracts for the people, published by WM. OLAND BOURNE, of this City. This address, for its length, is one of the most interesting, comprehensive and thorough discussions of the system of Slavery we have ever seen, and its powerful appeals for freedom gain new force, in view of the present condition of our political questions and the aspect of the emancipation proposal of President LINCOLN. Mr. BOURNE has presented the address in the handsomest and cheapest form for universal circulation, and the friends of the cause can hardly do a better thing than to place it in the hands of every voter in the Union as soon as possible. The low price of $1 a hundred, or $10 per thousand, should insure it a wide and speedy sale.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Voice from the Past.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Voice from the Past.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f03b7875-a22e-542b-85b2-b0076905d114,657,nyt://article/f03b7875-a22e-542b-85b2-b0076905d114,

On Saturday week the sales of the Public Funds of 1881 at par at the Board of Brokers, was deemed an event so auspicious and gratifying as to induce an exchange of congratulations between the President of the Board and the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury. These Funds, in the darker days of the rebellion in the Summer of 1861, were awarded from the Treasury as low as 85 percent., and fell at one time on the Stock Exchange to 80 per cent., the accumulated interest being thrown out of the account. Another award was subsequently made to the Associated Banks of the three Atlantic Cities at 89.32 per cent, to the extent of fifty million of dollars, and so fearful were some of the Banks that this operation might prove a losing one that they accepted the first offers of the public, through the Stock Exchange, to relieve themselves at cost and interest. It was not until late in April that the market advanced materially above 92 or 93 per cent., and under all these circumstances the unexpected pleasure expressed at the first sales in May at the par value of the Stock is not to be wondered at.

This lady is an American, and is said to be a charming vocalist. If so, she will add another name to the list of our native prime donne, who count up favorably in the number of operatic reputations, at the present moment This appearance will, we presume, close opera for the years 1861-'62.

editorial on encounter of men from South Carolina and New England at battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/12/archives/south-carolina-and-newengland.html,editorial on encounter of men from South Carolina and New England at battle," -- The red-mouthed South Carolina rebels have at last had what they have been so eager for these many years -- an encounter at arms with the men of Massachusetts and of Down-East generally; but it has not left the Palmetto braggarts in any such blaze of glory as they had always foretold for such an occasion. At the battle of Williamsburgh, on the peninsula, last Monday, there were no less than eight regiments of South Carolina troops engaged -- the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth -- some of which are the ""crack"" regiments of the ""Gamecock"" State. They were backed up, too, by eight regiments from Alabama, five from Virginia, and others from Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, the whole force numbering twenty-six regiments; while among the commanders were some of the greatest Palmetto Generals. On the National side there were about as many soldiers from Massachusetts as South Carolina furnished to the rebel side, while there were other regiments from New-Hampshire, from Rhode Island, and from away down in Maine, not to speak of the gallant fellows from Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, Michigan and this State -- the whole of them, however, not forming a force equal in numbers to the rebels engaged with them. Did the South Carolina fire-eaters whip the Yankees ten to one? Did they fight till the last man of them was hacked to pieces? Did they stand their ground till the last rebel was engulphed in the ultimate ditch? Oh I tell it not in Gath nor in the streets of Charleston! whisper it not in the ear of Gen. QUATTLEBAUM, nor let RHETT proclaim it through his Mercury, nor GILMORE SIMMS in his romances! -- when the Yankees gave them cold steel, they skedaddled! And in their flight -- according to the interesting account of the battle we published yesterday -- the rebels threw away their blankets, their knapsacks, and their muskets; and even left the wounded behind to take care of themselves, or be taken care of by our surgeons. All along the wayside, for a long distance, were strewn the evidences of their haste and terror. Where they may have finally hauled up at, it is impossible to tell; but having had a taste of Yankee steel, it need not be wondered at if they do not stop until they get back again to South Carolina. Even there, however, they will find twenty thousand Yankees occupying the richest part of their State, anxious to meet them at any reasonable odds. The South Carolinian has long been wild with anxiety to meet and fight the Yankees. Nowhere now can he go without meeting and fighting them. They are in both the Carolinas, and in all the States of the Gulf. They are present everywhere, and there is no place where they are not. Unless, perhaps, it be in Fort Sumter; and 1862 will not be much older before that too is garrisoned by Yankees.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEW-ENGLAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEW-ENGLAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b89a8388-7c42-5286-8b49-babf70ad0d1e,621,nyt://article/b89a8388-7c42-5286-8b49-babf70ad0d1e,

"The truth is that the comments of a bystander on a contest still raging can never be [???] to the parties engaged in it. He [???] of inclining to one side or other, and it he be overheard to predict the result he will not escape the imputation of wishing to promote it. This is just the position in which we have been placed. We could not abstain from expressing opinions on events passing in America, and our estimate of the chances of the game happened to differ from that formed by one of the players. Time alone can show how far we were right. We were never among those who exulted over the alleged ""breakdown of democratic institutions."" We saw from the first that it was not so much Democracy as the principle of Federalism, under very peculiar conditions, that was on its trial. The strain produced by the antagonism of interests between North and South might undoubtedly have pro red fatal to a despotism or a constitutional monarchy, though it might possibly have been easier to bring back rebellious subjects to their allegiance than to break the spirit of free citizens accustomed to assume the name and exercise the chief attributes of sovereignty. If we fell into any mistake, it was in somewhat underra ing the determination and number of the Secessionists. So long as South Carolina was the only State in open revolt, we were unwilling to give up the belief that the Unionists, said to form a strong in the other Slave States, might bring about a compromise. That hope was disappointed, and from the moment that the Confederate standard was hoisted in every Southern capital, and ""Independence"" became the war-ery of the movement, we felt assured that any reunion worthy of the name was impossible.

He [???] of inclining to one side or other, and it he be overheard to predict the result he will not escape the imputation of wishing to promote it. This is just the position in which we have been placed. We could not abstain from expressing opinions on events passing in America, and our estimate of the chances of the game happened to differ from that formed by one of the players. Time alone can show how far we were right. We were never among those who exulted over the alleged ""breakdown of democratic institutions."" We saw from the first that it was not so much Democracy as the principle of Federalism, under very peculiar conditions, that was on its trial. The strain produced by the antagonism of interests between North and South might undoubtedly have pro red fatal to a despotism or a constitutional monarchy, though it might possibly have been easier to bring back rebellious subjects to their allegiance than to break the spirit of free citizens accustomed to assume the name and exercise the chief attributes of sovereignty. If we fell into any mistake, it was in somewhat underra ing the determination and number of the Secessionists. So long as South Carolina was the only State in open revolt, we were unwilling to give up the belief that the Unionists, said to form a strong in the other Slave States, might bring about a compromise. That hope was disappointed, and from the moment that the Confederate standard was hoisted in every Southern capital, and ""Independence"" became the war-ery of the movement, we felt assured that any reunion worthy of the name was impossible.

We have learned here to regard him as the true type of what the Southerner ought to be, and of what in tale and tradition he is represented to be. Daring, self-reliant, earnest, truthful, gentle, in the right cause eloquent, and against the wrong unsparing; patient and unconquerable in persecution and adversity; the soul of honor, with the heart of a woman -- these are the elements of genuine chivalry, and all these are the possession of BROWNLOW. A loyalty like his, which has braved death, how shall we measure with the standard of GARRET DAVIS, or POWELL, or CRITTENDEN! BROWNLOW sets his country and the Union above all else -- oven above Slavery. Loyalists of the Kentucky school hedge their fidelity about with infinite conditions, and the reservation of numberless selfish interests, enshrined higher than the Union and the Constitution; talking of State rights in language borrowed from the lips of Rebellion.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/15/archives/a-splendid-opening-for-commodore-golds.html,,"BOROUGH. -- In the present situtation of affairs on the Peninusule, infinite interest attaches to the movements of the gunboats and ironclads that are pushing their way up James River toward Richmond. For whether the rebel force between the Chickahominy and the James awaits and gives battle to the army of Gen. McCLELLAN, or makes another, and this time the last, of its masterly retreats, it will depend on the gunboats to cut off its retreat and enable Gen. McClellan to capture the whole force. When last heard from, the gunboats were pushing vigorously ""on to Richmond,"" having silenced two rebel batteries by the way, and three days ago they were within little more than as many hours run of the Capital. Now there are but two or three possible points at which the rebels can retreat southward across the James -- and these are between City Point, opposite Petersburgh, and at Richmond. We take it for granted that our gunboats will destroy the floating means of transport the enemy may have prepared to avail himself of in case of flight. All that will then need to be done will be to either destroy or simply command by our guns the railroad bridge (of the Richmond and Danville Railroad) at Richmond, at the same time that another gunboat makes a detour into the Appomattox and up to Petersburgh, (but a dozen miles from its embouchure into the James,) and doing the same for the bridges there. Since the suicide of the Merrimac has relieved our fleet from police duty, we presume a portion of it, including the Monitor and Naugatuck, has been sent up to reinforce the gunboats that went up last week, and that we now have sufficient naval force to secure, beyond a doubt, the important objects indicated. There is no reason why the whole vast rebel army on the Peninsula should not, in this way, be captured; and the country expects that it will be so. Here is a splendid opening for Commodore GOLDSBOROUGH to carry off the richest laurels of the war. We presume he means to avail himself of it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A SPLENDID OPENING FOR COMMODORE GOLDS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A SPLENDID OPENING FOR COMMODORE GOLDS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dae66000-2398-58ee-ad43-bee352cfdae8,355,nyt://article/dae66000-2398-58ee-ad43-bee352cfdae8,

It is well known that when the legislative enactment took effect, and those dens were closed by the Police, the chief proprietors banded together to test the constitutionality of the law. Able talent was found ready to do the work of Devil's Attorney, and it was not doubted that they would be able to drive a coach-and-four, or at least several pretty waiter girls, through the enactment, and that, after a brief season of eclipse, the concert saloons would shine forth more brilliant and more bawdy than ever. Two or three of the more courageous Broadway proprietors have even ventured to keep their establishments open -- though in a sickly, half-mourning condition. Meanwhile, all their strength and all their hopes were concentrated on the test-cases of Lee and Butler, which have been fully argued before the Recorder.

The Independance found a cheerful echo in the London Herald, the elect vehicle of rebel falsehood in England. The Emperor, this veracious and purely disinterested couple averred, had determined to end the American contest by the offer of mediation, England cooperating; and, this offer declined, to throw the weight of the allied strength in the scale against the recusant combatant. In other words, the fact being assumed that the National Government would repel and resent mediation, while the rebels would grasp it at any price, it was asserted that France and England were about to espouse the cause of the latter, acknowledge their independence, open the blockade, and make war upon the Northern people.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'European Mediation--A Canard of Rare Plumage.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'European Mediation--A Canard of Rare Plumage.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fff254f4-27c2-5246-a953-a1ed743f3146,1148,nyt://article/fff254f4-27c2-5246-a953-a1ed743f3146,

STETSON & Co. informed the meeting, by letter, that they had tendered the hospitalities of the Astor House to the Commodore during his stay in the City. Gen. P.M. WETMORE, during a glowing [???] on the Commodore, suggested a supper as the most appropriate method of meeting and conversing with him. Rev. Dr. OSGOOD thought that a series of junketings was not the most appropriate method of receiving a hero. There ought to be symbolism more than anything else on such occasions; for his own part he thought late suppers demoralizing, and believed that every man should be in his bed after 11 o'clock. FOOTE was one of the old Puritan stock, with a dash of NELSON and CROMWELL in him, and he thought that some testimonial should be offered, in which all citizens could take a part. Rev. Dr. HITCHCOCK, in suggesting a reception at the Academy of Music, and a supper also, hoped that the speech of Parson BROWNLOW, on Thursday evening, would be [???] and circulated among the [???] States, which would leave JEFF. DAVIS' [???] not worth a pin. Prof. LARNED thought that the Commodore's modesty would prevent him accepting any demonstration. He suggested, however, that Capts. BAILEY and BOGGS be included in the demonstration, and Dr. HITCHCOCK wished to add Commodore STRINGHAM to the list, defending that gentleman from the statements made that he came here to get an ovation. That was not true; he had merely obeyed orders. Mr. ELLIOTT SHEPPARD remarked that the receipts at the Academy of Music had amounted to a nice sum for Parson BROWNLOW, but as Commodore FOOTE was not in want of money, he might be induced to accept a demonstration if the proceeds would go to some charitable object. The Chair. at the motion of Gen. WETMORE, agreed with the suggestion that the Commodore should be [???] some public place, where the citizens generally [???] him. He also agreed with the suggestion that the receipts of such demonstration be made available for some charitable purpose. The meeting then adjourned, and the Committee went into session, and appointed Judge Bonney, Mr. Gould, Gen. Wetmore, Prof. Hitchcock and Rev. Dr. Osgood, a Committee to invite Commodore FOOTE to a reception, and learn from him what attentions can be rendered to him, and report to the Committee in what manner the demonstration could be made.

Suffolk has already been occupied by our troops; from there to Weldon (N.C.) is but sixty miles by the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, and from Weldon railroads diverge to Goldsboro, Raleigh, (the capital,) and Greensboro. With these places in our hands, in addition to the coast line and the rivers already held by BURNSIDE, there would be little else needed to restore the Old North State to the Union, but to install the new Military Governor, STANLEY, at the capital. Nearly all the rebel troops that have been raised in North Carolina are now in Virginia; and a rapid movement from Suffolk would forestall any attempt the rebels might make to throw troops into the State from Richmond. The rebels, it is true, boast that they have an immense number of soldiers stationed at various points in North Carolina; and the organ of the rebels in this City yesterday stated that they had thirty thousand men at Edenton -- a very likely place, by the way, for the rebels to station thirty thousand troops, when a couple of our gunboats in Albemarle Sound, could at any moment isolate and capture them. We do not believe that North Carolina contributed thirty thousand men altogether to the service of JEFF. DAVIS. At the various points we have captured in the State -- at Roanoke Island, at Newbern, at Beaufort, &c., we have encountered but small bodies of troops; and a good part of these have been from other rebel States. At the present time especially, the State is very bare of troops, and would undoubtedly be easily enough occupied.

Here indeed the disproof is already perfect. The pillars of the rebellion are crumbling perceptibly as we look at them. The main supports it had to stand upon have already disappeared. New-Orleans and the navigation of the Mississippi; Norfolk and the traffic brought to its doors by the internal improvements of the Border States; the possession of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts; foreign sympathy, to assume in due time a practical shape; the ability of their rams and plated batteries to break the blockade and invade Yankee seaports; all these have come to naught. The manufacturers of Europe have given up all hope of the cotton crop. The pressure of the National armies is such that the chances of protracting resistance and provoking the mediatorial offices of the European Powers, by weariness of a long and apparently interminable war, have wholly disappeared.

HUNTER's order, liberating the slaves in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, will be in harmony with the prudent and conservative course he has heretofore taken on this question of Slavery, whenever it has come up for his practical action, in any form. Gen. HUNTER, in the issuing of the order, acted entirely upon his own responsibility, without authorization by the President, and without consultation with him. The course he took was antagonistic to the line marked out for him by the President, both by precedent and by instructions. It was not given to him, nor to any other General in the field, to decide a question of such momentous and enduring importance. The treatment of Slavery in the rebel States is a political problem, and not a military one; and while a commander may use all legitimate means to deprive the rebels of slaves used for military purposes, just as he may deprive them of warlike implements or stores, he cannot step beyond that and declare Slavery itself at an end. Gen. HUNTER was a subordinate of, and acting with, Gen. FREMONT, when the latter declared the slaves of rebels in Missouri emancipated; and he is acquainted with the action of the President upon that order. The policy of the Government has undergone no change since then, but, on the contrary, has been confirmed and illustrated by numerous examples.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

The continuance of useless strife and fearful loss of life seems to [???] papers, whose views on the subject, one would have supposed, from their general tone, to be more enlightened, preferable to any conciliatory steps taken by the great Western Powers to put an end to the calamities of civil war accros the Atlantic, and at the same time relieve a large portion of their subjects from the distress which this hepless struggle is inflicting upon them. Their great ar-gument is that any foreign interference to restore peace between the North and South isan encouragement to Slavery -- argument which is the more curious from the fact of the ""peculiar Institution"" having survived in the French Colonies until 1848. It is not doubted here that M. MERCIER's journey to Richmond is strictly political, and has direct reference to the war, and it is far from impossible that it may lead to the recognition of the Southern States as a separate nation. I subjoin some remarks on the subject from the new number of the Revue des Deux Mondes, published this day; you will observe that the Revue adopts as beyond question all the news given from a Federal source, although its correctness has been disproved by later intelligence.

Upon it no victories figure. The Union arms made no advance, by sea or land, tributary to the great result of the contest. In the Southwest Gen. HALLECK continued to press in cautiously but closely upon the lines of BEAUREGARD, apparently rating the strength, position and resources of the adversary at their full value, and resolute to afford him no other advantage than that of his elaborate works. In regard to relative numbers of the combatants at Corinth, accounts continue to disagree with more than ordinary pertinacity. On the one hand the superiority is assigned to the rebels, and the dreariest apprehensions are suggested as to the event of a struggle wherein the former is not only admirably posted and defended, and commanded by his ablest Generals, but has the odds of strength in his favor. At Corinth, also, the last ditch of the Southwestern rebels has been located, in order that we may be taught to anticipate there a vigor and tenacity of resistance not herefore encountered. The truth, however, appears to be that HALLECK has a force by one-third greater than BEAUREGARD, and of this greater number the main body have seen active service, stood fire gallantly, and have the utmost confidence in their ability to whip the rebels one to five. Of BEAUREGARD's force the majority are of new levies. When SIDNEY JOHNSTON's command reached the line of the Memphis and Charleston Road, after its retreat from Bowling Green, it is known to have dwindled away to a mere handful. It simply served as the nucleus of an army, alarmingly unsound at the core. BRAGG has reinforced it with ten thousand men from Pensacola. LOVELL is there with the detachment which deserted New-Orleans without striking a blow: the fugitives FLOYD extricated from Fort Donelson and the relies of Pea Ridge are also there. The rest is the ragtag and bobtail of the Southern mob driven into the ranks at the point of the bayonet, and eager for any calamity which shall release them and send them homeward. As to the morale, as of the numerical strength of such an army, we may fairly entertain doubts. No tropical people exhibits the fortitude and persistence under reverse, which stimulate to new efforts, and more desperate exhibitions of courage and daring. There is none of that real elasticity under disaster, which adds ferocity to each fresh encounter. The Southern army has no motive to new endeavors. Nothing but [???] and [???] fill the diary of the last three months, the few incidents of a contrary character being too insignificant to produce any [???] confidence. The misconceptions [???] at Bull Run have been cured effectually. Panic no longer fights on the side of the rebels, who, from the first, have counted more confidently upon panic than upon more [???] agencies -- panic in the cotton market, panic among European manufacturers upon the loss of Southern custom, panic among Yankee soldiery, wherever it should encounter the half-horse, half-alligator braves of the Southwest. Wiser and sadder men, they come to each new conflict with less arrogance and resolution; and of desperation they have little, for the reason that as much is to be hoped, among rank and file, from National as from rebel success. There is nothing either in the force or the spirit of the rebels to excite the fears of Gen. HALLECK. It is only their position which requires his extreme circumspection.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Business of the Week.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Business of the Week.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c46cf03-8bc9-5e2e-a933-a3160fcf07c7,948,nyt://article/4c46cf03-8bc9-5e2e-a933-a3160fcf07c7,

HUSTED & SON, made famous a few years ago by the exposures in LESLIE's illustrated Newspaper and the investigations which followed these exposures. The distillery is located on the block bounded by Flushing, Park and Franklin avenues and Ryerson-street. The fire was first discovered in some hay for horses that had been stored in the loft of one of the buildings, and before the progress of the fire could be stayed the stables occupied by ALBERT FREEMAN, PETER CLARK and GEORGE MESHENDORF, capable of accommodating (in the [???] cows are usually packed in swill-milk stables) about two hundred cows, were destroyed. The manufacturers of the swill in these establishments own the stables and let them out to other parties, who manufacture the milk. When the alarm was given, there was great consternation among the employes of the place, for they experienced the almost difficulty in getting the live stock beyond reach of the fire. Many of the cows were in such a weak condition that they were thrown down and trampled upon by the more recent additions to the stock, and several will have to be braced up before they can undergo the process of milking again. The miserable condition of the cows generally, thus summarily turned into the street for public inspection, excited the commisseration of all classes of citizens -- always excepting the ""milkmaids."" engaged about the distillery, who affected to consider the cows of the best kind, and were disposed to deny the right of any one to express a contrary opinion. One cow in particular, owing to her deformed feet, being unable to stand, attracted considerable attention, and yet the lookers-on were assured that she gave the best milk of any animal in the whole country. There were all kinds of apologies for cows in the lot, turned loose -- long tails, short tails, stub tails, and some with no tails at all. Their appendages were in every conceivable condition, from a sound stump down to stumps in every degree of decomposition -- some in rags and others without. It was a most pitiable and disgusting spectacle. Messrs. HEUSTED & SON estimate their loss at $1,000. The occupants of the cow stables refused to make any estimate of their loss, but it could not have been very heavy, except what may result from the incontinental exposure of their animals.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Fire in the Swill-Milk Stables.

It is not so easy to apply the same process to announcements of defeats, for the very reason that official dispatches are generally too good rather than too bad, and there is no end to the suspense, anxiety and torture to which the public may be put by a stupid employe of the War Department.

"Our knowledge of iron-clad vessels is really yet so limited that every lesson is valuable, even though purchased at the cost of vexatious or disastrous experiences. The action at Fort Darling, on the James River, will doubtless, when we receive the full details, furnish some important contributions, and already it has brought out one fact very sharply.

The Galena, however, was, we learn, severely damaged in her deck and upper works by the shot of the; rebel batteries, -- Fort Darling being situated upon a bluff two hundred feet above the river, high enough to direct a plunging fire upon attacking boats, which could not use their guns in response. Now the so-called ""bomb-proof"" deck of the Galena is but half an inch (possibly five-eighths) in thickness; of course, altogether too thin to withstand the impact of heavy rifled shot. While she was in process of construction we repeatedly urged in these columns the imperative necessity of adding to the thickness of metal both of her bows and deck. The admonition was heeded with respect to the former -- the half-inch plating being stripped off, and two and a half inch bars substituted, making her bows of equal thickness with her sides. But it was not heeded with respect of the deck, and she was put in service in a condition certain to result just as it has resulted.

The defence set up was, that Nash's interest in the suit against the Company was derived from an assignment from Ritter, and that subsequently he ascertained that Ritter had made an assignment previously to a Mr. Haugh, who had made an assignment to Ritter's wife, and that he (Nash) prosecuted the suit for the benefit of Mrs. Ritter.

"DAVIS was going to abandon Richmond.

He replied that he had never entertained a thought of withdrawing from Virginia; but, said he, ""if in the course of events, the capital should fall,"" etc., etc., ""the war could still be successfully waged on Virginia soil for twenty years."" This is a remarkable change from the assured and defiant notes heretofore given forth from Richmond. JEFF. DAVIS admits the possibility of its evacuation -- as well he may, since the National army has pushed his whole army from Yorktown up to within ten or fifteen miles of the city, and the Monitor is within eight miles of it. But the fall of Richmond does not imply the abandonment of Virginia. It would not do, of course, to admit such a thing at present, when Virginia troops are one of the mainstays of the rebel army. Whether it does or not, however, depends greatly upon the ""course of events,"" of which the rebel chief appears not to have much control at present. It is a preposterous falsehood, worthy only of JEFF. DAVIS, that his army could maintain a contest twenty years after the fall of Richmond, or even twenty weeks.

He cannot, of course, flee northward; he cannot flee to the mountains, for it would be impossible to subsist his army there; he cannot attempt to hold Petersburgh or Lynchburgh, while Suffolk is in our hands, and Weldon soon will be. If he thinks to escape from Richmond with his army, and carry on a war for twenty years between Petersburgh and the North Carolina line, he must be as great a fool as he has proved himself a traitor.

The order of services was as follows: Music by the band; prayer; anthem by the choir; address by Rev. C.J.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/22/archives/a-modest-quencher-for-intervention.html,,"It is an essential ingredient of panic that it should be groundless. The excitement about French intervention displays this characteristic in a marked degree, so distinctly, indeed, that it is a wonder that what we are accustomed to call cool-headed people have yielded so unreservedly to the outcry. Never, indeed, was a statement founded upon a narrower basis, or accepted from less credible witnesses. The foundation was the simple fact that M. MERCIER, the French Minister, paid a visit to Richmond; the witnesses to the malign purpose of his errand, were certain covert sympathizers with the cause of treason in this country, and the open advocates of that cause in Europe. Abstract from the business the fact of the visit, or the interpretation arbitrarily affixed to it by the devil's advocates, and there is clearly no more reason to believe in the story of French intervention now than there was three months ago. There is, it is needless to say, the profoundest suffering among the laboring classes of Europe. In France the looms are at rest, and the shops deserted, while the work-people live meagrely at the cost of the Government. In England whole communities, deprived of business, are dependent upon charity; while in both England and France, the manufacturing capitalists are frightfully near bankruptcy. But whatever of this was not true four months since, was foreseen a year ago by the Governments concerned, who believed to the contrary of what was believed here, that the war was to be exceedingly protracted, and that all thought of dependence upon American supply and demand might be at once and for a long time abandoned. No new element has figured in the business to strengthen this established and current European conviction. The only fresh element is the fact of the rapid progress and uniform success of the American arms; the certainty that the rebels are in their supreme struggle; and the strong probability of the war, contrary to all transatlantic preestimates, will terminate with the Summer. And these additional bits of evidence are not of a kind to encourage a departure from that patient attitude of neutrality which the prophets of evil rashly predict.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Modest Quencher for Intervention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Modest Quencher for Intervention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f160bf93-ec88-5021-bace-9eb8d323ae3d,690,nyt://article/f160bf93-ec88-5021-bace-9eb8d323ae3d,

Mr. W.T. PALFREY, who is spoken of as one of the oldest inhabitants of Louisiana, writes to the Planter's Banner on this subject, -- reminding them that hitherto the South has been largely supplied with corn from the West, and that not only is this now cut off, but that the Union armies have possession also of large portions of the corn-growing Southern States. The planters, as a general thing, he thinks, have been very neglectful in not providing for this contingency. Instead of devoting their lands to corn, they go on planting cane as usual, ""although at the outset they were in favor of the most ultra measures."" Even those with whom he has personally remonstrated, Mr. P. says, only profess their willingness to raise as much corn as will supply their own wants. He thinks they ought to consider, and provide for the wants of the Southern States in general, for ""a week's lack of food would disband the whole Southern army."" Is it not barely possible that these same planters foresee the end of the rebellion, and the time when their sugar crop will again be in demand?",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SUPPLY OF FOOD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SUPPLY OF FOOD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/117ae36d-0cfe-5a4b-87d7-45e06960ae39,224,nyt://article/117ae36d-0cfe-5a4b-87d7-45e06960ae39,

The Principal of the school, Mr. JOHN G. MCNARY, after consultation with the Trustees, decided to make an appeal for contributions through the children of his school, who number about 2,200. The appeal was made a week ago by himself, and the female principals, Miss ADELAIDE HAWLEY and Miss EMILY KENNEDY, who simply told the children the nature and object of the contributions desired, and instructed them not to urge the matter upon their parents in any way in case objections were made. The result of this simple and quiet appeal has been that five cartloads of goods, comprising every variety of articles needed for the suffering soldiers, have already been brought in by the children and their parents, and sent off to the Sanitary Commission, to the Home for wounded soldiers in Fifty-fourth-street, to the Park Barracks, to the City Hospital, and to other places where they were needed. The contributions of the first four days after the appeal was made comprised 239 bottles of brandies, wines, &.; 58 bottles of cologne, bay rum and liniments; 753 packages of farina, corn starch and the like; 40 packages of tea, cocoa and sugar; 40 boxes of lint, bandages, old linen, &c.; 240 jars of jelly and preserves; 145 dozen oranges; 51 dozen lemons; 704 shirts; 153 pairs of drawers; 917 other articles of wearing apparel; 155 sheets and quilts, and 223 articles of sundry kinds.

It is agreed On all hands that Mr. STANLY is the very best man that could have been selected to fill this delicate and responsible mission. Not less than in the case of Gov. JOHNSON do all the qualities conspire to make Mr. STANLY the fit guide of his native State out of the slough of secession. Born in the Old North State (the house in Newbern occupied by Gen. BURNSIDE as headquarters is that in which Gov. STANLY was born, and his distinguished father died,) he has that instinctive, sympathetic apprehension of the feelings, traditions, principles and prejudices of the people, which is the first condition of successfully dealing with a community in a period of revolution. Having formerly represented North Carolina in the National Legislature, and exercised high legal functions in the State, he is, of course, most intimately acquainted with the Constitution and practical working of the State Government, and will do the least possible violence to the habits and views of that conservative people. Finally, while his instincts and interests will be a guaranty of his sympathy and sincere friendship for the people, he is a man whose popularity and demeanor will conciliate, while his steady patriotism will insure his faithful administration. How Gov. STANLY understands his mission may be inferred from the following words, contained in a farewell letter to his friends in California, written on the eve of his departure for the East to assume his duties:",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7db3bb65-aa84-5828-8a8b-bfb7b88f876b,484,nyt://article/7db3bb65-aa84-5828-8a8b-bfb7b88f876b,

editorial on naval operations on Mississippi,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/23/archives/naval-operations-on-the-mississippi.html,editorial on naval operations on Mississippi,"-- We have been for a long time in great darkness as to what our fleet really was doing in the Mississippi above New-Orleans. Shortly after the capture of the latter city, we a learned from a rebels that some of our vessels had appeared before and had taken Baton Rouge; then that they were at Tunica Bend; then at Fort Adams; then at Natchez; and now we learn from the same source that that they had appeared before Vicksburgh, meeting nowhere with successful resistance. As all the points successively named are in regular order in the progress up the river, and as the rebels would not be likely to chronicle our successes, if it could be avoided, or if the facts could be misrepresented, it is more than likely that our fleet has actually captured or reduced every town or fortification on the river up to Vicksburgh which is four hundred miles above New-Orleans; and this view is confirmed by the telegram published yesterday from Washington, which announced that part of our fleet had gone up ""as far as Vicksburgh, for a purpose which it would be improper to state."" It is earnestly to be hoped that Gen. BUTLER did not let this improper purpose out of the bag when he stated in his official report of the capture of New-Orleans, that the fleet was going ""to pass up the river as far as the mouth of the Red River, so as to cut off their supplies, and make a landing and a demonstration in their rear, as a diversion in favor of Gen. BUELL.""

It sustains the War, but qualifies its support by the most damaging drawbacks. The general drift of its comments is that there is only one way of preserving the Union, and that is by abolishing Slavery; and everything done by the Government which falls short of this, or proceeds upon a different basis, is condemned either directly or by necessary implication. In yesterday's issue alone, there are half a dozen instances of this. Thus in a leading editorial, the Tribune says that ""if this Union should be destroyed, history will write on its tomb-stone, -- Died miserably of official deference and democratic subserviency to traitorous Slavery."" Its Washington correspondence gives expression to grave doubts ""whether the several States will promptly furnish their respective quotas of men under the forthcoming call of the President,"" unless in effect it shall first be decided that negroes may be enlisted. ""Some say,"" writes this correspondent, ""that their citizens will demand an Anti-Slavery policy before they will fill up the regiments.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The People and the President.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The People and the President.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c91a3a57-c62f-55f4-8679-786fd3bf08c1,951,nyt://article/c91a3a57-c62f-55f4-8679-786fd3bf08c1,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/24/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"A statement from the War Department is to the effect that no dispatches have been received from the vicinity of Richmond since Thursday, up to which time no engagement had taken place. More definite intelligence is contained in a dispatch to the Baltimore American from Fortress Monroe reproduced in our columns. The First Grand Division of the army had already commenced crossing Bottom's Bridge, and the Second Division was crossing the Chickahominy at New-Bridge -- the advance being already within five miles of Richmond, to which point the entire rebel army appears to have fallen back, with very little effort to check our onward movement. There was a rumor that a proposition for an armistice of ten days had been made by the rebels. There is probably no more foundation for this rumor than there was for a similar one relative to the rebels at Corinth. At any rate, such a proposition could not for a moment be entertained. There appears to be no doubt that the condition of the rebels at Richmond is becoming more and more desperate. The scarcity of provisions is represented by refugees to be very great, even the rebel soldiers being on half rations. Notwithstanding the fact that JEFF. DAVIS and the military authorities declared their intention to fight to the last in defence of the city, it was strongly suspected that it would be abandoned after a show of fight over the defences surrounding it, -- in which case fears were entertained that the soldiers from the Gulf States would fire the city, threats to that effect having been freely uttered. It is asserted that BEAUREGARD arrived at Richmond on Tuesday last; but it is doubtful if even he can make anything out of the partially armed mob of which the rebel army now seems to be composed. Its numbers are estimated at about 200,000, including the recent levies under the conscription law, which is still being rigorously enforced.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56dbea6e-03c1-5fde-87bf-28de1e598ee1,708,nyt://article/56dbea6e-03c1-5fde-87bf-28de1e598ee1,

The Commission is now working in perfect harmony with the regular medical authorities of the army; and it not only relieves these authorities of a large part of their overwhelming labors, but performs duties toward the sick and wounded soldiers which would otherwise be neglected. The work which it did for a long time in the camp is now changed to, or rather has added to it, work in the field. Since active operations began before Yorktown, these labors have been immense. The disabled at the different battles, those sick from exposure, from the malaria of the peninsula, and other causes, have been put almost entirely in its charge. The very excellent plan has now been adopted of removing all patients as soon as possible from the insalubrious vicinity of the battle-fields, and taking them where their wants can be better ministered to, and where the climate will be more agreeable to their enfeebled constitutions. Within the last fortnight, two thousand patients have arrived in this City alone from the military hospitals at Yorktown and Newbern, nearly all of them on board the hospital transports of the Sanitary Commission, and under its care. In a single day of the present month, twenty-five hundred patients, it is reported, were made over to the Commission by the military authorities, and by it were provided for. This involved an amount of labor which it would require actual observation to properly estimate or to appreciate.

Many of the States have already expressed their readiness to immediately put their quota on foot, and to-day an order will be issued from the Adjutant-General's Department for additional volunteers from the State of New-York. The order of the War Department, a couple of months ago, commanding that recruiting should cease, was received with disappointment; the present opening, accordingly, will be gladly embraced, and there is no doubt that in a week the full number will be under marching orders. An official telegram from Washington volunteers the information that the present recruiting is simply for the purpose of filling up regiments in the field, and organizing a small reserve. But there was no need of the explanation. Not a whisper of reluctance is heard, nor is there any holding back that the purpose of the Government in the conduct of the war may be criticised or questioned. The people have confidence that the programme these troops will aid in carrying out is a legitimate and a worthy one; and the President may depend on it that all the force needed shall be forthcoming.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR TROOPS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR TROOPS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af07ebda-03d7-50af-a1fb-97fd0f646b6f,209,nyt://article/af07ebda-03d7-50af-a1fb-97fd0f646b6f,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/24/archives/slavehunting-at-washington-a-remedy.html,,"In the early days of Abolition the evangelists of that ilk were used to achieve pathetic pictorial effects by delineating a leash of some dozen negroes, old and young, driven along in their bonds by the lash of a truculent overseer, while in the background stood the National Capitol, with the flag flying from the dome. The author of this telling antithesis would be unequal to realize the spectacle presented to-day in the District of Columbia. Slavery has just been abolished by an act, the intention of which met the cordial approval of the loyal people of the country. No longer was the seat of National Government to be the theatre of systematized outrage upon the rights of a race. The Slave-trade was brushed away long ago; Slavery had followed. So far as the National Government was concerned, the vexed and vexations question had been laid to rest. And what, now proves to be the fact? The District, so far from being freed from the horrors of Slavery, has now become exhibition grounds of their most repulsive forms. The streets of the City, and the shaded walks about the capitol, ring with the clamor of slave hunts. The negroes in Maryland have heard that slaves in the District are free. They see the serfs of the other day reveling in all the delight and dignity of self-ownership. They note the negroes of Virginia pouring over the Potomac, and unmolested urging their quest of a millennial North. They, too, seek freedom in the District. Their masters pursue them. The Marshal of the District, one LAMON, eagerly anticipates all legal doubts and decisions, by lending the civil energies of National authority to the chase. The negroes are caught, and then steps in another claimant. The Military Governor of Washington has explicit orders to look after the blacks. None of them is to go back, unless to a master of undoubted loyalty; and the schemes of the professional kidnapper have to be baulked. Here is apparently a quite sufficient conflict of powers. But this is not all. The people, impatient at the tardiness of their servants, now and then take a hand in person -- as the other day, when a regiment of Union-saving soldiers, passing through the Capital, resolved itself into a mob for the rescue of a hapless runaway from his hunters. Conflicts between the myrmidons of LAMON and the troopers of Gen. WADSWORTH are of daily occurrence, but are insignificant beside this wild outbreak of an indignant soldiery.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Slave-Hunting at Washington A Remedy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Slave-Hunting at Washington A Remedy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da718ca1-b7ad-56a1-a2f4-07e59a50e441,718,nyt://article/da718ca1-b7ad-56a1-a2f4-07e59a50e441,

editorial on Front Royal defeat,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/25/archives/the-repulse-at-front-royal.html,editorial on Front Royal defeat,"-- The movements of Gen. BANKS' corps d'armce, and of detachments of it, have been rather remarkable of late. When, about three months ago, he crossed the Potomac, and marched up the Valley of the Shenandoah, the rapidity of his movements was admirable, and his success everywhere complete. He drove the ""Stonewall"" rebels before him from point to point, defeated them at Winchester, and also in numerous cavalry skirmishes, pursued them to and from Strasburgh, from Woodstock, beyond the line of the Valley Railroad, as far as Harrisonburgh, and, it was believed, to Stanton, till finally it was announced that the Shenandoah Valley was entirely cleared of the rebels, who had held it for a full year. It was given out that his splendid march and pursuit of the rebels, was to terminate in his seizure of the railroad at Staunton, and from thence he would cross the Blue Ridge and operate somewhere in the rear or on the flank of the Richmond rebel army. Suddenly, however, the corps d'armee of Gen. BANKS was wheeled about, marched back to the railroad, (the Stone-wall Jackson rebels apparently following -- they say pursuing -- our troops,) and from thence to Strasburgh, where the railroad from Manassas Junction intersects the line running up the Shenandoah Valley. After he had made this retrograde movement, our forces in the mountains of Highland County, under MILROY and SCHENCK, who had been expecting support and cooperation from Gen. BANKS, were left isolated and were at, once attacked near the town of Macdowell by the rebels, and after a hard-fought battle and a heavy loss, had to fall back to Franklin, in Pendleton County. There they were opportunely met by reinforcements under Gen. FREMONT, and the rebels were in turn driven back. After halting for a time at Strasburgh, Gen. BANKS began to move his forces, in detachments, eastward over the Manassas Gap railroad, to join, it was said, the corps d'armee of Gen. MCDOWELL. Gen. SHIELDS' Division was moved first, and has probably by this time reached Fredericksburgh. Subsequently other columns were sent in the same direction; and it was while moving over this road that the detachment under Col. KENLY were surprised and repulsed by the rebels at Front Royal, some ten miles east of Strasburgh, after having suffered, according to Gen. BANKS' official report, ""considerable loss in killed and wounded and prisoners."" The rebels hold Front Royal, breaking BANKS' communication with Manassas Junction, and will probably, by burning bridges and tearing up the track, altogether destroy the connection, and prevent the union of the two corps d'armee, which was needed for their efficient action. This mishap is an unfortunate one at the present moment. If Gen. BANKS was going to move his whole force, piecemeal, over the railroad, he should certainly have held the lines open at all hazards, and with the large force under his command was abundantly competent to do so. It will be quite easy for him to move forward with his whole force and drive the rebels from Front Royal, but unless he also capture or totally destroy them, they will, with the facility of movement which has characterized rebel operations in that vicinity, return again to the Shenandoah Valley, and there resume their sway and their ravages.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REPULSE AT FRONT ROYAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REPULSE AT FRONT ROYAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/223ca7c9-b879-5f5a-a09c-426c1b7dd468,672,nyt://article/223ca7c9-b879-5f5a-a09c-426c1b7dd468,

At least, if we do not know these facts, it is our own fault. Have we not been told them often enough, and by those who ought to know best, namely, by these very superior whites who have borne this burden so long. Of course, we would not presume to doubt the general truth of their statements, but now and then there will cases arise which show either that there is some flaw in the case which they make, or that some one has neglected his individual duty toward has own darkeys, and has failed to keep them from some degree of idleness, of which Satan aforesaid was not slow to take advantage. Here, for instance, is ROBERT SMALL, pilot of the Planter, who, with his companions, ran that steamer out from Charleston, under the guns of Fort Sumter.

All the measures adopted to prevent contraband traffic have failed. The ship blockade and the stone blockade are alike ineffective. The rebel craft run through the one and over the other, bearing cotton out, and arms, powder and supplies in, apparently with safety and comfort. Steamers, schooners, barks, brigs, and ships of every size and shape, daily crowd the waters of Charleston Bay, paying no attention whatever to President LINCOLN's prohibitory proclamation, nor to Secretary WELLES' polite and easy cruisers. Our Nassau (N.P.) correspondent sends us a list of twenty-one vessels which have run from that port mostly to and from Charleston, from the 1st to the 18th inst. During these thirteen days there were thirteen vessels (one for each day) arrived from Charleston Iaden with cotton, and eight left Nassau, nominally for other ports, but really for a rebel market, as the nature of their car-goes will show. All this brisk commercial intercourse was between Charleston and one West India shipping port -- which, though the most convenient and most irequented, is not the only port which enjoys the benefit of the flourishing commerce of South Carolina.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN COMMERCE OF CHARLESTON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN COMMERCE OF CHARLESTON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c615620-a888-5287-844c-ced5a0603d20,542,nyt://article/1c615620-a888-5287-844c-ced5a0603d20,

There are no rebels there; the Indians are no more cantankerous than usual; and BRIGHAM YOUNG and all the Mormons swear their unflinching fealty to the National Government. There is, we know, a little cloud of mischief in the fact that the followers of the Prophet have established for themselves a State Government without authority from Congress, and without having gone through the ordinary formalities. But that is a matter very easily settled by legislation -- easily settled, perhaps, with the consent and cooperation of the Mormons; but if not, easy to be peacefully settled without their cooperation. The Mormons desire a State Government, and have organized one; but so have other Territories organized State Governments, which were subsequently squelched by Congress. If they do not peaceably assent to this, the Territory of Utah can be very conveniently cut up, and divided between the adjacent Gentile Territories, when the political power of the Mormons with be completely annihilated, and their united action be rendered impossible. This has nothing to do with the question of altering the boundaries of States or destroying State Governments. The boundaries of Territories are altered by Congress every year. It is much more likely that these Gentile soldiers from California will create difficulties in Utah than that they will ever settle them. If the troops are designed to operate against the fragments of dying savages west of the Rocky Mountains, we are likely to have an Indian was on our hands this Summer, which, though barren enough of value, will be fertile enough of expenses.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/26/archives/the-magazines.html,,"One sad reflection mingles with the whirl and excitement of our modern life -- the old-time depth and heartiness which gave color and tone to existence seems to be, day by day, departing. Old customs, quaint legends, odd usages connecting the acts of each time and season of our existence with homestead, family memories of the past, and thereby giving richness and depth to the sensations of the present, seem, among us, to be dying out. Everything is sheer and new; fresh cut edges, blank upright outlines brilliant fresh plastering, and paint yet odorous of the raw material, have greatly replaced the rounded shapes, the mellow tints, the ""dim religious light"" of the mansions, and the fanes of other days. We seem to live in a daytime that has no yesterday and no to-morrow. The German idea of ""Das Jetzt,"" -- the Now -- is fully realized as all in all; the whistle of the locomotive and the rattle of the car pervade all solitudes even to the cot of the recluse, and the cloister of the priest, and the newsboy sells his Sunday extra at the Cathedral door, shrilly mingling the announcement of battles won and cities captured with the chaunt of the ""Miserere,"" or the wail of the ""Dies Irae."" Yet, the human heart is so constituted that it tires at length of all this glare and freshness, this ""spektakel"" or hurly-burly of progress, in certain moments. It longs for the Past; for old associations; for the simulacra of the hours and friends departed. Manhood turns often wearily from its mad struggle of ambition to weep in dreams of childhood near the father's hearthstone, beside the mother's knee. NAPOLEON, Emperor and arbiter of Europe, melted to tears in the village garden beneath the fruit-tree that had been the sole witness of his boyish vows to beauty perished. Thus do even nations go back from the stifling pressure of existing trials and pursuits to the contemplation of its earlier and quainter history. This sentiment, much hidden in our brand-new Republic, is yet felt by vast classes of our people, and, from time to time, some one among us desperately strives to give it utterance. WASHINGTON IRVING was the creature of this taste, and we all love him best among the old Knickerbockers of colonial legend, or in the quaint and drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow. Others in different paths have endeavored to invest our scenery and social life with ripe associations. COOPER has done much, and HAWTHORNE and LONGFELLOW, too, have dipped their pens in Autumn dew, Revolutionary diaries, memoirs of early settlers, and what not, have been added to the shelves, but still we have felt the newness of our history to be an almost hopeless obstacle. Nothing is left for us, in this respect, but the common fund of antique usages, sayings, personages, deeds and things that belong to all who are of the same race and Christian faith. Here it is, precisely, that our new friend, the Book of Days, steps in, a literary Rip Van Winkle, but wide-awake and all in fresh attire. We welcome him thus fully, because we hail with real pleasure the prospect of good influences opened by the publication to the entire public. HONE's Day-Book and Year-Book were of a similar cast, and what scholar's library, in their time, lacked their presence? But CHAMBERS, with his well-known thoroughness and comprehensiveness, covers a range of thought and information far wider than the sphere of both these famous repertories. This is just what thousands of us have been waiting for and wishing that some one, with the material at hand, would give. Here it is, at last -- a gathering of ""old fireside ideas in general,"" and ""a means of improving the fireside wisdom of the present day"" -- a book of Festivals and Saints' days, of Seasons and their Phenomena, of Folk Lore, of Notable Events, Biographies and Anecdotes for every setting of the Sun, of Popular Archaeology, of Curious Fugitive and Inedited Pieces -- in fine, an ""Old Curiosity Shop"" of everything quaint and queer, antique and racy under the firmament. Beautifully printed by LIPPINCOTT, it is copiously illustrated with real merit, and commends itself monthly to the million for a price less than that of any other periodical in any walk approaching its own. Parts I, and II, are already issued. The yearly volume will be an elegant ornament, as well as a most useful and entertaining companion.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a856e1b-ab6c-5039-909d-378f3f9ca6da,789,nyt://article/3a856e1b-ab6c-5039-909d-378f3f9ca6da,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/26/archives/amusements.html,,"For so late a period in the season the past week has been unusually plentiful in musical entertainments. The Boughton Family Opera at the Academy of Music, which we spoke of upon Friday last, was, as we understand, repeated upon Saturday in Brooklyn. On Thursday evening a grand concert was given at Irving Hall, by the New-York Catholic Library Association. We allude to it for the purpose of remarking that Mrs. MOZART sung charmingly, while we have to compliment Mrs. GEARY upon the progress she has made as a concert singer, and which entitles her to warm and favorable mention whenever she appears in public. The Miss GELLIES, who are well and most agreeably known among our resident vocalists, also announced a concert at Niblo's Saloon for the same evening. They were supported by Signor ARDAVANI and Messrs. WERNER and SCHREIBER, as instrumentalists. However, the next sensation to the Boughton Family Opera, although critically far pleasanter, was the matinee at Niblo's Saloon, on Saturday, given by the Associated Artists. This drew a large audience, and was, we believe, the first appearance in public of Signor BRIGNOLI in the part of a manager. As we have previously spoken of Miss KELLOGG, with himself and SUSINI, in La Figlia del Reggimento, it will be unnecessary to repeat our criticism, it we mention that Signor SUSINI was it better voice than usual, and state that the opera was gracefully and ungraciously sandwiched into small slices, amongst which GOTTSCHALK was ingeniously dove-tailed. He played an etude and valse by CHOPIN it is rare to find the exquisite musical fancies of that delightful genius rendered by a living pianist. His fantasia on the Ballo in Maschera was subsequently given by him for the first time. It is as sparkling and as winning as his other fantasias, and was received with undivided delight by his hearers.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3af0d5e8-5119-5eab-8133-8aad0b783cca,1650,nyt://article/3af0d5e8-5119-5eab-8133-8aad0b783cca,

"Baltimore has always been a faithful barometer of the ups and downs of the rebel cause. Though the essential loyalty of the city has been long ago well assured, there has always been a large Secessionist element -- mainly women, snobs and rowdies -- ready at every rebel success to show its ""sympathy"" with rebellion. Of late such opportunities have been very rare, indeed, and these sympathizers have found it prudent to lie perdu. But the repulse of BANKS has given a sudden and extraordinary fillip to their hopes. Wild visions of a Northward-marching Confederate army, that shall seize Washington by a sudden coup, and realize the darling and oft-promised policy of carrying the war into Northern soil, float before their minds. The intoxication of this unwonted success appears to have stimulated them to a bolder and more open demonstration than they have long dared to make, and their insolent and indecent exultation produced yesterday a counter-action of loyal indignation, in which several of these blatant traitors received bloody noses, knock-downs, and other rough though not fatal responses. We prefer that Southern society shall have the monopoly of such manifestations; but certainly, if ever the toleration and long suffering of men were tried, it was in the case of those loyal Baltimoreans whose friends and relatives composed the regiment which is reported to have suffered the most severely in the rumored repulse, and who were compelled to listen to the malignant exultation of the rebel sympathizers over the slaughter of those they love. This is a situation to try men's patience, and it is easy to understand, without commending, the spirit that led to the violences that are reported. Happily it was but a momentary effervescence, and order again reigns in Baltimore. What is chiefly noteworthy in the affair is the evidence it affords of the strength of the Union sentiment in that city, whose streets were a year ago reddened with the blood of Union soldiers. Silently, a lukewarm neutrality has given place to a positive, staunch, determined loyalty. It is very evident that Baltimore can now take care of herself, and though it has happened that the evidence has not come in the most pleasing form, it is, nevertheless, at bottom, a gratifying manifestation of the solid heart-felt patriotism of her people.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/26/archives/the-effervescence-in-baltimore.html,,"Baltimore has always been a faithful barometer of the ups and downs of the rebel cause.

There were twenty-five patrolmen, two sergeants and the Captain, from each Precinct in the City. The flags upon all the Station-houses and upon some of the other public buildings were at half mast, and the City Hall and other bells were tolled during the whole time the procession was passing down to the ferry.

"CONDITION OF THE WOUNDED MAN, &c. -- There is a very great amount of speculation and rumor afloat, in respect to the causes which led to the unfortunate shooting affray in Prince-street, on Thursday evening last. The respective friends of both parties are very busy in endeavoring to influence public opinion, and to create a feeling in the minds of others similar to that which they themselves entertain in regard to the occurrence. Whatever may have been the motive which induced CARSON to attempt to take the life of WATROUS, it is now quite probable that the act will not result so seriously as it was at first believed by his attending physicians. The wounded man was yesterday comparatively comfortable, and he informed the reporter, who called for the purpose of learning his true condition, that ""he was not going to die of this wound, but, on the contrary, he would be around again in a few days."" His physicians also had, yesterday, strong hopes of his recovery. A very favorable change took place during the latter part of Saturday night, and the early part of yesterday. Under these circumstances WATROUS declines to say much with reference to the difficulty between himself and CARSON. He, however, denied most emphatically, that he owes his assailant any such sum of money as is stated in some of the papers. He says be never borrowed of him more than $100 or $200 at a time, and does not now owe him but a very small amount. He also stated to the reporter yesterday that there was not a word of truth in the story that a woman was connected with the affair. He pronounces it a base fabrication, got up by the friends of CARSON, for the purpose of shielding him from punishment for the deadly assault. WATROUS is a man of fine conversational powers, and evidently one who well understands the world, and human nature generally. On the other hand, it is proper to say, that the most intimate friends of CARSON confidently state, that the only motive the latter had, when he shot WATROUS, was to punish the man who had violated the sanctity of his domestic life. The counsel for CARSON, Messrs. GRAHAM & AVERILL, say, that instead of the shot having been fired suddenly and unexpectedly at WATROUS, as is stated in the deposition of the latter, taken before the Coroner on the night of the occurrence, the whole affair was talked over that afternoon, that CARSON made distinct charges against WATROUS of having seduced his wife, and told him that he (CARSON) knew well of an arrangement having been made the night previous, between WATROUS and his wife, whereby they were to go to the Central Park together, when he (CARSON) should be away from home. They state, further, that WATROUS admitted all this, and went down upon his knees before CARSON, and begged for his life, even before the pistol was drawn to shoot him. This is given as CARSON's version of the difficulty, communicated to his counsel since the night of the occurrence.

The writer -- a genial Englishman -- of great experience as a traveler, but to whom everything in America was entirely fresh and unexplored, determined to penetrate the Far West in the eventful Summer of 1860, at a time when the United States forces were occupying the Salt Lake Valley, and there was every prospect of a general frontier war, in which the forces of the Union would be battling against the Mormons in their mountain fastnesses, backed by the wild tribes of the interior. The moment was well chosen for the bold seeker after excitement and adventure, and our jovial Briton seems to have made the most of all his opportunities. His life on the wilderness pathway to the Mormon Capital; his residence of some weeks there: his intercoursse with the quaint inhabitants, and their ways, customs, and pursuits; his excursions through adjacent regions, and among the Dakotahs and other Indian tribes; his journeyings to Carson and Ruby valleys, and then the incidents of his returning travel -- are all told in a chatty, cheerful vein that, combining instruction with amusement, makes the work a delightful and interesting friend.

"Two inquests were held yesterday by Coroner COLLIN, at Bellevue Hospital -- one upon the body of Mrs. LYDIA PHILLIPIE, and the other upon the body of her daughter JULIETTE, aged 5 1/2 years, both of whom died under the following circumstances: Mrs. PHILLIPIE is a native of Switzerland, and about 26 years of age. In the early part of the present year her husband enlisted in one of the regiments of the Sickles Brigade, and was killed at the battle of Williamsburgh.

The modern method of compensating (as far as a mere mercenary return can repay) the inestimable services of these National lawgivers, by a fixed salary, instead of by a per diem, has this effect, that the business of governing the country never lags; nor is the Annual Session extended a day beyond the earliest feasible for an adjourment. To such extent, indeed, is this alacrity carried, that measures of the highest public moment are too apt to be scantily and only partially considered, in the haste of the Members to reach their homes and enjoy the well-earned laudations of an admiring constituency. It was different, indeed, under the old system. The Thirty-First Congress had in its hands the Compromise measures of 1850, and receiving eight dollars a-day per head, never thought of adjourning until September 30 -- two months before the commencement of the short Session. But the present Congress, with tenfold more business upon its calendar, business, the importance of which has no parallel in the antecedent history of the Nation, is quite willing to be released by the middle of June, whatever at that time may be the requirements of public welfare. Such, at least, appears to be its present temper.

BANKS reaching the country on Sunday, we doubtless owe an escape from the wild panic the first impression of such a disaster was calculated to excite. Time was given for a second thought; and reflection soon showed that the effort of the enemy was simply a throe of dissolution -- a spasm preceding that final collapse which must certainly render further movement impossible. Some demonstration was needed to restore the shattered morale of the forces before Richmond and Corinth. The gloom resulting from constant defeat and reverse was to be for an instant dissipated by a gleam of success. It was not impossible that, under the excitement of a reported victory, the army of JOHNSTON might be encouraged to give Gen. MCCLELLAN battle in front of Richmond, and so save the mortification of losing the Confederate capital without a blow. BANKS was known to have only a handful of men in his command. To make a dash at his enfeebled column, pursue it up the valley, drive it into Maryland, and then retire before MCDOWELL, or SHIELDS or FREMONT could close in behind them and cut off their retreat, was doubtless the rebel policy. An impression of this sort became general in this City as soon as the news had been fairly digested. It was seen that no material advantage was lost. The rebels gained nothing but the fame of a barren victory. The pieces on the National chess-board held their squares -- only the pawns had moved. Washington was not endangered. An invasion of Maryland was out of the question. And so public apprehension passed away; that acute index of popular opinion, the Stock Market, wavered only momentarily, and then recovered its tone.

Sketch of Banks 3-mos. campaign in Shenandoah Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/27/archives/gen-banks-campaign-sketch-of-gen-banks-three-months-campaign-in-the.html,Sketch of Banks 3-mos. campaign in Shenandoah Valley,"Precisely three months ago, on the 26th of February last, the army of Maj.-Gen. BANKS crossed the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, and took up its line of march along the valley of the Shenandoah. The column numbered some thirty thousand men, finely drilled and well equipped; and was composed of regiments from almost every loyal State in the Union -- from New-England, from New-York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, and from the Northwestern tier of States as far as Wisconsin. Its work was to destroy or drive from the valley the rebel force under Gen. THOS. J. JACKSON, (commonly called ""Stonewall"" Jackson,) who had, during the Winter, held possession of that section of Virginia extending from the Blue Ridge to the hills in Berkeley County, and from the Potomac on the northeast to the Southwestern limit of the State. Gen. BANKS' column set out in high spirits, anxious to measure swords with the rebel fee, and with a perfect confidence in the accomplished soldier and statesman who was in command. The day after reaching the soil of Virginia, the advance began. The enemy was driven from Charlestown, discomfited in innumerable cavalry skirmishes, his whole army was defeated at Winchester, he was pursued to Strasburgh, from thence to Mount Jackson, the terminus of the Valley Railroad; from thence to New-Market, to Harrisburgh, and to Staunton -- a distance of over a hundred miles from where he started; while a harrassing series of cavalry and infantry skirmishes was kept up along the whole line. Gen. BANKS' work, so far as his own Department was concerned, was now nearly completed. He had only to advance upon Staunton, defeat or drive away the rebels there, hold the railroad running across the Blue Ridge, and then his fine army would be ready for further operations wherever it might be needed. Suddenly, and while near this point, it was darkly given out from Washington that BANKS' army was on the retreat -- why, no common mortal could divine. It was reported early in the present month to be back at New-Market, back to Woodstock, back to Strasburgh, where it temporarily made a halt, and it leaked out from the telegraph that one-half of the column (SHIELDS' division) was on the wing over the Manassas Gap Railroad to Fredericksburgh -- for what purpose nobody but the war-gods at Washington could tell. The rebels, in the meantime, came up with the remnant of BANKS' army at Strasburgh, defeated a part of it at Front Royal, drove the remainder back from Strasburgh to Winchester, defeated it there, with great loss; drove it back in haste from Winchester to the Potomac; and there, on yesterday, it effected a crossing into Maryland -- after a retreat of a hundred miles -- precisely three months to a day, as we have said, from the time it set out. The advance, so gloriously and hopefully made in February, after all but accomplishing its object, ended in disaster and disgrace to the National arms in May.

The majority report, signed by Aldermen STRONG and GREEN, is in favor of directing the Board of Contracts to enter into a contract with the Citizens' Company for supplying the city at $1 80 per 1,000 cubic feet, provided the Company agrees to extend the contract for five years, furnish good gas, and supply private consumers at $2 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Under an ordinance passed by the Common Council some weeks ago, the work of grading the street is rapidly progressing, the various owners, after a long delay, during which the street became not only impassable, but a nuisance, agreed upon a grade. That portion of the work is being pushed forward, and, meantime, an ordinance lies on the table of the Common Council for paving the street with Belgian pavement, which should be commenced immediately; the grading is finished. If this is not attended to, and acted on at once, and authority given the Croton Department to pave the street at once, it will become again a common dumping ground, and another year may elapse before the street can be used by the community.

The State authorities had done all in their power, and in connection with the United States officials, had issued the necessary arms, ammunition, equipments and rations, but the uniforms and clothing which had been promised were not forthcoming. In vain did the State authorities and the commandants of the several regiments represent what had been done, and their readiness to go immediately upon being uniformed.

He stated that his orders were positive to issue no uniforms until all those receiving them had been mustered into the service of the United States.

Babies look over their plump little shoulders and laugh at the doctor as he passes rapidly around with his beautifully-adapted instrument, dispatching a case at every two seconds. The philosophy of scabs, or vaccine lymph, is very interesting as observed in this institution, which is renowned for the purity of its virus. The specimens of perfect extraction are carefully preserved air tight, between glass plates, and can be sent by avail to any part of the world. Many thousand of our State troops received the benefit of this genuine matter before exposing their persons to the infection of camps. When the volunteering excitement of one year ago was at its height, an order emanated from the Surgeon-General's office at Albany that every regiment should be vaccinated before leaving the State. This order was so promptly and efficiently carried out, not only by the giving out of virus, but by the personal attendance of the medical staff of the Eastern Dispensary, that a letter of grateful acknowledgment has been received from the State Department.

It utterly declines to die.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/28/archives/the-british-ministry-in-a-minority.html,,"-- The Ministry of Lord PALMERSTON threatens to be to Young England what the Long Parliament was to the Great Rebellion. It utterly declines to die. Time was that when the Government was beaten upon one of its measures, Ministers would either appeal to the country by a dissolution or resign. The Whigs do neither. With that happy nonchalance which is the Premier's peculiarity, he laughs at defeat, and scorns resignation. If he cannot bring the Houses to his support on one measure he can upon another. If he break down on domestic questions be brings up in the Foreign. If the Budget meet with a reverse, the Navy Estimates fetch up the leeway. And the unanimous support of the House upon the Trent settlement compensates for utter discomfiture on the Church Rates, or marriage affinities. The latest misadventure of the Ministry was in this business of Church Rates abolition -- a measure which the Cabinet has advocated for two sessions vainly. Not only was there a majority of one against the Government upon the direct question; but when a resolution denouncing the Government view was put, it was carried by an unmistakable majority. What hope can the Tories have of power, if even this blow fail to induce upon the Whigs a spirit of resignation?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BRITISH MINISTRY IN A MINORITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BRITISH MINISTRY IN A MINORITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cbfd76f0-f47a-50ff-b5b4-92c9abd926f2,216,nyt://article/cbfd76f0-f47a-50ff-b5b4-92c9abd926f2,

The moment a box was received on the sidewalk, it was seized by a hundred willing hands, and swiftly transferred to the armory room. In another moment the box was opened, and in almost less time than it takes to relate it, each company would be supplied with its quota. So far as the regiment was concerned there was no blame for the delay in embarkation for the seat of war. The spirit of the regiment was astonishing. The ranks were filled with some of our wealthiest and best citizens, who sacrificed business, home interests of all kinds, to join in the march of their favorite corps a second time to the defence of their country. The scarred and disfigured faces of many denoted the terrible experience of the regiment on the bloody field of Bull Run. Here was a man whose face was a series of frightful scars; there another whose nose was nearly gone. No less than thirty-seven were for months prisoners in the horrible tobacco warehouses of Richmond, previous to the arrangement for the interchange of prisoners. All went willingly to the work again. As an instance of the wonderful esprit du corps that characterized the members, we may state that there were in the ranks one who had resigned a position as First Lieutenant in the Navy, another who had relinquished a Lieutenant-Colonelcy of volunteers, four Captains of volunteers, eight First and Second Lieutenants of volunteers, three Sergeants of Police, eleven policemen and scores of others who gave up pecuniarily better positions in order to go with the regiment. All were not only willing but anxious to go, and joyously awaited the hour of departure. It was not the mere excitement of the moment, for many had tasted the stern realities of war. It was the calm, determined, patriotic resolve of good and loyal citizens. Col.

"The zeal with which Gen. DIX applies martial law to the malcontents of Maryland might be advantageously imitated in one or two other quarters, where leniency is working mischief. At Easton, the other day, a State Judge, backed by the County Prosecuting Attorney, exposed himself to the penalties of sedition. The population thereabouts was unfortunately sympathetic with the brace of legal luminaries.

Mr. ROBB more than twenty-five years ago settled in New-Orleans, and as a banker soon acquired not only large wealth, but the still greater distinction of an honest and public-spirited citizen. To him is the South largely indebted for its railroads. Probably no gentleman in private life stands higher, and no one in the country has a larger share of practical wisdom -- no one living knows more of the material interests and public men of New-Orleans and Louisiana.

"One of our correspondents with  the army before Richmond informs us that the rebel army, which has of late been drawn close to and immediately around Richmond, is now being rapidly thrown forward from the rebel Capital toward the Chickahominy River, and directly in front of the main body of our army.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/29/archives/change-in-the-rebel-situation-before-richmond.html,,"-- One of our correspondents with the army before Richmond informs us that the rebel army, which has of late been drawn close to and immediately around Richmond, is now being rapidly thrown forward from the rebel Capital toward the Chickahominy River, and directly in front of the main body of our army. This, it is thought, is a positive indication that the rebel Generals are going to contest, with their whole force, the occupancy of Richmond. Though MCCLELLAN is pressing close upon the city from two directions, and MCDOWELL is menacing it from Fredericksburgh, and the gunboats are but a short distance below it in front, there is no indication that the rebel host is preparing to evacuate. The retreat of such an army is not a thing that can be effected in a day, nor in two days; and, as our forces must now be within cannon shot of it, it would be impossible for it to make good its retreat at all, if the pursuit were pressed with vigor. These things certainly all look as if there was to be a desperate struggle for Richmond. The view would seem to be confirmed, too, by the late demonstrations of the political chiefs of the South against a peaceful surrender. The Legislature of Virginia has resolved that the ""capital of the State must be defended to the last extremity;"" Gov. LETCHER declares that the ""capital of Virginia must not be surrendered;"" the Mayor of Richmond says he ""would sooner die than surrender the city;"" JEFF. DAVIS says that he ""does not see or anticipate the necessity that the capital should fall;"" and the Press talks of a general slaughter before such an event shall take place.

The ringing of the bells at 11 o'clock A.M. -- the signal to be made in case the parade was to come off -- made the hearts of not less than twenty-five thousand children thrill with pleasure, and promptly the members of each school proceeded to the appointed rendezvous. While waiting to join in the division processions, their spirits were considerably dampened by a drizzling rain, which now commenced falling. But they did not long let this disappointment cloud their brows. The time was passed very pleasantly in listening to appropriate and considerately short speeches, singing, and partaking of the good things the partiality of friends had provided for them. Though thwarted by the elements in regard to a parade in force, they were determined not to forego the anticipated pleasures in the churches, so at 2 o'clock -- the time named in the programme -- each school marched, with banners and flags flying, and accompanied by music, to the particular churches set apart for their use respectively, and there the order of exercises, consisting of speaking, singing and partaking of refreshments, was carried out to the letter, and much to the satisfaction of all concerned. At the close of these proceedings, some of the schools, still bent upon having a procession of some kind, formed and marched several squares, honoring sister schools, prominent citizens and others, occasionally, as they passed along, with rounds of cheers. It is estimated that not less than 25,000 children were present at the different churches, and not an accident of any kind occurred to mar the occasion.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7276d2c8-6533-5ccc-a848-b831a68e7d10,388,nyt://article/7276d2c8-6533-5ccc-a848-b831a68e7d10,

The libel states that on the 12th day of September, the ship being then about three hundred miles west of Cape Clear, she was overtaken by a violent storm, which carried away the side-wheels, disabled the rudder, and did other serious damage. That the officers of the ship endeavored, by means of various devices, to steer the ship, but failed, and she remained from the afternoon of Thursday, the 12th, until the evening of Sunday, the 15th of September, in the trough of the sea, entirely at the mercy of the storm. That on Friday the libelant devised a temporary steering apparatus, and asked permission of the Captain to apply it to the broken rudder, which request was declined. That, on Saturday evening, at the solicitation of the passengers, the captain consented to allow the libelant to construct his steering apparatus, and placed men and material at his disposal, to enable him to complete his design. That on Sunday evening the temporary apparatus was completed, and was found to be sufficient to steer the ship, and with it she was brought safely to a harbor, reaching the Cove of Cork on Tuesday, Sept. 17.

He did actually issue it, though there comes with it from New-Orleans an explanatory paragraph, which somewhat modifies its effect. It seems that by a municipal regulation in New-Orleans, ""women of the town practicing their avocation"" are liable to be imprisoned in the Calaboose; and Gen. BUTLER merely intends to say by his order, that women who insult or express contempt, by word or gesture, for any officer or soldier of the United States, shall be subject to the same punishment. We regret that he did not say so in distinct terms, if that was his meaning. Besides the coarse and needless vulgarity of the language of his order, it was obnoxious to the very serious misconstruction which was put upon it by Gen. BEAUREGARD, and by nearly all who read it, without the comment by which it has now been followed. Our troops have probably had more severe trials to encounter than the scowls and grimaces of the female department of Secession; but if they cannot sustain these afflictions, they should have some regard to decency and their own dignity in their mode of inflicting punishment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OF NEW-ORLEANS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OF NEW-ORLEANS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06fda7cb-f8e1-5e52-9a85-5a39f36ac075,209,nyt://article/06fda7cb-f8e1-5e52-9a85-5a39f36ac075,

All have their first battalion filled, and serving at the seat of war. Several have their second nearly organized, and the Eighteenth, the headquarters of which is at Columbus, Ohio, has its three battalions, or the entire 2,400 men enrolled. Yesterday recruiting was commenced at several new stations, and there is hardly a town of any importance in the States of Maine. Ohio, Connecticut, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, that representatives of the above troops are not enlisting men. Lieut. MORGAN, Twelfth Foot, has been dispatched to Pottsville, Penn., for the purpose of opening a recruiting office there. He is to send on to Fort Hamilton all the men obtained, who will be supplied with requisites and drilled for duty. The Fourteenth Regiment, now numbering over 1,200 rank and file, has opened offices to fill up is ranks, and all the troops enlisted for its second battalion were sent to Washington on Tuesday.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/30/archives/the-battle-of-pittsburgh-landing.html,,"-- THE REBEL ACCOUNT. -- Gen. BEAUREGARD's Report of the Battle of Shiloh must have been more to the taste of President DAVIS than that of Bull Run, as it has seen the light within two months after the conflict. There are reasons indeed why it should be satisfactory. BEAUREGARD is shrewd and plausible. He knows how to put a bad picture in an advantageous light; and doubtless, nine out of ten of his dull rebel readers fancy the narrative to be one of a victory, attended by inestimable strategic consequences. The odds are all placed on the side of GRANT's army. Its numbers, position, and the presence of the gunboats, are represented at full value; and the daring plans of the rebel leader became really meritorious, considering the magnitude of the task he had set for himself. It was simply to rout GRANT at all points, under the very guns of the flotilla, drive his forces into the river, and return to Corinth, carrying back untold booty in great guns, small arms and equipage. The plan, he alleges, failed only because of the unexpected arrival of BUELL; but so admirably conducted was the retreat, that the rebels reached the lines of Corinth without the Nationals venturing to harass them. They found it inconvenient, however, to take with them anything but such better weapons as the rebels picked up on the field, as the relics of runaway Yankees. The losses in general officers, and rank and file, on the rebel side, are admitted to be great; but newspaper reports are relied upon to prove the loss on the side of the North to be yet greater.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BATTLE OF PITTSBURGH LANDING', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BATTLE OF PITTSBURGH LANDING', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4687c5e8-dc34-5a0c-96a9-e6dae8fee055,467,nyt://article/4687c5e8-dc34-5a0c-96a9-e6dae8fee055,

The result of this step was that CARSON yesterday afternoon delivered himself up to Policeman WARREN. He was immediately taken before the Justice, who issued the warrant, and after an examination, he was held to bail in the sum of $5,000 for his appearance to answer any indictment which may be found against him by the Grand Jury. In answer to the usual questions put to him by the Justice, CARSON stated that he was 32 years of age; that he was born in Philadelphia, and that his residence was Ontonagon, in the State of Michigan.

"Gen. HALLECK'S combinations against the rebels at Corinth have proved too much for them, and they have evacuated the position last ditch and all.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/31/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"Gen. HALLECK's combinations against the rebels at Corinth have proved too much for them, and they have evacuated the position -- last ditch and all. The dispatches published by us yesterday announced that three strong reconnoitering columns of our army advanced on Wednesday morning from the right, centre and left, to ""feel"" the enemy, and to unmask his batteries. The enemy, it appears, hotly contested our advance at each point, but was driven back with considerable loss. Gen. POPE's column, on the left, encountered the strongest opposition, and our loss there was twenty-five killed and wounded, while the enemy left thirty dead on the field. The fighting was renewed on Thursday morning, Gen. POPE's heavy batteries opening upon the enemy's works, from the advanced batteries of which he soon drove the rebels. Gen. SHERMAN in the course of the day also established a heavy battery at only one thousand yards' distance; and early yesterday morning skirmishing parties were advanced in all directions. Three of our divisions soon occupied the enemy's intrenchments, about a mile from Corinth, which was soon discovered to be in flames, and the enemy falling back. Our troops immediately pushed forward, and Gen. POPE's advance, the Thirty-ninth Ohio, occupied the town, and planted the ""Old Glory"" on the Court-house. The enemy, it appears, evacuated the place during Thursday night, and retreated down the railroad toward Mobile -- one report states, to take up a new position at Okolona, about sixty miles below on the railroad. Gen. HALLECK seems to be in doubt about the enemy's movements, accounts being, he says, conflicting. He is of opinion that the rebels are in strong force on our left flank, some four or five miles south of Corinth, but of course on the railroad. He has doubtless taken measures to ascertain the truth, which we shall all learn in good time.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09dff21f-1da4-53a4-a8e3-fb5e95b54ba7,921,nyt://article/09dff21f-1da4-53a4-a8e3-fb5e95b54ba7,

It is safe to say the news of the rebels having evacuated Corinth was as little expected as was that of the evacuation of Yorktown. At Corinth had been located one of the very last ditches of the insurrection.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/05/31/archives/the-evacuation-of-corinth.html,,"It is safe to say the news of the rebels having evacuated Corinth was as little expected as was that of the evacuation of Yorktown. At Corinth had been located one of the very last ditches of the insurrection. There, with as numerous a throng of traitors as could ever be brought together, in a position possessing every natural advantage in addition to the most elaborate defensive works, and surrounded by approaches of peculiar difficulty, it was reckoned confidently, North and South, that one of the two decisive battles of the war would have to be fought, and that doubts as to the relative force and martial characteristics of the antagonists would require no further solution. The force under Gen. BEAUREGARD has been rated at various figures. A moderate estimate derived from others of much larger proportions, would seem to justify a belief that at least one hundred and thirty thousand men were behind the lines of Corinth. The ablest Generals in the rebel service -- BEAUREGARD, BRAGG, HARDEE, POLK, and VAN DORN, to say nothing of BRECKINRIDGE -- were at the head of the several divisions; men who, beyond mere military skill and experience, possessed the entire confidence of their soldiers. All these conditions turned the odds of the apparently impending conflict in favor of the rebels, who had an additional incentive to desperate resistance in the circumstance that the fate of Memphis and the Mississippi River was dependent on the result. Yet all these arguments for a great fight have been spoiled by the event. The rebels have retired, not in the direction of Memphis, or to a position where the possession of the river might still be disputed, but to a point at the Southeast, which is simply a step in the direction of further retreat. The war in the West is ended. The Mississippi Valley is in possession of the Union. The entire region to the west, from Texas northward, can offer no further resistance to the National arms. Forts Wright and Randolph must fall with the fall of Corinth. The theatre of war is narrowed to the southeastern angle of the Republic. And it is almost certain that, in thus abandoning the Southwestern States, all of the rebel army which was drafted from that section will abandon the flag of BEAUREGARD in a body.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Evacuation of Corinth.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Evacuation of Corinth.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-05-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3096a33e-c200-5fdf-9e0a-72d8a64bdd92,910,nyt://article/3096a33e-c200-5fdf-9e0a-72d8a64bdd92,

"Berry vs. Kelly, Sheriff, Ketchum et al. -- Ketchum & Son, on the 6th of February, 1861, as creditors of Carroll & Mead, who had suspended payment, caused an attachment to be issued against that firm, consisting of three persons, upon the ground that the members thereof were all non-residents. On the same day the Sheriff levied the attachment on the partnership stock.

The amount called for was not great, the interest offered was liberal, and the security regarded, by Confederates, at least, as most ample -- being nothing less than a tax on all the cotton to be shipped from the prolific South to all parts of the cotton-consuming world. It occurred to us at the time, and probably to many other much brighter financiers, that it was not wise to pledge all of the money that the Confederate Government expected to raise from the cotton monopoly, to sustain the credit of their first loan, and that by no means a large loan. It was possible that other loans would be needed, and further securities wanted. Would the cotton tax be pledged again? Second mortgages are never as good as first mortgages. At least such has been the estimation of financiers heretofore. It may have been, perhaps it was, reserved to Mr. MEMMINGER to establish the contrary principle.

A magic-lantern exhibition added to the pleasures of the evening, and such hearty laughter was induced by the merry show that appetites were fairly set on edge for the rare feast of cakes and iced lemonade which ensued. The members of the Children's Aid Society, who were present, saw to it that none lacked in participation of these delicacies, which, as a general thing, constituted unattainable temptations upon on corner fruit-stands, and never to be indulged in at the individual expense of those who now, with unrestrained sociability, luxuriated thereupon. After each had partaken to their heart's content, and to a colic-threatening extent, three times; three were given for the Loding-house, and for the considerate friends who had planned this pleasant entertainment for them. A circle of interested observers was present, and appropriate remarks were made by Mr. MACY and others. Some first-rate music formed a main attraction of the evening, and the manner in which these Italian-born children rendered the ""Garibaldi March"" and other national airs was inspiriting to the fullest degree. By invitation of Mr. and Mrs. TROTT. Superintendents of the Lodging-house, a most satisfactory reconnoissance of the premises, dormitories, &c., took place, the children moving in an orderly manner through each apartment.

A number of enterprising shippers and merchants have already put up cargoes and taken out licenses, under the regulations prescribed by Secretary CHASE in his Circular; and Uncle Sam's war-dogs will hardly be withdrawn from their long watch ere argosies freighted with articles of use, of medicine, and of luxury, to which Southern eyes have for months been strangers, will sail into those harbors and take in exchange cargoes of those staples for which our European friends do so pine. Our late files of the French and English journals are filled with speculations as to a possible relaxation of the blockade, which appears to have been diplomatically forthshadowed in London and Paris; and the capture of New-Orleans was chiefly interesting to them as bearing upon this all-important question. The President's proclamation, which has now been received at the other side of the Atlantic, has, however, decided the matter, and without doubt the intelligence has been received with the liveliest satisfaction. It only remains now that the vessels that go in search of the new golden fleece shall be successful in obtaining their cargoes. And for this it is necessary, first, that the cotton shall not have been destroyed, and secondly, that the planters shall be willing to sell. We have very little doubt that both the fact and the disposition will prove satisfactory. Wild fictions have reached us of the burning of cotton along the Mississippi as our flotilla pushed up. Doubtless a certain quantity has been consumed, but it has been the work of Confederate soldiery specially charged with this ""patriotic"" task, and we have yet to receive evidence that a single planter has either burned his cotton or suffered it to be burned, if he could help it. Already cotton begins to reach New-Orleans from Plaquemine, and our latest advices report the arrival of more from up river.
