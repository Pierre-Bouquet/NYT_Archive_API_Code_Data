An authorized Washington telegram this morning announces that there was but little if any fighting going on yesterday. Throughout the four days from Wednesday to Saturday the fighting was continuous, hot and bloody. Beginning on the first day, with but a single division of the National army, which was the attacking party and achieved a decided success, the battle waxed in magnitude on Thursday, with dubious results, swelled into the proportions of a general engagement with fearful carnage and a successful issue on Friday, till on Saturday the reinforced rebels became the attacking party, and a ""severe battle"" -- how severe we as yet know not -- followed, the result of which, according to this morning's dispatches was that ""the advantage, on the whole, was with the enemy, and Gen. POPE fell back to Centreville with his whole army, in good order.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Battles near Washington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Battles near Washington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/00c95db9-3a8d-52f6-85aa-0809cbf41039,627,nyt://article/00c95db9-3a8d-52f6-85aa-0809cbf41039

At the time of the explosion a man named NEAL MCELROY, the night foreman, was engaged in stirring the contents of the pan. He was blown up to the roof of the building and falling to the ground received such injuries that he expired in a few moments. An iron bar, which he was using at the time, was thrown up to the roof with great force, running very nearly through one of the rafters, where it still remains. Two other workmen were slightly scalded by the hot saleratus which was scattered in every direction. The body of MCELROY was taken to his late residence in Bay-street, where it was viewed by Coroner GAFNEY and a permit given for burial.

"About 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, two men, one named WM. MCFADEN, a butcher, residing in First-avenue, near Twenty-sixth-street, and the other named MARTIN GALLAGHER, had a dispute relative to some trifling matter, which resulted in a desperate struggle between them. There seems to have been some difficulty previously existing between the men, and at the time of the altercation GALLAGHER was under the influence of liquor. While in this condition he began a quarrel with the father-in-law of MCFADEN, when the latter became exasperated and interfered. GALLAGHER still continued abusive, and MCFADEN seized an old-fashioned butcher knife, one of the long, narrow kind, and plunged it with full force into GALLAGHER's neck behind the ear, driving it up to the hilt and leaving it in the wound.

He thinks we ought to be satisfied, by this time, that we never can conquer the South, inasmuch as we have not done it already. There is undoubtedly a good deal that is discouraging in the experience of the past year. Our armies have not accomplished what they ought to have done, nor a tithe of what they would have done if they had been led by competent commanders. We have lost a great many men by disease, and a good many in battle; we have neglected many opportunities to cripple the enemy -- we have wasted a great deal of money -- we have made a good many mistakes, both military and political -- we have lost a great deal of time -- we have frittered away the most splendid resources ever put into the hands of a Government for war purposes -- and, on the whole, we cannot pretend that our past year's experience has been a very brilliant success.

Editorial urges immediate drafting because of Union being threatened in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/01/archives/the-rebellion.html,Editorial urges immediate drafting because of Union being threatened in Virginia,"The past week has been another ""week of battles"" in Virginia. Fighting -- heavy fighting -- has been going on there almost every day, and with results generally favorable to our arms. We have given from day to day, as they have reached us, somewhat imperfect accounts of the important events which have occurred -- necessarily imperfect, because in most cases written at a distance from the scenes of operations. They have been sufficient, however, to give a general idea of the great movements which have been effected, and the series of skirmishes and battles which culminated on Friday and Saturday in the great struggles, of which we give accounts elsewhere. We on Saturday morning published a dispatch from Gen. POPE to Gen. HALLECK, giving an official account of the battle of Thursday, which was ended by the darkness of night, and expressing the expectation that it would be renewed in the morning. In a dispatch dated Saturday, Gen. POPE states that a terrific battle was fought on Friday, on the old Bull Bun battle-ground, with the combined forces of the enemy, lasting with continuous fury from daylight until after dark, by which time the enemy was driven from the field, which was occupied by our forces, who were too much exhausted to push matters. Gen. POPE intended to pursue as soon as reinforced by FITZ-JOHN PORTER's corps, which was expected up during the morning. At the moment of closing his dispatch, however, word was brought to Gen. POPE that the enemy were in full retreat toward the mountains, and he made immediate preparations to pursue. Gen. POPE estimates our losses on Friday at not less than eight thousand men killed and wounded, and the losses of the rebels at fully double that number. Our captures in this battle are said to be great. Their extent will probably soon be made known. We have as yet no official reports of the operations of Saturday, but they appear to have been fully as serious as those of the day previous, and with results not quite so satisfactory. The retrograde movement of the enemy in the morning seems to have been for the purpose of meeting reinforcements, which are reported to have come up in large numbers, swelling the force to such an extent as to embolden them to make an attack in their turn --the attack on Friday being made by us. The attack was boldly met, and a severe battle ensued, the advantage of which was, on the whole, on the side of the rebels. Gen. POPE consequently fell back in food order with his whole army to Centreville, where he was reinforced by FRANKLIN's Division, and where he was also joined by SUMNER's Division during the night, and again prepared to take the offensive. Yesterday, however, according to our latest dispatches from Washington, no fighting of any consequence took place, though various rumors of a great battle were prevalent throughout the day. Washington was, of course, intensely excited, and this excitement was not allayed in any measure by the report that some rebel scouts had been seen at Langley's, in the vicinity of the Chain Bridge. This report, however, does not seem to be verified.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6d0a5647-d36e-53e4-a64a-18016d52edc9,1466,nyt://article/6d0a5647-d36e-53e4-a64a-18016d52edc9

The  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/01/archives/amusements.html,,"The season at the Winter Garden has commenced auspiciously. Every evening through the week there have been large and appreciative audiences, performances of unusual excellence, and a general air of brightness and prosperity, that seems to promise cheerful fortune in the future. The changes which have been made in the decoration and lighting of the auditorium are vast improvements on the previous aspect of those important items of theatrical completeness; the regular company comprises a good deal of acknowledged talent and efficiency, and, now that Mr. HAWTHORNE is engaged in the pictorial department, more artistic scenery than has of late appeared upon the stage may be expected. The success with which the season has been inaugurated, though, belongs chiefly to Miss BATEMAN, whose unquestionable genius infuses vitality enough into plays that have lost the charm of freshness to make them still attractive. It is an achievement of no ordinary magnitude, and one that any actress may be justly proud of, to draw enthusiastic crowds for six consecutive nights to see a piece like the ""Hunchback,"" which every play-goer has seen unnumbered times before, and usually without finding any of those qualities in it which compel especial admiration and delight. Yet Miss BATEMAN, without startling the town by any attempt at a sensational reading of her part in it, has made it a vehicle for the development of so much genuine power, pathos and well-discriminated individuality, as to render it, for the time, a more desirable dramatic study or entertainment than almost any novelty would be. Very wisely, she has had secured for her support the services of actors of established reputation, whose excellence combines with her own to produce the nearest approach to perfection which can be reasonably hoped for under what is called the ""star"" system. ""The Hunchback"" will be given again before the close of Miss BATEMAN's engagement; but tonight it gives place to ""Rosa Gregorio,"" the drama by Mr. DEWALDEN, which was received with so much favor at the Winter Garden last Spring. Miss BATEMAN, of course, plays the heroine, and the other leading characters are in the hands of Mr. J.W. WALLACK, Jr., and Mr. EDWIN ADAMS.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/81a493b4-5b6e-5ad2-a4f3-d40c44c197a3,894,nyt://article/81a493b4-5b6e-5ad2-a4f3-d40c44c197a3

The ...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/01/archives/amusements.html,,"The season at the Winter Garden has commenced auspiciously. Every evening through the week there have been large and appreciative audiences, performances of unusual excellence, and a general air of brightness and prosperity, that seems to promise cheerful fortune in the future. The changes which have been made in the decoration and lighting of the auditorium are vast improvements on the previous aspect of those important items of theatrical completeness; the regular company comprises a good deal of acknowledged talent and efficiency, and, now that Mr. HAWTHORNE is engaged in the pictorial department, more artistic scenery than has of late appeared upon the stage may be expected. The success with which the season has been inaugurated, though, belongs chiefly to Miss BATEMAN, whose unquestionable genius infuses vitality enough into plays that have lost the charm of freshness to make them still attractive. It is an achievement of no ordinary magnitude, and one that any actress may be justly proud of, to draw enthusiastic crowds for six consecutive nights to see a piece like the ""Hunchback,"" which every play-goer has seen unnumbered times before, and usually without finding any of those qualities in it which compel especial admiration and delight. Yet Miss BATEMAN, without startling the town by any attempt at a sensational reading of her part in it, has made it a vehicle for the development of so much genuine power, pathos and well-discriminated individuality, as to render it, for the time, a more desirable dramatic study or entertainment than almost any novelty would be. Very wisely, she has had secured for her support the services of actors of established reputation, whose excellence combines with her own to produce the nearest approach to perfection which can be reasonably hoped for under what is called the ""star"" system. ""The Hunchback"" will be given again before the close of Miss BATEMAN's engagement; but to-night it gives place to ""Rosa Gregorio,"" the drama by Mr. DEWALDEN, which was received with so much favor at the Winter Garden last Spring. Miss BATEMAN, of course, plays the heroine, and the other leading characters are in the hands of Mr. J.W. WALLACK, Jr., and Mr. EDWIN ADAMS.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b192f5be-9634-5e93-9194-16edaa80cbe8,894,nyt://article/b192f5be-9634-5e93-9194-16edaa80cbe8

STEVENSON, commanding Second Brigage, First Divison. It consisted of a portion of the Twenty-fourth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, under Licut.-Col. OSBORN, a detachment of the Marine Artillery under Lieut.-Col. MANCHESTER, and a company of the Third New-York Artillery. On that day, the transports Pilot Boy, Ocean Queen, Massasoit, Allison, and Union, carrying a portion of the troops, proceeded through Core Sound to Beaufort, where they were joined by the others, who had come down by rail. Thursday was passed in providing the vessels with coal and water, and in giving the troops an opportunity for a sea-bath; and on Friday the expedition proceeded on its route. The Union, together with the Wilson, (which had joined the rest at Beaufort,) and the launches of the Marine Artillery, went by the way of Bogue Sound; whilst the other transports, accompanied by the gunboat Ellis, Lieut. PORTER, pushed out past Fort Macon into the ocean, and followed the coast to Bogue Inlet. The wind, which was light at daybreak, blew hard by afternoon, and it was with some difficulty that the vessel passed through the narrow, winding inlet, among the breakers. Within was still water, and a broad creek with meadow lands on either side. The boats anchored at its mouth, and waited for the arrival of the Union and the Wilson. Swansboro was seen in the distance, and very soon after their arrival a large white flag was seen to wave from a high brick building. A launch of the artillery was at once sent forward, and its men landed. At nightfall the Wilson arrived, bearing Col. STEVENSON and staff, and proceeded immediately to the town.

Editorial attacks London press reporting,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/01/archives/the-mischiefmakers-of-the-london-press.html,Editorial attacks London press reporting,"The attitude of affected wonder adopted by the London Press in commenting upon what they term ""the unfounded hostility of the United States toward England,"" constitutes quite a psychological curiosity. We are reminded of Mr. GARRIEL RAVEL in one of those innumerable pantomimic situations wherein, after committing some flat burglary, he essays to convince his captors of his innocence by facial alternations of meek ignorance and lugubrious vacuity. Can it be possible that those writers imagine the American public to be ignorant of their long-continued and most industrious efforts to damage and vilify the National cause? It seems hardly credible, yet it is difficult to explain their position upon any other rational basis. We are willing to concede that the bulk of the English ruling classes had a right to change their minds on the subject of negro Slavery. Albeit they had trumpeted their abhorrence of that system for many long years, their conversion was sudden, and rather a singular time was selected for its advertisement. We are ready to allow that it is perfectly natural they should desire a dissolution of the Union, if their reason is convinced -- and they profess it is so convinced -- that such an event would add to the permanency of British institutions, by doing much toward the extirpation of those agitating principles and opinions which have sometimes threatened them. We are prepared to admit that there was and is a powerful if not irresistible temptation to make use of the American rebellion so as to insure the political destruction of those troublesome Liberals and Radicals who are so unlovely in the sight of the British aristocracy. All these concessions it is proper to make, because although the actions so justified are dictated by pure selfishness, they are warranted in a manner by the traditionary arguments and usages of nations, and are not, in a technical sense, inconsistent with the principles of common honesty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mischief-makers of the London Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mischief-makers of the London Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dff75552-14b0-50a9-a242-b728a7b6b91b,1055,nyt://article/dff75552-14b0-50a9-a242-b728a7b6b91b

Dr. Gaither was born in Rowan County, North Carolino, in December, 1785, but emigrated to Kentucky early in the present century. He studied medicine and graduated at the celebrated Philadelphia school during the professorship of Dr. Benjamin Rush. When the war of 1812 broke out, he went to the field as assistant surgeon. He acquired a very extensive practice, and frequently represented his county in the State Legislature; was a Jackson elector when the Hero of New-Orleans first attained the Presidency. Dr. Gaither was in Congress from 1829 to 1833, during the stormy period of South Carolina Nullification, and he died as he lived, a Democrat of the strictest school, sternly opposed to disunion. While in Congress he was on the Committee of Ways and Means when McDuffie was its chairman, and made the first minority report against the recharter of the United States Bank. Alter his congressional career, he never entered political life again, except as a member of the Constitutional State Convention in 1849, but devoted himself to his profession. He had a surgeon's commission tendered to him in the Mexican war, but, having two sons in the service, he declined the position, and enjoyed the evening of his days surrounded by all the comforts of a home he had ever gladdened, until he sank to sleep placidly, with all his faculties active to the last, and enabling him to give directions as to his medical treatment as steadily as if he had been prescribing for a patient.

"The news of the last fortnight from the battle-ground in Virginia has well tested the popular temper. The moment the retirement of MCCLELLAN from the neighborhood of Richmond was announced, immediately after the President had called for six hundred thousand new men, it became evident that the last chance of the rebels was to reach and overwhelm POPE before MCCLELLAN should join him; and that chance failing, it was only left to crush the combined National army before its numbers should be trebled by the coming of the new levies. These opportunities, and the perils they involved, were unquestionably appreciated by Gen. HALLECK. It had fallen to him to retrieve the tremendous blunder of approaching Richmond over the Peninsula. Could he safely extricate the endangered army of MCCLELLAN from the James River, and place it beside that of Gen. POPE on the Rappahannock, the odds of the war would again turn to the side of the North, and the campaign be renewed with the most encouraging auspices. To effect the salvation of MCCLELLAN, POPE was sent to demonstrate on Richmond. The rebels were not slow to recognize their opportune moment. They neglected altogether to follow the retreating columns of MCCLELLAN down the James; but gathering all their forces, and urging Northward every General and every soldier, they attempted to extinguish POPE before reinforcements could reach him. Their movement was not, however, sufficiently rapid. Some portion of MCCLELLAN's army, with the bulk of BURNSIDE's, had effected a junction with POPE before the great, rush of the rebels came; and thus strengthened, the National commander was enabled to fall back in perfect order from the Rapidan to the Rappahannock, and to contest on the banks of the latter the further advance of the enemy. But the enemy was aware how tardily the divisions of MCCLELLAN were moving to the support of POPE, and knew too well, that unless he could fling his entire force upon our people, while their numbers were still incomplete, and before the combined army had assumed any sort of organization, his hopes of victory were forever lost; and hence the incredible energy with which the legions of LEE, and LONGSTREET and JACKSON were moved to the rear of our lines.

The attack mentioned this morning as repulsed by the Union troops at Bolivar, the previously reported defeat of Gen. NELSON, the advance of BRAGG toward Western Virginia, the threatened investment of Fort Donelson, are parts of the same daring strategy which places the main army of the rebellion in front of Washington. The explanation of this unwonted activity, and also of its apparent delay to the last moment, is obvious. The rebels, as their journals had no hesitation in declaring, never believed in the possibility of the Federal Government placing in the field the additional six hundred thousand men called for as volunteers and conscripts. The North was believed to be weary of the war. All the paupers who could be hired to fill the ranks had been obtained; there was no further material for volunteers; and as for the draft it would meet with resistance almost everywhere. Under these impressions the Confederate leaders remained tranquilly on the defensive, until their error became plain. Then, to strike before those six hundred thousand men should take the field, to extinguish the forces already a-foot, and carry the war as far as practicable from their own territory, became the indispensable policy; and this general onslaught was planned, as we see it in course of execution. What is apparently an exhibition of daring enterprise, is therefore nothing more than sheer desperation -- the agonies, in fact, of dissolution. They are doomed, and they know it. The certainty of this truth should qualify thesorrows of the croaklings who see nothing but ruin for the country in the events before Washington.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBELLION AT THE LAST GASP.

"Saturday was not, as announced, the last day for the payment of bounties. It was intended to be so; but the quota of the State has been so nearly filled byvoluntary enlistments, and it was so evident the complications of the enrollment would postpone the operation of the draft for two or three weeks longer, that it was thought advisable by the authorities, both at Albany and Washington, to continue every possible inducement that would be likely to make enough men enlist to complete the new regiments and restore those now in the field to their original strength in a manner that promised the least delay. As it is, men are volunteering, and regiments are being completed faster than they can be armed and equipped. Enlistments have attained so settled and apparently certain a daily average as to make the reinforcement of the army from that source a matter of simple calculation. It was seen that if enlistments went on as prosperously as they had been doing for the past month, the different military departments would have as much as they could attend to putting them into the field, without having their hands still further burdened with the sudden exigencies of an immense conscription. It in fact became an economical question whether it would not cost less money to continue the payment of bounties in a gradual and steady stream that could be easily disbursed and managed, than to accept the pecuniary responsibilities of providing for the wants of the new levies in one overwhelming lump. In the former case the present system and appliances of the department would answer all requisite purposes; in the latter, disorder and confusion might ensue, accompanied by consequent waste. Had it, however, been in the power of the authorities to raise the quota required of them by draft immediately, arrangements would most likely have been made for trying the experiment, even though it might have been impossible to use the men thus raised at once. There have been good reasons advanced for taking such a course. But the Empire State may congratulate itself that the opportunity still remains for her to prove that she has enough patriotism to contribute her share of soldiers to the cause freely and willingly -- such of her sons as cannot shoulder a musket themselves, contributing of their substance to influence those in doing so who are able.

From early in the morning till quite late in the evening, dispatches were being received at the General's headquarters, Astor House, from various parts of the State, tendering companies and regiments for the Corcoran Brigade. For Col. MCDERMOTT's Regiment, alone, over two hundred men were enlisted yesterday, and from appearances, no doubt, the rush will continue. The war Committee, of Albany, sent in a communication offering to organize a regiment for the ""Corcoran Legion,"" and was accepted by the General. Reports were also received from Col. MCMAHON, who is now raising a regiment in Buffalo, to be called the ""Corcoran Guard,"" to the effect that his regiment is now nearly full. An invitation from the War CommitteeMayor and Common Council of Troy, asking the General to visit that city, and accept its hospitalities, was declined, on account of the numerous engagements of Gen. CORCORAN. The sum of $500 from Mr. A.M. HOYT, White-street, and $50 from an Irishman of the Seventeenth Ward, was banned in to aid enlistments for the brigade. The Sixty-ninth has now commenced recruiting in earnest, the headquarters being at the armory over Essex Market. A large number of men were enrolled yesterday, and, now that the State and United States bounties will continue to be paid, the increase of enlistments will no doubt be most marked, as the men will be enabled to leave their wives and families comfortably not amply, provided for. Authority has been received by the officers of the Sixty-ninth, permitting them to raise 1,800 men for this regiment, which authority has given great satisfaction to our Irish citizens.

He studied medicine in Philadelphia and New-York. His first services were in New-Mexico, where he was actively engaged on the field for four years, subsequently serving in Florida, at West Point, and in Kansas. He was the most intimate friend of the late Gen. LYON, with whom he served in Kansas throughout the Border-ruffian war. While in Kansas he twice accompanied Topographical Engineers to the Rocky Mountains, and was medical director of the Sioux Expedition under Gen. HARNEY. After this he visited Europe for the purpose of acquiring information relative to the arrangements of the Military Hospitals of France, England, and Germany, and also to witness the workings of the medical organizations of the various armies. He returned in 1839, and after a year's service, resigned to accept the Professorship of Anatomy and Physic in the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The wounded soldiers of the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment, who were the victims of the Baltimore riot of the 19th of April, were cared for by Dr. HAMMOND. After witnessing that scene he immediately applied to headquarters and was restored to the army as an Assistant Surgeon. Since then he has been in active service on the Staffs of Gens. PATTERSON and BANKS, having charge of the large hospitals in Hagerstown, Frederick and Baltimore, and was, at the time of his appointment to his present high position, the Medical Inspector of Camps and Hospitals in Western Virginia. During his many years of service he has written many works on scientific subjects, many of which have been translated and printed in foreign countries. He was appointed Surgeon-General of the United States Army on the 28th of April, 1862, with the rank of Brigadier-General. In stature Gen. HAMMOND is very imposing, being six feet two inches in height weighing 230 pounds, and his demeanor is that of a thorough soldier. His varied capabilities and practical knowledge of the wants of the sick and wounded, and his promptness in personally seeing that all sanitary measures are adopted throughout his department that will tend to alleviate the sufferings of our unfortunate soldiers, will be well appreciated, not only by the Government, but by the people of this country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sketch of the Life and Services of Surgeon Gen.

The United States gunboat Tuscarora had returned from Belfast Lough to Kingstown, and anchored outside the bay. The London Globe defends Earl RUSSELL's use of the phrase, ""unnecessary and injurious civil war,"" by showing that it is a citation from the President's reply to the Governors. The London Times treats the conscription as a new act of despotism, and thinks that ""involuntary servitude is now the lot of the white race"" in the United States. The News and Star continue to defend the cause of the North. It is claimed by the Paris Pays that the harvest in France is the best in ten years, and that no corn will be needed from abroad. It is said that NAPOLEON has expressed decided condemnation of GARIBALDI's movements. The embarkation of troops for Mexico had been suspended. In the Turin Senate on the 20th of August, RATAZZI, in reply to a question by a Senator, declared that the Government consider GARIBALDI in a state of rebellion, and the situation of Italy grave. GARIBALDI had entered Catania. In the London money market the funds were weaker, and the fall is attributed by the London Times to the telegrams in the extras giving the news from America. Money was in good demand at unchanged rates. The Liverpool Cotton market has been excited, with an advance of from 2d.@3d. lb. The sales for three days reached 67,000 bales. Advices from Manchester represent an excited and advancing market. The Liverpool breadstuffs market is generally firm; London upward, with a slight advance.

From this and other late indications, it would seem that the Secretary of War has surrendered the whole question of drafting into the hands of the Governors of the several States. A sort of small State-Rights battle has been waged, and Mr. STANTON retires worsted from the conflict. Each Governor appoints any day he sees fit for the commencement of drafting; the consequence is that there is an utter want of uniformity in a matter where, of all other things, uniformity is most needed. Besides, if each State Governor is to proceed on his own ""responsibility,"" what assurance is there that we shall have a draft at all. At present, we confess, the prospect is hazy.

The first efforts of our people, unaccustomed to war-making on a large scale, have given celebrity to single regiments like HAWKINS' and DURYEE'S Zouaves, the Sixty-ninth and other gallant commands; but we have had no overwhelming triumph to record of brigades and divisions, which, uniformly drilled, equipped and disciplined under the eye of a single leader, have decided the fate of battles. It is only because we are new to the business, and have been compelled hitherto to be content with instructing our soldiers in the simple movements which are always preliminary to the combined manaeuvres, that these things are so. The time for greater things, we trust, approaches nearer as we grow older in the business of warfare. But before we can do as the French and English have done, we must imitate more closely their first efforts.

She remained hovering about the coast on the lookout for Confederate vessels. She put into Kingstown with the view of getting coals. Unable to accomplish this there, partly in consequence of the return of the Ajax, she weighed anchor and steamed with all speed to Belfast Lough, where, according to a previous arrangement, she received a supply of coal amounting to a hundred tons. Having anchored outside of the jurisdiction of the Harbor Commissioners, the Collector of the Customs at once took the matter up and served a notice on the Federal captain to depart within twenty-four hours, and a revenue cutter was placed alongside of the Tuscarora to prevent further violation of the neutrality laws, and at the same time the matter was reported to the Admiralty.

POPE, it was stated, was in full retreat to Washington, while JACKSON, having chosen Edwards' Ferry as the proper point for crossing the Potomac, was already urging his march upon Maryland. Later information served to correct these rumors. The very telegraph, which always sympathizes curiously with the bear movements of Wall-street, seems to have repented at the end of an hour or two the mischief it had done in catching up and exaggerating a foolish and baseless rumor, and came halting in with corrections and explanations. It was true Gen. POPE was arranging to render his lines of communication more secure from a flank attack, and was, therefore, drawing in his army so as to rest upon the lines of Arlington; and it might have been true that JACKSON had designs upon Maryland; but the latter statement was purely a bit of street gossip, originated doubtless among the panic-makers of the Capital, and greedily gathered up and sent flying all abroad by a correspondent, whose faculty of inventing news happened at the moment to be costive. At the hour we go to press there is nothing to indicate the departure of JACKSON from the main rebel force at Bull Run. For once that active officer has been outmarched by a lying rumor. Hereafter the public will do well to receive all stories circulated immediately before and during the sessions of the Stock Exchange with great caution.

Invaded by Colombia Reactionary Party troops,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/04/archives/ecuador.html,Invaded by Colombia Reactionary Party troops,"I wrote you, a month since, that the troops of Gen. ARBOLEDA, the leader of the reactionary party in the State of Cauca, in the new Republic of the United States of Colombia, formerly known as New-Granada, had entered on the territory of Ecuador in pursuit of some Mosqueristas, who had sought refuge over the frontier at Pasto, and when ordered off, had killed or badly wounded, an Ecuadorian officer. For this act, you already know, the President of Ecuador, Senor GARCIA MORENO, had demanded the dismission of the Colonel who commanded ARBOLEDA's troops, and also an indemnity of $100,000. This having been refused, the Province of Pasto was invaded by MORENO, it is said by 2,500 men, but it could scarcely have been by so many. A private letter from Guayaquil says that ""ARBOLEDA, who was at Popayan, the capital of the State of Cauca, having heard of this invasion, marched immediately into Pasto, and on the 30th of July, in the vicinity of Tulcan, found himself in front of the Ecuatorian force. On the 31st, at 10 in the morning, he commenced to man�uvre, and outflanking the Ecuaorians, made a bayonet charge upon them with a part of his force in solid columns, and was received by a shower of balls from six pieces of cannon. At this moment Gen. ZARAMA, whose division had succeeded in flanking the Ecuatorians, advanced upon them, the two parties completely encircling them, President MORENO, 'who performed prodigies of valor.' was taken prisoner, as also did the Commandant General and Secretary of War, Senor DANIEL SALVADOR. Thirteen hundred prisoners also fell into the hands of ARBOLEDA, including nearly all the Ecuadorian officers. Seventeen hundred muskets and seven pieces of cannon also fell into ARBOLEDA's hands.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ECUADOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ECUADOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Ecuador', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/943b7346-cab5-5931-98bf-a2a4a9e86384,593,nyt://article/943b7346-cab5-5931-98bf-a2a4a9e86384

Very little evidence tending to throw light upon the dark mystery was elicited yesterday. Several witnesses were examined, among them Mrs. JOHNSON, the proprietor of the house, where the body was found. She testified that the deceased was sent to her house by Dr. Cox; that she had previously made an arrangement with him to take a lady who was coming from the country to be nursed, and she supposed it was this country lady, until deceased had been in her house for several hours. The burial certincate, which was given by Dr. SHERRILL, states that the deceased died of inflamation of the bowels. The post-mortem examination, made by Dr. ROBINSON, Deputy Coroner, shows that she died from a very different cause. The inquest will be resumed at 9 o'clock, this morning, when it is believed that some very startling evidence will be given. Coroner NAUMANN, aided by the Police, has been engaged in working up the case, and ail believe that there is evidence enough to convict some of the parties who have been apprehended.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db311e7c-a899-5c26-a193-3c64a5f74f6e,884,nyt://article/db311e7c-a899-5c26-a193-3c64a5f74f6e

The following verdict was rendered by the Jury: ""We find that the deceased, CATHARINE GALETZKIE, came to her death by metro peritonitis, supervening upon abortion; and we believe, as far as the evidence elicited, that Dr. COX is instrumental in producing the abortion; and we censure Dr. SHERRILL for neglect of duty as a physician, in giving a certificate of death for inflammation of the bowels, and in secreting the fact of deceased having had a miscarriage."" Upon the rendition of this verdict, Dr. COX was brought up for examination but by the advice of his counsel, Mr. C.S. SPENCER, he refused to answer the questions put to him by Coroner NAUMANN, except those as to his name, age and occupation. He was thereupon conveyed to the Tombs to await the action of the Grand Jury. Dr. SHERRILL, Mrs. JOHNSON, who kept the house in Thirteenth-street where Mrs. GALETZKIE died, also a servant of the latter, and Mrs. TRUEHEART were detained as witnesses in the case, and sent to the house of Detention.

This is a gratifying turn of affairs. When an individual is afflicted with a monomania, there is nothing so desirable as a good distraction; and the same law holds with nations. Now, the American question had come to be a positive mania with the European Governments. No doubt they have a serious interest in it; doubtless, the commercial disturbance which it produces causes them a certain amount of real suffering; but they are not half as much interested in it as they imagine, or at least not in the way they imagine, and not a tithe of the evils which they trace to this cause are justly chargeable thereto. The fact is, there is a not inconsiderable element of hallucination in their notions of the American war. They have talked and written, plotted and diplomatized, so much about it that they can see nothing else; and then it is for these Governments, so convenient a horse on which to place all sorts of burdens, that they are not disposed to see anything else. The troubles in Italy will call off their attention from the all-absorbing subject.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Italian Question a New Bar to Intervention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Italian Question a New Bar to Intervention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-09-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56074155-f1f4-5e2f-8041-ce2126a24a48,541,nyt://article/56074155-f1f4-5e2f-8041-ce2126a24a48

"Editorial sees Confederates planning attacks in Ohio, western Pennsylvania and elsewhere while Union forces concentrate around Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/05/archives/editorial-article-1-no-title.html,"Editorial sees Confederates planning attacks in Ohio, western Pennsylvania and elsewhere while Union forces concentrate around Washington","with treason scattered throughout the country affords them unlimited facilities for this sort of deception; and whether the exigency demands that the rebel force should be exaggerated or depreciated, or that its location and projects should be stated fairly or falsely, the agents of the rebellion find no difficulty in producing the required impression upon the public mind. No better illustration of this fact is needed than their ability to hold Manassas for eight months with 40,000 men, while not only the people at large, but the leaders of the National army were made to believe that a force four times that strength were latent behind those formidable intrenchments. An instance of more recent date is notable in the rumor of Stonewall JACKSON advancing upon Maryland by way of Edwards' Ferry -- a rumor calculated to produce the profoundest alarm in the North and no doubt designed to weaken the force in front of Washington by causing the dispatch of two or three divisions to defeat the pretended movement of the rebels. Of the same character, in all probability, is the present reiterated declaration of an intention to surround and capture Washington, and dictate conditions of peace in the White House. It is doubtless the mask of a possible, and probably effective blow to be stricken in some other quarter. Washington, surrounded as it is by magnificent works, and filled with 150,000 men, is impregnable to any force that can lay siege to it, unless indeed the Union commanders play false, and surrender without a contest. The gunboats patrol the river, rendering a crossing impossible any where below the Lower Falls of the Potomac; while higher up a crossing would be hazardous in the extreme, seeing the liability of a retreat being cut off; and ineffectual, because Washington is fortified and guarded on the eastern as well as on the western side. Equally absurd is a proposition to surround the capital, cut off the railroads and telegraphic wires, and starve out its garrison; for not only is a second blockade of the Potomac impossible in the presence of our iron-clads, but a diffusion of the rebel squadrons around the long circuit of the fortifications would expose them to certain destruction, for the besieged would have no difficulty in cutting off the entire investing force in detail. Washington is threatened, and must, therefore, be defended. But we have no idea that it is the immediate object of the rebel operations. From the experience, long and lamentable, we have had of rebel strategy, we may expect to find a blow struck in some quarter where a deluded people least expect to receive it. The conjuror always diverts the attention of his rustic audience from the method of the immediate wonder he is achieving by some more striking and attractive by-play. The rebels have caught the trick, and we are the constant victims. It is quite possible that while every eye is fixed upon Washington, the rebels may have their attention riveted upon a line of operations four hundred miles away. In fact, the plan of severing the Western from the Eastern States, by the occupation of the Ohio and Pennsylvania frontier, has been a favorite idea with leading Southern papers, and has possibly found favor with the insurgent leaders. The Alleghanies would furnish a safe basis of operations; the exuberant granaries of the two great States would feed the starved army, weary of half rations of salt pork and corn-bread; Pittsburgh with its shops and founderies would replenish their stock of cannon, arms and munitions, and send mailed iron boats and rams to recover the Ohio and the Mississippi. And the rebel ken may extend yet further. If from the river to the lake the line of rebel troops be drawn impenetrably, they may calculate upon opening negotiations with the Northwest, with a view to a union of the latter with the States of the Lower Mississippi, in preference to its present connection with the East. They may argue that, weary of an unpopular and hopeless contest, and stripped of all confidence in the Washington Government, the Northwest may listen to terms heretofore scorned, for the bribe of freely navigating the Mississippi, and an indefinite promise of gradual emancipation, yielding to the offered alliance as an only escape from the evils of war and the burdens of National taxation. With the probable upshot of such diplomacy we have nothing to do. It is enough that such dreams have been thought worthy of grave discussion at the South, and may reinforce other arguments for an occupation of the region we have referred to. If in the course of a few days we hear of the enemy showing himself along the Upper Potomac; seizing the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and gradually withdrawing the army before Washington to the shelter of the Blue Ridge, we may be assured the scheme mentioned is in a fair way to realization. Indeed, if we are not greatly mistaken, the advance of KIRBY SMITH and HUMPHREY MARSHALL through Kentucky; the rumored presence of BRAGG with a considerable force in Western Virginia, intending to reach the Ohio by descending the Kanawha; the cavalry demonstrations at Buckhannon and near Philippi, close to the Pennsylvania line, are all indications of a purpose to seize, hold and occupy Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ac136791-ed0e-5d1e-b907-cd5dbe59df9f,991,nyt://article/ac136791-ed0e-5d1e-b907-cd5dbe59df9f

Editorial on US Sen. Simmons resignation; Editorial on resignation of Rhode Island Sen. Simmons,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/06/archives/a-trading-senator-resigned.html,Editorial on US Sen. Simmons resignation; Editorial on resignation of Rhode Island Sen. Simmons,"-- Senator SIMMONS, of Rhode Island, has had virtue enough to do voluntarily that which the United States Senate had not virtue enough to compel him to do -- vacate his seat in the Senate. Nominally, at least, he resigned his position, though we judge that the pressure brought to bear upon him by the public sentiment of his own State, since he got home, was so strong as to make his resignation partake of the nature of at least moral compulsion. From the astounding confessions of personal corruption which he made at the last session of Congress, and from the fact that he confessed he could see no harm in the downright bribery he owned to, it is clear that neither his conscience nor his sense of propriety had anything to do with the matter. It has been purely the result of local and national opinion, and of the universal disgust expressed at his course by the Press. It was said, after the adjournment of last session, that the reason the Senate refused to expel him, after his confessions of corrupt conduct, was that he had threatened to make exposures in many other Senators' cases, which would be far more infamous than those he made in his own. In this view, we may have lost something by his resignation; for though details of Governmental corruption, yet there is nothing more essential to public well-being than that Congressional knavery be exposed. Mr. SIMMON's term only lasted till the 4th of March next; but we are glad that for over the brief Winter session an honest man will occupy his seat. After that time, the noblest of all Rhode Island's modern sons, GOV. SPRAGUE, will adorn the place in the Senate which SIMMONS has disgraced.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A TRADING SENATOR RESIGNED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A TRADING SENATOR RESIGNED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Rhode Island', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'CONGRESS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-09-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/130d4eac-51e0-5eb0-a5d9-64660c526e3e,294,nyt://article/130d4eac-51e0-5eb0-a5d9-64660c526e3e

The only possible justification that can be presented for this gross violation of international comity, is the fact that the British authorities some months ago decided that the vessels of both belligerents should be excluded from British ports. This was a most oppressive stretch of the rights of neutrals, as what would fall lightly on the insignificant marine of the rebels must necessarily be fell most severely by our numerous and widespread navy.

They would gladly see our troubles at an end, and all the States reunited under the old flag. They detect the principle of secession, and cleave to that of undivided nationality.

Judge Advocate General ANTHON expects to have the enrollment of the names of persons liable to the draft in this City and Brooklyn finished by Tuesday.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/06/archives/military-movements-in-the-city-enrolling-for-the-draft-judge.html,,"Judge Advocate General ANTHON expects to have the enrollment of the names of persons liable to the draft in this City and Brooklyn finished by Tuesday. His enrolling officers have already obtained the names of more persons than it was thought the population of the two cities would have yielded; but this the Judge-Advocate accounts for by supposing either that the last census was deficient or that since the census was made there has been a great influx of new residents. Instead of this City having only 800,000 inhabitants, it is found to held close upon 1,000,000. The arrangements made by the Judge-Advocate for quietly and efficiently executing the arduous duty devolved upon him have proved his possession of high administrative ability, tact and shrewdness. No better system for achieving the object intended could have been devised. The enrollment, when done, will be seen to be more comprehensive and complete, than any one could have anticipated. There will be far fewer evasions of it than are generally calculated upon; and portions of it have been framed in such a way, as to insure a much more equitable, and satisfactory enforcement of the draft man has heretofore been deemed likely or possible. Very little trouble is now experienced by the emolling officers in the course of their rather disagreeable duties. The stringent measures taken with people who tried to be obstinate and awkward, when the enrollment first began, have had a salutary effect, and saved a great deal of subsequent trouble. The speedy detection, too, and punishment of the enrolling officer who was discovered taking bribes for omitting the names of persons in his district, has been a warming to his fellows, and no evidence of further corruption has comt to light. The Enrollment Police (whose business it is to follow the enrollment officers, and find out if efforts have been made to deceive them in the way of names, ages and addresses) are a faithful, energetic body of men, and have performed good service. The force of clerks employed by Gen. ANTHON number about 50. Some thought was entertained of putting on an extra night relay of 25, but it was found that progress was little expedited by the results of this nocturnal pressure. Well regulated day work is more reliable and efficacious. Yesterday, Bedloe's Island was visited by the enrolling officers. To-day, Wall-street will be canvassed. It is intended to take the names of resident porters in that locality to commence with. Then those of clerks, bookkeepers and others will be ascertained, and a comparison instituted between the names and addresses given from their places of business and those given in the parts of this City and Brooklyn where they live. This is one of the many checks against fraud which the cowardly or unpatriotic will find it hard to get over. How any one can escape all the cunning devices applied to prevent the evasion of his duty to his country of every able-bodied man. would seem a mystery. As an instance of how perfect are the meshes and how wide-spread the ramifications, of the great enrollment net that Gen. ANTHON has cast over the community, may be mentioned the statement of a well known citizen, who says he has a store down town, not very far from the Post-office, a store in one street up town, a wholesale factory up town, in another street, and a private residence up town in still a third street. Every one of these places is in a different district; and yet in each district his name has been obtained with full and true particulars concerning him to the remotest necessary detail. A fish here and there will slip through the net no doubt, but, in face of all the precautions taken, not very many.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Military Movements in the City.; ENROLLING FOR THE DRAFT JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S OFFICE PAYMENT OF BOUNTIES.

Smith invasion of Kentucky failed because citizens remained loyal to Union,"The condition of things in Kentucky is beginning to be more clearly seen, and matters have a more hopeful look. It is evident that the rebels have again counted on a general rising of Secessionists in Kentucky and been disappointed. Gen. KIRBY SMITH, in his present invasion, went through the same form of issuing a ""proclamation"" to Kentuckians that SIMON BOLIVAR BUCKNER did when he occupied Bowling Green one year ago, and that MORGAN did in his recent raids. Gen. KIRBY SMITH said to the Kentuckians: ""Let no one make you believe we come as invaders to coerce your will or to exercise control over your soil. Far from it. The principle we maintain is, that Government derives its first powers from the consent of the governed. * * I shall enforce the strictest discipline, in order that the property of citizens and non-combatants may be protected. I shall be compelled to procure subsistence for my troops among you, and this shall be paid for. Kentuckians, we come not as invaders, but as liberators.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""KIRBY SMITH'S INVASION A FAILURE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""KIRBY SMITH'S INVASION A FAILURE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76862977-4ef2-5ab3-9d85-d20525145238,279,nyt://article/76862977-4ef2-5ab3-9d85-d20525145238

Now that the purchase has been dearly made, it is to be hoped that people may be willing to profit by it. It is true that the democratic character of our society is in some respects unfavorable to the relation which should exist between officer and soldier, and the circumstance affords an additional reason for seeking in the selection of officers those personal characteristics which, in such a society, are the proper substitutes for distinctions of caste.

"A dispatch that has passed the scrutiny of the Government censor comes from Washington, through Philadelphia, to the effect that Gen. POPE has been relieved of his command; and the meaning of the remainder of the telegram we suppose to be that he has demanded a court of inquiry into the causes of the disasters which befell the army while recently under his orders. It is the best thing he could do, and we trust the statement is true. At and since the battle of Cedar Mountain his military management has been so extremely bad that even half-blind civilians could not fail to comprehend its stupidity and atrocity. There need neither be criticism nor argument about it so far as the public and the great body of the army are concerned.

editorial laments Confederate seizure of Frederick,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/08/archives/the-rebel-invasion-of-maryland.html,editorial laments Confederate seizure of Frederick,"The seizure of Frederick, the Capital of Maryland, by the rebel army, which to the shame of our military authorities, is on record to-day, inaugurates the rebel invasion of the loyal States. The programme opens audaciously, and it is not difficult to conceive what is intended to be the next step. The rebels have a way of carrying out military movements to their logical conclusion, which, unhappily, our Generals have never possessed. From Frederick, by the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, which they command, they are within striking distance of Baltimore. This they will undoubtedly aim to seize, and if they succeed they will really have such a tourniquet round our necks as the London Times said the capture of New-Orleans would be in the case of the rebel cause. They there tap the great artery leading from the whole system of the loyal States to their heart in Washington. By holding Baltimore they completely cut off communication with the Capital, and thus prevent the forwarding of reinforcements on whose forthgoing our entire national safety depends. It is a brilliantly audacious scheme, and is worth any sacrifice if it should prove even temporarily successful. That the success will be anything more than temporary, we, of course, do not dream. So far the rebels have but a few thousand men in Maryland; and a force sufficient to grind them to powder can immediately be hurled upon them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Invasion of Maryland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Invasion of Maryland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c43da8c3-4fe1-5a45-ba56-82bfbcf931c0,235,nyt://article/c43da8c3-4fe1-5a45-ba56-82bfbcf931c0

TAYLOR, who died recently at Alexandria, of wounds received in battle, was born near Clinton, Hunterdon County, N.J. He was a cadet in the Military School of Col. ALLEN PARTRIDGE, in Connecticut, until he was eighteen years of age and then entered the navy as a Midshipman. After making several cruises he resigned his commission and returned home from the Mediteranean, where he was serving. Family troubles were the cause of this step, and immediately on reaching home hie made it his business to seek out the author of his difficulties and administered him severe personal chastisement. He raised a company of Volunteers for the Mexican war and acted as their captain, and upon the outbreak of the present rebellion, was named Colonel of the Third New-Jersey Regiment. This regiment was in the reserve at the battle of Bull Run, and did good service in attempting to check the rout of the National forces. In the reorganization of the army, he was made Brigadier-Greneral, and in this capacity did good service on the Peninsula.

"Very full details of the rebel movement into Maryland, and their operations in Frederick and vicinity, will be found in our special correspondence and dispatches this morning. They do not differ in the facts from the accounts which have already been published. The Government authorities received the news of the invasion on Saturday evening, in documentary form, and during that night and Sunday, immense bodies of our troops were put in motion for the Upper Potomac and elsewhere.

The rebels appear to have captured no Government stores whatever at Frederick. All the National forces stationed there fell back to Harper's Ferry, but before doing so destroyed all the hospital and commissary stores they could not remove, and took away with them the sick and wounded. Communication with Harper's Ferry is of course cut off by the rebels, but there is no danger of the National force there being starved out, as has been feared, so long as they can receive supplies from the West over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which the recent skirmish at Martinsburgh indicates is still in our possession in that direction. It appears to be doubtful whether the rebels intend to make a movement on Harper's Ferry. With the Maryland Heights in our possession, such a movement could hardly be successful, unless in overwhelming numbers. It appears more probable that they contemplate a raid into Pennsylvania, by way of Hagerstown; a direct march upon Washington, or an attack upon Baltimore. At any rate, there is no doubt of their presence in the State in heavy force.

When the Governor issued his proclamation, offering on behalf of the State to any volunteer an additional bounty of [???] at the same time appointed special disbursing and inspecting officers, whose duty it should be to authorize and effect its payment. The inspecting officer for this City was a Dr. THOMSON, without a certificate of health and physical soundness from whom no recruit could claim, or, at any rate, obtain his money. But, before passing the ordeal of inspection from Dr. THOMSON, the recruit had to be examined and passed by other doctors, appointed by the War Department, to see that none but able-bodied men received the bounty offered by the United States. It would naturally be thought that one inspection by a competent medical man would be sufficient for all useful purposes: but it seems there is a sort of irrepressible conflict between the respective authorities of State and nation, and that their respective dignities demanded the exercise of separate and independent jurisdiction. Heretofore this condition of affairs has been productive of incipient trouble; but actual conflict was avoided up to yesterday, when things came to a crisis, the doctors openly quarrelled and the country had in consequence to suffer from the temporary stoppage of enlistments. Of course each casts the blame upon the other, and, of course also, there must be more or less of blame attaching to both. It seems that the United States Doctors pass the men first, whereupon they are sworn, in by the mustering officer, and are, to all intents and purposes, regularly enlisted soldiers, beyond the chance of escape, and liable to punishment for desertion or mutiny if they revolt or run away. The only bounty they are so far entitled to, however, amounts to $29. To get the other bounties ($100 now -- $50 State and $50 City) -- they must satisfy the further critical judgment of Dr. THOMSON. Dr. THOMSON appears to be hard to please. Certificates signed by Dr. MOTT, Dr. GAHAN, or Dr. KERRIGAN, are not with him conclusive evidence of a recruit's fitness. He must see for himself, and is not to be deterred by feelings of professional courtesy from differing with the other Doctors in opinion. On several occasions he has thus differed with them, and declined to grant a certificate entitling the recruit to the State and City bounties. This is mortifying to the United States Surgeons; but is especially hard on the unfortunate recruit. Dr. THOMSON's rejection of him does not discharge him from the service; it only deprives him of $100. Very reasonably he feels himself swindled and outraged, and from that moment his mind is made up to desert. To remedy the matter. Col. REEVES, U.S.A., the chief mustering and disbursing officer here for the War Department, issued an order requiring recruits to pass through Dr. THOMSON's hands first, as his (Dr. THOMSON's) approval did not make soldiers of them, and no harm would follow if they were afterward rejected by the other doctors. This arrangement did not suit Dr. THOMSON, WHO issued a counter proclamation, refusing to have anything to do with recruits that had not been mustered into the United States service before they were brought to him. The result of all this bickering antagonism is that, yesterday afternoon, no men could be passed at all. Both offices were crowded for hours with Captains and Lieutenants and the recruits they had been procuring; but, between the two orders, enlistments fell to the ground. It is a scandalous and objectionable piece of business altogether, and should somehow be settled very speedily. The country's emergency is too serious to permit of such consideration being shown to mere personal self-esteem or obstinacy. It is recruits that are wanted, and no one cares by whom they are inspected, so long as it is known that the duty is assigned to a capable medical man.

HURLBERT, formerly of this city, and well known as a literary man and an attache of the New-York Press. Mr. HURLBERT went to Richmond from the North about the time that the Confederate Government was removed there from Montgomery; and until he left that city, a week or two ago, he was in constant and close observation of the civil and military operations of the Rebel Government. Of the movements of affairs, and of many of those things which have appeared inexplicable and mysterious, he has had an inside view; while of the private opinions and designs of the rebel leaders, as well as of the past and present condition of Southern sentiment and Southern affairs, he has a more ac curate knowledge than is possessed by any one who has yet undertaken to enlighten the public on these topics. His sketches will, of course, be as different as is possible, from the mass of undigested rubbish we have had in the newspaper, professing to give the result of personal observation on events in the South. They are the work of one accustomed to observe affairs as wall as to philosophize upon them; and who, in his former writings, has shown himself possessed of an unsurpassed brilliancy of style and vigor of diction. They will be the first glimpse the public has had behind the scenes of the great Secession rebellion; and as such will be appreciated by the readers of the TIMES.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INSIDE VIEW OF THE REBELLION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INSIDE VIEW OF THE REBELLION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/556ec7a7-107d-5390-8322-6e9b6b521550,273,nyt://article/556ec7a7-107d-5390-8322-6e9b6b521550

For instance, they gain prestige in having transferred the war from their own soil to ours. They gain subsistence in the capture of commissary stores at the various Union posts they have occupied, and in foraging on the farmers wherever they march. If they fail therefore, to take Baltimore, or Washington or Harrisburgh, or Philadelphia, but retreat now to the south bank of the Potomac as expeditiously as they came, they will, nevertheless, have inflicted a burning disgrace on the Union cause.

And when she comes the country may as well prepare to hear of some startling news. The announcement which the naval authorities kindly send us from Fortress Monroe, to the effect that they are ""ready for her,"" is an assurance which has small value. We have not so much fear for the shipping in Hampton Roads -- for that can be brought under protection of the guns of the Fortress or retired to shoal water. But there are several directions in which a vessel of the formidable character which the Merrimac No. 2 is said to present, is capable of doing us infinite damage. Most of cut iron-clads, which alone can pretend to encounter her, have been removed to the Potomac, and the whole Southern coast is clear for her to descend in a destroying avalanche on our blockading vessels. Instead of putting herself in the way of our Monitors and Galenas, she will probably go down in a raid of this kind -- and looking along the line of what it is possible for her to do, we can scarcely see power to cause us.

But it was the hope and belief of the country that the arrangements of the Confederate leaders had been such as would have completely failed that plan.

In responding to the toast of ""The Health of the City Member,"" Mr. LAWSON said he was afraid not much had been done for the public good in the late session. Lord PALMERSTON had told the people at Dover that the session was quite remarkable for the number of public benefits enacted, but with that tact for which he was celebrated, the noble lord had taken good care not to enumerate them. [Laughter.] After referring to some of the measures which had been before Parliament, Mr. LAWSON alluded to the prevailing distress. He said: We feel that distress in Carlisle, through I do not know that it is yet so bad as in some parts of Lancashire; but I know it is very great. It behooves us all to do what we can for the relief of that distress; but I do not know that much can be done in the way of legislation. A bill has been passed in meet the difficulty, and I trust it will have the intended effect. The cause of that distress we all know, is the sad state of affairs in American. What are the causes of that war -- that fratricidal war, or who is to blame, are not topics on which we can properly descant at present. There are different opinions on the subject -- some think one right and some think the other right -- and we can hardly discuss it without becoming partisans. I can only say that I saw with very deep regret, the speech made by an honorable member of the House of Commons a short time since, in which he said he positively rejoiced at the war in America. I did not think such a sentiment could be uttered by any Englishman. [Cheers.] I am sure I only utter the sentiment of every one here when I say that we deeply grieve that state of things and hope and trust it may soon be brought to a termination, so that peace may reign again on the other side of the Atlantic, and our own suffering population may again have a return of prosperity.

A number of gentlemen who participated in the engagement reached this city last evening, but they know absolutely nothing, except that our army had achieved a great victory on the same ground on which it was before victorious on July 21, 1861. They know neither our loss nor the enemy's; the number of prisoners captured by us, nor the route of the enemy's retreat. The most of them say in vague terms that the enemy fled before our men toward Alexandria, or Arlington Heights, or Leesburgh, they don't know which, and they can give no explanation of how he effected a retreat in this direction, our lines being confidently asserted to have extended across all the roads leading to Washington, from Union Mills to Thoroughfare Gap. Some, however, maintain that the enemy retreated through Centreville. If this be true, he must have broke through LONGSTREET's lines on the Warrenton turnpike. But all of LONGSTREET's men with whom we have conversed assert that the enemy, so far from breaking our lines, was driven back a distance of two miles. From all we have been able to learn we think it most likely that the enemy, during Saturday night, escaped toward Alexandria by passing to the east of JACKSON's extreme left. If, in the fight of Saturday, we drove him before us, as there seems little doubt that we did, and there has been no subsequent fight, there were but two ways by which he could have passed our army -- by hugging the Potomac on JACKSON's left, or passing clear around our army by a detour to the westward. But with our present scant information, the discussion of this subject is profitless indeed.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM THE REBEL ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM THE REBEL ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Richmond Examiner', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e7ca170-1430-5c57-9136-d94495499edb,855,nyt://article/9e7ca170-1430-5c57-9136-d94495499edb

",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/10/archives/ihe-english-press-on-american-affairs-mr-russell-on-mcclellans.html,,"""Thus far,"" writes Gen. GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN -- page 8 of his Military Commission to Europe -- ""the allied Generals displayed none of the qualities of great commanders -- their measures were half-way measures, slow and blundering -- they failed to keep constantly in view the object of the expedition, and to press rapidly and unceasingly toward it."" This criticism refers to the period when, on the 27th of September, the allied Generals had got to Sebastopol, having landed their armies on an open beach on the 14th of September, fought and defeated the enemy at the Alma, sent their sick and wounded away, buried their dead, and taken up a position never afterward abandoned till their object was achieved. ""Although (he says, page 5) fully aware that it is much easier to criticise operations alter the result is known than to dirrect them at the time, I shall not hesitate to invite attention to what appear the evident mistakes on either side. This not for the purpose of finding fault or of instituting comparisons,"" (though the very next sentence contains a comparison between the petty operation of landing near Vera Cruz and the disembarcation of the Allies in the [???]) ""but with the hope that it may serve to draw its intention of our officers to the same [???] perhaps, assist in [???] similar [???] own part hereafter."" It is almost cruel to the young officer to proceed with these quotations, and we shall only add one more: ""If a deficiency of men and means is assigned as a reason for the early operations of the Allies, it is but another proof that in undertaking this affair they neglected one of the clearest rules of war -- that is, to undertake no important operation without full and reliable information as to the obstacles to be overcome, and the means of resistance in the hands of the enemy."" ""We cannot afford,"" he says, ""a Moscow campaign."" How little, when he wrote these lines in January, 1857, did the American officer imagine that he should be at the head of an enormous army levied for the purpose of invading a State once incorporated in the country he served, and of destroying the city in which his enemies, once his countrymen, were assembled to defend their homes and their liberties! The deductions he draws from his observations in the crimes are applied to the effect of a foreign invasion or the United States, and he remarks that, though a small army could he crushed by the superior numbers of the people, a force of 100,000 disciplined men would be quite invincible, because the multitude brought to bear against them work their own destruction, for ""if without discipline and instruction they cannot be handled, and are in their own way."" There is a sort of analogy between Sebastopol and Richmond. Neither Williamsburgh nor White Oaks was quite equal in results to the Alma, it is true, but the covering force was obliged to retire. The enemy blocked up the water entrance to their city; the Federals command the sea, as the Allies did, and they have not been able to force the water batteries. The Confederates are said to be as strong as the Eussians were. Their Gortschakoff is in the field outside. The Federals, too, have been attacked on their right before the place. Are they quite as proud of their Inkerman? Does Gen. McCLELLAN stand the test of his strictures on those who were in a position somewhat like his own? We make the Americans a present of the comparison. The latest news we have from his army is, that it is moving somewhere or other, having made a fiasco in the advance to Malvern Hill. MCCLELLAN has now been more than a month in his place of refuge at Harrison's Landing. At last he ""prepared for a great battle."" On Tuesday, Aug. 5, he moved out and took possession of Malvern Hill, and sent back for the greater part of his army, but the messengers took the wrong road and the troops did not come up till it was too late. ""The enemy were not asleep,"" but came out in force. Gen. McCLELLAN went back to his camps again, and the Confederates took possession of Malvern hill, and are, we suppose, there now. All that comes from the Federal army, is the same intelligence of great sickness, aggravated by intense heat, and certified by boat loads of sick soldiers, and promises of something going to happen. We must wait with patience for the march of events, which move more rapidly than the Federal arms, as it is nearly always the case that the initiative is taken by the Confederates.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Ihe English Press on American Affairs.; MR.

We earn from our correspondent at Harper's Ferry that none of the horde has made its appearance in the neighborhood of that cardinal position; a circumstance indicating that for the present, at least, the advance into Western Pennsylvania is postponed. On the east, Gen. MCCLELLAN has occupied Barnesville, in the immediate neighborhood of the Monocacy, not far from the point where that stream pours into the Potomac. An advance toward Washington and Baltimore is thus pretty effectually barred; and alarm about the instant and urgent danger of those two capitals reasonably quieted. The rebel strength appears for the moment to be concentrated between the Catoctin and the Monocacy. At the head of the ridge dividing the two creeks the advance of the invading army has already shown itself, no further than eight miles distant from the Pennsylvania line; while to the right of this column, raids and demonstrations push hourly nearer the railroad connecting Philadelphia with Baltimore. Whatever may be the ultimate meaning of the rebel movements, it suffices for the present to know that Central Pennsylvania, with the capital of the Commonwealth, are threatened on the one hand, while there is great danger of the rebels getting to Havre de Grace, where the indispensable line of communications between Washington and the North may most conveniently be severed. In short, having cut off Washington from direct intercourse with the West by seizing the Baltimore and Ohio road, the next step has been to possess themselves of other lines of communication with the loyal States. There were but two of these, the Northern Central and the Philadelphia and Baltimore lines. The Northern Central is already in their hands. We are at present unadvised of any steps on the part of the National Government to save the only remaining line, that through Philadelphia, from a similar appropriation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Task in Maryland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Task in Maryland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19da6a21-d1de-5b52-a3c5-678fe7e45d9d,567,nyt://article/19da6a21-d1de-5b52-a3c5-678fe7e45d9d

Editorial deplores military officers becoming politicians; says their sole objective should be to defeat enemy,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/11/archives/military-politicians.html,Editorial deplores military officers becoming politicians; says their sole objective should be to defeat enemy,"The worst result of incapacity on the part of the civil authority in times of peril and disaster such as now beset our country, is the hasty and desperate resort to military leaders for counsel and command, which such incapacity is almost sure to breed. The experience of the world is full of instances of national ruin thus precipitated, and although we have no positive fear of any similar catastrophe as impending directly upon ourselves, still we think it well to note the least beginnings of evil in this as in all other directions. What policy the Government of the Union shall pursue in dealing finally with the great rebellion, is still a legitimate matter of discussion for loyal men who are determined only that suppressed the rebellion shall be, and if it shall appear on grave and full consideration, that the life of the nation can only be preserved by the death of Slavery, he is a traitor double-dyed who would oppose the exhibition of the decisive remedy, be its operation never so painful and never so stern. It is necessary, therefore, for us to call the attention of the loyal public to the insidious efforts which are making in certain quarters to create a sort of vague and passionate public feeling in favor of the usurpation by ""Constitutional"" Generals of absolute control over the issues of this war. Hints have been recently thrown out in one and another quarter, of the ""determination"" which is said to exist in ""military quarters"" to assume the control of public affairs rather than permit that control to pass into the hands of ""Abolition schemers,"" the said ""schemers,"" so far as we can understand, being the legally constituted political representatives of sundry loyal States of the Union. This talk may be idle -- it is certainly dangerous and disgraceful, so far as it means or can mean anything at all. The military arm of the Republic is its arm and not its head. The final voice upon the policy of the great struggle we are making rests with the people and their representatives. It cannot and it shall not be taken from them by any clique whatever, be that clique Executive or Military. The people of the United States intend to be victorious in this war upon which they have staked such tremendous values of treasure and of life. They intend to preserve not only the present unity, but the self-respect, the liberty, and the future of the nation, and they intend to preserve these, at whatevar cost to local institutions and provincial passions. From the rank and file of the National Army they have no fears. These men are blood of their blood, and one flesh with them. But if (which we by no means yet believe) there exist among the accidental leaders of the army any disposition to mistake the objects of their commission, any delusion as to the power vested in them, and any tendency to believe that the American people of the Free States will accept a military settlement of their score with the rebellion, patched up without reference to the convictions of any great section of the Free States, it will be well for the victims of so perilous a hallucination to emancipate themselves at once from its fatal sway. We have had enough of the cobbler transgressing his last. We have suffered enough from politicians assuming to be Generals. We have not so much patience left as will tolerate experiments of State made by Generals turned politicians. Our commanders in the field have one plain duty to do -- to find and beat the armies of the rebellion. They have not done this work yet so handsomely that we can afford to spare them for new exertions in another quarter. And when they shall have done it, the issues of victory, we beg leave emphatically to say, will remain to be controlled by the people themselves, and by the explicit delegates of their explicit will.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Military Politicians.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Military Politicians.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38bcbdc3-b9e8-543b-91d6-f7e6f2248a52,668,nyt://article/38bcbdc3-b9e8-543b-91d6-f7e6f2248a52

Editorial on views of French newspaper Paris Moniteur,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/12/archives/the-french-official-organ-and-the.html,Editorial on views of French newspaper Paris Moniteur,"AMERICAN QUESTION. -- The Paris Moniteur has been for some time past publishing a series of letters concerning military operations in the United States, written by a man evidently conversant with his subject. These letters, which have attracted a great deal of attention, have been reproduced by the majority of the French newspapers at Paris and in the provinces. Lately, however, a partiality for the North, which was at first perceptible in these comments, disappeared. The South gradually gained ground in the mind of the writer, and soon his correspondence clearly indicated a change of views and sentiments, which, owing to the official character of the paper in which they were inserted, affected more or less the other organs of the Press. In one of its latest issues, the Moniteur, as if it wanted to remove all doubts about its conversion, translated and indorsed an article in the London Times, in which that paper advises Mr. LINCOLN to give up the prosecution of the present war, and to make peace with the South. These various symptomshave been interpreted by the Secessionists and their friends as a tendency on the part of the French Government to favor their cause, and as preliminary to the recognition of the Southern Confederacy. It will require a few weeks to determine how nearly correct this impression may be.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRENCH OFFICIAL ORGAN AND THE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRENCH OFFICIAL ORGAN AND THE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29fb0427-eb2c-51fd-8261-6887e1caa9e3,223,nyt://article/29fb0427-eb2c-51fd-8261-6887e1caa9e3

Patten and Capt. Slate at the wickets, who were not out, and well in for 38 runs on the previous evening. The play was opened with great spirit on both sides, the fielding being sharp, and the bowling of Creighton -- underhand -- and Sadler -- round-arm -- quite effective, while H. Wright kept wicked; the result was that the change of bowling and ill lack on the part of some of the officers together with some fine catches by the fielders, brought the innings to a close for 84 runs. In Lieut. Patten's 27 were three 4s, a 2 and singles, well got. Capt. Slade's 23 comprised a 4, three 3s a 2 and singles, in obtaining which some very fine play was shown. Capt. Phillips played well for a 2 and three singles, and Capt. Beresfords 6 were got by a 2 and 4; the rest did nothing. Sadler's 5 wickets were obtained at an expenditure of 60 balls for 21 runs; Creighton's, 5 wickets for 60 balls and 16 runs. The United States sent in Messrs. Sharp and Hudson to the bowling of Messrs. Cholmely and Hamilton; the bowling was not up to the previous day's play, and it was consequently mastered by the batsmen, and Mr. Cholmely was changed for Capt. Slade, and again for Capt. Pemberton, who was remarkably fast, and at times rather wide of the wickets -- the byes counting up in consequence. Mr. Cholmely was again put on, and remained till the match terminated -- as it did in favor of the United States, with five wickets to go down. Mr. Hamilton was not changed during the match. The wicket-keeping was in no way to be compared to that of the day previous, as Sharp ought to have been caught three times, H. Wright once, easy, and Mr. Gibbes once from a sharp chance.

LEE, about whose movements and intentions so much vague speculation has for a week past exercised the calm observers of passing events in Washington, are at last beginning to exhibit their presence and their purposes with a plainness which ought to open the eyes even of the most self-satisfied military critic in that abode of strong delusions. This ""rabble rout,"" whose passage of the Potomac we were gravely notified by telegraph, was regarded with satisfaction in ""well-informed circles,"" has so far established itself in the very heart of Maryland that its leader -- the commanding General, be it noted, of the whole Confederate army -- has thought the time ripe for issuing his proclamation to the people of that State. That any man in his senses should read this proclamation and fail to appreciate the extent of the peril with which the Republic is now threatened, would surprise us, had not the faculty of astonishment been well high exhausted by the events of the last eighteen months.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ragged Raid of Lee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ragged Raid of Lee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bae9d36f-a0f1-5382-8993-b5461340c81c,882,nyt://article/bae9d36f-a0f1-5382-8993-b5461340c81c

Indeed, without more definite knowledge than we at present possess of the magnitude of the invading army, it is impossible to form a precise idea of the leading object of the movement. If the force were but a limited one, the motive at first assigned to the raid would be all-sufficient -- namely, that the army which crossed the river were to act as purveyors, sending over supplies to the main body on the other side of the Potomac, who should keep guard while the others rifled the house. This notion is not borne out by the facts. For, first, it is known that though supply trains of the rebels have for days continued to cross into Maryland, none are known to return. And, secondly, the rebel army have pushed their advance so far North, and left their rear so unguarded, as to preclude the possibility, even if they had the desire, of keeping their lines of communication open with a force on the south side of the Potomac. If, on the other hand, the rebel army in Maryland be really of the formidable proportions now represented -- if it number anything like a hundred thousand men -- it is vain to blink the inference to which their audacious advance leads up. They have, in that case, given up all care for communication with the Potomac; and having, as CORTES did when he burned his ships, voluntarily cut themselves off from retreat, they are now determined to push their invasive march on to the great State of Pennsylvania.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A Week's Campaign in Maryland."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""A Week's Campaign in Maryland."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1968cfe1-37b0-5cc0-b5ea-d67a957b65d8,1218,nyt://article/1968cfe1-37b0-5cc0-b5ea-d67a957b65d8

On Thursday evening, at 7 1/2 o'clock, they made a cavalry raid into Westminster, about five hundred strong, with two pieces of artillery. Westminster is in a northwesterly direction from Baltimore, at the junction of several county roads, one of which leads directly to the city. Greencastle, mentioned above, is a village in Franklin County, Pa., about three miles from the Maryland line, and about equidistant from Hagerstown and Chambersburgh. It is intersected by the railroad from Chambersburgh to Hagerstown. Meantime the National forces are not idle. New-Market, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, only ten miles from Frederick, was occupied by them on Thursday. We also learn, from the National Intelligencer, of yesterday, that on Thursday Gen. MCCLELLAN had advanced his headquarters some miles beyond Rockville, and that the army had approached the Monocacy River.

"A few weeks since, this community was thrown into some alarm by the starting intelligence that the large military organization encamped at East New-York, and known as the Empire Brigade, under the command of Gen. SPINOLA, had become openly mutinous, and had committed disorders of the gravest kind. Prompt and stern measures were taken, at the time, to suppress the outbreak, the greater portion of the men who had dispersed were again got together, and the ringleaders of the rioting were arrested and held for court-martial. This, for a time, produced quiet and order, and recruiting has been going on briskly and regularly, until on Tuesday last the number of men appearing on parade was no less than 3,008. Throughout that day and the next, symptoms of disorder were again noticed, and, on Thursday, became so violent as to call for the determined interference of the brigade officers. Gen. SPINOLA and his Staff went among the men, reasoning with them and exhorting them to return to duty, but with only indifferent success. The sources of trouble appeared to be as follows: Of the older enlistments, only a few have received their full pay and bounty money, and are consequently, as they have been for a long time, discontented. Under recent action, the War Committee of Queens County have been paying an additional and extra bounty of $60 to new recruits; and as the latter received the money at once, and made no niggard use of it in the nearest dram-shops, their jovial demeanor on returning to camp nettled the earlier members of the brigade, who were on comparatively short commons, to no light degree. In fine, from bandying words, the rival parties soon came to blows, and what with liquor and rage, the entire camp presented one scene of riot and confusion on Thursday morning. Strong guards of sober and reliable men were speedily detailed and put under arms at every available point, but as the men were move or less tinctured with the feelings, of their comrades, they could not be held to the mark, and the brigadesmen began to leave camp in large numbers without permission.

The latter proposition is sustained by the fact that, in the case of the Golden Gate, a portion of her boats were burned at their tackles, that nobody in the hour of peril and panic seemed to have any special charge of the means of rescue, and that these means were consequently in part destroyed, while the remainder were made efficient to the saving of many less lives than they were capable of rescuing from an awful and sudden death.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Golden Gate Disaster.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Golden Gate Disaster.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-09-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c9505c6a-5e37-5d29-817f-270faaaab909,1105,nyt://article/c9505c6a-5e37-5d29-817f-270faaaab909

"Our advices from Maryland this morning are of the highest importance. They indicate that the rebel army is retreating from that State much more expeditiously than they came into it, and that they are not making their escape unscathed. A dispatch from Harrisburgh states that yesterday morning heavy cannonading was heard at Hanover, Greencastle and Chambersburgh, proceeding from some point south of Hanover, no doubt across the Maryland line. From Baltimore we learn that cannonading was heard all day on Saturday in the direction of Harper's Ferry, and a dispatch from Frederick gives the explanation that it proceeded from an engagement at the foot of the mountains, on the road to Sandy Hook, with a rebel force of two thousand cavalry and three batteries of artillery. Gen. BURNSIDE passed through Frederick on Saturday morning, and the whole National army pushed on after the retreating enemy by every available road, and even crossed the fields. The reception of Gen. BURNSIDE in Frederick was a perfect ovation, the people turning out with the wildest enthusiasm; and when Gen. MCCLELLAN entered the place, the streets and sidewalks were perfectly blocked with the enthusiastic masses, including a large proportion of ladies. Our latest advices from Frederick are to yesterday forenoon. They account for the tiring heard on Friday. It was an artillery duel between Gen. PLEASANTON and the rear guard of the rebels, who were so hard pushed that they were forced to fall back to Middletown, from which place they were also driven in the afternoon. On Saturday our cavalry had two affairs with the enemy, and so pushed them that they were forced to burn half a mile of their wagon trains. This, in addition to a train of a hundred ammunition and subsistence wagons, captured by Gen. FRANKLIN, will prove quite a serious loss for the rebels. LONGSTREET is said to have been repulsed at Harper's Ferry on Saturday afternoon, but at 8 o'clock yesterday morning the battle had been renewed in that direction, and the firing, as heard at Frederick, was rapid and heavy. It was expected that our main column would come up with the retreating enemy yesterday afternoon, and force them to a general engagement. Our troops were in fine spirits, and much elated at the cordial reception extended to them by the people of Maryland. All danger of an invasion of Pennsylvania may now be considered past, as the rebels will no doubt have enough to do to escape the destruction which they have courted. Gov.

If the purpose was to march upon Baltimore, they have been foiled in that; for we have driven them from all the points they seized on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, between the Potomac and the Relay House, and now hold this line strongly and securely. If the rebel aim was an invasion of Pennsylvania, a march to the Susquehanna, and the capture of Harrisburgh, it is evident that they have now no hope of success in that scheme; for all Pennsylvania has flown to arms, and there is already an improvised army on the southern line of the State, sufficiently powerful to make any attempt at invasion fatal. The telegrams of this morning from Frederick state that the movements of the rebel army indicate that there is no fear whatever of the invasion of Pennsylvania; while even from Harrisburgh, where the excitement has been so wild, we have a dispatch to the effect that the rebel pickets have retired from the State line. Whatever may have been the primary or ultimate object of the rebel movement across the Potomac, there is no doubt that the whole thing is an utter failure, and while the fact that they have been permitted even for a brief time to occupy loyal soil and ravage a loyal population, is disgraceful to our military authorities and a disaster to our cause, there is nothing but this for them to glorify themselves with.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Retreat from Maryland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Retreat from Maryland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/557e9f85-1359-5852-b532-4e0f02efb59c,836,nyt://article/557e9f85-1359-5852-b532-4e0f02efb59c

"THE GAS COMPANIES AND THE COUNCILMEN. --  At the last meeting of the Board of Councilmen a resolution was adopted directing the Counsel to the Corporation to initiate the necessary measures for taking possession of the property and machinery of the New-York and Manhattan Gas Companies, in accordance with the provisions of their charters, by which the City has a right at any time to assume proprietorship upon paying the Gas Companies a fair valuation for their property. There is no good reason why the city should not undertake the business of supplying the people with gas as they do with Croton water; and we trust the movement thus inaugurated by the Councilmen for squelching out these arrogant monopolies will be pressed to a speedy consummation. The indignation of the people toward these gas companies on account of their attempt to saddle their customers with the National tax upon their manufactures, knows no bounds, and will not be appeased until they are crushed out.

THEODORE L. CUYLER, who has just returned from a three months' vacation in England and on the continent of Europe, gave to a large audience at Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, last evening, the result of his observations during his absence, with respect to the opinions entertained abroad touching the American Rebellion. His narrative was highly interesting, and was received with every demonstration of delight, but did not present any new or different aspect of European opinion regarding American affairs from that well known to exist by most readers of the newspapers. In England, he said, the aristocratic influence in the main was against us; so was the commercial influence, and as for the press, with the exception of the Daily News, Star, BRIGHT's paper, and the Edinburgh Mercury, it was all hostile to the North. Still we had a few friends among the nobility, among whom he mentioned Lord SHAFTSBURY, who had stated that if the North would only raise the standard of God and Liberty, they would not lack for sympathy in Europe. Earl RUSSELL had likewise frequently expressed a similar sentiment, and he gave that nobleman the credit, notwithstanding the harsh criticism he had encountered on this side the water, of being a conscientious Anti-Slavery man, of having no sympathy with the South, and of having stood thus far, as a breakwater, against the tremendous pressure brought to hear upon the Government in favor of intervention and recognition. The religious element of Great Britain contained a large substratum in our favor. At all the religious meetings he attended, our civil war was alluded to in the prayers, and the invariable petition was that it might result in the downfall of oppression, the spread of civil liberty, and in a speedy termination.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Europe Thinks of US.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Europe Thinks of US.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da02e66f-c464-5df6-8ca2-a47cb66e39d0,909,nyt://article/da02e66f-c464-5df6-8ca2-a47cb66e39d0

If this is correct, and the railroad bridge is safe, it affords a practicable crossing for MCCLELLAN's army, and may place it in the Shenandoah Valley ahead of LEE's retreating columns. The rebels, in that case, would be effectually circumvented, and their condition far more perilous than it has ever before seemed. They could not retreat toward Richmond, nor advance upon Washington, or again move toward Pennsylvania, but would be driven to the mountains westward, where, in their naked condition, their sufferings at this season, from cold as well as hunger, would be extreme.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL RETREAT POSSIBLY CUT OFF.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL RETREAT POSSIBLY CUT OFF.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/57aa93ee-82f1-531f-8140-48904f077682,152,nyt://article/57aa93ee-82f1-531f-8140-48904f077682

"A series of dispatches from Gen. MCCLELLAN to Gen. HALLECK, published this morning, give brief outlines of the important events which have occurred in Maryland during the last two days. The first, dated at 9:40 P.M., of Sunday, announces that, after a very severe engagement, the corps of Generals HOOKER and RENO had carried the height commanding the Hagerstown road by storm, the troops behaving in the most magnificent manner the action continued until after dark, and left us in possession of the entire crest -- a glorious victory. Gen. FRANKLIN, at the same time, was hotly engaged on the extreme left. In the battle for the possession of the Heights, Gen. RENO was killed. The second dispatch, dated at 3 o'clock yesterday morning, announces that FRANKLIN's success on the left was as complete as that on the centre and right, and resulted in his gaining an important position, after a severe engagement all along the line. The troops, old and new, behaved with the utmost gallantry, carrying strong positions with but very little help from the artillery, and without severe losses. The enemy had disappeared during the night, and our troops were advancing in pursuit. The Third dispatch, dated at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, announces the reception of the information from Gen. HOOKER, in the advance, that the enemy was making for the river in a perfect panic, -- Gen. LEE acknowledging that he had been shockingly whipped. The fourth dispatch, dated ""Bolivar, 10 o'clock A.M.,"" announces the receipt of information completely continuing the report of the rout and demoralization of the rebel army. LEE, who was reported wounded, stated his loss at fifteen thousand, among whom was Gen. GARLAND killed. Gen. HOOKER alone had captured over a thousand more prisoners, seven hundred having already been sent to Frederick. This is a glorious record of success for the National army. It will be noticed that the fourth dispatch from Gen. MCCLELLAN is dated at Bolivar, which is on the lower side of the Potomac, a little below Harper's Ferry.

"APPRAISEMENTS OF PRIZE STEAMERS -- The four steamers recently captured by our blockading squadron, being of prospective use to the Government, have by its order, been appraised. The Bermuda, the most valuable of the four, has been appraised by the Court Appraisers at $120,000, by the Government Appraisers at $110,000. The captors and claimants will no doubt agree to the Government taking the vessel at the larger sum, but as it is $10,000 above the value fixed upon by the agents for the Government, it is doubtful if the vessel will be taken at that figure. With respect to the steamer Lodona, the Court Appraisers put her value at $75,000, the Government Appraisers at $80,000, and the claimants and captors allege her to be worth $85,000. This vessel will be allowed to be taken by the Government, no doubt, at the appraisement of $80,000. The steamer Florida, which is a wooden vessel, and has seen ten years' service, has been valued by the Court Appraisers at $38,000, by the Government agents at $10,000. It is supposed that the captors and the claimants will both agree to the Government having her for $40,000. The Government appraisement of the steamer Emilie values her at $10,000, the Court appraisement at $15,000. The Emilie is old and nearly worn out. She sailed for a number of years as the Wm.

J E Johnston to command area west of Mississippi River,"Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, so long the preeminent military leader of the rebels in Virginia, has been assigned to command west of the Mississippi River, having under him Gens. PRICE, HOLMES and MAGRUDER. This implies one of two things. Either the Rebel Government is about to commence a new and more serious campaign in that remote region, or it is disturbed by military rivalries at home growing out of the accession of Gen. ROBERT E. LEE to the command lately held by Gen. JOHNSTON. The latter is probably the moving cause of JOHNSTON's transfer. JEFFERSON DAVIS has always found his relations with the Virginia aristocracy doubtful and unpleasant. He did not meet their ambitious expectations of controlling the Confederate Government on the establishment of its Capital at Richmond, and he has not yet fully overcame their prejudices against him. He has never had in his family the cordial sympathy of Richmond society; and lately, when that city was in danger and disorder, his wife and children were said to be removed to Raleigh, N.C., for refuge.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Designs West of the Mississippi.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Designs West of the Mississippi.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/025133f5-5711-5ad9-a779-ec336a5a2097,508,nyt://article/025133f5-5711-5ad9-a779-ec336a5a2097

The faithful and [???] agent of the Association, Mr. ABRAHAM BEALE, has looked after the welfare of the unfortunate prisoners with his usual [???], and not a few young men are now following [???] who have been saved from disgrace, [???] from unjust imprisonment through his efforts. There are few [???] which better to-serve the [???] did management of the public than this. The [???] of the Association for the past your were $1,942 10; documents, $1,935, 25, leaving a balance in the treasury of $ 5 85.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e4dd016-e838-534f-a947-97635116a4dc,1395,nyt://article/3e4dd016-e838-534f-a947-97635116a4dc

"The accompanying map will give a succinct view of the scene and localities of the great battles of the present week, and of the course of the rebel movements from the time they crossed the Potomac, until Wednesday night. On Friday evening last, one week ago to-day, our army entered Frederick, having driven the rebel forces up to and beyond the place, from the point at which they crossed the Potomac, above and below the Point of Rocks. Our forces followed the retreating rebels from Frederick across the Catoctin Mountains, and on Sunday HOOKER and RENO came up with their rear guard at the gap in South Mountain, indicated in our map, (incorrectly called ""Hagerstown Heights,"") while Gen. FRANKLIN engaged another body of them on the same day, at a point to the southeast. Of these battles, the TIMES on Wednesday and Thursday gave by far the fullest and best accounts that have been published. The different bodies of the rebels seem to have then swept around southwesterly on Monday from these localities and from Hagerstown -- skirmishing briskly as they retired -- until on Tuesday all their forces were concentrated in the neighborhood of Sharpsburgh, at a point east of Antictam Creek, and probably at the intersection of the roads leading from Middletown to Sharpsburgh, and Rohersville and Williamsport. Here was fought the great but indecisive battle of Tuesday; and during the day's fighting, we drove the rebels south and west for some distance -- our army at night occupying the ground where the battle closed. The tremendous engagement of Wednesday was fought closer to Sharpsburgh, or between Sharpsburgh and Rohrersville; and though we do not definitely know the course and result of the battle, we know that at night we occupied Rohrersville, and that Gen. Mc. CLELLAN had destroyed the aqueduct at the mouth of the Antietam Creek, and the bridge across that creek upon the road leading to Sharpsburgh. So that from all we can gather, it would appear that the rebel army is now collected in the great bend of the river, (see map,) which will be observed as running some ten miles north from the junction of Antietam Creek with the Potomac. There are mountain ridges on both sides of the creek, and the whole country in this vicinity is thickly covered with hills, so that it is necessarily slow work pursuing the rebels, and they are able to contest many points. One dispatch asserts that the greater part of the rebel army, instead of being west of Antietam, has retreated southward in the direction of Harper's Ferry. When it is considered, however, that Gen. BURNSIDE, with a large force, holds Harper's Ferry, and that other troops, under Gen. SIGEL, are moving; in this direction from Washington, it would seem that wherever the rebel army may be placed, or in whatever direction it may be retreating, it will find escape a difficult matter if our troops are thrown upon it with skill and vigor. There will likely be another, and a decisive, battle fought speedily on this part of the line off the Upper Potomac; and on the space covered by our little map is, very probably, located the ground which will see the death, as it is now seeing the dying, struggles of this great rebellion.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/19/archives/the-great-battles-in-maryland.html,,"The accompanying map will give a succinct view of the scene and localities of the great battles of the present week, and of the course of the rebel movements from the time they crossed the Potomac, until Wednesday night.

On Wednesday morning the general engagement was resumed, and lasted until 5 o'clock in the afternoon. It is understood that both armies were engaged in their full force -- the corps of JACKSON having recrossed the Potomac and joined the army of LEE. The battle was obstinate and bloody, but at its close the advantage remained with the National army, the position for which it fought having been gained, and no doubt being entertained of final victory. One account states that the rebels retreated, leaving Gen. LONGSTREET and the remnant of his division in our hands as prisoners, together with six batteries of artillery. It is stated, also, that at least 15,000 prisoners had been captured since Sunday, and the belief was expressed that the entire rebel army would be captured, as the Potomac was rising and our troops were pushing them continually. Accounts from the vicinity of the battle-field yesterday, up to 9 o'clock A.M., say nothing of the engagement having been renewed up to that time, and the inference is that both armies were engaged in burying the dead.

There was abundance of testimony inculpating one Mrs. WATSON, the reputed paramour of the prisoner; but as for MACHADO himself, he appeared in the transaction like the echo of his name -- a mere shadow. Since that time the Marshal has been on the look-out for evidence to sustain the charge against MACHADO, and on Thursday last he succeeded in arresting the Captain of the Mary Francis, who, it is said, is prepared to make a full expose of the whole affair. This Captain, whose name is JOHN W. PERKINS, on hearing of the first arrest of MACHADO, made himself scarce, and his whereabouts could not be ascertained until within a few days, when a person who had been arrested for uttering treasonable language, in order to get the favor of the Marshal, informed him that Capt. PERKINS, for whom he had so long been in search, was at Peoria, Illinois. Deputy-Marshal J.A. SMITH was at once dispatched after the Captain; but on arriving at Peoria, he was informed that the object of his search had just got married at that place, and was then absent on a wedding tour.

This is an important work, and cannot be too highly estimated. Upon its correctness depends the equitable nature of a draft, and hence the greatest care has beer exercised by Gen. ANTHON in the preparation of this portion of the system. Set A is finished, with the exception of transfers. By transfer is meant that system by which the names or parties who have been enrolled at their places of business is transferred to their places of residence. The examiner, when the copyist has furnished his transfer list, takes up the book and erases the name of the party enrolled where it appears more than once on its appropriate page. Thanks to this plan, a man may be enrolled four times, as was done in some cases, yet in the engrossed books from which the draft will be made up, his name will appear only once, and that at his place of residence only. The cases, However, where the residence has been given in an indefinite manner, such as ""Brooklyn,"" ""Jersey,"" &c., without designating the precise locality, the party has been put down at his place of business, so that if he has two chances of being drafted, the shrewd citizen has but himself to blame. The entire work of copying, transferring, &c., will doubtless be finished about the 1st of October, making the entire time occupied in enrolling; New-York and Brooklyn with 400,000 names about six weeks. The labor required to do this work, though laborious, has been done at, comparatively speaking, almost a ""trifling"" expense. The entire job will cost about $1,500, or about four cents a name, which fact reflects great credit upon the economical administrative abilities of Gen. ANTHON and his efficient assistant, Mr. SORIBER. The economy of this enrollment may be fairly judged when it is stated that the bills presented for enrollment expenses in country towns have thus far averaged from 40 to 70 cents per name.

Several ineffectual attempts have been made to call a special meeting of the Board of late, but the members were making the best of their advantages, and it was found impossible to convene a quorum in the city, as the members were scattered in every direction, some even sailing on a European tour. The Mayor, however, has been anxious to present some communications of importance for the consideration of the Board, and it is difficult to state the extent to which they may have accumulated by the delay. The Mayor's peculiar notions of economy apparently do not agree with the liberal views of the Board, and they had the presumption, at their last session, to pass measures on which the Mayor had placed his official vetoes. The Mayor, of course, was not at all pleased with this action, and reports at the City Hall have it that he had threatened to call in the aid of the law to uphold the dignity and power of his office against the refractory members of the City Government. The story soon assumed a shape which gave it a degree of probability. The Mayor was, so the report of the Aldermanic jokers runs, to imitate in a minor degree no less a personage than OLIVER CROMWELL, by depriving the municipal authorities who practically questioned his authority of the functions of their office.

"A SKEDADDLE AT CAMP FRELINGHUYSEN. -- Some 600 or 800 of the New-Jersey nine months volunteers, encamped at Camp Frelinghuysen, took French leave on Saturday morning. There were some 2,300 soldiers in the camp, and, as we learn from one of the Corporals who did not skedaddle, they had been promised a furlough to enable them to visit their homes before marching to the seat of war. The furlough was promised for Wednesday last; when the time came, they were requested to wait until they got their uniforms. The uniforms were furnished on Friday, when, to their surprise, they were informed that they were under marching orders, and could not have a furlough at all. This caused much ill-feeling in camp, but the soldiers, although they were determined to have their promised furlough, yet decided to proceed in a quiet and orderly manner. They therefore held a mass meeting, and appointed a Committee to wait upon the commanding officer and inform him that they should leave camp yesterday morning, with or without a furlough, and that they would all return again at any reasonable time that he would fix. Morning came, and, as the Colonel in command had decided that he had no power to grant furloughs while they were under marching orders, about a third of the men, as above stated, skedaddled. Through the exertions of Capt. WALTER H. DODD, and Capt. MORRIS, of Newark, the remainder were persuaded to remain until arrangements could be made for their departure in a more soldier-like manner. Col. VAN VORST was finally prevailed upon to grant the men furloughs until 9 o'clock Monday morning, although he protested that he had no authority so to do. Furloughs were accordingly given to the remainder, and they departed quietly. It was stated in some of the evening papers that during the stampede of the skedaddlers one of the men was shot in the arm by Maj. BABCOCK. This is a mistake. The Major fired his pistol, hoping to intimidate the men and induce them to return, but it was not loaded with ball and nobody was hurt. The affair did not partake of the nature of a riot in any respect, and there is no doubt that nearly all the skedaddlers will quietly return to camp to-day. They are expected to leave for the seat of war on Wednesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/22/archives/newjersey.html,,"A SKEDADDLE AT CAMP FRELINGHUYSEN. -- Some 600 or 800 of the New-Jersey nine months volunteers, encamped at Camp Frelinghuysen, took French leave on Saturday morning.

The altar and other portions of the church were draped in deep mourning, and from an early hour in the morning the church was filled by a mourning throng of the late congregation of the lamented deceased clergyman, who, each in their turn, passed by the open coffin, and cast a sorrowful and lingering gaze at the pastor they all knew so intimately and loved so well. The pupils of the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy, and the inmates of the Orphan Asylum, both of whom had reason to mourn the loss of one who had exercised such a paternal care over them, occupied one of the side aisles of the church, habited in white coiffures, presenting an imposing view. The services commenced at half-past ten, with Father KEEGAN as celebrant, Father FAGAN as deacon, Father MCKENNA as sub-deacon, and a large concourse of clergymen, assisted in the ceremonies, among whom were the Right Rev. Bishop LAUGHLIN, of this diocese; Revds. Messrs. CONSTANTINE PISE, D.D.; MULLANE, MCGUIRE, DELAVAN, MCGOVERN, O'FARRELL, YEANCES, MALONE, MCCLOSKEY, MCDONNELL and O'NEAL. Just before the final ceremonies, the Rev. Dr. PISE ascended the pulpit, and delivered an eloquent and feeling eulogy on the deceased. He laid particular stress upon his charitable disposition, and during the delivery of the preacher's eloquent remarks, very many of the congregation were moved to tears, and stifled sobs were heard from all parts of the building. The musical portion of the services were conducted by Mr. MAX BRAUN, the competent organist of the church, and consisted of SCHMIDT's requiem Mass, which was excellently rendered by Madame ANCHUTZ and Miss NEWMAN as soprani, Mr. WEINLECH as basso, Mr. JOHN BROWN and Mr. HOFFMAN, tenorii, and Miss NEWMAN as contralto.

"A SUSPICIOUS CASE OF DROWNING -- A COLORED MAN FOUND IN THE WATER WITH HIS FEET TIED. -Coroner COLLIN on Saturday held an inquest upon the body of JOHN COOPER, (colored,) aged 29 years, who was found in the water at the foot of Harrison-street, at a late hour on Friday evening, under circumstances which render it almost certain that the deceased had been the victim of foal play. The evidence, as developed upon the inquest, is briefly and substantially as follows: Late on Friday evening, Capt. HARDY, of the barge N.F. Whitby, heard a man, who was then in the water near the stern of his barge, shouting and halloing as if he were in a drowning condition. The Captain soon procured a light, and then he found the deceased was struggling in the water and trying to seize hold of some part of the barge to save himself from sinking. A boat-hook was procured, and with the assistance of others, the unfortunate man was raised to the deck of the barge, in a very exhausted condition. It was then ascertained that his feet were tied firmly together with a quantity of thread. The Police of the Fifth Precinct were notified, and COOPER was taken to the Station-house, where he died yesterday morning. The jury rendered a verdict that ""deceased came to his death by congestion of the lungs, caused by immersion in the water."" The whole transaction has a very suspicious appearance, and the police are trying to ferret out the mystery. The deceased, on his way to the Station-House, told the officers that some smart fellow had tied his feet and then threw him overboard.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/22/archives/general-city-news.html,,"A SUSPICIOUS CASE OF DROWNING -- A COLORED MAN FOUND IN THE WATER WITH HIS FEET TIED. -Coroner COLLIN on Saturday held an inquest upon the body of JOHN COOPER, (colored,) aged 29 years, who was found in the water at the foot of Harrison-street, at a late hour on Friday evening, under circumstances which render it almost certain that the deceased had been the victim of foal play.

BRAGG, upsets all previous information as to the nearness of Gen. BUELL's pursuing columns. Gen. ROUSSEAU, whose rapid advance down the Louisville and Nashville railroad, last Summer, stopped the rebel advance at Munfordsville, was said to have followed Gen. BUCKNER back to Glasgow, one week ago, after the latter had failed in his assault on Munfordsville. And Gen. ROUSSEAU was leading BUELL's advance in pursuit of BRAGG. But now we are told that BRAGG's whole army came up two days later, surrounded Munfordsville and forced it to surrender. ROUSSEAU was not a General to suffer that result, if he had been so near.

After conversing with the lad for some time, the person in charge of the office had his suspicions aroused, by the seeming effeminacy of the applicant, that all was not as it appeared. He accordingly sent for Capt. MOUNT, of the Third Precinct, who, immediately on seeing the youthful would-be seaman, pronounced her a female beyond all question, despite her very artful disguise. After a great deal of protestation, the young girl confessed that her name was BRIDGET SILK, she was seventeen years old, and was a native of Eastchester, N.Y., where she had been living with her sister. Her parents were dead some time. She had become imbued with a desire for romantic adventure, and for the purpose of carrying out her plans, had intended shipping for a whaling voyage. She had selected the Zouave costume as a better disguise than an orninary male attire, and she made quite a creditable Zu-Zu. Her first idea was to enter the army as a volunteer, but the difficulty of passing the doctor had restrained her from this course, as she knew no way of avoiding the -- to her -- awkward but necessary ceremony. She expressed her intention quite freely to run away again, if she was sent home, as she had determined to see the world outside the narrow limits of the village where she was reared. Capt. MOUNT presented her to Superintendent KENNEDY, who directed Officer RICE to take her to her friends. Mr. RICE, when we last saw him, was carrying a huge carpet-bag in one hand, and leading the girl-boy by the other, she followed by a crowd of curious masculinities.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Romantic Adventure A Female Zouave.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Romantic Adventure A Female Zouave.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/794cc168-4be9-57f5-9f5d-9f6bb5a0e20c,316,nyt://article/794cc168-4be9-57f5-9f5d-9f6bb5a0e20c

"-- About the only thing we know of the rebel army is, that it is all out of Maryland; and the telegraphic indications this morning are, that it is continuing its retreat in Virginia, and altogether leaving the line of the Potomac. There have been fears expressed that the rebels might suddenly cross once more into Maryland lower down the river than the point at which they got out of it, and suddenly march upon Washington while our array is absent. But, it must be remembered, that notwithstanding all cavils, we have an army left in Washington sufficient to defend it -- now that we know Baltimore is safe and loyal in the rear, -- while, in such an event, MCCLELLAN's victorious army would march back to Washington as quickly as it marched out from it a fortnight ago to pursue the rebels. On the south side of the Potomac we have another army under most gallant leaders, which it seems has not been sent to cut off the rebel retreat at any point. Possibly it has been kept at the forts to prevent the rebels from coming down from Harper's Ferry on the south side, capturing Arlington Heights, and attacking the Capital in front. It is difficult to tell where the rebel army is pushing to. Probably Gen. HALLECK is waiting to discover before he makes any moves.

His long life of devotion to his country has passed into the treasury of historical inspiration; his marvelous victories have already become a legend of liberty; his very mistakes and extravagancies like the mistakes and extravagancies of every noble nature in its pursuit of noble ends, will transmit a golden warning and instruction of their own to future times. It should be matter for satisfaction, then, to all thinking men, that the Italian Government has decided to bring the hero of Sicily, now become the victim of Aspromonte, to a trial before the highest Court of Italian justice, the Italian people in Parliament assembled. The nature and extent of the fault which has been committed by the successful liberator of Naples and the Alps, in his unsuccessful at tempt at the liberation of Home, can only be fairly and adequately recorded in the result of such a trial before such a tribunal. Only in this way, too, can the Government of VICTOR EMANUEL do justice to itself and its own motives at the bar of history. For it is the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable case, that the accusing Government is itself upon trial at the same time with the accused rebel. The duty imposed upon VICTOR EMANUEL and his Ministry by the expedition against Rome, was a duty which needs to be gravely vindicated and established. It needs to be shown past all cavil, and with supreme solemnity, that the King, whose crown was set firmly upon his head by the right hand of the man who is to-day his prisoner, could only prove himself worthy to wear that crown by striking down that prisoner's arm when it was once more raised to fix the final cross of Capitoline splendor upon the diadem. A painful and terrible thing it was to do; and although the conscience of the civilized world has already justified the King of Italy in doing it, the future peace of Italy, not less than the royal record itself, demands that the justification should be made ull, formal and explicit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Garabaldi on Trial.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Garabaldi on Trial.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1862-09-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30f4485f-0c0a-5dd3-b45b-8a21db429d63,965,nyt://article/30f4485f-0c0a-5dd3-b45b-8a21db429d63

The event is extremely important, and every way auspicious for the Confederate cause. In some respects, it is one of the most momentous successes of the war. The number of prisoners captured is probably greater than has been taken in any other single engagement during the war, exceeding even the number taken by the Federal forces at Fort Donelson, or by the Confederates in the battles before Richmond. In material results, the victory is extraordinarily fruitful. Large quantities of small aims were taken; a great amount of ammunition, and several hundred wagons, ordnance stores, Quartermaster's and Commissary's stores. Such particulars as have come to hand will be found in another part of this morning's paper. In another point of view this success is highly important, it expels the last remnant of the federal army from the Valley, and secures the whole of that rich country to the Confederacy. It relieves Gen. LEE from all apprehension of danger in his rear, and opens a safe line of communication with Richmond. It might have been unsafe to leave the strong position of Harper's Ferry in possession of the enemy; but now that this point has, been provided for, Gen.

"WESTERN VIRGINIA. -- From an advertisement of the rebel Ordnance Department, in the Richmond Whig, we learn that ""all preparations for Major-Gen. FLOYD's army are being concentrated at Lynchburgh."" It would seem from this that FLOYD is making extensive preparations for work in Western Virginia, where the campaign has already opened on the Gauley and Kanawha Rivers, with considerable successes on the rebel side. We have hardly any troops in that great section of Virginia now to resist the advance of FLOYD's ten thousand ""irregulars,"" and it would not be astonishing if he were shortly to make his way across the mountains, take advantage of its unprotected condition, and capture and hold it as KIRBY SMITH has captured and held Kentucky. There is only one way by which Western Virginia can be permanently held, other than by maintaining a large army there, and that is by the capture of East Tennessee.

We have no doubt they will be subjected to the most atrocious treatment by their Southern captors. Many of them were undoubtedly freemen by birth; many had earned their freedom by services to our cause and our army; and all of them were under the guardianship and protection of the Government. Most of them were employed in various army work at Harper's Ferry, under the act of last session of Congress, authorizing the employment of negroes as military laborers.

Serious disturbance had broken out at Pressnitz,. in Moravia, owing to the stoppage of the cotton factories. The riots continued for three days, and were only put an end by the arrival of a regiment of hussara. Thirty of the rioters were arrested. In England, attention was being generally attracted to jute as a substitute, in part, for cotton. A method is said to have been discovered by which it can be spun on cotton machinery. The price of jute, in consequence, had gone up 50 per cent. The Liverpool Cotton market was irregular, but an advance had taken place. Breadstuffs were quiet and steady, and provisions heavy! Consols were quoted at 93 1/2@93 5/8 for money. American Stocks, in consequence of the news of POPE'S reverses before Washington, were flat. Nothing at all seems as yet settled with respect to the fate of GARIBALDI and his followers. The Turin Government is evidently greatly embarrassed.

"Capt. JOHN KAVANAGH, of Company I, Sixty-third Regiment N.Y.V., (Gen. THOMAS FRANCIS MEAGHER's Irish Brigade,) is now officially reported among the slain in the great battle of Antietam. Capt. KAVANAGH was one of the Irish exiles of 1848. Having taken a conspicuous part in the effort of O'BRIEN, MITCHEL, MEAGHER and O'GORMAN to secure the national independence of Ireland, he had to fly to America to escape the vengeance of the British Government. He spent most of his years in his adopted country in mercantile pursuits. On the outbreak of the present rebellion, he relinquished all business interests and devoted himself to the service of the Republic, to which he was most earnestly attached. He was one of the principal organizers of the Thirty-seventh Regiment New-York Volunteers.

"Last night began the Jewish Festival of Rosh Hashoua, or the New Year. The festival is of the utmost sacredness to the followers of the Ancient Faith, demanding, during the two days of its continuance, absolute cessation of all business and rest from all work.

Nothing previously on record at all equals the savage energy with which the French people then rose to vindicate their newly won freedom and independence; and as there are between our situation and that of France during the Revolution many points of similitude, both in the imminence of the crisis and the universal enthusiasm with which it was met on the part of the people, we will best appreciate the magnitude of the efforts of the loyal States when set side by side with that other marvelous and hitherto unmatched exhibition of patriotic ardor. The result of the comparison will be, to show that we have already placed in the field as many soldiers as France was able to raise then; while if the results of a critical examination of the number of troops commonly claimed to have been raised by France shall be accepted, it will appear that the number really raised by her has been doubled by the levies that have spontaneously sprung forth in defence of the Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What the Country Has Done Toward the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What the Country Has Done Toward the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ccfa0251-a9c7-591d-8e25-3660288e5ea8,1117,nyt://article/ccfa0251-a9c7-591d-8e25-3660288e5ea8

The gift came just at the right moment -- immediately after the great battles in Maryland; and the Sanitary Commission, which was in danger of having to draw upon the future for means to relieve the tremendous strain upon it, was at once put in financial condition to procure whatever might be needed for the relief of the wounded. In a brief appeal from the Commission, published this morning, its President says that, at the recent battle-ground, they were able to be present two days in advance of regular supplies, with wagon-loads of stimulants, medicines and conveniences; and the same document, elsewhere justly says: ""the first two days on a battle-field are more important than the next ten, to the saving of life and misery."" The means to purchase these medicines and comforts, came from the generosity of California. When it is remembered that San Francisco is a city of only about seventy-five thousand inhabitants, and that this hundred thousand dollars is the fruit of public subscription, its value as a testimony of sympathy will be seen to be greatly enhanced. We understand that other cities in the Golden State will soon be heard from as having followed San Francisco's golden example. California has sent few troops to the war; for the simple reason that the Government has refused to accept them, as it would not pay to transport them such a vast distance. But there is no State in our broad domain in which the people are more thoroughly loyal to the Constitution and the Union; and, under present circumstances, they could not give a more gratefully-received proof of their loyalty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CALIFORNIA AND THE SANITARY COMMISSION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CALIFORNIA AND THE SANITARY COMMISSION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6b7f402-6ecc-5931-a6e3-36d4992ecb80,383,nyt://article/e6b7f402-6ecc-5931-a6e3-36d4992ecb80

"-- The meeting of certain Governors on one of the mountain tops of Pennsylvania has excited much attention, and provoked in some quarters the most violent condemnation. Charges of secret conspiracy to overthrow the National Government have been freely offered by the sensational Press; while the most moderate view of the Press at large has been that measures unpalatable to the Administration were there to be rolled into pellets and forced down its reluctant throat. There was no ground, however, for any such apprehensions. That the meeting was probably ill-advised, and in all respects unfortunate, can hardly be doubted. There was too striking a resemblance between it and similar gatherings of State Right Governors in the South just before the rebellion broke out; and indeed, the substance as well as the form of the thing smacked unpleasantly of that violent Anti-National creed which has set this hapless people by the ears.

The war, which it was supposed would paralyze all its energies and reduce infinitely the demand for and consumption of luxuries of all kinds, seems rather to have operated in a contrary direction, and by placing wealth in different hands from those which formerly held it, given an impulse to trade which is unexpected as it is gratifying. Broadway and other principal thoroughfares begin to wear their wonted brilliant aspect -- people are returning rapidly to town -- sidewalks are thronged, stores are crowded -- the important business of Fall shopping has commenced -- the signal for the display of all those varied textures and ingenious specimens of art and skill, which afford the best evidence of industrial resources, and act at the same time as traps for the unwary. The shopping community, however, never manifested a greater willingness to be caught. This season, above all others, shows no lack of the one thing needful. Whether it is that business is unusually prosperous, or money more than usually plentiful, or because investments are considered doubtful, and currency itself uncertain, most true it is that women never received so liberal a carte blanche, or encountered so little opposition to their suggestion that the family wardrobe needed replenishing. In fact, instances have been known, recently, where husbands have handed a fifty-dollar bill, unasked, to their astonished wives, with the recommendation to ""pitch in"" -- a reckless more of proceeding, unparallelled in domestic annals -- and which has led, in several cases, to misgivings that an extra bottle with a friend had something to do with it, or possibly some remnant of hereditary insanity.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OPENING DAY.; Annual Exhibition of Fall and Winter Fashions.

"The situation in Kentucky derived many of its recent alarming features from the excitable temper and incapacity of Gen. NELSON, at Louisville, as we took occasion at the time to show. On a report, evidently quite vague in its character, that Gen. BRAGG was ""marching rapidly upon Louisville,"" having eluded Gen. BUELL, Gen. NELSON indulged in a series of frantic orders and proclamations in regard to closing all business houses, sending off women and children, seizing ferries for military purposes, and so forth.

The prisoner was barkeeper for Louis Bleyart, at a liquor store, kept corner of Morris and West streets. The deceased, with several other persons, came to Bleyart's place, obtained liquor, and refused to pay.

Nay, we may as well go further, and admit that we should be thankful, as things now stand, for smaller favors. We should gratefully accept a Pelissier, and commission an Yvon to record his achievements. But whenever the decisive man shall come, and with him the decisive hour, and the limner shall follow after to perpetuate for our children the ""great deliverance"" of the land in all its terrible beauty, the task of this latter will be greatly simplified to his cunning hand by the efforts which our leading photographic artist has made, and is making, to catch our armies ""living as they rise,"" and, alas! to embalm our falling heroes ere they fall. From the outset of the war Mr. BRADY has been in the field. His cameras have followed the cannon from the Potomac to the York, from the Chesapeake to the Alleghanies. Scarce has the camp of the volunteer been pitched by the more or less muddy waters of the Chickahominy ere the patriotic Polyphemus plants himself within range, flings away his green curtain, and opens his one-eyed battery upon the scene. Like the sunlight which he presses into his service and ours, this silent Asmodeus penetrates into every secret, unveils every mystery. He captures the fugitive contraband as he urges his slow oxen through the splash of the Rappahannock fords, and sends him down through all coming time to reveal the insensibility of the negro race to the compromises of the Constitution, and to the beneficent influences of patriarchal order. Just glance at the group! Not a white face among them -- no Caucasian serpent seducing these wanderers from their Eden-home. They have equipped themselves -- spoiling their masters, perchance, as the Egyptians were spoiled by their fugitive slaves of old -- they have confiscated sundry rebel horses and wagons in advance of the acts of Congress, and they are making their way slowly northward -- Yankeeward -- freedomward.

"Fifty thousand of our fellow-citizens of Hebrew blood were yesterday, and are to-day, engaged in one of the most ancient and solemn observances of the Jewish Faith. Rosh Hashona, or the Head of the Year, comprises the first two days of Tisri, the seventh month of the Israelitish sacred year, or the first of the civil year. In the First Book of Kings, this great month is called Ethanim or Continually Flowing, from the fact that the autumn rains then began to fill the dried up beds of brooks and rivers and to overflow the parched levels of Judea. This latter is the more ancient name, deriving its origin from the patriarchal period preceding the captivity. Nearly coinciding with our Christian October, it was, in some sense, also the late harvest month of the Hebrews, with whom the fullness and ripeness of the year immediately preceded the birth of its suscessor, and from the growth and culmination of sin in the human heart, the significance of the opening festival is also largely deduced. This month and New-Year began on Wednesday evening at sunset, and yesterday was celebrated the Feast of Trumpets, the first of a succession of Jewish festivals which will extend over the next four weeks, in the Book of Numbers we are told of the two trumpets of beaten silver which the Lord commanded Moses to make, and which were used in the wanderings of the Tribes to summon all the people together when on the eve of departure. These trumpets were subsequently employed at the opening of the solemn ceremonial to proclaim the New Year, and also at the beginning of the Sabbatical year and the Jubilee, as many passages in Numbers and the Book of Leviticus indicate. Hence arises the rite of the Shophar -- the Trumpet, or, in still more ancient usage, the Ram's Horn, which is blown by the High Priest in the Synagogue during the worship of the day. It was customary in the strictest Synagogues to offer up, on this day, in addition to the regular monthly sacrifices, a solemn holocaust in the name of the whole nation, and this consisted of a bullock, a ram, a kid, and seven lambs of the same year, with measures of flour and wine. Although, even in the Holy writings, the precise origin of the Feast of Trumpets is not distinctly stated, the entire period of the Rosh Hashonah proper, which covers two entire days, counting, according to Jewish custom, from sunset to sunset, is observed with the utmost reverence and solemnity, and the Israelite who does not, upon this occasion at least, worship like the rest in absolute penitence and self-abasement, to the exclusion of all worldly cares and occupations, is looked upon as abackslider from the ancient faith, and as one in extreme spiritual degradation and peril.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/26/archives/local-intelligence-rosh-hashona-the-jewish-newyear.html,,"Fifty thousand of our fellow-citizens of Hebrew blood were yesterday, and are to-day, engaged in one of the most ancient and solemn observances of the Jewish Faith.

"COMPLAINT OF THE VOLUNTEER SURGEONS. Great complaint is made in regard to the conduct  of many of the volunteer Surgeons, who recklessly amputate the limbs of the wounded, and leave them destitute of the care needed for their recovery.

We shall fall into a fatal error when we trust to ships, gunboats, or floating batteries alone, for the defence of our harbors or seacoast. All writers on military art agree on one point, that a land battery is in every way superior to one that floats. While the latter has to contend with an uncontrollable element, affecting the use of its guns, the precision of their aim, and the safety of its men from numberless causes, the first can fire from a firm foundation with a certainty of aim, and with a protection to its men that cannot be rated at less than ten to one. We will pass by the wooden ships in our calculation, and enter only upon those of iron, and yet not fail to see that vulnerable points are presented upon everything that floats, no matter how carefully constructed, that utterly outnumber the weak points of the weakest of our old stone fortifications.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Harbor Defences--Ships Against Forts on Land.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Harbor Defences--Ships Against Forts on Land.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a012f3cb-ed9d-5080-9299-10d57a09adec,1180,nyt://article/a012f3cb-ed9d-5080-9299-10d57a09adec

Nothing could more strikingly prove how firmly he believed himself to be engaged in a justifiable mission, and not in a civil war. He had, it seems, strictly enjoined on his followers not to fire on the royal troops, and even after he was wounded he repeated the order, GARIBALDI. does not explain how he expected to proceed after this peaceable, unresisting fashion, beyond saying that he ""entertained the hope that the regular troops had received orders less sanguinary."" The probability is, however, that he expected, when he refused to fire on the royal troops, they would join him with or without the consent of their commander. In this expectation he was sadly deceived, and it was perhaps not until he found himself a prisoner that he fully understood either his real position toward the Government or the real sentiment of the people.

"Brig.-Gen. PHELPS has just published in the New-York Tribune a full statement of the difficulties which he experienced in executing the President's policy of emancipation before it was adopted. This is the substance of the case set forth by the General -- and so far as he is personally concerned in the matter, it is too plain to need discussion, that he sacrificed his peace of mind, his permanent usefulness in Louisiana, and his commission, to a thoroughly and curiously mistaken theory of his duty and his responsibilities. He went to Louisiana as a military agent of the Government at Washington, under the orders of a Major-General, regularly appointed and charged with the supreme direction of affairs in the Department to which Brig.-Gen. PHELPS had been assigned. Much meditating the grave issues of Slavery and emancipation, as it is creditable to him that he should have done, Gen. PHELPS became convinced that the continued existence of Slavery is incompatible, in the first instance, with the progress of civilization at the South, and, in the second instance, with the maintenance of the National authority over the seceded States. Thus convinced, he forthwith proceeded to act upon his convictions, and to establish at ""Camp Parapet, near Garrollton, La.,"" a nucleus of free institutions for the South, reporting at the same time to his commanding officer that the Government at Washington really must come to some conclusion upon the question of emancipation, if it expected either to retain the services of Gen. PHELPS, or to put a satisfactory end to the rebellion. We mean no disrespect to Gen. PHELPS in this statement of his singular appeal -- for we are disposed to believe him as sincere and singleminded, as we cannot but think him mistaken in his estimate of his official obligations.

PHELPS, was finally compelled to interpose his superior authority in execution of certain orders, which the apostolic Brigadier had hesitated to obey, and an unpleasant collision, which could have had but one result, and that not an agreeable one for Gen.

It is only upon the excess of 40 ounces, belonging to any one person, that the tax of three cents per ounce is chargeable. As an encouragement of the family institution, the framers of the law have exempted those silver mugs, which are the peculiar endowments of babyhood. In fact, everything which does not come under the head of silver tableware ""kept for use,"" is exempt. While the law is thus tolerant of sliver ware, it puts a tax of 50 centsper troy ounce on all gold plate kept for use. People happening to have any of that kind of property in their houses, must have it weighed and certified to.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ca644d3-10c5-502d-b089-032848bb99d9,2577,nyt://article/7ca644d3-10c5-502d-b089-032848bb99d9

It is drawing upon itself the frowns of the friends of political morality everywhere. England, with her feet upon Ireland, and her bayonets pressing against the breast of India, admonishes us that all peoples ought to be free to choose their own political associations, and that government without love is selfish empire. Her rulers are expending $350,000,000 a year to maintain a dominion that has been won by the sword. The little Island reverberates with the clink of hammers, building iron-clad fighting ships, and with the peals of ordnance denoting the trial of Armstrong guns. The newspapers applaud the new militia system, which is to convert every Englishman into a capable soldier. England thinks of nothing, apparently, so much as war;prepares for nothing so much as war; contracts enormous debts freely only for war; and all the time berates all other nations -- the United States particularly -- for any indulgence in war, no matter what the provocation. Better give up national life; better surrender natural boundaries; better yield up forts, mints and custom-houses; better perish utterly from the map of nations, than go to war against rebels. So says England to the United States, but so did England never in all her career of a thousand years and more. England spends nearly as much in peace as the United States does in war -- 350 millions a year. And all this is gathered, or supposed to be, from the labor of a hard-worked people, who have a pinched area and slender means of work.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Nations that Judge Us.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Nations that Judge Us.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cd6c54e0-3f44-53f1-ae28-d69bb3b7a9dc,1023,nyt://article/cd6c54e0-3f44-53f1-ae28-d69bb3b7a9dc

Having settled it to their own satisfaction that the armies of the Confederates are everywhere practically in the ascendant, and that the safety of Washington depends upon keeping Gen. MCCLELLAN chained, with all the men whom we can muster, in a condition of masterly inactivity and leisurely observation, the estimable ""Conservatives"" have been sedulously fretting about their fears of the terrible consequences likely to be visited upon the loyal States if we do not make haste to propitiate the victorious South. Conquest of the seceded States being impossible, in their judgment, the time, they think, has come for averting the alternative conquest of the loyal States, by a frank and immediate surrender. Should we now go back into the presence of President DAVIS, like the burgesses of Calais before EDWARD III., with ropes about our necks, and walking upon our knees, it is just possible, they opine, that we might be forgiven, the Union reconstructed on a basis of general acquiescence in all Southern demands, Mr. LINCOLN and Mr. HAMLIN be pensioned off with liberty to reside in Liberia or Chiriqui, and FERNANDO WOOD be sent out as Minister to England or France, vice ADAMS or DAYTON, banished to Hayti for life, and MASON or SLIDELL recalled for domestic promotion. Should we, however, prove obstinate at this crisis; should we elect State Governors who prefer liberty and the nation's life with war, to peace with National death and Slavery, and in a general way aid and abet President LINCOLN in his efforts at emancipation, then it is not easy to say what may happen to us -- to what extremities of vengeance the outraged Confederates may proceed, or what dire chastisement a banded Europe will desire for a people so infatuated and so insolent as to think their National existence a thing worth fighting for.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Hope for the Democracy An Offer of Mercy from the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Hope for the Democracy An Offer of Mercy from the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/119625c1-fe74-5716-a9f5-3dbf4a17c47f,1027,nyt://article/119625c1-fe74-5716-a9f5-3dbf4a17c47f

London Shipping Gazette article says US proposes to issue letters of marque and reprisal to check hostilities by Southern privateers against US commerce,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/29/archives/letters-of-marque-proposal-issue-of-letters-of-marque-by-the-united.html,London Shipping Gazette article says US proposes to issue letters of marque and reprisal to check hostilities by Southern privateers against US commerce,"A Nova Scotian cotemporary, received by the ast mail, contains an axtract from the Newfoundland Royal Gazette, from which it appears that the Governor of that Colony has received a dispatch from the Duke of Newcastle, dated the 1st ult., intimating that Earl RUSSELL ""had been informed by the American Minister in London, that it is the intention of the United States Government to issue letters of marque, with a view of checking the hostilities carried on by Southern Privateers against United States Commerce."" This information the Duke of Newcastle has thought it right to communicate without delay to the Governors of Newfoundland and New-Brunswick, ""as serious inconveniences may result to British commerce from such a measure."" The promptitude of the Colonia Secretary is commendable, but it is somewhat strange that information so intimately concerning the carrying trade of this country, should have been left to find its way here from our North American Colonies. The notice which has made its appearance in the Government journal of Newfoundland should, unquestionably, have appeared in the Government journal here, in the first instance. Yet we are not aware that the London Gazette has contained any intimation on the subject of this officially reported communication of Mr. ADAMS to Earl RUSSELL, respecting privateering. The document, however, which has appeared in the Newfoundland Royal Gazette is evidently genuine. It is put forth ""by His Excellency's order,"" and bears the signature of the Acting Colonial Secretary. Assuming, then, that the Federal Government have resolved to carry out their intention with respect to the issue of letters of marque, the information is quite as necessary for our merchants and shipowners here as in the Colonies. If Federal privateers take the sea, they will probably not confine their operations to ""checking the hostilities carried on by Southern privateers against United States Commerce"" -- they will take the sea in aid of the Federal navy, either to assist in maintaining the blockade, or, what is more likely, to cooperate in effecting captures. Privateering has been formally abolished by the maritime States of Europe, Spain excepted, but it is still retained by America as a means of supplementing her naval force. There are two aspects in which the issue of letters-of-marque and reprisal may be regarded -- either as authority to ships to carry armaments for purposes of defence and capture, if attacked, or simply for the purpose of harrassing the commerce of the enemy, wherever it may be fallen in with -- or, as the old law of this country has it, ""to seize the property of the aggressor nation without hazard of being condemned as robbers or pirates."" Application was made early in the war to President LINCOLN to permit merchantmen to carry arms with a view to reprisals as well as defence, but it was refused. It would seem this refusal has been reconsidered, and that Northern merchantmen will be authorized to carry arms for purposes of aggression as well as defence. There can be no doubt that the law of nations justifies the Federal Government in resorting to this mode of increasing their maritime force. ""When a State which has received, or supposes it has received (says WHEATON, E.I.L., p. 372) an inquiry from another nation, it delivers commissions to its officers and subjects to take the persons and property belonging to the other nation wherever the same may be found."" This is the law of Reprisals as hitherto sanctioned by international usage, and the Cabinet of Washington are authorized to resort to it. But the evil of privateering consists in this -- that it superadds to patriotic motives those of private interest and cupidity, and has been found in the experience of nations to be most mischievous in its effects. Hence the Powers who met in Paris in 1856, agreed that its abolition was demanded by the progress of events as a remnant of barbarous warfare, inconsistent with the present advanced state of civilization. By the issue of letters-of-marque and reprisal, to meet the Southern privateers, the Federal Government at once concede the status of ""another nation"" to the Southern States. It is, however, incorrect to describe the Sumter, the Jeff. Davis, the Alabama, and other craft which have taken the sea under the Palmetto flag as privateers. They are, as the Confederate authorities assert, vessels commanded by officers regularly commissioned by the Confederate Government, and which have taken the sea in defence of the commerce of the South quite as much as to prey upon the commerce of the North. The point of view, however, in which we in this country must regard this issue of letters of marque by the Federal Government is, that it is intended thereby to reinforce the Federal fleet indefinitely, and, so far as neutral commerce has suffered inconvenience from the operations of that fleet, to increase that inconvenience. The armed vessels of the South are too few in number to necessitate a resort to privateering on the part of the North; but neutral vessels somehow do continue to enter and leave ports under blockade with valuable cargoes. These are the vessels for which the Northern privateers will be on the lookout, and not for the Sumter, that has long sizes changed hands at Gibraltar, the Alabama, or even the ubiquitous Ovieto. Hence it is, no doubt, that our Colonial Secretary has considered it his duty to warm our North American Colonists of the ""serious inconvenience which may result to British commerce from such a measure,"" a warning which we feel is quite as necessary for our shipowners and merchants here as for those of Newfoundland or New-Brunswick. Our Government, cannot, of course, dispute the right of the Federal Government to grant licences to private adventurers to arm ships, whether for purposes of aggression or defence; but it will be their duty to see that no interference with neutral lawful commerce is attempted, under any pretence whatever.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LETTERS OF MARQUE.; Proposal Issue of Letters of Marque by the United States Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LETTERS OF MARQUE.; Proposal Issue of Letters of Marque by the United States Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Shipping Gazette, Sept. 16', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Sept', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87ebc7f3-ae77-561f-bb76-86fca42dc810,989,nyt://article/87ebc7f3-ae77-561f-bb76-86fca42dc810

When, at the commencement of our troubles, everything looked dark and gloomy, it was freely prophested that the result of the war, should it long continue, as far as our City was concerned, would be to greatly injure its material prosperity. Many shrank appalled at the prospect, and all who could, prepared for the coming storm. The opinion most prevalent was that the withdrawal of the Southern trade, on which many of our merchants were dependent, would do the City great damage; that the anticipated general depression and stagnation of business throughout the country would keep at home the customers usually thronging to the City at stated periods, from our Northern cities and towns; that the people themselves would feel that they were about to be impoverished, and would in consequence curtail their expenses, and decrease their expenditures, to accord with the new order of things; that real estate in the City, influenced by the general feeling of uncertainty and doubt, would speedily deteriorate in value, and thus seriously affect a large portion of our community. Indeed, our Southern enemies, in the extremity of their hate, did not hesitate to assert that the North would be ruined, and that the City of New-York would no more be exultant in its wealth and prosperity. When, later, the immense army of the Republic had been placed in the field, and from every rural district, as well as from every city and town, our noble soldiers flocked to uphold their country's honor, and maintain their nation's integrity, fears were entertained that our farming interests would suffer from the want of labor -- that the transformation of our sturdy yeomen into hardy soldiers would cause whole sections, which, under other circumstances, would be cultivated and productive, to lie waste and useless. In all such speculations the people of this City were deeply interested. New-York has long been the City from which the people of our own land have drawn their supplies of merchandise and foreign commodities, and the port from whence had long been exported the stores of grain and provisions which other nations needed for their support. If, then, the war should cause this domestic demand to cease, and should also prevent the production of the articles of export, our City, more than any other, would be the sufferer.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; TRADE AND THE WAR.

"On Saturday morning Miss CARLOTTA PATTI made the adieux of her brief but brilliant first season on the lyric stage to a crowded and enthusiastically good-natured house at the Academy of Music. The opera selected for this occasion was ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" in which Miss PATTI had appeared the evening before, and which was rendered all the more satisfactorily by herself and by the whole corps for what may be considered fairly enough as a preliminary grand rehearsal. We feel bound, however, in commending, as we most heartily do, the successful courage of Miss PATTI, her friends and her impresario, in thus bringing her forward upon a new arena of triumphs, to repeat our verdict, given after her debut in the role of Amina, that her lyrical future belongs essentially to the airy and peaceful, rather than to the intense and passionate school of art. In saying this we imply no censure, remember, for we simply indicate a vocation. To ask a prima-donna worthily to interpret for us the flutter of Zerline in the coils of the tempter, the enchanting coquetry of Rosina, the simple pathos of Linda, the rustic despair of the slandered Amina, is to offer her one of the most charming and brilliant careers possible upon the stage. That Miss PATTI, whether as singer or as actress, is scarcely equal to the lyrical and the dramatic force of Lucia, was sufficiently evident on Saturday, though her conception of the character was good, and her execution of the music, save in certain particulars which deserve kindly notice, was brilliant and accurate. The quality of Miss PATTI's voice betrays her, in passages which demand extreme frankness and fullness of declamatory emotion, into a shrillness which sometimes (as was the case very notably in the trio on Saturday) amounts to positive thinness and wiriness. She is apt, too, to exhaust her force too rapidly on the earlier phrases of an air, and though this mistake may possibly be due to the circumstance that, in passing from the concert room to the stage, Miss PATTI has not yet learned to measure accurately the, immense increase of the demand which the latter makes upon the strength and sustained volume of the voice over the former, it is a perilous mistake, which must lead to very bad effects, unless it be corrected in time, as it very easily can be.",https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/29/archives/music-miss-carlotta-patti-and-mr-nixons-season-of-opera.html,,"On Saturday morning Miss CARLOTTA PATTI made the adieux of her brief but brilliant first season on the lyric stage to a crowded and enthusiastically good-natured house at the Academy of Music.

During her engagement, she has played in ""The Hunchback,"" ""The Lady of Lyons,"" Romeo and Juliet,"" ""Geraldine,"" ""Rosa Gregorlo"" and ""Macbeth,"" and has produced a new piece called ""Beatrix, the Madonna of Art."" ""Beatrix"" is an adaptation of a play by LEGOUVE, (a former co-laborer with SCRIBE in some of the best pieces attributed to the latter,) and written for the purpose of introducing Madame RISTORI to the Parisian public, in a character wherein should speak the language of her audience. The piece achieved a great success, and ran through nearly a whole season. It will never cause a sensation on the American stage; still it is a neatly-constructed, interesting sort of piece, very well worth seeing. The plot of it runs briefly thus: A Grand Duchess of one of those extraordinary German principalities that have Courts and Cabinets and armies and all the other pharaphernalia of nationality, yet are no bigger than so many Jersey farms, is possessed with a desire to render the little six-by-nine dominion, which she rules in the absence of the Prince, her son, as renowned for the presence of great minds in every department of art as it is contemptible in actual extent. To this end, she invites, among other notabilities, Beatrix a wonderful Italian actress and as virtuous as she is talented, to lend the lustre of her genius to certain festivities which are in contemplation at the palace. Beatrix accepts and arrives in company with her manager, Mr. KINGSTON. An American, who may be said to embody a French dramatist's idea of Mr. BARNUM. The great aim of the indefatigable KINGSTON is to prevent his Beatrix falling in love, as he has a contract with her, whereby he is bound to gain a fortune if no matrimonial engagement should induce her to break her business one. In aid of his purpose he secures the services of one Captain Kaerner a rejected suitor of Beatrix who binds himself for certain considerations to kill any rival who shall dare to make her an offer. It chances, however, that a dangerous lover appears upon the scene in the person of Prince Frederick, the Duchess's younger son, who had previously seen Beatrix in Vienna, and become madly infatuated with her. The idolatry of the lover, the struggle in the heart of Beatrix to stifle or disguise the reciprocal passion which she feels, the unconsciousness of the Grand Duchess, the anxieties of the manager, and the jealous perturbations of Captain Kaerner give rise to numerous effective situations. The closing scene, in which Beatrix (learning the dignity to which, by the death of an uncle and resignation of a brother, Prince Frederick is advanced) rejects the crown he wishes to share with her, (because she seems to think it might injure him in the estimation of the world to marry an actress,) might be made very impressive if it were judiciously elaborated a trifle.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1862-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7f18d5d-55b7-5f76-9026-2de77cc8e3dd,1315,nyt://article/d7f18d5d-55b7-5f76-9026-2de77cc8e3dd

October,https://www.nytimes.com/1862/09/30/archives/the-magazines.html,October,"-- The Atlantic, for October, opens with a charming paper -- ""Autumnal Tints"" -- by the late HENRY D. THOREAU; ""King of the Gypsies"" he was called while he lived, the forest was his home, and birds and herbs his most familiar companions. He was on talking terms with oaks. The aspen forgot to tremble in his presence, the mimosa to shrink at his approach. And he reproduces the tints of our autumnal woods with a freshness and faithfulness that passes the skill of other men. ""David Gaunt"" is brought to an end in the current number -- ""Mr. Axtell"" unfortunately is not. NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE contributes a pleasant paper -- ""Leamington Spa."" From the ""Spa"" comes bubbling up a question that is certainly worth serious consideration. Let Sir CRESSWELL CRESSWELL listen: ""I wonder whether a middle-aged husband ought to be considered as legally married to all the accretions that have overgrown the slenderness of his bride, since he led her to the altar, and which make her so much more than he ever bargained for?"" Here is, indeed, a vast field for speculation opened, which only the Divorce courts can adequately solve. ""House Building"" is an architectural article by J. ELIOT CABOT. Dr. EDWARD JARVIS discourses of the sanitary condition of the army. E.H. DEBBY treats of the resources of the South. An interesting memoir is given of ELISABETH SARA SHEPPARD, with a brief paper -- a niche in the heart -- by this lamented authoress.

On investigation, it appears that the deceased, THOMPSON, who was a married man, had been residing with a colored woman other than his wife, for some time past at the above-mentioned place. At 6 o'clock, his wife, who goes by the name of AMANDA THOMPSON, came into his room, and while he was in bed some conversation ensued between them, the nature of which has not transpired. After a few moments AMANDA drew a razor from her pocket and cut her husband's throat, inflicting a most ghastly wound. The deceased sprang up from the bed and followed the murderess a few feet, but he almost immediately fell to the ground and expired in about ten minutes. AMANDA deliberately walked from the room to the street, and thence to the Fifth Precinct Station-house, where she delivered herself up to the officer in charge, stating what she had done.

"how utterly shameless and fraudulent are those exposures of private property to public outcry, known as Sheriff's sales. The knowledge has, however, been thrust upon them by Judge BARNARD, who took occasion a few days since to say in open court, and for the benefit of John Doe, Richard Roe and others, that those sales are illusory; ""that they are attended by a lot of Jews and swindlers, bidding collusively, and, finally, the property is disposed of to one of the gang."" It was the opinion of the magistrate that the profession should apply for orders to sell property taken in execution through other channels.
