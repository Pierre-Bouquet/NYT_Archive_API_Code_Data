"AFTER SADOWA. -- In dealing with Austria the Prussian Government showed a wise moderation. It annexed no territory, and the pecuniary indemnity claimed was nor unreasonable, being limited to 20,000,000 thalers from Austria and about 8,000,000 thalers from Saxony for the cost of the war. The end was attained when Prussia became the supreme arbiter of Germany, and the Emperor and King of Austria-Hungary ceased to form part of the Germanic body.
