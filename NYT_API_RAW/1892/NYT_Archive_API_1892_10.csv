"From the Christian Union. Among the Spectator's friends is a Scotchman who came to this country young, prospered here, married here, but has often visited the old country, making in all nearly a hundred voyages. One of these voyages was made in 1851, with his young wife. That was the year of the great World's Fair, when the Crystal Palace dazzled the eyes of the visitors, whose wonderful tales spread the marvel far and wide.
