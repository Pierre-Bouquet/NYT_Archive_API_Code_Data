",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/01/archives/the-death-of-lord-palmerston.html,,"The sudden removal of the British Premier from human affairs will probably facilitate the peaceful settlement of our difficulties with England. Though not in direct charge of the Foreign Department, beyond all doubt he had a large part in the practical shaping of its policy. That policy never more unmistakably bore his personal impress, even during the long years when he was the Foreign Secretary. The one thing which, above all others, ever marked his diplomacy, was his eagerness to form revolutionary alliances, and at the very earliest stage. He began with the French revolution of July, 1830, but had no chance to deal with that in advance, since it was accomplished almost as soon as it was attempted. But he played no small part in the subsequent revolutionary movements of Belgium, Spain and Portugal, and ever afterward meddled, at every opportunity, on the continent in favor of the party of subversion. His attachment to liberal principles was not the motive, as was proved by his quickness to approve and recognise Louis NAPOLEON's coup de etat, for which he was compelled to leave office. The practice came from two other traits -- one, his constitutional fondness for troubled waters, and ingrained love of mischief, and the other his intense nationality of spirit, and consequent anxiety to build up British influence. These qualities not only shaped his policy toward revolutionary governments, prompting him to form the most intimate relation with them at the earliest stage, but continually manifested themselves in his ordinary treatment of foreign nations. There has hardly been a Cabinet in Europe, when he was in power, which he did not manage to offend by gaining some undue advantage. Nothing suited him better than to be walking on the giddy brink of war; and he habitually carried the spirit of war into the relations of peace. He always, whenever occasion offered, manifested this disposition toward our own country, whether out of power or in. Thus he made his famous onslaught upon the Ashburton treaty, stigmatizing it from his seat in Parliament as the ""Ashburton capitulation."" The fact is notorious that the United States have had no serious difficulties with England for the last quarter of a century that were not attributable to his policy. It was he that made the frivolous claim to the possession of the Bay Islands and the Mosquito protectorate; and he that persisted in a purpose to make enlistments in America for the British service, contrary to our laws. His whole tone and temper toward us, and his mode of applying principles to facts, as they arose, was always unfair and irritating -- in marked contrast with the manifestations of the Tory leaders, when they were in power, although every reason would have justified our expecting from each party precisely the reverse.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Death of Lord Palmerston.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Death of Lord Palmerston.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f3dd6df-85e4-53b4-b353-50edc7b69834,967,nyt://article/2f3dd6df-85e4-53b4-b353-50edc7b69834

The present intelligence offices are, for all practical purposes, utterly useless to families. The servants recommend are often entirely untrustworthy; they make engagements to go to a place in the city or country, and then, without warning, coolly leave the employer in the lurch and the family unprovided for. They are no better fitted for their work, frequently, than girls that could be picked up in any tenement-house. The office never seems to pay the slightest attention to their references, and one may get a thievish or even a drunken servant from such an agency, without the slightest redress, and knowing that from that or some other office she will secure a good situation, as soon as she leaves you. The ""help"" that are furnished by many of the intelligence agencies are by no means worthy of their name. They are often ignorant of the simplest details of housekeeping; they cannot cook a steak or dust a room properly, or bake bread that can be eaten, or make up a bed. They are frequently slatternly, irregular and lazy. The choice in an office is worse than a ticket in a city lottery.

BABCOCK, of No. 223 Bay-street, Jersey City, requesting him to indorse a note for $200, and offering a bill of sale of the sloop as security. He subsequently asked Mr. BABCOCK to advance money for repairs, and Mr. BABCOCK expended $523 on the vessel, SHAUGHNESSY continuing to run her to the Kills for sand, and one day last week she was sunk at the Kills and abandoned by her master. Capt. BABCOCK raised the sloop and took possession, and on Saturday night, it is alleged, SHAUGHNESSY went to Capt. BABCOCK's pier with a junk-dealer and attempted to take away the vessel's rigging, but was surprised and driven off by the night watchman. Not to be balked thus, SHAUGHNESSY is alleged to have gone on board the sloop on Monday night, and with JOSEPH DUFFY to have stolen her at 1 o'clock yesterday morning.

Securities Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/01/archives/our-securities-abroad.html,Securities Abroad,"-- The news by the Damascus assures us of the restoration of confidence abroad in the ""good intentions"" of our national rulers, and, consequently, in American securities. At an early hour, yesterday, the City of Boston reached this port, with advices of panic and depression in the money and stock circles of London, and a fall of 1 1/2@2 per cent. in United States 5-20s, under a false report which appeared in the London Times, to the effect that our government had sent ""threatening letters"" to France, and that indifference to our threats would assuredly lead to ""a breach of the public peace."" The one day later intelligence, by the Quebec steamer, indicates that the monied interests of the British capital had been convinced of the utter absurdity of such a mischievous rumor, and that there would be no danger -- save the seductive peril of making money -- in locking up hard cash in United States securities at the ruling figures in the London market. The quotations for Five-Twenties by the Damascus show that the ground lost prior to the departure of the City of Boston had been fully recovered. The market comes now reported as strong and buoyant. The probability is that decided improvement will be reported by the steamers now on their way hither. The latest London figures for United States Five-Twenties are 64 1/2@64 3/4, without the November coupon, representing three per cent in gold, the addition of which would make the closing prices, as reported by the Damascus, 67 1/2@67 3/4, or with gold at 146, equal to something over 107 1/4 in the home market.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR SECURITIES ABROAD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR SECURITIES ABROAD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80cc16ac-53d0-5d1d-af2d-5c56d5782801,409,nyt://article/80cc16ac-53d0-5d1d-af2d-5c56d5782801

Every toiler in the realm of honorable industry is inspired with new encouragement and confidence. The moral, intellectual and religious interests of society have been steadily advancing, and the annals of the State and the nation have been consecrated by heroic achievements and patriotic devotion. The unhallowed disturbance of the nation's rights and security has yielded to the healthful calm of peace, resulting in the salvation and extension of the public liberties.

M.S. DRIGGS Co., were destroyed by fire in April last. They have been rebuilt with great care, and were opened to public inspection yesterday. The fire by which the stores were destroyed, originated in the cooperage factory opposite, the intense heat from which burst the shutters on the bonded stores from the fastenings. To guard against this in future double iron shutters have been added, separated by an air-chamber of 20 inches; the inside shutter, being suspended on rollers, can only be opened by sliding. Messrs. DRIGGS have introduced, as an additional protection, a duplex steam fire engine of great power and capacity -- built by the Woodward Steam Pump Manufacturing Company -- throwing four 1 1/2-inch streams simultaneously, or 2,500 gallons of water per minute. The water is carried to the Water-street front through a 4-inch iron pipe, so as to prevent any damage by water to goods in store in case of a fire in the rear. The steam boiler is placed in a separate and thoroughly fire-proof compartment, built under the supervision and direction of the Rate Committee, of the Board of Underwriters. It would be difficult to suggest any additional precautions, and the enterprise commends itself to the patronage of the public.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/26e388ad-dc33-5d35-8371-7f8515c3c964,840,nyt://article/26e388ad-dc33-5d35-8371-7f8515c3c964

Not for years has there been so little political excitement during the last week before the election. This comes from two opposite causes -- the confidence of the Union party, and the utter hopelessness of its opponents. When the two tickets were first put into the field, there was some prospect of a brisk struggle. The marvelous change of front which the Democratic Convention made in adopting the main principles of the Union party, its resorting to; the Union party for some of its most important candidates, and its audacious claim to the peculiar championship of President JOHNSON, made it appear that possibly a rally and dash might be made which would severely test our strength. But soon it became obvious that the tactics of the convention had really made the party less formidable than ever. The number of War Democrats who were induced to return to their old ranks was exceedingly small, while the very shifting of ground produced profound dissatisfaction among all the Peace Democrats who had any regard to consistency. What the Freeman's Journal says of its party in its last issue, is strictly correct: ""The Democracy are disorganized; they have neither the spirit nor the organization of the old party."" The attempt which has been made by some of the party prints to make up a false issue of freedman suffrage against the Union party, has amounted to nothing, for the simple reason that in no State Convention has the Union party declared itself in favor of imposing that suffrage upon the South against its will. It is true that the most of the Union party would be pleased if the Southern States would admit the freedmen, at least the most intelligent and deserving portion of them, to the ballot box. In that they agree fully with the frankly declared sentiments of President JOHNSON. But that is a very different matter from insisting upon the government of freedmen suffrage by the Southern States, as a sine qua non to restoration. The people understand the difference, and have not cared a button for all the Democratic rant upon the subject.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Aspect of the Canvass.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Aspect of the Canvass.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abf684ba-5057-5554-abe8-27468ff95e1e,717,nyt://article/abf684ba-5057-5554-abe8-27468ff95e1e

"Newtown, Queens Co., Extensive Seizure at",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/02/archives/brooklyn-news.html,"Newtown, Queens Co., Extensive Seizure at","DISCOVERY OF A COUNTERFEITING DEN -- DIES, PLATES AND CHEMICALS SEIZED BY THE POLICE AND ARREST OF ONE OF THE GUILTY PARTIES. -- A manufactury of counterfeit United States postal currency and greenbacks was recently discovered in the vicinity of Newtown, Queens County, by Inspector FOLK and detectives attached to his office. It appears that about two months since a party of five Italians rented a two-story frame house, about one mile from the village, which they have since occupied. As there were no women about the place the neighbors grew suspicious and the light there must be something wrong. A noise similar to that made by a sewing machine was frequently heard. Three savage dogs were kept on the premises, and very few persons cared to visit their new neighbors. It was also ascertained that they had two guns and a revolver, which were constantly loaded and placed in such positions that they could be easily reached. It was likewise discovered that the farmers in the vicinity were relieved of considerable quantities of corn, beans, &c., and taken all together, it was deemed proper to inform the authorities. Accordingly, on Thursday of last week, a delegation waited upon Inspector FOLK, and related all the circumstances within their knowledge. The Inspector visited the place, and becoming satisfied that all was not right, made preparations for a more thorough examination. Accordingly, on Monday night last, he proceeded to Newtown with nearly his whole detective force. Arriving at the house some time before daylight on Tuesday morning, they rapped at the door, but receiving no answer, forced their way inside. Ascending to the second story they found a man asleep. He was soon awakened, however, and made aware of the object of their visit. The sole occupant of the premises feigned ignorance, but had sufficient self-possession and knowledge of the English language to make them understand he was engaged there as cook. As for anything else he knew nothing. The officers then proceeded to the garret, where they found a quantity of note paper (blank) and a number of cords stretched across from beam to beam, which they inferred were used to dry the paper after printing. A lot of chemicals, red and green fluid, gold dust of superior quality, and instruments used by engravers. were found in the closets. They then descended to the cellar, and observed new ground which had apparently been taken from the garden. Procuring the necessary implements, they dug down about two feet, when they struck some wooden boxes, all carefully wrapped up in cloths. Exhuming these they discovered a small printing press, and a large number of platea and dies. Several plates contain 42 dies, each of 25 cents postal currency, others plates were engraved for $5 and some for $20 greenbacks, and still others for 50 cents postal currency and $30 Treasury notes. The engraving had been obs[???]rated on some of the plates, but the 25 cent dies were perfect, and of superior workmanship. From the appearance of the dies it is believed that impressions taken from them cannot be distinguished from the genuine. No printed bills were found, but from the amount of paper cinders in the stoves (of which there were two) it is believed that the manufactured [???] still on [???] had been burned so as to destroy all the [???] possible of the guilt of the counterfeiters. With this view the plates were defaced, but it seems they had not the requisite time to finish the job. The parties doubtless had an intimation of what was going on, and made preparations accordingly. The principals left the neighborhood the previous day and are still at large. The man arrested gave his name as GIOVANNI GUCHERI. Some of the officers believe him to be one of the party who were, some months since, arrested on the charge of being implicated in the murder of ANTONIO DIODATI, but he denies it. He was brought, to Brooklyn, and is now confined in the Forty-first Precinct Station-house.

A very great number of arrests of guilty parties have been reported within a few months, but so far we have heard of only one case of conviction.

They have everywhere, East and West, treated with scorn all the wooing of the Democratic party to support its tickets. The trick of making military nominations to win their confidence in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Iowa, has been unavailing. The soldiers are implacable against the party which nursed Copperheadism, and which pronounced the war, wherein they were pouring out their blood, ""a failure,"" the party, too, which did its best to bar them from the ballot-box. The army was the embodiment of the war spirit against the rebellion; and it is a moral impossibility that those who composed it should now turn themselves over to that party which was the conglomerate of everything that had any measure of sympathy with the rebellion. It is not in human nature for an organization of men who have poured out their blood for any cause to fraternize afterward with those who sought to betray that cause. Every day's perils encountered for the flag only made the soldier all the more devoted to it; and he worshiped it the most when most rent by the battle's rage From the beginning, the army hated all factionists and malcontents.

For example, the laws made for the whites in regard to the marriage and family relations, their duties and responsibilities, cannot at once, in their entirety, be applied to the blacks, for the reason that the marriage and family relations of the latter, have heretofore been, and still are, in the greatest uncertainty and confusion.

The first candidate in age and experience is undoubtedly Lord RUSSELL, to whom, we believe, Her Majesty has intrusted the task of reconstructing the Cabinet. He has himself held the office of Prime Minster for six years, and has served the crown in a number of important and difficult, offices. He is one of the last of those who took part in passing the first Reform Bill, for death has been very busy among these for the last few years; he was at one time the acknowledged head of the Whig party, and has an European reputation second to no other British statesman. With so many recommendations, it may be thought that we need look no further than Lord RUSSELL, and that his task would be comparatively easy. These great recommendations are, however, cancelled by still greater defects. Lord RUSSELL is a member of the House of Lords, and it is a source of weakness to any government to separate the office of Prime Minister from the leadership of the House of Commons. The two positions mutually strengthen each other. The Minister is more powerful from his Influence over the House, and the Leader has more authority from his position as Minister. To separate the two is a waste of power. Lord RUSSELL is, besides, considerably past seventy years of age, and though we have been recently governed with vigor and success by a Minister of upward of eighty, it may not, perhaps, be wise to give to this preference for antiquity the strength of two successive precedents. The accession of Lord RUSSELL to power will weaken the government by detaching from it a considerable number of Irish supporters. The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill has not yet been forgotten, and the same cause which has expelled from Parliament almost every Irish Liberal member who supported that measure, would deprive the government of a considerable part of the support which it now expects from Ireland. But there is more to be said. A new generation has arisen since Lord RUSSELL was Prime Minister, his name has lost much of its influence, and the association connected with it are becoming obsolete. The reputation gained by one Reform Bill has been somewhat impaired by three futile attempts to pass another. Nobody knows what Lord RUSSELL's present position with regard to reform is.

In the United Kingdom, the occasion would naturally make this topic paramount, but at least as much anxiety prevails on the continent to ascertain who is the coming man. It is not, perhaps, too much to assert that the demise of this influential personage has attracted more attention in foreign countries and given rise to greater anxiety than the loss in either of one of their own Cabinet Ministers or diplomatists would have done. In France, LOUIS NAPOLEON is deprived of one of his staunchest and most serviceable friends, while the Liberal cause in Europe, despite some indefensible inconsistencies on the part of the deceased Viscount, has undoubtedly experienced the loss of one of its most valuable supporters.

Mr. Romeyn Killed,"ACCIDENT ON THE ERIE RAILWAY -- ONE MAN KILLED. -- An accident occurred on the New-York and Erie Railway on Friday night, resulting in the death of Rev. Mr. ROMEYN, Pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Sloatsburgh, and injury to two others. As far as ascertained, the particulars are as follows: The way-passenger train from Jersey City at a quarter past four o'clock on Friday night, on arriving at the water tank about a mile west of Ramapo, crossed over on the eastern-bound track for the purpose of taking in water, and, as is alleged, flagmen were sent out to warn approaching trains. While engaged taking water, No. 22 freight train came down on the eastern-bound track, and it appears did not discover the signal until it was too late to avoid a collision. The engineer of the western-bound train, with great presence of mind, at once commenced to back his train, and by so doing undoubtedly prevented a terrible accident. As it was, the collision was of sufficient force to do considerable damage to the engines, and break up the baggage-cars and platforms of a number of the passenger-cars. Rev. Mr. ROMEYN, who was standing on one of the platforms at the time, was crushed to death. A German, whose name could not be ascertained, had one leg crushed and the other badly injured, and another man had his ancle badly bruised. It is said that no persons in the cars were injured. The German was taken to Turner's Station, where his leg was amputated by Dr. GENOA, of the New-York Hospital, who was a passenger on the train. His recovery is doubtful.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.; Williamsburgh.

The veracity of the latter statement, as well as its necessity, may well be questioned. The sternest managerial duty hardly justify the withdrawal of a work which the public demands. Our confidence in this Spartan resolve is somewhat shaken, too, by noticing that the come opera of ""Crispino e la Comare"" which was played for the ""last"" time on Tuesday of the past week, will be repeated to-morrow night. At the time we ventured to suggest that it was a pity to shelve this very agreeable work. It is with entire satisfaction, therefore, that we hear of its restoration to the programme A satisfactory demonstration of the popularity of the music was made on Saturday, when, notwithstanding the terrible storm, a brilliant and large audience assembled at the matinee, and seemed to enjoy itself in defiance of the elements. Mr. MALETZEK's announcements for the week are full of interest. They are as follows: Tonight, (Monday,) ""Robert le Diablo"" to-morrow (Tuesday,) ""Crispino e la Comare:"" Wednesday, ""Rigoletto:"" Thursday, opera in Brooklyn; Friday, ""Fra Diavolo;"" Saturday, a grand combination matinee, and on Saturday evening, a grand extra performance for the benefit of the Benevolent Dramatic and Musical Association.

It was the second of a series of three games between DUDLEY KAVANAGH, who for nearly two years was champion of America, and PIERRE CARME, a renowned expert from France. The first game, which was the three-ball carom game, was played in the hall adjoining the Fifth-avenue Hotel on the 5th of last month, and on that occasion CARME was successful by 26 points in a score of 250 up. Immediately after this CARME commenced practice for the four-ball game, which was entirely new and very perplexing to him; yet in a day or two, while he was progressing finely, he was seized with a pulmonary attack, from the effects of which he has scarcely recovered at the present time. As this completely interrupted his training, and as it was deemed certain no postponement would be allowed, he had almost determined to forfeit; but a few days since, being enabled to resume practicing, his progress was so rapid that his friends advised him to play the match.

George Wilkes and Com. Vanderbilt, for $2,000; Atlantic vs. Athletic at Brooklyn","In the previous match contest in harness between these champion stallions of the trotting turf, when the driver of Wilkes pulled into Vanderbilt and broke him up badly, Wilkes was the winner. Without meaning to imply that this accident was intentional; on the contrary, believing that it happened by a mistake of Wilkes' driver, who endeavored to get his horse down from a bad break by pulling him on the wrong side; yet the result of the accident was the same for Vanderbilt, who never recovered the effects of that break throughout the remainder of the race. The return match between these two horses to wagons was set down for Thursday last, but The weather on that day proved too bad for frotting purposes, and the conditions being ""fair day and good track,"" the match was postponed from day to day until yesterday, when it came off. The rules of the trotting turf are definite and conclusive enough, and certainly imply that when a match is made for a certain day, with the conditions of ""a fair day and good track,"" if lack of these conditions compels its postponement, all bets are off; and that when the match comes to an issue, it has to be regarded as a new race; so, however, do not argue the judges of the Union Track. On Thursday last, prior to the setting in of the storm which precluded the trotting of the match, the usual toss for choice of places took place, and Wilkes won the pole -- a considerable advantage in a close race, as all trotting men are fully aware. The judges yesterday without any foundation decided by a vote of two to one, that the chances of last Thursday should hold good for yesterday, when the former was a past and undecided event. By what process of reasoning they arrived at this conclusion, is best known to themselves. Perhaps the umpire judge could best explain this matter, and not the one appointed either by the owner of Wilkes or Vanderbilt. Nevertheless the old adage of ""judge knowing the best"" was acted on, and the dictum of the judicial trio was submitted to not, however, without some just murmurings on the part of the malcontents. The betting had been for several days previously strongly in favor of the stallion Wilkes, and prior to the start it stood at $100 to $30 on him against his opponent.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.; The Trotting Match for $2,000 Between the Stallions George Wilkes and Commodore Vanderbilt--Wilkes the Winner--Time, 2:34 1-2, 2:30, 2:29 1-2,2:31 1-2.

"Mr. Jacob Patterson, of Munroe, Orange County, N.Y., had been suffering for years from Consumption with a severe putrid infections sore throat, to make new of his own words, a hurried respiration, hot and offensive breath, the skin of a burning and disagreeable heat, without the least moisture; the pulse quick, hard and irregular, averaging from 100 to 140 strokes per minute; the month and throat presenting a fiery appearance, the palate and glands painfully swelled; combined with a pain in the chest, the whole countenance presenting a ghastly, cadaverous look; the white part of the eye had [???]pearly, unnatural appearance, and, strange to say, the eye itself beamed with sparkling animation and lustre; the expectoration was copious and frequent; white, frothy and sometimes tough opaque substance, solid, of a yellow or green color, having a fetid smell when thrown on bursting coals. In this infected state he was treated by the most eminent physicians he could find, but the excruciating pain in his side and chest, which became insupportable, so much alarmed his friends, that in this last dismal waste of life, he was taken to the well-known Dr. Von Eisenberg, of our city. At the doctor's office he complained of weakness at the least bodily exertion, and when placed in the examination chair, the breathing was fearful, the pulse was small and quicker than natural; he complained of a tightness, as if a cord were drawn across the chest. The doctor, with his usual care, made an accurate diagnosis of the case, expressed willingness to undertake to treat him, and to attend to him to the best of his ability. The doctor declared himself to be always impressed with a decided belief that our wise and beneficent Creator has placed within the reach of his feeble creature man, a cure for all diseases; that he has often cured this fatal complaint by assiduous attention and careful judgment. The preliminary arrangements were made; Dr. Von Eisenberg operated on the patient, after which Mr. Patterson declared himself to be very much relieved, since which time the patient has been under the doctor's care for a few weeks. To the patient's inexpressible delight, as well as to the great satisfaction of his friends, he has entirely recovered, and has just now come to New-York for the purpose of asking the doctor to allow him to resume his usual business. He looks remarkably strong, and his face is filled out and looks stouter than ever it has been; in fact, he says for the last twelve years he never enjoyed a single night's rest, and now he sleeps as sound as an infant; and, according to his own words, he seems to have an iron digestion.

"Republic, Steamship; Chief Officers' Boat Rescued",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/08/archives/the-wrecked-steamer-republic-arrival-of-the-boat-of-the-chief.html,"Republic, Steamship; Chief Officers' Boat Rescued","Yesterday morning the steamer Gen. Hooker arrived in port, bringing twelve of the passengers and crew of the ill-fated Republic. The history of these people is truly distressing, they having suffered everything but death. The boat under the command of the chief officer, S.[???]. YOUNG, left the Republic just as she was going down, and in a few minutes swamped; but owing to the energy and coolness of those on board, the boat was cleared of water and kept head on the sea till daylight. By a singular good fortune, Capt. GEO. W. MCNAIR, late of the ship Inspector, was on board the boat, and as the chief officer was exhausted by his efforts to save the steamship, Capt. McNair took the management of the boat, so as to give Mr. YOUNG some time to rest; and the passengers kept rowing with a desperation which only the fate before them could inspire. The demijohn containing the only water on board got broken before one drop of it was used -- thus thirst, more terrible than anything that can be describe, was added to their other calamities. The boat had no provisions except salt meal and ship bread, which got saturated with salt water, with [???] exception of three cans of preserved fruit. T[???] may be said to have saved the lives of the people[???] the boat, and were kept to the very last. On [???]day, every one having become so much exhausted that it was impossible to make headway by rowing, a table-cloth was found in the boat, and they extemporized a sail, and with that the boat was kept on her course to the westward, as well as could be done with nothing but sun and the stars to guide them. Thursday night was one of intense suffering, and insanity, the invariable result of exposure, want of sleep and thirst, began to exhibit itself. Friday morning came, and no sail, no land in sight. It was water -- water everywhere. The imagination of all on the boat began to conjure up sights and sounds which were only imagination. Insanity was dawning upon every mind. At about 10 in the morning of Friday, a sail in the distance was discovered, and, as the breeze had died away, the sail in the boat was taken down, and the oars again assumed for a pull for life. They kept on for hours, but could not gain on the sail in the distance, and finally gave up. Having worked in the sun with all the energy possible so long, and yielding the chase in disappointment at last, the sensation of thirst now seemed, at this time, to be unendurable. Men's throats were swollen, their jaws set, and speech began to be difficult. As a last resort, the whole party jumped into the sea to bathe and absorb moisture externally. It seemed to allay the burning thirst. Soon another soil came in sight in the opposite direction, and, as a last effort, the boat was reversed and they began to pull for it. The sail proved to be the barkentine Horace Beals, from New-York, commanded by Capt. JOSEPH BLANKENSHIP, who picked them up at 6 o'clock P.M., after they had been in the water for fifty-one hours; and every thing that could be done for their comfort was done by Capt. BLANKENSHIP. They could not stand when they were hoisted upon his deck, but were soon restored by the use of stimulants and water. If ever a man was a nobleman by nature, who held his patent direct from his Maker, that man was Capt. JOSEPH BLANKENSHIP. The survivors cannot say too much in his praise. From the time they were taken on board till Sunday evening, they remained upon his ship, when the steamer Gen. Hooker came up and took them off, and brought them to this port yesterday morning.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WRECKED STEAMER REPUBLIC.; Arrival of the Boat of the Chief Officer at Charleston.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WRECKED STEAMER REPUBLIC.; Arrival of the Boat of the Chief Officer at Charleston.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Charleston News, Nov. 1', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Nov', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f31284e-4400-5511-958e-18a63bcda0a1,1004,nyt://article/0f31284e-4400-5511-958e-18a63bcda0a1

Quite early the voters appeared at the polls, and without trouble, annoying delay or provoking challenge, deposited each his ballot and retired. So signal a victory is rarely won as that gained by the believers in the efficacy of the Registry Law. Its beneficial influence was felt at every poll and by every inspector; the labors of the officials were wonderfully lightened, the delay so vexatious to business men was entirely obviated, frauds were effectually guarded against, and peace, quiet and good order reigned throughout the borders of a city, whose election days have been memorable for rows and riots since their earnest date.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CITY.; ENTHUSIASM BETTING SCENES ABOUT TOWN THE REPUBLICANS TAMMANY HALL CAPT.

"As early as 6 o'clock in the evening crowds commenced to assemble round the TIMES and other newspaper offices, anxiously waiting for news from the various districts. Of course no returns were received at so early an hour, yet the public were on hand, and waited with exemplary patience for the figures which were to show whether or not their favorite candidates had been elected. For the first few hours, the returns came in slowly, and it was not until after 10 o'clock that the total vote of any ward was known. The TIMES had made ample provision for bulletining the returns as received, and immense crowds congregated in and around the office, those who could not catch a sight of the figures depending on their friends in front to keep them posted up. Here were the merchant and the banker, the resident of Fifth-avenue and of the Bowery, the man who owns a fast team and the one who drives a butcher's cart, touching elbows, and all apparently equally interested in watching the magic figures, which told of hopes realized or of aspirations dashed to the ground. The little work girl, who had spent the weary day in some dark left toiling until hands and brain were weary, stopped as she passed the newspaper offices to see who was the fortunate candidate. The telegraph boy with his message, the porter with his load, the fast man fresh from his carouse, pater familias hurrying home to his family and fireside, could not resist the opportunity of one glance at the bulletin. Many were the means adopted by the crowds around the offices for passing the time. The qualities and chances of success of the various candidates were of course freely discussed. Men bet greenbacks, boys bet peanuts on their favorites. The operations of the Registry Law offered a never-ending subject of discussion. The Democrats appeared to be, for some reason not particularly clear, entirely opposed to it. ""This law,"" said a resident of the Second Ward, ""was evidently intended to choke off the Democratic vote. It's only of another piece with the census swindle. At the last Presidential election our district (the first) cast 144 votes for MCCLELLAN, and now the district only gives, according to that bulletin, 147 votes in all. Can anything be plainer than that this law was meant to kill the Democrats?"" ""But,"" said a Republican, ""the law bears just as hard on us as on you. Our vote in that district for LINCOLN was 127, and now we only give BARLOW 66. You see the proportion is about the same. Besides, you must look at the good effect of the law. This time voters had not to wait for hours before they could get a chance to deposit their ballots. You just went up and voted. Last year many were kept away from the polls altogether, and there's no doubt many illegal ballots were cast. This year there will be few votes given that are not legal.""

The ladies naturally evinced considerable interest in the details of the affair, and yesterday they seemed determined to satisfy their curiosity to its full extent. For this unique marriage the most elaborate preparations were made. It was to have come off on Saturday last, but owing to the indisposition of the fair and daring bride it was postponed until yesterday afternoon.

It is especially the sickness of the poor and the filthy. The more comfortable classes are comparatively little affected by it. Bad sanitary conditions, and nuisances which are obvious, influence it immediately. So clearly is this the fact, that many persons look upon it as a direct Providential punishment for want of cleanliness and carelessness of sanitary provisions. It rules most where other diseases which science can prevent are accustomed to rage; so that the fever nests and the homes of diphtheria and typhoid and scarlet fever are the favorites of the cholera. Scientific writers tells us that certain courts in English cities, where all the great pestilences have made fearful havoc, are still the chosen seats of this modern epidemic. The first cases in this city in 1849, were in Orange and Baxter streets, near the Five Points, in infamous dens of filth; it raged especially first in the Sixth and Fourth Wards. When it appears during this year or next, it will seek out the same districts. ""Rotten Row,"" in Laurens-street, was a centre of the pestilence then; it will, undoubtedly, continue to be so now. The districts near the pig-styes, and the bone-boilers, and the exposed offal of slaughterhouses, suffered most in the former attacks; they will again. Open privies, cess-pools, heaps of garbage, crowds of inmates in dirty rooms, are what especially stimulated the disease before; they will still operate. It will be remembered by some of our citizens, that a butcher, whose daughters were in the habit of dressing the entrails of swine at night, though living in Seventh-avenue, quite apart from the scenes of the pestilence, was attacked with all his family.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHOLERA.; General Character of the Disease--The Precautions to be Taken.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHOLERA.; General Character of the Disease--The Precautions to be Taken.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22946e25-098b-57a2-8f00-b840300c8da2,1116,nyt://article/22946e25-098b-57a2-8f00-b840300c8da2

There are many men at the South who have large farms, but are utterly unable to work them, for lack of capital. In many respects it is not desirable, for them or for the country, to sell these farms outright to Northern immigrants, as the latter would thus lose the skill and experience essential to their profitable cultivation; but if the Northern capitalist and the Southern landowner would go into partnership, the best material results would be attained, and a harmony of sentiment and opinion would grow up, which would be highly serviceable to the State and the nation at large.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Southern States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Southern States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dbcf846-4315-5ec5-b6b7-da0bcc532946,458,nyt://article/4dbcf846-4315-5ec5-b6b7-da0bcc532946

Building houses, even at present rates, to be rented out to tenants, would yield large returns; and would continue to do so, even though the country were able to return next month to a specie basis, and the prices of rents were to fall one-half. Yet the Tribune again declares and argues that the present ""currency inflation makes building unadvisable"" and unprofitable, and speaks of house-building only being resumed when the currency is at par. Such arguments as this are wide of the mark, as house-owners and house-renters well know, and as not a few capitalists are beginning to realize. If builders should stop their operations and wait for the currency to reach par, the poor would in a few months be packed even worse than they are now, and the exactions upon tenants would become even more intolerable.

It appears that for some time past a party of Paterson roughs have been in the habit of riding on the 8:30 emigrant train from Jersey City, and when the conductor came around to collect the fare, would refuse to pay it, and use abusive and insulting language. Conductor DAVID DOREMUS, together with the men employed on the emigrant train, have on a number of occasions ejected these men, and for so doing gained their enmity, which finally culminated in a serious riot. As the train arrived at Paterson, on Wednesday night; upon which there was a regiment of soldiers. Conductor DOREMUS stepped out upon the platform, when a man, backed by about thirty of these rowdies, stepped up and arrested him. Conductor DOREMUS demanded his authority, which, as is alleged, was refused, when the man, who, it was subseqently learned, was a constable, was knocked down by some person. A general melee then commenced between the rowdies and the hands belonging to the train, in which the soldiers, who were on their way to Dunkirk, joined in against the rowdies. Bayonets, knives, pistols, stones, clubs and other weapons, were freely used, and the battle raged fiercely for about ten minutes, when the rowdies were worsted and driven away, carrying with them about a dozen injured men. One man was stabbed in the temple with a bayonet, and another had a railroad lantern broken to pieces over his head, and was badly cut with pieces of glass. None of the railroad men were badly injured.

Although returns are not precisely settled, we may calculate that of the thirty-two Senators not more than four or five are of the Democratic faith. Last year (including Mr. NIVEN, of the Sullivan district, subsequently ousted by Judge Low,) the Democracy mustered eleven members. They have lost more than half of their powerless minority. Mr. MURPHY, of Brooklyn, Messrs. BENJ. WOOD and CHAS. G. CORNELL, of New-York, and Mr. SUTHERLAND, of Westchester, comprise all of that party certainly elected. Two of their most eminent and characteristic representatives from this city remain at home -- LUKE F. COZANS and THOMAS C. FIELDS -- the latter giving place to a good Union man -- THOMAS MURPHY -- and the former having been set aside by Street Commissioner CORNELL, whose patriotic anxiety to serve the public is only limited by the number of offices in the gift of the people. Mr. SUTHERLAND, of Westchester, takes the place of SAXTON SMITH, of Putnam, and will probably be a more active member; indeed, he may be the minority leader, since it is an even chance that Senator HENRY C. MURPHY will incline strongly to silence, if not to the Union side. It will puzzle Lieut.-Gov.

and the Missouri Convention Oath,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/11/archives/making-his-own-oaththe-missouri-repub-.html,and the Missouri Convention Oath,"lican has a long story to the effect that when Major-Gen. F.P. BLAIR came the other day to vote in St. Louis, he repudiated the oath proscribed by the State Convention, and offered to the judges an oath of his own manufacture. Of course the judges were compelled to refuse it; and on that refusal we have whole Niagaras of indignation in the aforesaid paper. Passing by the legal merits of the case, in the abstract, we may be permitted to say that ostentatious defiance of law, in any case not justified by military necessity, by a high officer of the army, is not an example that should commend itself to good citizens. The cheap resource of voting under protest, might, in this instance, have soothed a tender conscience; or, if that sacrifice for the country was too great, it is possible that even entire absence from the polls might have been endured by the people without disarranging the internal or external economy of the Commonwealth. During our dreadful war the State of Missouri was the theatre of some of the most atrocious crimes, and generally of the most reckless lawlessness, that ever blackened a nation's history. That the reaction should be severe, and that it should seem unreasonable to some extent is quite possible; but has not the great suffering of the past furnished ample reason that every loyal citizen should heartily join in the good work of restoration, even at the temporary sacrifice of some peculiar crotchets in regard to oaths and forms of loyalty?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MAKING HIS OWN OATH.--The Missouri Repub- ...', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MAKING HIS OWN OATH.--The Missouri Repub- ...', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64e70200-40f2-5910-9797-b8252e019f1a,257,nyt://article/64e70200-40f2-5910-9797-b8252e019f1a

A few of his friends deeming the successful close of an arduous campaign a fit time to indicate their regard, express their gratitude and manifest their esteem, called at the place above mentioned, about 10 o'clock last night, accompanied by the superb band of the gallant Seventh Regiment, numbering in all some forty pieces. The first intimation granted Mr. WEED of the intended compliment was delicately conveyed in the graceful melody of choice selections from ""Martha.""

There was much excitement around the place of execution, but the most perfect order was maintained, and in the short space of an hour the last demands of earthly justice were satisfied. We note, as an indication of public sentiment, that a large crowd of people gathered outside of the prison, out of sight but within hearing of the solemn work, when the drop fell and WIRZ was sent to his final account, gave loud and repeated cheers. WIRZ persisted to the last that he was innocent of most of the charges proved against him, and intimated, as indeed he has all along insisted, that Gen. WINDER was the immediately responsible party. There is a curious story to-day made public, that WIRZ's wife a few days ago conveyed poison to him, and in spite of detective watchfulness, actually put in his mouth, while apparently kissing him, a bolus of strychnine; but the prompt interference of an officer prevented him from swallowing it. The public will feel sensibly relieved that this terrible affair is ended, and that the long strain of excitement over the awful disclosures of the trial is among the events that all good men will hasten to forget.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EXECUTION OF WIRZ.--The extreme pen-...', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EXECUTION OF WIRZ.--The extreme pen-...', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b1e3a40-abb4-5828-a4e1-07944b2bc22b,210,nyt://article/9b1e3a40-abb4-5828-a4e1-07944b2bc22b

And Northern Characteristics,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/11/archives/local-characteristics-south-and-north.html,And Northern Characteristics,"-- A Southern paper protests against all attempts to ""de-Southernize the South, to bleach out its tone and color, to emasculate its mind and character, leaving it neither one thing nor the other."" We should oppose any such attempts as strongly as our Southern cotemporary. There are many distinctive phases of life and character in the South which are admirable. The climate of many of the States has induced habits of less activity than prevail in our Northern regions, and from this have arisen marked personal characteristics, which it is beyond our power to change. The easier conditions of life in the South have originated and developed traits in the Southern man which are less prominent in the Northern man; and these we would not change. The chief pursuit, in planting, of the dominant class of the Southern people, has made prominent differences between them and the commercial class, which is the most powerful in the North; and the Southern features we would not have changed. The thinking people of the South have given more attention to politics, and the thoughtful people in the North have given more attention to literature; and from this circumstance has sprung intellectual varieties, both of which have their value, and neither of which we would alter. In short, whatever there is distinctive in Southern modes of life and phases of character that has an inherent value, or is adapted to their distinctive pursuits, proclivities or conditions of existence, we would retain, and protest against attempts to change. We do not desire that the Southern people should be ""de-Southernized,"" or that they should assimilate in characteristics or costume to the people of the New-England States, or the Western States, or even of this admirable city.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS, SOUTH AND NORTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS, SOUTH AND NORTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1a137eb-cb48-5ea8-bc18-a183da09bc1c,290,nyt://article/a1a137eb-cb48-5ea8-bc18-a183da09bc1c

He was graduated in the University of the State, admitted to the Bar in 1835, and soon became the editor of a Democratic journal. He served in the Seminole war in 1836, and was appointed Attorney-General of Alabama. He left that office to edit the Southron, and in 1842 was made Judge of Tuscaloosa County Court, publishing a useful Digest of State laws during his term of office. He held the post of law clerk in the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury at Washington in 1845, and for four years from 1846 was United States District-Attorney for Southern Alabama, residing at Mobile. For the next five years he was one of the editors of the Mobile Register, and went to the Legislature in 1853. He has the credit of originating and carrying into effect a free school system, in the State. Next he was a Judge of Probate, and in 1855 published his poem, ""The Bed Eagle, a Poem of the South "" -- a work showing some ability, but too romantic and poorly arranged, as well as too deficient in original power, to hold on abiding place. He was a Democratic Presidential elector in 1856, and in the next three years published a volume of miscellanies, entitled ""Romantic Passages in Southwestern History,"" besides ""Songs and Poems of the South."" He was reelected to the Legislature in 1859, and chosen Speaker.

He sees the fertile soil still before him; he sees the laborers still in existence around him; he knows the eager demand for that which is the staple product of the soil; and he foresees a prosperous future if he can but bring into proper relations the conditions of profitable production. He has, in its sphere, the assistance of a beneficent government; he enjoys the benefits of public order and the protection of law; and there are no restraints upon the exercise of his legitimate freedom. There is but one difficulty which appears to him formidable, and that is the securing, under fit conditions, of the labor of those who formerly did his will as slaves, but who are now entitled to exercise their own will as freemen. Formerly he could enforce labor; now he has to negotiate with it. Formerly there was but one side to all questions on the plantation; now there are two sides to every question.

The one to which he belongs, and to which he will return, as soon as he can dispose of certain property in this State, lies near Cordova, a town on the road between Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico, and about a hundred miles from the former place. It consists of about a dozen large haciendas of apparently good land, capable of producing cotton, coffee, cocoa and tobacco. The land will be given to the settlers by the Emperor's government, in parcels of six hundred and forty acres to families, and in smaller allotments to single men. STERLING PRICE, Gen. JO. SHELBY, Ex.-Gov. HARRIS, of Tennessee, and Judge PERKINS, of Louisiana, were there at the time of his departure, with other proposed settlers of less note. Lieut. MAURY, formerly of the Naval Observatory at Washington, was also there, and actively engaged in furthering the scheme, by drawing up a report to be circulated in the Southern States, with a view of inducing parties of colonists to come over and join them. The work of tilling the soil had not been fairly commenced, and would be postponed until there was a suitable accession to their numbers. This they expected to obtain in reasonable time through the medium of MAURY's report, and the influence of the newspaper which ex-Governor ALLEN, of Louisiana, has commenced publishing in the city of Mexico. MAXIMILIAN, our informant thinks, is secure enough on his throne, provided the Monroe doctrine be not broadly asserted by the United States. The armed resistance of the Liberals will soon be overcome, and the opposition to him be confined to the Church party alone. This opposition, however, is not apt to take the form of a revolution, inasmuch as the Liberal party first confiscated the Church property, and MAXIMILIAN's offence consists only in refusing to restore it. -- St. Louis Republican.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CONFEDERATE COLONY IN MEXICO.--We', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CONFEDERATE COLONY IN MEXICO.--We', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad63c520-07fa-508c-b9a3-cf06af6765dd,368,nyt://article/ad63c520-07fa-508c-b9a3-cf06af6765dd

Indeed, there has been so great reason to believe that the space allotted to the United States, by the Commissioners of the Exhibition, would be, although vast, insufficient to represent all our interests seeking admission to it, that the government has decided to apply for a grant of ampler room. It is hoped that the space of 3,346 square metres originally given us will be again assigned, instead of the surface of 2,788 metres afterwards reserved to us; and we need scarcely incite those more particularly interested among our citizens to take advantage of this expectation.

It appears that some two or three years ago certain privileges and concessions were granted to a Frenchman named LAMBERT by the King of that island, on condition that he should found a company for the ""regeneration of the country."" The company was got up, funds were collected, and on the faith of the promises, first of the King, and afterwards of the French Government, a large sum was expended. An insurrection broke out in the island, however; the King was murdered, and a new race reigned in his stead. These last refused to carry out the terms of the treaty, whereupon the French Government demanded the repayment of the sums advanced by the company. Alter a time compliance was promised with this demand, but an insurrection having broken out at Tananarivo the payment was delayed for a fortnight. A French journal, commenting upon this affair, deprecates the idea of a war with the natives of Madagascar, but urges that there is a necessity for such a display of strength as may preclude all ideas of resistance on their part.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cdd1c9eb-1387-5984-92e3-c5224c708876,1433,nyt://article/cdd1c9eb-1387-5984-92e3-c5224c708876

It is on a question long since settled in America, but still an exciting one in Europe. The Pope it seems, is an Anti-Mason. He took occasion the other day to renew some papal condemnations of masonry in connection with other secret societies, while ABD-EL-KADER is not only a Mahommedan, but an enthusiastic freemason. In a lodge in France he said: ""I consider freemasonry as the first institution in the world. In my opinion every man, who does not profees freemasonry, is an incomplete man. I hope that one day all the principles of freemasonry will prevail throughout the whole world, and then all the nations will be at peace."" Certainly, if nations could be bound over to keep the peace by all joining a lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, I think the Pope might be induced to withdraw his objections, which are much the same as those of the old Anti-Mason party, which, in my younger days, was not at all of this learned Arab's opinion.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EUROPEAN NEWS.; Our London and Paris Correspondence.

We refer to the letters of Mr. SEWELL on ""Emancipation in the West Indies,"" and of Mr. OLMSTED on the ""Cotton and Seaboard States."" In the former, it will be remembered that Mr. SEWELL showed conclusively that the so-called ""failure of Jamaica emancipation"" was merely a diminished production, resulting not from the idleness of the negro, but from the entanglements of the estates, and especially from the prejudices and rancor of the planters against the freed blacks, showing itself especially in efforts to continue a kind of serfdom, and to cheat the negroes of their wages or to under pay them. The result was, that a great gulf was created between capital and labor, which has not, to this day, been fairly bridged over in Jamaica. The freedmen abandoned their old masters' estates in distrust and with hostility, and squatted on unoccupied lands, raising enough for their own wants, but letting the large estates go to ruin, and causing the production of sugar, which depends much on a combination of labor and capital, very largely to fall off.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Danger to the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Danger to the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed713d44-bc41-5091-a773-731426cf7191,846,nyt://article/ed713d44-bc41-5091-a773-731426cf7191

Emigration from,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/13/archives/emigration-from-italythere-is-at-this.html,Emigration from,"time a large emigration in progress from the Southern provinces of the Italian Kingdom to Egypt, consisting chiefly of skilled laborers, artisans and mechanics. The movement is not, we are told, like the Irish exodus, the departure of poor, uneducated people, but it is the very bone and sinew of the Italian nation that is emigrating, the exact material that a country rallying into new life needs and demands. The reason assigned for it is the usual reason assigned in all times for all popular migrations -- the desire and expectation of a better condition. The material prospects of Old Egypt are actually at this moment better than those of Young Italy. ""The Italians of to-day,"" writes a correspondent from Italy, ""are beset with immeasurable difficulties. They have a hostile clergy, a discontented peasantry, a landed proprietary groaning under heavy taxation, seaports without trade, and capital without movement; brigandage in the south, beggary in the north, a ruined exchequer, and a not very reputable court."" And beside all these internal troubles they are in constant peril of war with Austria, and of difficulties with the Pope or the party of action. Egypt on the other hand, under the new stimulus of the greatly enlarged cotton culture, the prospective commercial advantages of the Suez Canal, and the liberal policy of the existing Viceroy, is giving grounds of belief that she will speedily attain a high and permanent prosperity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EMIGRATION FROM ITALY.--There is at this...', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EMIGRATION FROM ITALY.--There is at this...', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a985612-c466-5689-be32-da6492a68bfc,318,nyt://article/0a985612-c466-5689-be32-da6492a68bfc

It cannot be denied, we think, that the members of the musical profession, as a class, can justly claim the respect and support of the community at large, for they materially contribute, by their genius and untiring industry, to cater to the entertainment of those who patronize places of public amusement. We are satisfied that if an unvarnished and candid statement of the reasons which induced them to demand a fair remuneration for their services (and that is all they ask) were given to the people, the verdict of the people, which is always the arbiter of justice and humanity, would be unanimouslv opposed to the despotic action of a set of men who have combined in their endeavors to forward their own selfish interests, regardless of the claims of a too generous public. This ""close corporation"" of rapacious theatrical directors affords another striking illustration of a truth which is familiar to the working class by bitter experience -- viz.: that capital is almost invariably combined against labor.

Algonquin Controversy; the American Artisan on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/13/archives/naval-engines-the-algonquinwinooski-trial.html,Algonquin Controversy; the American Artisan on,"We reported last week that the Algonquin was evidently ahead of the Winooski, and for a period of three hours had developed 19 per cent, more power, burning an equal amount of fuel. She continued to gain during fifty-six of the ninety-six hours of the trial. It is alleged by the friends of the Winooski that she then began to lose. On the other side it is alleged that for some hours the Winooski had throttled with her stop-valves, thereby evading the agreement to work with her throttles wide open. In reply to this it is alleged that it is frivolous -- a mere excuse for backing out of the contest; and that the reason for backing out was, that the boilers of the Algonquin were leaking, and other matters were out of order, and she could not have kept at work four hours longer. It is also alleged by Mr. DICKERSON that one of the Winooski's wheels, which had the outer ends of its paddles knocked off by collision with a coal barge, was relieved of much of its resistance; and that when the barge got foul of the Winooski her wheels ought to have been stopped; and the reason they were not stopped was, that the Algonquin had proved herself the superior, and the Winooski managers wished to gain an advantage by knocking off the paddles. To this the Captain of the Winooski replies (to the Tribune's reporter) that had the wheel been stopped it would have been much more damaged.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NAVAL ENGINES.; The ""Algonquin-Winooski"" Trial.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NAVAL ENGINES.; The ""Algonquin-Winooski"" Trial.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the American Artisan', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31605c64-e96e-5cbd-8da9-817c9504a097,1530,nyt://article/31605c64-e96e-5cbd-8da9-817c9504a097

The building was damaged by fire and water to the extent of $1,000. The second floor is occupied by Mr. FRANK M. PAGE. Damage to furniture $150, insured. The first floor was occupied by Mr. SMITH WING. Loss on contents $150, supposed to be insured....Sunday morning about 8 o'clock a fire broke out in a shed in the rear of a large brick building, corner of Adams and John streets, one part of which is occupied as a Tube manufactory, and the other as a Button manufactory. The flames communicated to the main building and destroyed the upper portion of the Button factory and ruined the contents. The premises are owned by Messrs. BENTON & CO. Damage about $3,000. The proprietor being out of town the amount of insurance could not be ascertained. About 10 o'clock on Sunday morning there was an alarm of fire in the Third District, caused by smoke issuing from St. Paul's (Roman Catholic) Church, corner of Court and Congress streets. It appears that too much wood had been placed in the heater. Some of the congregation, becoming frightened, raised an alarm of fire and ran out. The excitement which ensued was almost instantly allayed by the announcement of the cause of the smoke....About noon there was an alarm of fire in the Second District, caused by throwing burning cinders among some refuse oil in the yard of the glass-works foot of State-street. No damage. In answering the alarm, Hose Company No. 5, with seven persons on the reel and three or four at the tongue, proceeded down the railroad track in Bridge-street at a fearful rate. Perceiving a railroad car coming from the opposite direction on the same track, the guides tried to switch off, and in so doing broke the tongue. One of them named PATRICK FLYNN, was thrown under the wheel, which ran over him and upset the carriage, throwing all on top with great force upon the pavement. One of FLYNK's legs was crushed. EDWARD LEDDY and WILLIAM MCFARLAND were dreadfully injured about the head and spine. ROBERT CRUMMY was pitched head foremost against a tree and was badly bruised. Three others were slightly hurt. Drs. REGAN and FARLEY attended to several of the sufferers. MCFARLAND and LEDDY were subsequently taken to the City Hospital. The others were conducted to their residences.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e5408f3-110b-5ef3-93ad-739bba8015ca,1130,nyt://article/6e5408f3-110b-5ef3-93ad-739bba8015ca

Mr. BUCHANAN says that, ""from the use of private correspondence he has resolutely abstained."" It has become too much the habit with our public men to use for so-called public or partisan ends what was spoken or written in the freedom of personal acquaintance. The temptation to do this is constant, and often the highest moral courage is required to avoid yielding to it. Tested by a strictly ethical rule, the violation of personal or private confidences has the evil effect of making men insincere, hypocritical and double-faced in the intercourse of daily life.

It subsequently appeared, by the evidence adduced in the presence of that official, that the accused had rented a room adjoining the grocery store, in which stood a barrel containing some thirty-two gallons of kerosene, leaving the same a few minutes afterward in a rather hurried manner. He closed the door of the room, and asked a young man named EDWARD GRACE to accompany him to the front part of the building. GRACE followed him, and they had scarcely reached the front of the store, when the alarm was given. Mr. SCHORLING rushed into the adjoining room, and found that the barrel was surrounded by flames, and the faucet so burned that the oil was pouring forth and igniting as it tell upon a box on which the barrel was placed. With great presence of mind, Mr. SCHORLING at once dragged the barrel from the room, burning his hands in a shocking manner, and extinguished the flames by means of a few buckets of water. The testimony of Mr. GRACE further showed that the accused had been in the room about half an hour previous to the occurrence, and it is supposed that during that time he made all preparations and applied the match.

In Pennsylvania, its convention resolutions deplored the war and denounced the manner in which it was prosecuted by the government. In New-Jersey, the main rally was made against the Constitutional Amendment interdicting slavery. In New-York, the canvass was conducted chiefly on a claim of special approval of the policy of President JOHNSON, which was falsely represented to have for its end an immediate and unconditional restoration of the Southern States. In every Northern State where an election has been held, the Democratic party has taken a position that it believed to be specially agreeable to the South. It has everywhere been beaten.

It has been quite apparent from the beginning, that the trial was governed much more by the mutual resentments of Mr. ISHERWOOD on the one side and of Mr. DICKERSON on the other, than by regard for the interests of the navy or the spirit and object of the contract. Mr. FORBES agreed to build a vessel for the service which, in the ""development of power and economy of fuel,"" should be at least equal to those which the Navy Department had provided. The agreement was made in good faith and in absolute reliance on similar good faith from the other side. This is shown by the fact that he consented, without objection, that the trial should be made wholly under the direction of the department, assuming, as he had a right to do, that his vessel would be tested as she was to be used, -- in the usual service of the navy. If at sea, running at the usual cruising speed, she proved to develop equal power with equal economy of fuel, as other vessels in the service, he would have fulfilled his contract. It never occurred to him that his ship was to be handed over to parties for a scientific prize-fight and to be subjected to precisely such usage as might suit their purposes without regard to his rights. That she would be tied to a dock, instead of being sent to sea -- that she would be tried, first for power, without regard to economy of fuel, and then for economy without regard to power, when, for all purposes of practical utility, both must go together -- and that her rival should resort to tricks and evasions which would be reacted on a racecourse or at a prize-fight, for the purpose of securing a victory, were in such utter violation of the ordinary modes of transacting business between a government and a citizen, that no one could suppose they would be resorted to. Yet the article from the Artisan shows very clearly that this is precisely what has been done. We trust that the Secretary of the Navy will still see the propriety of placing the acceptance of this vessel on some more equitable basis than that thus far adopted, as otherwise the whole question will inevitably be thrown upon Congress for adjustment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TRIAL OF THE ALGONQUIN AND WINOOSKI.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TRIAL OF THE ALGONQUIN AND WINOOSKI.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc4a9315-ab72-5d56-b510-8f78b1518fde,408,nyt://article/fc4a9315-ab72-5d56-b510-8f78b1518fde

London Daily News on United States Securities,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/14/archives/mistaken-ideasthe-london-daily-news.html,London Daily News on United States Securities,"attributes the very considerable fall in our securities of late in Europe to the fears there entertained as to the course our government will pursue in the controversies that are pending with France and England -- with the former on the Mexican question, and with the latter on compensation for damages. It is natural and common for the holders of a government's bonds to be somewhat timid as to its action upon great public questions -- particularly when war is one of the possible issues. But in the present instance there would seem to be a want of reasonable confidence in the pacificatory disposition and the sagacity of our administration. They seem to fancy that we are looking around the world for an adversary, and are determined to make war our first argument, not our last resort, in every quarrel. It is a mistake. The decision as to war or peace, now and in the future, lies more with England and with France than with us. We have given neither Power any ground of offence, and shall give none to either. We have overlooked wrongs and injuries on the part of both, such as, in other times, have often led to war. It is from this, from the past course of our government, that the people of Europe should judge of its present policy and its future disposition. We could undoubtedly be driven to war; but only after the exhaustion of every means for securing an honorable peace.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISTAKEN IDEAS.--The London Daily News', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISTAKEN IDEAS.--The London Daily News', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/100147f4-3e8c-5ee1-925c-1afbaf5fee63,248,nyt://article/100147f4-3e8c-5ee1-925c-1afbaf5fee63

British Deserters,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/14/archives/important-from-the-maine-border.html,British Deserters,"We have, from apparently trustworthy authority, a rather startling rumor of trouble of a serious character on the Canadian border. It appears that a British officer took the liberty of leading a company of marines across the line into the State of Maine to arrest deserters; that his men themselves, finding they were on foreign soil, deserted him; that application was made to our authorities to have the men given up, which was, of course, refused.

"of the semi-official London press, it would appear that Lord RUSSELL's task of reorganizing the Cabinet has been a much more difficult one than was anticipated. The distrust of the Foreign Secretary's ability to bring together a compact body of followers, or to hold them together in support of an administration, does not seem to belong alone to the press or the party which has always opposed his policy. It seems to pervade the higher political circles from which Whig or Liberal Ministries are supposed to be chosen; and the probability is that the strongest plea offered to Messrs. GLADSTONE, GIBSON and CARDWELL, to serve under the new Premier, was one founded upon the temporary or provisional character of his administration. There is an irreconcileable difference of feeling, if not of sentiment, between the pure Whig of the RUSSELL-GREY school, and the younger class of politicians that followed the fortunes of FEEL. And when we add to this difference the decided unpopularity of Lord RUSSELL with the great body of Englishmen, it is easy to reckon upon some trouble in store for him -- even before Parliament assembles. It is true we have by the European steamer this morning reference to a speech of Mr. GLADSTONE's at Glasgow, in which he commends his new chief to the working-men of the country. This much was to have been expected. Mr. GLADSTONE having taken office -- even if it is only provisionally under Lord RUSSELL -- is bound to give him, for the time, a loyal support. But this personal fealty can in no manner alter the natural political affinities of the two men. The London Star, it will be seen, calls for a place in the Cabinet for Mr. BRIGHT. But it is more than doubtful, we should think, whether Mr. BRIGHT is not as resolutely opposed to taking office as was Mr. COBDEN. Until class government is far less powerful than it is to-day, in England, Mr. BRIGHT's natural place is on the independent benches.

Seventeen volumes have already appeared, and how many more are to appear, may be guessed from the fact that the seventeenth volume only comes down to October, 1808. From this mass M.

J., Reynolds' Tobacco Factory","It will be recollected that large sums of money were offered for the detection and arrest of those engaged in the assassination of President LINCOLN, and subsequently for the capture of JEFF. DAVIS. Both matters were accomplished, and the money for the arrest of DAVIS was not long since all paid over to Gen. WILSON and his party. Owing to the large number engaged in hunting down BOOTH and his associates, it was more difficult to tell to whom the reward was due. The Secretary of War consequently appointed a committee to investigate the matter, and make the proper division. The report was made out and sent to the Secretary of War, who approved and sent it to the President for his approval and order to disburse the money. No action has been taken yet by him, and a large number of detectives are now in Washington, awaiting the announcement, to get their share. The amount involved is near a quarter of a million dollars, inclusive of the hundred thousand dollars in gold offered in California.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84840332-6b26-59d5-a679-3f9cc4b4a507,616,nyt://article/84840332-6b26-59d5-a679-3f9cc4b4a507

The Imposture,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/14/archives/the-fenian-impostureit-was-perhaps.html,The Imposture,"well enough for the Fenians to get up a temporary excitement, as a relief from the dullness which succeeded the cessation of hostilities in this country. Patriotic ardor must find vent in some way. But there is some danger of the joke being carried too far; not in the sense of creating international trouble -- for that is altogether out of the question -- but in this regard: Hundreds, and probably thousands, of poor, honest, unsuspecting Irish, living in the unsophisticated sections of this country, have been cajoled into making remittances to the managers of the Order here and elsewhere -- not one tithe of which, they may depend on it, are used for any other purpose than maintaining a set of scamps in idleness. Stories come to us of remittances of Fenian funds to Ireland. Most of these stories are doubtless intended to show that the contributions received are actually expended for some revolutionary end. Even if an honest share of the funds were sent to Ireland, the result would apparently be merely to send a few more ill-advised young people to jail. But we do not believe that the money is used for any other purpose than getting notoriety and patent leather boots for a set of dlers iin this country. It is really time, that those who are in a position to advise the unsophisticated people in the rural districts as to the real nature of the Fenian swindle, should do so. It is a crime to bolster up the concern even as a joke. The clergy, on whose ministrations the Irish-Americans chiefly depend, are probably doing their best to stop the swindle. But every one who wishes well to Ireland and her people should lend a hand in exposing what is really an unmitigated imposture.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The FENIAN IMPOSTURE.--It was perhaps...', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The FENIAN IMPOSTURE.--It was perhaps...', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/961937a0-2606-530e-8375-d3fb07911fa3,299,nyt://article/961937a0-2606-530e-8375-d3fb07911fa3

LORD, of the Sanitary Police, to anticipate the westward march of the cholera. While there is no doubt a great deal of needless parade given to the few cases of supposed cholera on board the Havre steamer Atalanta, the mere appearance of the pestilence, whether on board an overcrowded ocean steamer, or in a port of Western Europe, is an intimation to us that we shall not, judging from past experience, entirely escape the scourge, either during the present Winter or the coming Summer. We may have it in some form during Winter. But the prospect is not one to alarm us unduly; we are simply admonished by it to be thoughtful and, if possible, wise. There is apparently in the present advance of sanitary science no absolute barrier against the march of the disorder. But the mitigating agencies, available in every civilized community, are such as to rob the epidemic in a great measure of its ancient terrors. This very Atalanta case tells the story simply, and with good effect. Not a single case appeared in the clean, capacious, well aired cabins of the vessel -- while only a few feet distant, in compartments barely separated by wooden partitions, but crowded to excess, the disease had sway for several days.

In answer to this report, the Queen has issued a royal decree ordering that a certain cargo of 103 negroes taken from a Portuguese slaver be transferred to Fernando Po, or other Spanish colony, in the Gulf of Guinea, and thence to be transferred to any other colony or to any port on the coast of Africa they may designate. Any slaves captured in the future are to be treated in a similar manner. The authority formerly possessed by superior civil Governors of colonial provinces where slavery existed of compelling negroes to labor is revoked. Emancipated slaves who can count five years' residence in the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, and have entered the government depots, may be declared free, and transferred to one of the Spanish possessions of the Gulf of Guinea or a port on the African coast.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SUPPRESSION OF THE SPANISH SLAVE-TRADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SUPPRESSION OF THE SPANISH SLAVE-TRADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19ae5b7d-d0b0-5c89-b529-ac542491e83a,290,nyt://article/19ae5b7d-d0b0-5c89-b529-ac542491e83a

The tribes of the province of Oran, in Western Algeria, distinguished for ferocity and turbulence, have revolted again, at the instigation of their leaders, and it is said they have fifty thousand men under arms. Rebellion is not a new feature in Algeria, but in this case a powerful native family, hitherto trusted by the French, have joined the insurgents, and formed an alliance with a confederacy of independent clans in the Southern desert. Though the French army is doubtless equal to the task of putting down the revolt, it will nevertheless require an immense amount of hard fighting, and a long campaign in a country where more men are killed by marches than in ordinary battles. The revolting tribes will no doubt be severely punished, and their lands confiscated and divided among their conquerors; but it cannot be very encouraging to know that all that may be gained by this sacrifice of life and treasure will be a few miles of barren territory and a precarious and temporary peace.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW ALGERIAN REVOLT.-The Emperor', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW ALGERIAN REVOLT.-The Emperor', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/34b13cd0-897b-59e3-9404-cc2f65262c52,209,nyt://article/34b13cd0-897b-59e3-9404-cc2f65262c52

Mr. GLADSTONE, in his Glasgow speech, seems to have been exceedingly careful not to commit the new administration to anything beyond the most indefinite promises of liberal measures. What he positively declared was, that there would be no retrograde steps taken -- a promise which any statesman might make without compromising himself in any degree whatever. ""Retrograde steps"" would simply mean Revolution. And the majority of the recently elected Parliament are, doubtless, of the opinion that Revolution had better be avoided. Therefore, it is altogether unlikely that Lord RUSSELL's administration will be permitted to survive for any length of time. The ""rest-and-be-thankful"" doctrine was well enough, while a Minister like Lord PALMERSTON was at the helm. But that was a compromise which could only last for a time.

New-Jersey, it informs its readers, has ""yielded to the enemy,"" and although the Democracy fought with the courage of desperation, they have not been successful in a single State. All the consolation the Times can offer the anxious Virginians is that although the Democratic defeat has been terrible, ""their firm, manly, noble stand in defence of the constitution, and of a policy of clemency and magnanimity toward the South, forced their adversaries to abandon many of their radical views, and to give apparently a cordial support to the reconstruction policy of the President."" The Times thinks it will ""soon be able to determine whether the Republican party is irretrievably wedded to radicalism, or has purged itself of the sin of sectionalism, and is prepared to take its position as a national party."" It asserts that ""if they determine to adhere to their radical policy, they will stand before the nation convicted of having deceived the Northern people by their pledges, and if they imitate the Democracy in conservatism and magnanimity, they will, after all, be able to boast of nothing in the way of original statesmanship.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM THE SOUTH.; The Southern Press on the Result of the Recent State Elections.

They state that it is twenty-four years since, with one exception, they have publicly asked for assistance, but that they are now forced by several causes to resort to this means of increasing the funds of the institution. All the necessaries of life, they say, have risen in price from fifty to one and two hundred per cent. while the subscriptions to the Asylum funds have not increased at all. The State appropriation has been diminished, owing to the increase in the number of institutions sharing the State fund. The Asylum building stands greatly in need of repairs, while there is a mortgage of $6,000 on it beside a temporary debt of $10,000. Under these circumstances the managers confidently appeal to the public for aid in enabling them to care for the many children under their charge, some of whom are in the tenderest years of infancy.

Police Parade,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/17/archives/the-police-parade.html,Police Parade,"-- Every law-abiding citizen of New-York who saw the police display yesterday must have been reassured in his personal safety and his worldly possessions. It would be difficult to find another equally efficient body of men, even in our glorious army. The solid results of discipline were never more conspicuously manifested, and the hard-working officers who have brought the force to this admirable standpoint are to be generously commended. It is but a few years since we had a dirty lot of ragamuffins, who plundered rather than protected the people, fellows whose insignia were badges of shame, who hid their shields (good shields to them) at the first symptom of a disturbance, ran into the nearest alley, and cowered until all occasion for their presence had passed. Or, in a notable instance, kept the polls to elect a ruffian to the Common Council and clubbed away from the ballot-box the opponents of their rascally candidate. The change is wonderful; it is honorable instead of being disgraceful to be an officer; the men almost invariably deserve and enjoy the respect and confidence of the people; they are not only respected but feared, for the roughs and lawless robbers that linger in the lowest dens of the town have most keen remembrance of the arms that cracked crowns during the riots of July, 1863. So it happened that at the City Hall their fine parade passed almost unapplauded, for the spectators were mainly those who had no love for law and order. Up town they were better received; but whether better or worse, the display proved the gratifying fact that the Metropolitan Police force is the finest, best organized, best disciplined and most efficient body of men for similar duty in the world.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POLICE PARADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE POLICE PARADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32b86eb1-462d-50c6-b6e1-31ce4b29ff3a,291,nyt://article/32b86eb1-462d-50c6-b6e1-31ce4b29ff3a

The Insurrection in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/17/archives/the-insurrection-in-jamaica.html,The Insurrection in,"-- The negro insurrection in the parish of St. Thomas in the East, which at one time threatened to involve the whole island with nameless horrors, has been brought to a sudden close. On receiving notice of the outbreak, the military authorities took prompt and most efficient measures to put it down. A strong force was at once marched to the disaffected region, and on its appearance there the insurgents abandoned their attempt, threw away the arms they had collected, and gave themselves up. A large number were immediately put on trial and summarily executed, the commander of the expedition having neither time nor inclination to take them with him. It is a noteworthy fact that the master-spirit of the revolt was a white man, a member of the Assembly, who, for the sake of gratifying a private pique, used his influence to create disaffection among the negro population. The insurrection seems to have been well planned, and but for the premature uprising caused by a local disturbance, it might have been far more disastrous than it was. The disaffected region was still under martial law at last advices, but no further danger was apprehended.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE INSURRECTION IN JAMAICA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE INSURRECTION IN JAMAICA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Jamaica', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a7fa545e-e342-55fc-a067-ca9b10dfedaa,195,nyt://article/a7fa545e-e342-55fc-a067-ca9b10dfedaa

We have the Winter months in which to prepare for warding off its advent in the Spring. The experience during previous visitations and during the past Summer in many of the chief cities of Europe, show how much can be done by human agencies in keeping back or modifying its ravages; and by the same means we have learned how it is in man's power to create the conditions under which cholera flourishes with the most deadly luxuriance. Where people are huddled together in filthy tenements and amid noisome vapors -- where moral and physical uncleanliness abound -- where are filthy streets and cesspools, and bad drainage -- there are the favorite haunts of cholera. This is a fixed fact, and in common with other journals, we have shown it again and again. We have again and again attempted to convince the people of the city of the necessity of remedying these fatal and threatening evils. There will be an opportunity, this Winter, for their demanding and securing such legislation as will effectually remove them. It is also in their power to defeat such legislation, so that they will find the sanitary condition of the city next Spring, no better than it has been or is now.

Card by the Editor on its Position,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/18/archives/the-citizena-card.html,Card by the Editor on its Position,"A statement loosely made by an officer of the Citizens' Association, and we trust incorrectly reported in the columns of the TIMES, renders it necessary that the position of this paper be distinctly and openly defined. The Citizen is the property of its editor and of him alone, absolute and uncontrolled. It has never received one dollar of subsidy from the Citizens' Association since passing into the proprietorship of its present owner, nor has that owner received one dollar of salary or reward from that Association. At the time of the transfer of the paper to its present editor and owner, an agreement was made by the Citizens' Association for the fulfillment of their unexpired contracts with subscribers and advertisers, at a sum certainly not greater than the mere cost of executing such work; and beyond that original agreement, which was made at the time of said transfer, the Citizen has not received, nor asked to receive, one dollar of help from any quarter. It is no more the ""organ"" of the Association, in the offensive sense of the quoted word, than the Tribune is or has been the ""organ"" of the Republican party; and there is not to-day, and never has been, since our assumption of the ownership, any power, save the will and judgment of the editor, in control of the columns or political course of this paper. If it were consistent to-day with our sense of right and self-respect to support FERNANDO WOOD for Mayor and JOHN E. DEVELIN for Corporation Counsel, that support might be as freely given as to the nominees of the Citizens' Association; and it is because we personally believe that JOHN HECKER and RICHARD O'GORMAN are candidates whose election is essential to the welfare of our city, and not because they are the nominees of any body of men in particular, that they receive our support. Such being the state of facts in the past, we anticipate from the Association in the future no dollar that will not be given for value received, just as the same shall be extended to other papers. As to the circulation of the Citizen, it can only be necessary to remark, without wishing to injure by invidious comparisons or figures any other journal, that it has to-day but two papers of its class in the city -- the Sunday Mercury and Dispatch -- with a greater sale of copies.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Citizen--A Card.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Citizen--A Card.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d74504ad-37b4-5fe8-b43a-a8fb827c1ecf,506,nyt://article/d74504ad-37b4-5fe8-b43a-a8fb827c1ecf

PELOUZE, the well-known chemist. In nature, mineralogists give the name of aventurine to a sort of brownish-red quartz, interspersed with brilliant metallic points; but a happy imitation of this stone was discovered at Venice during the middle ages by an accident, a workman having by some mistake let some copper filings fan into a crucible containing colored glass in a state of fusion. For a long time the process remained a secret; in those days chemists were very careful not to let anything connected with their laboratories transpire, and used to leave their secrets to their heirs by will. Such precautions would be utterly useless in our days, modern chemistry having unravelled all the old mysteries, and effectually rendered all future ones impossible. MM. FREMY and CLEMANDOT many years ago obtained beautiful specimens of aventurine by heating a mixture of 300 parts of pounded glass 40 parts of protoxide of copper, and 80 parts of oxide of iron from a blacksmith's forge, and letting the composition cool very slowly. M. PELOUZE's new aventurine vies in lustre with the finest specimens of Venice, and is much harder than the latter, since it will cut glass. M. PELOUZE's formula is as follows: 250 parts of sand, 100 parts of carbonate of soda, 50 of carbonate of lime, and 40 of bichromate of potash. The glass obtained from this mixture contains from six to seven per cent. of oxide of chromium, about half of which is combined with the glass, the other half being free under the form of sparkling needles contained within the mass. The jewelers who have already seen this new artificial aventurine, and tried it, have declared that it constitutes an important addition to their supply of imitation stones.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d41d1580-fcdf-57ca-aeb5-08cc1ba76528,1289,nyt://article/d41d1580-fcdf-57ca-aeb5-08cc1ba76528

There are so many practical topics upon which light might be thrown by a comparison of notes, by contributions of facts, and by discussions, that we augur great benefit from such assemblages. The question of labor, its supply and remuneration; the question as to the practicability of large plantations, and as to their supervision and government; questions relating to new applications of machinery, and to all such novel ideas or appliances as may be adapted to the new order of things, will furnish ample materials for deliberation.

The blockade of the ports by the Spanish Admiral PAREJA still continues; but some few vessels have been permitted to enter and clear at Valparaiso, while others have been ordered off. No further action has been taken by the foreign diplomatic corps in Chili in relation to the illegality of the blockade. PAREJA, with only seven vessels, declares all the ports (over forty in number) closed. The fear which for a time existed that PAREJA would bombard Valparaiso, seems to have subsided. Chili, determined to maintain her national dignity, is making every preparation possible to carry on the war into which she has been forced. Telegraph lines and roads are being opened into the interior and to the frontier, which will in a measure compensate for the loss of communication by sea. All custom duties have been abolished, and thirty-six coast towns are declared ports of Chili. This is done to encourage blockade-running, which will no doubt in a little while be carried on quite extensively. Letters of marque have been issued in large numbers, and already many persons have left Chili to avail themselves of them.

Solely from a patriotic point of view, this enterprise of an American Steamship Company is worthy of support and encouragement. We have too long been dependent upon foreign nations for facilities in inter-oceanic communication, and no true-hearted American can help feeling that we are disgraced as a mercantile people by permitting the vast traffic between Europe and this country to fall exclusively into the hands of England, France and the German States. These nations being fully sensible of the great degree in which well-established and properly conducted steamship lines contribute to their wealth, power and prestige, foster these enterprises by the payment of large subsides, and a generous sum each trip for carrying the mails. Without this governmental assistance the New-York and Havre Company launch boldly into the sea of competition, deeming themselves justified in making the attempt from the very large patronage which they enjoyed before the war put a stop to their enterprise. The reputation of their ships for comfort, economy and sea-going qualities, is already well established, and by prudence in the management, the line was always self-supporting. It would probably have never been suspended had not the perils from Anglo-rebel privateers made the risk of running longer too great.

"A tragedy took place abont 4 o'clock yesterday morning, at the corner of Eighth and South Third streets, Brooklyn, Eastern District, which, it is feared, will result in the death of a very efficient officer of the Forty-fifth Precinct. It appears that about an hour previous to the occurrence, Officer JAMES LEE, of the same precinct, noticed two men acting in a suspicious manner on his bcat; and he watched them until relieved from duty, and then informed Officer THOMAS LANGAN, who went on duty at that hour. Officer LANGAN in turn informed Sergt. HUNT of the fact of these men being in the neighborhood, and the Sergeant immediately went after another officer, with the view of having sufficient force at hand to act in case of emergency. He had not been absent for this purpose over two minutes when he heard the discharge of firearms, and hurrying back found Officer LANGAN standing at the corner above stated with the blood flowing from his mouth, he having exchanged shots with the two men he had been watching and received their fire. It seems that just previous to Officer LANGAN's turning the corner of South Third into Eighth street, he heard a noise at the door of the residence of Mr. JAMES FERGUSON, and, concluding that burglars were at work, turned the corner and came suddenly upon and hailed them. Without giving any answer they simultaneously discharged their revolvers at him, the officer answering their fire. One ball took effect in LANGAN's nether lip, fracturing his jaw and descending to his throat. He was sent to the station-house by Sergeant HUNT, who in company with other officers started in pursuit of the scoundrels, they having fled, it has since been ascertained, up South Third-street -- but the morning being intensely dark and the lights all extinguished, they eluded the vigilance of the officers and escaped. The wounded man was attended at the station-house by Drs. NORTH and COLT, and afterward was sent to his residence, No. 18 North Second-street. Dr. COCHRAN was called in during the day, and after a consultation it was concluded to send the sufferer to the City Hospital, in Raymond-street, his throat being so swollen that it was found impossible to extract the ball. He was taken there in a carriage by Capt. WAGLOM and Officer TRAVIS, where he now lies in a critical condition. After daylight, some officers traced blood along the route of the fugitives, up South Third-street to Union-avenue, proving conclusively that some of them had been wounded. The police have also learned that a horse and harness were taken from the place in South Fourth-street, near Eleventh, and a wagon from Grand-street, near Union-avenue. This being on the route of the assassins, it is presumed that the they stole this property to facilitate their escape, the officers in that neighborhood having left there to ascertain the cause of shooting.

MORTON, and few had the capacity to work as hard. In raising, equipping and forwarding troops; in providing for their welfare in the field and their comfort while sick or wounded, and latterly in securing their prompt mustering out, and giving to each regiment a joyous welcome, he worked unflaggingly by day and night. He has personally supervised all these matters, down even to details; and, in the exercise of his patriotic duties, has passed to and fro between the State of Indiana, the National Capital, and the field, literally hundreds of times. At the same time he kept up the warlike and patriotic ardor of the State throughout the war, by laboring personally in the several counties, and delivering speeches everywhere. He maintained the credit and financial honor of Indiana, which a Copperhead Legislature had attempted to destroy, by the boldest and most skillful measures, and raised an abundance of money under the greatest difficulties. He was often called to Washington by President LINCOLN as an intimate friend and trusted adviser, and the support he gave to the government in its hour of trial, was profoundly appreciated by the entire administration. We trust that this able and eminent man, now prostrated in the service of his country, will renew his vitality and his power under the genial skies of Italy.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gov.

The return of so many old and tried members of the city regiments from the war, has given an impetus to recruiting, and the consequence is that the majority of the commands are rapidly filling up. The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Twenty-second Regiments have reached their maximum strength. The Seventh will turn out, next Friday, fully 750 men, fully equipped in the new and elegant chasseur uniform, lately adopted by the command. The new company just organized for Col. VARIAN's Regiment, (Eighth,) will not be able to parade with their regiment, in consequence of a failure to supply their uniforms in time. The new regiment, designated as the One Hundred and Twelfth, lately organized by Col. HULL, and more popularly known as Durye's Zouaves, and recently assigned to the Fourth Brigade, will also be kept out of line, because too much red tape is bound about the uniforms which now are lying boxed up in the United States Quartermaster's depot. No doubt these uniforms will be issued during the week, but not in time for the Zouaves to make any proper parade. If the uniforms had been issued in time this veteran organisation would have been able to prepare and so swell the ranks of the Fourth Brigade. We understand that the universal trouble regarding sufficient uniforms will bear heavily upon the gallant seventy-ninth Highlanders, whose surviving members from the battles of the rebellion have swelled the ranks of the home organization to such an extent, that were uniforms only forthcoming nearly four hundred muskets might be paraded. The Fifth Rifles are in a prosperous condition, and make a creditable display. The Fifty-Fifth are also in a proper position at present, although they might be better. The Twenty-Second will surprise their friends by their full ranks next Friday, most strenuous exertions having been made to equip every man enrolled.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR CITY MILITARY.; The Approaching Parade on Evacuation Day--Division, Brigade, and Regimental Orders.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR CITY MILITARY.; The Approaching Parade on Evacuation Day--Division, Brigade, and Regimental Orders.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edd004cf-2323-5cd0-8fa8-fa976f3fa8cd,1178,nyt://article/edd004cf-2323-5cd0-8fa8-fa976f3fa8cd

Two objections were urged: one, that the visit here would be quite brief, and entirely occupied to private businees; the other, that such a proceedings would be in absolute disregard of the General's reported dislike of parade or show. The project was abandoned for a time, but upon consultation it was ascertained that the General could so arrange his affairs as to find a spare evening for the reception of his friends. Several meetings were held by the gentlemen prominent in the matter, and after a little the project assumed shape and became the topic of town talk. Circulars were issued to one hundred and fifty persons, suggesting that each member of the body subscribe $100 toward defraying the expenses of the reception.

"By the arrival of the steamships City of London and the New-York at this port yesterday, we are placed in possession of highly interesting news respecting the notorious pirate Shenandoah.

ARTEAGA and twelve of his officers were shot after the surrender, and it is further related that Gens. GOMEZ, SALAZAR and PARAPACHOS have suffered a similar fate. When the decree reached us a few weeks ago, it was hardly thought that it would be put into execution; or, at all events, it was imagined it would be modified in some way, as for example, by holding their prisoners without the privilege of exchange, and suspending the death penalty over their heads. It is true there had been executions or assassinations of Republican Generals taken in arms by the Imperialists even before the issuance of the October decree, as in the case of the brave and patriotic Gen.

Work of the State Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/21/archives/florida.html,Work of the State Convention,"Gov. MARVIN telegraphs to the President that the Florida State Convention has completed its labors and adjourned. Their work seems to have been earnest and thorough; they annulled the ordinance of secession, emphatically repudiated the wax debts contracted by rebel authority, distinctly abolished slavery, and declared all the inhabitants of the State entirely free; provided for the admission of the testimony of colored persons, where any of that race are concerned, and amended and liberalized the constitution in other respects. It is not to be doubted that the Legislature will work in harmony with these great changes, and that within a brief period this undeveloped, but naturally rich State, will begin a new and promising career. Her ablest men have for years (long before the war) frankly admitted that slavery was their stumbling block, weak in itself as an industrial value, yet politically strong enough to shut out the capital and energy knocking a[???] their doors, and so sinking them down to a miserable appanage of their domineering neighbor on the North. During the war the rebels made good use of the natural wealth of Florida by drawing from her ever-luxuriant pastures a large portion of the beef and corn that supported their armies. Now that she opens her doors to liberty and enterprise, there is good reason that her wonderfully salubrious climate, her generally fruitful soil, her live-oak forests, and especially her favorable situation for trade with the Indies, will attract the stirring blood and busy capital of the North, and speedily bring her into hitherto unknown political and commercial importance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Florida.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Florida.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Florida', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ff2d40a-4ca8-5ea8-8767-f2449b319cc9,262,nyt://article/7ff2d40a-4ca8-5ea8-8767-f2449b319cc9

They are the keepers of boarding-houses, and the proprietors of hotels. Life in a boarding-house has been the oft-selected theme of cynics and querulists; it has never been considered a fit topic for levity. It is a serious business, costs a great deal, inculcates lessons of patience, and tends to sour the disposition. With this we have nothing to do, but desire simply to chronicle the fact that every boarding-house in the city averages its absolute fullness from the moderate dens of Water and Pearl streets, where dirty beds and wretched food are served at the small price of $2 50 per week, to the gorgeously gilded and elaborately frescoed salons of Fifth and Madison avenues, where one can sleep on modern bedsteads and endure four or five courses of cookery at prices ranging from $20 to $40 per week.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; HOTEL LIFE IN NEW-YORK.

VANDERVEER, aged 16 years, residing with his parents, No. 54 Woodhull-street, who died on Sunday from injuries sustained while on a gunning excursion near Fort Hamilton, on the 1st ult. The deceased was accompanied by a boy named WM. DISSEN. In rambling about in search of game they came to a fence, and seating themselves on the top rail VANDERVEER placed his gun in such a position that the trigger was beside his feet, and the muzzle near his head. DISSEN warned him of the danger he was in, and jumping down ran some distance. Hearing the report of VANDERVEER's gun he looked round and saw him falling from the rail. The bullet had perforated one ear, and he fell upon a stone, fracturing his skull. The wounded boy was conducted to the fort by some soldiers, where he was properly attended to by the surgeon. DISSEN was then told to take him home on the cars, but two conductors in succession refused to take him, and he was sent back to the fort, where he remained until the arrival of his father, some five hours afterward. The jury in the case rendered the following verdict: ""We find that WM.H. VANDERVEER came to his death by accidental injuries received by the discharge of a gun in his own hands, on the 1st of October, 1865. The jury further censure the Brooklyn City Railroad Company for the inhumanity displayed on the occasion in refusing to allow deceased to be brought to the city in their cars.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f743a999-e146-597a-9f1c-2d0dbfe33ef2,826,nyt://article/f743a999-e146-597a-9f1c-2d0dbfe33ef2

The Mississippi and Alabama Conventions, which met three or four months ago, did their business cleanly and expeditiously. They pronounced the secession ordinances to have been originally null and void, discarded all the debts which had been contracted to give effect to these ordinances, decreed the permanent abolition of slavery in the simplest and most direct terms, and imposed upon the next Legislatures the duty of enacting laws which should secure to the freedmen full protection of person and property. They did this with little prompting from Washington, and with little murmuring in any quarter. There was a general sense of what was due to the government, and a cheerful readiness to fulfill it. The later conventions have been less harmonious. In all of them there has been a faction which has been reluctant, perverse, and captious. The speeches of these men, as given in the reports of the conventions, show a great misconception of the actual situation. They all assume, more or less, that whatever the course of the Southern States, restoration will be an easy matter. These men have used the great magnanimity of the government in its amnesty and general policy of reconstruction, to give color to the pretence that, in the view of the government itself, no real crime had been committed, and that preliminaries to restoration were, after all, little else than a matter of form. This idea was strengthened by the position substantially taken by the Democratic party in all the late elections in the Northern States, that the restoration should be immediate and unconditional; and by the misrepresentation of the leaders of that party that this was what President JOHNSON was aiming to effect.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Progress of Reconstruction.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Progress of Reconstruction.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/068f3f04-ffe9-56cf-989f-098342ca9055,947,nyt://article/068f3f04-ffe9-56cf-989f-098342ca9055
Lessons Taught by,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/22/archives/lessons-taught-by-the-cattle-plague.html,Lessons Taught by,"The British Press has begun to agitate the question whether too much meat is not eaten in England. For one pound of meat the people of Scotland consume, the English consume ten. Yet there is quite as much health and muscular vigor north as there is south of the Tweed. Eighteen thousand head of cattle have been sacrificed this year by the plague, and really good meat is quite as dear in London as it is in New-York to-day. Economy has, therefore, become a necessity even with the well-to-do-classes; and some of the journals are occupied in inditing long homilies upon the subject -- laying down the law as to the quantity (three-quarters of a pound) which each person may wisely use per day. The London Times is, as usual, wonderfully sage. It observes: ""In Winter, at all events, there really is no reason why we should not import our butcher's meat from British American and other transmarine pastures."" Why this new trade should be opened in Winter, when the only portions of British America where cattle are to be had, are those which are closed to navigation, we do not exactly understand.

"New-York; Cortlandt-street, Hoerles' Boot Store",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/22/archives/the-police-courts-the-tombsbefore-justice-dowling-alleged-burglary.html,"New-York; Cortlandt-street, Hoerles' Boot Store","On Sunday morning, the boot and shoe store of JUSTUS HOERLE, No. 1 Cortlandt-street, was entered by burglars, at about 6 o'clock, who wrenched off the padlock and forced the bolts and inner lock with a jimmy, and robbed it of between three and four hundred dollars' worth of boots and shoes. A boy, who was returning from the paper office with his papers, saw three young men in the act of forcing open the door, but was afraid to give any alarm. Shortly after, another boy, employed in the barber's shop under the Merchants' Hotel, in Cortland-street, saw three young men as he was taking down the shutters of the shop pass by with boots and shoes in their hands. Capt. HELME, who shortly after visited the premises to ascertain the extent of the robbery and learn by what means the burglars had effected an entrance, learned the above facts from these boys, and also got a description of the dress and general appearance of the three young men, and set to work at once to find them out. He put an officer on the case to work it up, and also directed his officers to drive all the suspicious characters off who might be hanging around their several posts, and in case they did not leave, to arrest and bring them to the station-house. At about 7:30 o'clock on Sunday evening, Officer JOHN MALOY found a number of these characters congregated on his post in Greenwich-street, and ordered them away; two of them refused, and the officer found it necessary to use his club in arresting them, and brought them to the station-house, and the Captain at once recognized them from the description he had received as two of the parties who had been concerned in the robbery. They were detained over night on the officer's charge of disorderly conduct, and in the morning the boys before alluded to were sent for, and recognized them at once as two of the three men whom they had seen with the boots in the morning. They were taken to court and committed by Justice DOWLING, and sent back to the station-house to give the officers an opportunity more fully to work up the case. The Captain having learned that three young men answering their description had been seen on Sunday afternoon to enter the second-hand boot and shoe store of SAMUEL ROSENBERG, No. 121 Baxter-street, with some boots and shoes in their possession, and to leave without them, sent Officer WALKENSHAW to examine the premises for the stolen property. He succeeded in recovering a part of it, and arrested ROSENBERG as a receiver of stolen goods. On being brought to the station-house he recognized the two young men as two of the parties who had sold the shoes to him. Officer HEY arrested, during the day, the third prisoner, with a pair of the stolen shoes on his feet, and a pair of old shoes, found in the store, proved to fit him exactly. The four prisoners, THOMAS JENKINS, PATRICK SWEENEY, THOMAS LYONS and ROSENBERG were taken to court and committed for trial by Justice DOWLING.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POLICE COURTS.; The Tombs--Before Justice Dowling.

The various diplomatic problems now unsolved will become no more formidable by the postponement for a time of their solution, and questions that are now menacing may become harmless in their character.

Mrs. LANGDON was last on the premises up to about 3:30 o'clock on the afternoon of the day, making preparations for the carpenters and painters, the house requiring certain repairs. On leaving, she secured the doors as usual, bringing the keys away with her. The facts, as ascertained through Fire-Marshal BAKER, are that Mr. TELLPIE, who lives in the adjoining house, on going to his bedroom, discovered smoke therein, and on looking out of his window, saw flames issuing from the roof of his neighbor's house, on the south side. The police, under Capt. WILSON, were at hand almost instantly, and finding the front door securely fastened, broke it open, but found the fire to have extended so rapidly as to preclude all access to the second floor, or to save any of the furniture. Mrs. LANGDON estimates the value of the house at $10,000; insured in the Park and New-Amsterdam offices for $6,000. Her furniture she values at $2,500, and on this property she has an insurance of $3,000 in the Lenox Insurance Company. There is no other theory for the fire save as the work of an incendiary. Mrs. LANGDON had noticed when there last, a window of the laundry to have been pushed up, as if some person had entered or passed out thereby, but attached no great importance to this fact at the time. She also states that she caused a fire to be made in the grate of the dining-room, as the house was damp; but that it was quite low when she left it, and she cannot think it possible that the fire could have its origin in this.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f0a2a90-2f9a-57a6-b40d-1e4a4dc2ed0f,1285,nyt://article/4f0a2a90-2f9a-57a6-b40d-1e4a4dc2ed0f

the Call for in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/22/archives/a-healthy-signthe-richmond-press.html,the Call for in Virginia,"keeps up a lusty demand for labor. This is a wonderful change from the days when Virginia was wont to make merchandise of her surplus labor, by sending her slaves to the markets of the Cotton States. Virginia finds now that she not only needs all the labor she has in her population of freedmen, but that she requires a large importation to enable her to develop her vast resources. A healthier sign than this could hardly be given. It betokens a vitality in her industrial system which apparently but needed the removal of the curse of slavery to enable her to take the rank among her sister States to which her superabounding natural wealth entitled her. But for slavery it is probable that Virginia to-day would have been the most populous State in the Union. She now invites free labor, and we know of no community where such labor will find better recompense, for the next twenty years at least.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A HEALTHY SIGN.--The Richmond press', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A HEALTHY SIGN.--The Richmond press', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'LABOR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8156d05f-588c-54a0-b762-67d065a61430,161,nyt://article/8156d05f-588c-54a0-b762-67d065a61430

We fancy, however, that more matured judgment would place Our Mutual Friend much lower in the long list of DICKENS' books, if they were ranked according to merit. It would stand undoubtedly many degrees above (perhaps his worst work) Little Dorritt, but also an equal number below David Copper-field, and the older stories to which he owes his fame. The partiality for an involved plot, combined with an entire absence of the skill to manage and unfold it, though characteristic of DICKENS generally, was perhaps never so conspicuous as in his latest work. The crowd of unnecessary persons brought in, and described with singular elaborateness and detail, and then dismissed or forgotten, was never so much in the reader's way before, and yet, curiously enough, the author speaks in his Preface of the pains employed in devising the story, and the ingenuity shown in conducting it. Of course, in every book that DICKENS writes, there must be many characters and scenes that could originate with no one else -- much rich and fanciful appropriate detail founded on the close observation of nature that no one else could give us, and a hearty sympathy with the right, and hatred and cruelty of oppression. These will all be found in Our Mutual Friend. The portrait gallery that we owe to DICKENS is enlarged by the never-to-be-forgotten pair. Mr. and Mrs. BOFFIN, although the simplicity that distinguishes them is strangely at variance by the author's device, by which they assume fictitious characters and language in a plot, even though its object is a good one. There is no occasion to discuss at length a book now in every one's hands. Were it a total failure, its sale would scarcely be diminished, for it takes a long time for an author like DICKENS to write himself down, and of this we happily see no signs.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/22/archives/amusements.html,,"NIBLO's. -- Mr. FORREST has given ""Othello"" twice this week. Of his own performance nothing need be said; the public know it well; they know that it has a great many noble points, and a few strongly marked and disagreeable peculiarities. It is enough, however, to say that it is a great representation, worthy alike of the artist and the highly intelligent audiences that gather to listen and applaud. The cast of the piece is open to objection. It does not strike us that Mr. MCCULLOUGH is a good Iago. He did not seem to illustrate the wonderful deception and Mephistophiiian subtlety of the part; he was too plain and open in tone, so much so that one could not imagine that even the free and unsuspicious Moor would not at once see through his very flimsy disguise. Iago is one of the very best acting parts in the English drama; it is reasonably a more effective character than Othello, and a customary interchange of these parts by the greatest of actors has given them coequal position. Mr. MCCULLOUGH was accurate in the text, and most carefully elaborated the traditional points; but the inspiration of superior genius was not there. Mr. BURNETT's Brabantio was indifferently begun but admirably ended, and deserved more applause than the brevity of its stage existence gives room for. Of the Cassio of Mr. COLLIER, we have only to say that while evidently appreciating the needs of the part, he was incautious enough to overact it a little, and render it much too melodramatic; a small fault, but one that should be corrected. Mr. BECKS ought to surrender Roderigo to somebody -- anybody, who can appreciate the difference been a well-bred young gentleman, nursing an improper and hopeless love for one who never could have been approached save with most respectful courtesy, and a dancing-jack of a thing, simpering and fidgeting about the stage like a lunatic. There are many parts that Mr. BECKS can do admirably; but this is not one of them. The Desdemona of Miss AGNES PERRY was a very praiseworthy performance, modestly and delicately rendered throughout, in thorough harmony with the general interpretation. It is not a part in which to portray force; the graces of gentleness and simple trustfulness in conscious virtue are its main features, and these were well illustrated. If this be a fair specimen of her abilities she has a hopeful prospect.

C. and Fabian, Bonds, $40,000","WILLIAM CHASE BARNEY, a Custom-house clerk, and BENTHAN FABIAM, a clerk in the Treasury Department, were taken before Justice DOWLING, on the 6th inst., and required to answer for an alleged forgery of bonds to the amount of $40,000. Eminent counsel, namely: Messrs. JAMES T. BRADY, JOHN SEDGWICK, EDWIN JAMES, R.D. HOLMES and T. DUNPHY, were engaged, and the defence moved off by denying the court's jurisdiction, and claiming that inasmuch as the offence, if any, had been committed against the United States Custom-house, the prisoners ought to be heard before a United States judicial officer. It became manifest at once that the court had a tedious trial in prospect, and hence an order of adjournment was entered, to enable the lawyers to make full preparation. The accused, meantime, were committed to the Tombs. At a subsequent hearing it transpired that RICHARD CHAUNCEY also had been accused of complicity with BARNEY and FABIAN in the alleged forgeries, and another adjournment was ordered, to enable counsel to amend the papers by inserting his name therein. The case was set down for 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and it was understood that then the counsel would argue the question of jurisdiction, but when Justice DOWLING took the bench a messenger delivered a note from Mr. JOHN SEDGWICK asking an adjournment, because of his being engaged in the Superior Court; and everybody consenting, His Honor named Tuesday afternoon next, at 2 o'clock, as the time when he would listen to such arguments as counsel might offer. FABIAN and CHAUNCEY were thereupon remanded to the Tombs.

We do not say that the finances necessarily constitute the weak or the dangerous point in our national future; but if responsible men choose to speak as it our debt were unmanageable, our financial system false, and ultimate repudiation inevitable, they will assuredly in time produce a weak and dangerous condition of that public faith upon which cur stability is founded. There are in finances, as in other matters, a vast number of narrow-minded men, who hold an equally vast number of narrow and divergent theories, and each of whom devotes himself to preaching that if his special scheme be not carried out, everything will go to wreck. They generally begin by showing that things are on the verge of ruin already, and that only this or the other measure, of which they hold the patent, can possibly save the country. They are a dangerous class -- not, perhaps, that the theories of all of them are dangerous, but that they all seem to think it necessary to destroy the public confidence as a preparation for their theories. When such men get into Congress or into print, they are able to unsettle the faith of thousands, even though able to give nothing satisfactory in place of that which they take away.

Carey. -- This case brought up the very interesting question of how far one court may interfere with the jurisdiction of another in matters of contempt. The petitioner had purchased the mortgaged premises in a foreclosure suit in the Common Pleas, bidding at the referee's sale $15,600, and depositing, in accordance with the terms of sale, ten per cent., viz., $1,560. Subsequently he objected to completing the sale on various alleged defects of title, but his objections were overruled, and from the order overruling them the petitioner appealed. An order was then procured by the plaintiff in the former suit, on the ground, among others, of collusion between Carey and the defendants, that he pay the balance of his purchase, $14,040, with interest from the 25th of September, to the referee. This was afterward modified so far as to allow him to pay the money into court. Failing to comply with either of these orders, the Court of Common Pleas issued an attachment, and, after the usual proceedings by interrogatory, the petitioner, Carey, was committed to close confinement until he should comply with the orders, and pay $30 as costs. Carey then procured from the Supreme Court a habeas corpus, to which the Sheriff made return that he held the relator by virtue of the commitment of the Court of Common Pleas, which he annexed. The relator then asked that a writ of certiorari be issued to the Court of Common Pleas to compel a return from that court of all their proceedings on which the commitment for contempt was based.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Conflict of Jurisdiction.; SUPREME COURT--CHAMBERS.

JEHIN PRUME. -- The expectations which the public had of an artist who bears a name so well known and esteemed as that of PRUME, attracted a large audience to Irving Hall, on Saturday last, and we are happy to state that these expectations were realized to a great extent. Mr. PRUME is a gentleman who evidently has appeared frequently in the concert-room, and is no novice in his art. His style is eminently French, and of the same school which was best represented by BAZZINI, OLE BULL, BERIOT, PRUME, and which disappears more and more since JOACHIM, LAUB, SINGER, and other classical German players, have returned to the old masters. We therefore must judge Mr. PRUME exclusively from the standing-point of a salon-player; and in this respect he is a very talented and admirable artist. His playing is technically marvelous, and there are no difficulties which Mr. PRUME does not overcome with the greatest ease. His ""staccato"" is distinct and graceful, his flageolet pure and sympathetic; he plays the chromatic scale perfect, and he renders every ""fioritura"" and ""cadenza"" exceedingly well. His bowing also is very good, although not free from coquetry. If the foregoing qualifications alone would suffice to constitute the claim of a modern violinist to the name of a first-class artist, we should not hesitate to call Mr. PRUME so. But Mr. PRUME lacks some essential qualities for such a name. His tone is very small, and he almost incessantly whines whenever he has to play portamento or rostenuto. He phrases well enough, but he never gives the last note of a phrase its full value, but removes his bow with a disagreeable suddenness. He furthermore lacks quietude, and works painfully with his entire body during every variation, as if he wanted to show how difficult it was to get a certain figure out of the instrument. He also very often corrects the composer's work with an amiable ""insouciance,"" which was especially disagreeable in his rendition of ERNST's ""Elegy,"" a piece seldom heard to greater disadvantage. As a result of Mr. PRUME's playing on Saturday last, we have to say that he has nothing more to learn, but a great deal to unlearn, and this he will undoubtedly do, as he is a young gentleman yet. A number of well-meaning, but highly injudicious friends, interrupted every piece by their extremely offensive applause, and evidently embarrassed ths artist. Of the artists assisting Mr. PRUME we mention Mr. MILLS, who played superbly as ever, and Miss ZELDA HARRISON, a very premising young mezzosoprano, who was exceedingly well received.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.; A Valuable Theatrical History Proposed.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.; A Valuable Theatrical History Proposed.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f6c0c3e-d8a9-5fb5-82b3-392b2f9d497c,1201,nyt://article/0f6c0c3e-d8a9-5fb5-82b3-392b2f9d497c

Objection to the President's Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/23/archives/the-hownottodoit-policy.html,Objection to the President's Plan,"If it be true that ""where there is a will there is a way,"" the prime question is whether there is a will. It is the having no will to do a thing that makes what is called an ""impracticable,"" and to be that is to be without any right to moral influence. There are men who have no will that the South should soon be restored. They are full of objections against the President's plan, which spring not so much from opposition to the particular mode of restoration, as to the restoration itself. They are shut up to the ""foregone conclusion"" that the South ought not, for an indefinite period hence, to enjoy again its full constitutional powers. In many cases, this comes from an honest belief that the Southern whites will not, for years, be fit to be trusted with any power over the race they have so lately held in slavery. In many other cases, it is but the offspring of that old vindictive feeling of the human heart which delights in keeping down a prostrate enemy. In other cases still, it proceeds from a dread of the revived political power of the South, as a mischievous element in the future politics of the country. But however various the motives, the result is the same -- a policy of obstruction and procrastination. The only study of these people is how not to do it.

The plaintiffs' counsel, Mr. Dean, opened the case, and introduced testimony which tended to show that some negotiations had been had prior to the 6th day of April, 1864, relative to a sale by the defendants -- a respectable grocers' house in this city -- to the plaintiffs -- who were also respectable grocers -- of one hundred half chests of Oolong tea, in English order, of the value of about $4,300. The terms of sale were to be satisfactory paper at four months, which would sell in Wall-street, without recourse, at 7 per cent. per annum off, or cash, less 2 1/3 per cent. off. The sale was conducted through the intervention of one Wells, a tea-broker, and his clerk, a Mr. Love. The plaintiffs claimed the sale was absolute. The defendants insisted that the contract was never consummated, because the paper of the plaintiffs offered for the teas was not the class of paper they had given the broker authority to take. From the broker's testimony, on the direct examination, it would seem that he understood that the contract was entered into on the 6th of April, and subsequently, on the 9th, the defendants returned him the sale note, and insisted on the cash, and he went over and saw Mr. Washington Archer, who spoke as if it would be all right, but that he would have to see the senior partner of the concern.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Contract of Sale.

I., Cozens' Oil Factory--$50,000","DESTRUCTIVE FIRE AT BLISSVILLE, L.I. -- LOSS $50,000 -- THREE MEN INJURED. -- A fire of considerable magnitude took place at Blissville, Queens County, yesterday, involving a heavy loss of property, and throwing out of employment some two or three hundred men. About 11 o'clock, as some of the workmen employed in COZZENS & CO.'s kerosene oil factory were engaged in emptying some acids into the agitator, in the purifying house connected with the works, a volume of flame suddenly ascended, caused, it is believed, by impure chemicals, and in a few minutes, the whole building was filled with the roaring element. The terrified men stampeded in every direction, seeking for safety, and in a very few minutes a terrific volume of flame burst through the roof, rising to an altitude of at least three hundred feet, and measuring probably sixty feet in circumference. The dense smoke from the burning building obscured the atmosphere for miles around. Two hose companies and a truck from the Eastern District visited the scene of the fire, and were instrumental in saving all the buildings attached to the immense works, except that in which the fire broke out, which was entirely destroyed. By 2 1/2 o'clock the flames subsided. During the progress of the fire three of the men employed in the works were somewhat injured -- two by falling from a ladder and one by burns. The loss of oil is estimated at the value of $40,000, and the destruction of the building will involve a loss of about $10,000, including the machinery. There was no insurance. These oil works are probably the oldest in the country, and were originally erected for the manufacture of coal oil. They are owned by the brothers COZZENS, whose place of business is in Pearl-street, New-York.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a2e05200-85f0-515b-9525-87e429d2d463,299,nyt://article/a2e05200-85f0-515b-9525-87e429d2d463

Losing his way, however, he sought information from two men he met on the corner of Laurens and Bleecker streets, and in reply they told him to stay there, and probably the woman (Mrs. FLEMMING) would join him. Waiting there a short time, the prisoner, HARRY CLARKE, came forward and told him to go to his house in Thompson-street for another trunk, he remaining with this one till he returned. On going to Thompson-street to the number named, he was told there was no trunk there, and on his return to the place he had left CLARKE, found that he and the trunk had both disappeared. Searching for her property, Mrs. FLEMMING met a man named BARNEY AARON, who told her that he thought he knew where the trunk was, and that it might be had from CLARKE, in whose possession it then was, for $30. She gave the $30 to AARON, who procured her the trunk and its contents. She then made the complaint leading to the arrest of the prisoner. HARRY CLARKE, who is 31 years of age, and a native of Ireland, residing at No. 169 Laurens-street, where he kept a liquor-store, stated in his defence that a man left the trunk in his place for BARNEY AARON, and that AARON came there about four hours after and took it away.

This duty has never been so momentous as it will be on the occasion of the opening of the new Congress, now near at hand. As a consequence of rebellion, a part of the Union is in the most abnormal relation to the Federal Government. It is under a military rule, mild, to be sure, in its administration yet utterly at variance with every principle of our republican system. The great problem is how to terminate this, and revive the regular operation of the constitution consistently with future security, and with the obligations devolved by the war. It is the official duty of the President to gather all the data that bear upon this problem, and to work out the best conclusions he can in regard to it.

They examined his person, and found his right hand cut across the fingers, as indicated by the glove found in the Park. The cuts are clean, and show that they were made with a sharp instrument. His clothes were also examined, and they were found to be bloody. A young Spaniard named JUAN VELE, called to see the prisoner yesterday. He represented himself as a cook in a French boarding-house, and that he boarded at the Hotel de Cuba, in Bleecker-street, New-York. He stated that he had furnished PELLICER with money for ten days, in consequence of being out of employment, and in needy circumstances. Some days ago, he (the visitor) had invited several ladies to go to the theatre, and wished his friend PELLICER to go along. In order to make him look somewhat decent, he bought him a pair of kid gloves, and he (Mr. VELE) identified the gloves which were cut across the fingers as the ones he bought. Mr. VELE saw GONZALES at the Hotel de Cuba at different times. On Wednesday last, about 7 o'clock in the morning, GONZALES came there, and inquired for Mr. PELLICER, who came down to the door, and admitted him. GONZALES said he desired lodgings, and was then invited by PELLICER to his room up stairs. The servant girl was in the meantime directed to see the landlady, and ask her whether she could accommodate him. She sent word that she could. Mr. VELE occupied the same bed with PELLICER the night previous, and was present when GONZALES came to the room. GONZALES asked PELLICER to come one side, and they engaged in a private conversation, which continued for some time. The parties subsequently went down stairs. In the evening, about 7:30 o'clock, GONZALES and another man, supposed to be ORTEGO, called at the hotel. VELE was there at the time. GONZALES; said to PELLICER, ""Come, let's go,"" and PELLICER answered, ""Wait, I forgot something in my room,"" and he forthwith went up stairs into a room which bad previously been locked, and returned. The parties then took a walk toward Broadway. VELE found, from the action of the others, that he was not wanted in their company, and left them. GONZALES, ORTEGA and a young Spaniard continued their way down Broadway. That was the last that he saw of the deceased. PELLICER was not seen at the hotel after that evening. When he left the house he wore a spotted calico shirt, a white Derby hat, and dark mixed coat; vest and pantaloons. The clothing was found saturated with blood. The prisoner denies any knowledge of the murder, but refuses to look at the body of the murdered man. He pretends not to understand English, but will converse in Spanish with friends.

"Clamins vs. Town. -- This was an action of slander, damages laid at $500. From the opening of C.S. Spencer, Esq., plaintiff's counsel, it appeared that the plaintiff was a bar-tender for Mr. Fangado, who kept a liquor-store in West-street, in this city. While there the defendant, in June last, came in and asked him if he had paid that money over to his employer he had left with him, to which the plaintiff replied that he had received no money from him, (the defendant,) whereupon the defendant charged him with stealing the money, calling him a thief, &c. In consequence of these allegations his employer discharged him. The plaintiff when put on the stand corroborated the statement of his counsel, and under oath denied ever having received any moneys from the defendant to give to his employer. Mr. McMahon, on the part of the defendant, stated that on the 3d of June, 1865, the defendant, a sail-maker, borrowed of Mr. Fangado $20, to be returned to him in two hours. Being about to go out of town at the time appointed, the defendant came into the store of Fangado, and not finding him in, gave the money to the plaintiff to hand to his employer, in payment of his loan. On the 8th day of June following, Mr. Fangado asked the defendant about that money, and he said: ""I gave the money to Dick,"" meaning the plaintiff. Fangado denied that the plaintiff had given it to him, whereupon defendant took him in and confronted plaintiff, who, after some hesitation, denied having received the money; whereupon the defendant said to him: ""If you have not paid over that money to Augustus, (meaning Fangado,) you have put it in your pocket and stolen the money."" The defendant, when put on the stand, corroborated this statement, and swore that he gave the plaintiff the money to give to his employer, Mr. Fangado was sworn, and testified that he had intended to discharge the plaintiff before this occurrence, and did not do so on account of this difficulty.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/25/archives/general-news.html,,"Later news from Matamoras states that the Liberals are in force eight miles from that city, and an unimportant skirmish had taken place, in which one Imperialist was killed and three taken prisoners. The battle of the kegs, ludicrously famous in our Revolutionary war, was paralleled recently on the Rio Grande, when the Imperialist gunboats did heroic warfare for some time upon some barges laden with wood, which had broken away and were, floating down the stream. The innocent barges were mistaken for iron-clads; one of them had her rudder shot away. The dispatch says that ""highly important communications had passed between the Imperial commander of the fleet and the Federal commander at Brownsville, which will cause considerable excitement in official circles."" An official order was issued by MEJIA prohibiting any one from crossing from the American side, or vice versa. Upon the receipt of information that there was firing upon Antonio from the Texas side, the French Commodore dispatched a vessel to Vera Cruz with the particulars of the occurrence, and it is reported that a swift vessel will be dispatched to France for reinforcements. A gentleman lately from Matamoras says that the rebel force is much scattered, and the streets of the city have been fortified with earthworks. He also states that two flatboats came down on the night of the 14th and attacked the Imperialists gunboats, which succeeded in sinking both. Many of the Liberals were killed and drowned, and some captured. (Probably untrue.) The Matamoras Ranchero, of the 10th, says: ""Despite the report to the contrary, there is not the slightest apprehension of another attack on the city.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a42b5a71-d38f-5e70-968f-2a82a626e942,1111,nyt://article/a42b5a71-d38f-5e70-968f-2a82a626e942

The troops who are marched through our streets must feel abashed at the sight of the armless and legless veterans who have covered themselves and their country with glory, and we doubt not would gladly be relieved from this yearly farce.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SOMEWHAT OVERDONE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SOMEWHAT OVERDONE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-11-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b2e6b422-e61d-55c8-af24-af2d4eab70ed,152,nyt://article/b2e6b422-e61d-55c8-af24-af2d4eab70ed

WARD, residing at No. 85 Laurens-street, a native of Connecticut. The complainant stated that he came here in September last in search of employment, and that on searching the advertisements in a morning journal ho found one in which a situation was offered at $18 per week, the sum of $400 to be deposited as security for the honesty of the employe; that he replied to this advertisement in person, by calling at the place named in the advertisement, No. 266 Broadway, Room No. 4. That there he met the prisoner, OSCAR SMITH, who explained to him the nature of the situation, that of grocery clerk, in a most respectable establishment. Complainant went with SMITH to a store No. 299 Fourth-street, where he was introduced to the alleged proprietor, HUGH W. GERN, ultimately agreeing to accept the situation on the terms proposed, an agreement being drawn out to that effect. He then went to a lawyer with SMITH, where the contract was made and signed, and he then handed SMITH $300, SMITH having agreed, as GERN's agent, to accept that sum, the complainant being unwilling to give more. On the day named for his going to business, on his reaching the store, GERN was not there, the place being in charge of a man pointed out to him by SMITH the day before as the wagon driver of the establishment. Waiting there all day, he found that the representations of SMITH as to the trade of the house was slightly overdone, as but five dollars instead of fifty were taken in. Next day he came again, with like results, but on this day a young man called to see GERN, and stated that he had been relieved of $400 by the same advertisement, and had come that day to take his situation. It appears that further evidence will show that these gentlemen have carried on this game with great success, making as much as $1,600 in a day by their conspiring and fraud.

"AN ELOPEMENT. -- A few evenings since a young man, accompanied by a girl 18 years of age, arrived in the 11 P.M.

She replied that she had been deceived and intended to jump off the dock. The superintendent told her that he could not allow that, and after further conversation the girl said that she was not married to the man with whom she came, but that she had eloped with him from Middletown, N.Y., under the promise of marriage on their arrival at Jersey City, but that as it was too late to procure the services of a minister, she had consented to pass as his wife until the following morning, when they were to have the ceremony performed; that after going to their room and engaging in conversation awhile, the young man said he could not fulfill the contract as he was already married.

The day was magnificent, and the atmosphere of that genial nature that Indian Summer alone gives us. The members of the New-York Club were met at the depot by a deputation of the College boys, escorted to their grounds, and after an excellent lunch the game at once commenced, the Actives taking the bat. This club were short three of their first nine, but their places were well filled by TILTON, HILLYER and CHRISTIE, of the second nine. The Alerts on this occasion played with more energy and better judgment than they did with the Unknowns the week before, the playing of one or two of their number being particularly good. Several ladies, and most of the faculty of the college were on the grounds during the game, imparting additional interest to it by their hearty applause. Upon the conclusion of the game, the Actives were treated to some excellent instrumental and vocal music by Messrs. REILLEY and RICHARDS, of Seyton Hall, and also to a bountiful repast, where many well chosen remarks were made by the Presidents of the Alerts and Actives, as also by Rev. Father MCCREADY, President of the college. At the parting at the depot, cheer after cheer were given by the departing club for the Alerts, their gentlemanly treatment and generous hospitality.

"November, 1864, PETER J. CUCUEL, of Morristown, N.J., in a fit of madness caused by intoxication, deliberately murdered his wife, by stabbing her in the breast with a butcher-knife. He was tried at the last May term, convicted, and sentenced, in accordance with the law, to be hanged. Persevering efforts to obtain a new trial or a commutation of sentence were made, but they all failed, and on Friday, the 24th inst., just a year and a day after the commission of the crime, he was executed. The execution took place in the jail yard at Morristown. Some four hundred persons were admitted as spectators within the prison walls. A very large concourse of people were assembled outside. The drop fell at precisely 12:15 o'clock. The unhappy man slept five hours on the previous night, but was much prostrated the next morning.

Precautions against Cholera,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/26/archives/sanitary-precautions-in-rhode-island.html,Precautions against Cholera,"It is encouraging, now, that other cities at least are doing, what New-York neglects to do; that is, the preparing for the approach of the cholera. The City of Providence was attacked by all three visitations of this pestilence, but, owing to vigilant and energetic sanitary measures, she escaped with only some 150 deaths in each of the two latter. Under the advice of a skillful Superintendent of Health -- Dr. SNOW -- she is now preparing for a fourth. This scientific adviser but follows the majority of the profession in Europe and America, in denying that cholera is contagious, (though admitting that the seeds of the disease may be conveyed by the excreta of the sick,) and therefore lays little weight on quarantine -- which, indeed, in the case of a city like Providence, would be practically impossible. He accordingly calls the whole attention of the citizens to preventive measures. The experience of England, as Dr. SNOW well urges, shows that the condition of the drinking-water in a town is one of the chief causes or stimulants of the disease. Providence suffers under one of the curses of American cities, which ought to have gone out with the witches, or any abuse of the Middle Ages -- cesspools side by side with wells; the excreta of the one thus draining into the fluid of the other, and scattering wide the seeds of every kind of malady. Bad water and cholera inevitably go together. The Health Officer accordingly recommends a supply of pure water, and the draining of all cesspools and open privies, as an indispensable condition of safeguard.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sanitary Precautions in Rhode Island.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sanitary Precautions in Rhode Island.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Rhode Island', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7b891cba-237c-52ef-b05a-2fdd861f77c2,1265,nyt://article/7b891cba-237c-52ef-b05a-2fdd861f77c2

This tallent for forgetting, as it may justly be called, is particularly conspicuous wherever truths become public which tend to lower England's position among the nations. For example, while the Thunderer gave broadside after broadside to the glorification of the Cherbourg naval review -- now painting its details in the glaring colors of its correspondents, and anon lauding the tout ensemble in ponderous editorials -- not one word has it ever contained descriptive of the far more important iron-clad show at Stockholm. And yet, so far as scientific results are concerned, there can be no comparison between these two contemporaneous naval pageants.

At a meeting of the managers of the Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Companies, in this city, yesterday, the details of a contract were agreed upon with MILLER & COURT-RIGHT, two experienced contractors, to construct a railroad from Irving to Oil City, a distance of fifty-three miles, with three miles of siding, and to furnish the same with locomotives and cars, the whole to be completed with the equipments in all of May, 1866, or in about five months from this time -- equal to about eleven miles per month.

It contains some sentences which are worthy to be remembered among the pithy utterances for which he will be always famous. ""No party,"" says Mr. LINCOLN, ""can command respect which sustains this year what it opposed last."" The defeat of the Democratic party at the recent election points this moral, as was never done more thoroughly. The Democratic leaders undertook to do this very thing. They imagined they could make the people forget what they had said and done but one year ago. And we consider it one of the good results of the election that this attempt of theirs has not received the varnish which success would have given it. If this shift of theirs had commanded success, they would not have cared so much if it had not commanded respect. But their failure has brought out the truth of Mr. LINCOLN's remark in a most striking way, and the example will, we doubt not, be a useful one. Politicians will be taught again the old lesson that ""consistency is a jewel"" -- not merely an ornament, but a thing of value, which cannot be lightly thrown away without leaving the spendthrift so much poorer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

Magazines for December,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/27/archives/literary-the-magazines-for-december.html,Magazines for December,"-- The Atlantic Monthly (Boston: TICKNOR & FIELDS,) for the coming month, winds up the old year with spirit, and is a number far above the average. It commences with the first installment of a story by CHARLES READE, (which is the ""leading feature"" of the new sixpenny London magazine The Argosy,) entitled ""Griffith Gaunt, or Jealousy."" It opens well, and the continuation will be looked for with interest. ""William Blackwood,"" by JOHN NEAL, is a capital original chapter from the literary reminiscences of one who, having seen and done much, has much to tell. ""The Chimney Corner"" continues to show Mrs. STOWE's excellent good sense, applied to the amelioration of the every-day troubles of life. CHARLES DICKEN's feeling notice of Miss PROCTOR is given from the new illustrated edition of her Poems. The most remarkable paper is well described in its title: ""Clemency and Common Sense; a Curiosity of literature with a Moral,"" by Hon. CHARLES SUMNER. In a dozen pages he painfully traces the literary history of a mediaval Latin poem, remarkable as being the source of the well known quotation: Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens evitare Charybdim, and then appends a moral on the dangers of the republic, between the Scylla of concession and compromise and the Charybdis of State Rights. The article is creditable to Mr. SUMNER's industry in a field possessing little general attraction, though it is strange that a scholar of his eminence should nod so far as to speak of ""the Monastery of St. Gall in France,"" when referring to the famous ecclesiastical establishment in Switzerland. ""The Parting of Hector and Andromache,"" is an Homeric translation by W.C. BRYANT, that will attract all lovers of poetry. In the ""Reviews"" we learn that ""now Mr. HAWTHORNE is dead, America has not, perhaps a writer who is master of a more graceful prose than -- HIGGINSON.""

In its interior arrangements the church is admirably adapted to the holy purpose to which it has been dedicated, and to the comfort of the congregation, who cannot but feel gratified at the extremely happy results of the labors of those to whom its construction and chastely modest decoration were intrusted. The corner-stone of the building was laid on the 6th day of July last, and the interior completed a few days since. The structure measures ninety feet by forty, and seats commodiously its congregation of four hundred and fifty persons. The pulpit, of graceful design and ornamentation, is a gift of a member of the congregation, alike creditable to his taste as to his charity. The organ is small, but of much sweetness of tone, and of compass sufficient for the space it is required to fill. The pews are painted in enamel, with framing of black walnut, and cushions of neutral-colored merino. The effect upon the stranger as he enters the edifice is that neatness and order lend their aid to sanctify the house of prayer. The service was opened by the young and eloquent pastor, Rev. CHARLES E. HART, who, after the staging of the opening hymn by the congregation, offered up with much fervor and devotion the dedicatory prayer. A sermon was then delivered of considerable power, with frequent passages of rhetorical beauty, by Rev. S.D. ALEXANDER, D.D., from the text, Isaiah, 59th chapter and 21st verse. The service closed by the singing of the 101st Psalm, the congregation rendering with much feeling the passage, pregnant with beauty and with promise, ""Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me.""",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Dedication of a New Presbyterian Church.

HUMPHREYS, of Mississippi, a full copy of which appears today in another column, the President shows how far removed is his policy from any approach to sectionalism or partisanship. The question of the withdrawal of the national troops was that on which the President's views were asked for. And the tone in which these views are stated for the guidance of the civil authorities of Mississippi -- apart altogether from the entirely moderate and reasonable character of the views themselves -- cannot but convince the rational-minded of the Southern people that the basis of Mr. JOHNSON'S policy is conciliation. Not conciliation of one class at the expense of justice to another -- but conciliation between all classes, as well as all sections. ""The troops will be withdrawn,"" says the President, ""when peace and order and the civil authority have been restored and can be maintained without them."" Again he says: ""Every step will be taken while they (the troops) are there to enforce strict discipline and subordination to the civil authority."" No concession is to be required of the people of Mississippi, other than a loyal compliance with the laws and Constitution of the United States -- including ""protection to all freedmen in person and property.""

Liquor and Crime,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/27/archives/liquor-and-crime.html,Liquor and Crime,"Every day's police and criminal reports indicate anew the great and terrible agency of liquor in the production of crime. In the latest of our local horrors -- the murder of Senor OTERO in Brooklyn -- the perpetrators of the crime, (if we may infer that those under arrest as the culprits are really such,) first plied their victim and then filled themselves with hot and strong liquor, as a necessary preliminary to the commission of the atrocity. And nine out of ten of the murders that disgrace our community are committed under the same infernal influence. The same thing may be said of the lesser grades of criminality. In cases of violent assault, the assailants are nearly always excited by liquor; and in a large proportion of the personal outrages on the streets and elsewhere, the victim or the perpetrator is a victim of this unnatural stimulus. It is one of the chief causes of domestic quarrels and difficulties -- one of the fundamental agencies of degradation and vice. In fact, it would seem from our experience, that, but for liquor and its influences, the grosser forms of crime would, in great measure, cease to prevail.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Liquor and Crime.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Liquor and Crime.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Liquor', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c8b2321-e4e7-53ec-8140-2ec546f75b44,333,nyt://article/6c8b2321-e4e7-53ec-8140-2ec546f75b44

When we got these, under the Lieutenant-Generaley of GRANT, we began to move forward, steadily and systematically, to the final triumph. It is possible that GRANT's way of reaching Richmond by an overland march was not the best conceivable way; it is certain that the necessities imposed by the policy of concentration were attended by loss and suffering, and were otherwise liable to severe criticism; it is doubtful whether all the cooperative movements were wisely designed, and it is sure that several of them were failures in execution. But the great and important central fact remains that, with the governing unity referred to, it was possible to wield the entire forces of the nation harmoniously, and for the carrying out of a fixed purpose in a defined manner. It ended ambitious wranglings, rectified cross purposes, stopped the conflict of project and action, relegated military tyros and charlatans to limbo, and gave us the prime conditions of success, at the same time that it removed the main causes of failure.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Financial Policy The Secretary of the Treasury.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Financial Policy The Secretary of the Treasury.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b44bcc1a-6e6a-5f3e-b4a6-90093e132b6f,742,nyt://article/b44bcc1a-6e6a-5f3e-b4a6-90093e132b6f

Kennie, resulting in the victory of the former, in one hour and thirteen minutes -- the owners of the respective horses driving them. Both were what is technically termed green road horses, neither having been trained on the track, or publicly driven on it previously. The match created considerable interest in private trotting circles at the time, and little among the habitues of the course. The match was horse against horse, and not against time, hence there was no necessity for a display of speed, or the urging of either horse beyond his natural speed. Nevertheless, the winner was extremely distressed, and died the following forenoon. The black golding (the loser) exhibited much less fatigue, and his owner showed him to us a few days afterward, in his road wagon in New-York, looking little, if anything, the worse for his trot. Butler, Jr., was half brother to the celebrated trotting gelding General Butter, and was thought very highly of by his owner. Captain Kennie's pedigree is unknown, but there is evidently a great deal of blood in him, which is exhibited in his clean legs, the thoroughbred points in his quarters, and in his method of getting over the ground. He stands about 15 1/2, hands. All that his owner knows of him is that he was sired by a Canada stallion out of an imported English mare. The winner had the advantage of being driven on the road all the Summer, and was consequently full of hard food, whereas his opponent had been turned out to grass during the whole period, and was only taken up three weeks prior to the race, and was consequently in a sott, green condition -- the only training he had received being a gentle jogging on the road, added to which his driver weighed 40 pounds more than the driver of Butler, Jr., who was far below the regular Fashion Course weights, which caused a discussion among the judges as to whether he ought not to have been distanced for being short of weight. It was to be regretted that the judges did not take the time of the separate miles in so interesting a race, but the owner of the survivor asserts that without track-training he has driven him over the course in 2:36; and MACE, the professional driver, declares confidently that he will, if he is placed under his care, bring him down ""among the twenties.""

On the 7th inst., as was reported some days ago, the Franco-Mexican steamer Antonio was fired upon from the Texan side of the river by some fillibustering squad, of whose nationality, purposes or character nothing whatever is definitely known. An Imperial journal published at Matamoras, however, pronounces the assault ""one of the most dastardly outrages ever perpetrated on the frontier."" Only two persons were hurt in the engagement. But as the Antonio had on board a detachment of Franco-Mexican marines, and had been previously under heavy fire from the Mexican side of the river, the firing from the ""neutral"" side was looked upon at Matamoras as an exceedingly outrageous insult. The assailants are alleged to have been dressed in ""Federal uniforms."" And to this fact, it is left to be inferred, it was due that the French commander refrained from returning the fire from the ""neutral"" side of the river.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Sensational Reports from the Rio Grande.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Sensational Reports from the Rio Grande.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11dd964b-4e7b-5714-88b3-c95371fe0777,634,nyt://article/11dd964b-4e7b-5714-88b3-c95371fe0777

"Both GONZALEZ and PELLICIER, the alleged murderers of OTERO, are still held in irons by Capt. WADDY, in the Myrtle-avenue Police-station, Brooklyn.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/28/archives/the-brooklyn-murder-gonzalez-affected-at-sight-of-the-murdered-man.html,,"Both GONZALEZ and PELLICIER, the alleged murderers of OTERO, are still held in irons by Capt. WADDY, in the Myrtle-avenue Police-station, Brooklyn. They stood up stoutly until yesterday morning, maintaining a dogged stubbornness, and seemingly entertaining some hope of escape from the awful weight of evidence that Capt. WADDY and his officers have accumulated against them; but yesterday morning they broke down, and so sensibly was GONZALEZ affected, that for a time he was unable to stand erect in his cell. He was yesterday morning, in a close coach, accompanied by Capt. WADDY and an officer. The visit was made as secretly as possible; nevertheless, at the undertaker's, a number of persons having recognized Capt. WADDY, the inference was at once drawn that one of his companions was the murderer, and naturally quite a throng soon gathered in the street; but there was no disturbance. On catching a glimpse of the corpse, GONZALEZ blanched and turned away; and when drawn near the body he shuddered, but uttered not a word. He was almost immediately removed in the Masonic Building, in Fulton-street, and here -- as had been previously done in the case of PELLICIER -- his photograph was taken by Mr. WILLIAMSON. As at the undertaker's, so here, a multitude collected in front of the doors, and before Capt. WADDY was ready to take his departure, the multitude had been augmented to the number of more than a thousand persons, and it was with no little difficulty that Capt. WADDY replaced his prisoner in the coach. He was then rapidly whirled off to the Forty-fourth Precinct Police-station, and remanded to his cell in the basement Yesterday afternoon, of No. 1,703 South Sixth-street, Philadelphia, master of the bark Thomas, appeared at the Forty-fourth Precinct Station-house and identified both GONZALEZ and the old garments which he cast aside on the morning following the murder, and which Capt. WADDY's men seized on Saturday evening in the sleeping chamber which GONZALEZ had occupied in the German boarding-house, at No. 217 Centre-street. There was blood on the right coat-sleeve, blood on the shirt, blood spattered on the pantaloons, and blood in one of the pockets into which GONZALEZ, after committing the murder, thrust his hand, Having also identified GONZALEZ, Capt. PETERSON went to view the body of OTERO, and this also he identified. He then returned to the Myrtle-avenue Police-station, and there made concerning his knowledge of the murderer and the murdered. Captain PETERSON has been eighteen years in the Cuban trade, sailing from New-York to Cardenas. In both cities he has a large circle of acquaintances, particularly among commercial men. He knew OTERO in Cardenas as the keeper of a confectionery, restaurant and billiard saloon, and he says that OTERO was highly respected there. Last year OTERO drew a capital prize of $25,000 in the Royal Havana Lottery, and not $10,000 as was at first reported. With this money he undertook to erect a new theatre capable of seating 216 persons in the parquet; and he had progressed so far with this enterprise that at the time of his departure for New-York only the furniture and a few trilling fittings for the interior were needed to complete the house. He had expended nearly $20,000 on the theatre, and had only about $5,000 available funds left; but this he conceived to be sufficient, and with it he came to New-York. On board the Havana steamship he made the acquaintance of GONZALEZ, a Havanese rectifier, who had been thrown out of employment by the burning of a distillery, and who was bound for New-York to seek a position, as the TIMES has already said. Arriving in this city, OTERO sought Capt. PETERSON and arranged for the transportation of his purchases to Cuba, and the Captain being well acquainted in the city OTERO secured his services as a guide. GONZALEZ appears to have dogged his steps until, desiring to try the Philadelphia market, he accompanied the Captain to Philadelphia. GONZALEZ tarried behind during this trip, and spent most of his time in the Barcelona Hotel and at the Hotel de Cuba. In Philadelphia OTERO priced thirty-six iron columns for the interior of his theatre, an 1 bade Capt. PETERSON purchase a sewing-machine for his (OTERO's) sister-in-law in Cardenas. This machine was brought to this city yesterday, and stowed in the hold of Capt. PETERSON's vessel, at her pier at the foot of Dover-street.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE BROOKLYN MURDER.; Gonzalez Affected at Sight of the Murdered Man He is Identified by Capt.Peterson, of the Bark Thomas WhoOtero Was The Inquest and the Funeral.

ROBERTS was one of the staunchest supporters of the war, gives him no title to the support of the Union party for the Mayoralty. Were it said no conclusive title, we might admit it. Were he dishonest and corrupt, or were he so weak as to be transformable into a mere tool for other men of that character, nothing he might have said or done in the war would make him fit to be our Mayor. Personal integrity and firmness are indispensable qualifications for the office. If absent, all other recommendations are worthless.

That being the case, we say that the fact that he has been a thorough-going Union man through the times which tried men's souls, when every one of his competitors was more or less derelict, made it right that he should be put in nomination by the Union party, and entitles him to the vote of every truly loyal man.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mayoralty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mayoralty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7204314-59ec-5397-ac78-90e0d3e8f1db,748,nyt://article/d7204314-59ec-5397-ac78-90e0d3e8f1db

Mormon Question and Its Easy Solution,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/28/archives/the-mormon-question-its-easy-and-peaceful-solution.html,Mormon Question and Its Easy Solution,"Our correspondent in Utah gave, through our issue of yesterday, a somewhat stimulating review of the present condition of things among the Mormons. He depicted the despotic power exercised by the Prophet BRIGHAM YOUNG; declared that YOUNG and the other hierarchs are treasonably disposed toward the United States Government; and not only this, but the Mormon people, under the advice of their leaders, are preparing for resistance, even to war, against any interference with what they call their religious faith -- which latter article, as appears from all they say and do, is reduced to but one item -- polygamy. The burden of the Mormon sermons to the people is to arm, and ""arming they are."" Nor is this the most impressive circumstance. There is actually an individual designated as ""Drill-Master-General,"" who has been for a long time actively engaged in the business of arming and drilling the forces of the Church of Latter Day Saints for the great battle of Armageddon. Our correspondent gave some other items of Mormon news less portentous than these, but which, nevertheless, may deserve as much attention and more immediate action; such as, that there are Federal officials who take part in treasonable practices, who indulge extensively in polygamy, and who fail to do their duty as assessors and collectors of government taxes. We earnestly trust that the authorities at Washington will see that this last-mentioned matter is rectified, even before making preparations to meet the Mormon hosts on the final field of Armageddon.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mormon Question Its Easy and Peaceful Solution.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mormon Question Its Easy and Peaceful Solution.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-11-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0b68d53-889c-5544-ac18-6291c24cf2e1,949,nyt://article/f0b68d53-889c-5544-ac18-6291c24cf2e1
Abroad and at Home,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/28/archives/cotton-abroad-and-at-home-the-eng.html,Abroad and at Home,"lish papers report a better prospect of cotton next year from India and Egypt than at any previous time. The conditions of raising and transporting the staples in both these countries are greatly improving; and if the price could be kept up to the present figure for ten years longer, a permanent and sufficient supply for the European market might by that time be obtained. But it is here that the peril and the fear arises. For if cotton can be again raised in this country at anything near the old price, or even at the rate of fifteen to twenty cents a pound, then neither the Indian nor Egyptian growers can compete with us, and their prosperity will collapse. We think there is good reason for other countries to fear this. We believe that cotton will be planted over a very large surface next Spring; and by the year following next, when the South shall be well supplied with capital; when its labor and industry will be thoroughly organized; when emigration shall have poured thither, and when the use of new and improved machinery shall be extensively introduced, we shall probably give Europe all the cotton it needs at ten cents a pound, or less.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COTTON ABROAD AND AT HOME.

It is largely devoted to a narration of his observations and experiences in the United States, and is at once very able, very friendly, highly eulogistic and highly enthusiastic. He told his auditors that ""to understand America they must go there,"" and ""no man of business entering life,"" said he, ""should consider his education complete, until he paid a visit to the United States."" He expressed himself as astounded beyond measure at our greatness, growth and power, as they had displayed themselves in war and in peace. On the great questions of the reconstruction of the Union and the maintenance of peace between America and England, he expressed himself as satisfied with the prospects; and the London Times' report of the speech says that a protest which he made against the Christian people of the two countries imbruing their hands in each other's blood was followed by ""loud applause, the whole assemblage rising to their feet, and cheering the honorable Baronet most enthusiastically."" In the same direction, the Times remarks: ""Sir MORTON PETO concluded his able speech by expressing a belief that England and America would in the future, now that the great blot of slavery was abolished, be better friends, and come to a better understanding; and the only thing required to accomplish that was that they should go to America as he had done, and feel their warmth of friendship as he had.

"SERIOUS SHOOTING AFFRAY IN JERSEY CITY. -- Yesterday afternoon a difficulty occurred between two canal boatmen named JOHN QUINN and AARON ROWLOF, at the Morris Canal basin, in Jersey City, which resulted in QUINN being shot by ROWLOF, and seriously, if not fatally wounded. The injured man was taken to the station-house, where he was attended by Dr. HADDEN. It appears that the gun was loaded with buck-shot, two of which penetrated the skull just over the left eye, and another entered the cheek. The doctor did not succeed in extracting the balls from the skull. ROWLOF was arrested by Constable STROBER, and was committed to the City Prison to await the result of the injuries. QUINN states that the difficulty originated in reference to tying up their boats; that he threatened to put a hole through ROWLOF's head, when the latter went into the cabin and brought out a gun and fired at him with the result above stated.

This establishment is at No. 896 Broadway, between Nineteenth and Twentieth streets, in the same building with Mons. BLOT's well-known Cooking Academy. Mr ELLIS has made every arrangement in this new establishment to supply, at the shortest notice, all kinds of family sewing from the plainest to the most delicate work, so that a complete traveling outfit for a lady or an entire family can be prepared at a day's notice. It is but little more than two years since Mr. ELLIS opened this up-town store, for the rental and sale of WHEELER & WILSON's, and HOWE's sewing-machines. The enterprise, which was then projected as an untried and doubtful experiment has so rapidly grown in public favor, that from a limited business, conducted as a simple convenience, it has become a recognized necessity, and hundreds and thousands of machines have been and are being sold, to be paid for in small installments, to widows and daughters of soldiers and others unable to pay the full price of a machine at once, and of all these cases not one single woman has failed to comply with the very liberal conditions made by Mr. ELLIS. In this way hundreds of humble homes have become the possessors of the machines, and much want and suffering prevented, while remunerative employment has been given to many hundreds of operators -- gratuitously taught -- to work the machine. Many refined and intelligent ladies have sought independence in the respectable remunerative employment which Mr. ELLIS has organized and is now extending in his new enterprise. -- Tribune.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/11/30/archives/ellis-new-sewing-rooms-mr-john-t.html,,"ELLIS, one of the most enterprising of the sewing-machine men of our city, has just opened rooms for family and general sewing -- entirely distinct from his other up-town establishment, at the corner of Twenty-second-street and Broadway, for the rental and sale of the Wheeler & Wilson, and Howe's sewing-machines.
