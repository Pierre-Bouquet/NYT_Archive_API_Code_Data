"Magazines for March, the",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/01/archives/the-magazines-for-march.html,"Magazines for March, the","-- Harper's New Monthly Magazine (New-York: HARPER & BROTHERS,) opens with the conclusion of ROSS BROWN'S ""Tour Through-Arizona."" His papers are valuable, as containing the fullest account yet given by any traveler of that remote region, and the summing up of his impressions is no doubt near the truth. He regards it as ""a territory wonderfully rich in minerals, but subject to greater drawbacks in the way of peaceable settled occupation than any of our territorial possessions."" The new installment of WILKIE COLLINS' novel, ""Armadale,"" preserves well the weird, mysterious atmosphere of the story. One portion -- the explanation of a dream --seems written with a recollection of EDGAR A. POE's peculiar analytical faculty. DICKENS' ""Our Mutual Friend,"" progresses also, but the writer is entangled among three or four sets of characters, very slightly connected together, if at all, by any community of interest, so that his transitions from one to the other tax the memory, and display an utter want of the constructive power needed for the easy working of a good serviceable plot. ""The Siege and Capture of Port Hudson, by Admiral FARRAGUT,"" forms the subject of JOHN S.C. ABBOTT's ""Heroic Deeds of Heroic Men."" The economic article is a full and exhaustive account of ""Sugar-making in Cuba,"" each process described being illustrated with excellent wood-cuts. Three or four stories of the usual magazine calibre, ""Mr. Raspton's Resurrection."" ""Poor Isabel,"" ""Maud Molyneaux's Music-Box,"" will gratify the lovers of fiction. ""Ultramarine Views"" is a lady's clever account of the disagreeables of an Atlantic trip. ""Our Lessons in Statesmanship"" takes a cheerful view of the results of the late Presidential election. Some of Harper's fair readers will miss the usual fashion plate, this month conspicuous from its absence, but there is enough good matter in the number to make up for the omission.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Magazines for March.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Magazines for March.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/232fdb6d-b98b-56cb-a6c5-635e64486d36,1242,nyt://article/232fdb6d-b98b-56cb-a6c5-635e64486d36

Carriers' Liability; Nieman vs. Grand Trunk Railroad,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/01/archives/interesting-to-common-carriers-supreme-court-circuit-before-justice.html,Carriers' Liability; Nieman vs. Grand Trunk Railroad,"Canada. -- This was an action brought for the recovery of a large quantity of tools which were shipped by the plaintiff for New-York, at a station on the Grand Trunk Railway, at or near Toronto, in February, 1863. The testimony showed that the Grand [???] Railway conveyed the goods in question to Portland, Me., and that they were there transhipped to a steamer of H.B. Cromwell's line, which delivered the property in question at her wharf in this city. No one calling for the merchandise within the period usual in such cases, it was sent to a storehouse with a view to its being sold. The Judge who tried the case, decided, after hearing all the testimony, that the only question was as to the construction to be given to the contract contained in some special regulations on the back of the receipt given to the consignor in Canada, by the defendant's agents, at the time of the delivery of the goods to them for transportation to New-York. One of the conditions printed on the back of the receipt was to the effect that the defendants agreed to convey the property for which they gave their receipt, to the end of their route, and upon its being delivered to another line of transportation, running thence to the place designated for the delivery of the goods, they were relieved from all responsibility. The Judge held that inasmuch as the plaintiff knew of these conditions at the time the goods were shipped, and the fact having been proved that Cromwell & Co. had delivered them in New-York, their place of destination though they could not be found by the plaintiff until near a year subsequent to February, 1863, the defendants were not liable as common carriers. The result would have been different, the court said, if the suit had been against Cromwell & Co., the owners of the line between Portland and New-York. The jury by direction of the court, therefore, rendered a verdict for the defendants. Leave was granted to plaintiff to take the case to the General term, without the usual security for costs.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Interesting to Common Carriers.; SUPREME COURT-- CIRCUIT.

Desertions; Prevalence of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/01/archives/rebel-deserters.html,Desertions; Prevalence of,"-- It has been noticed that whenever the rebel armies have abandoned any Southern State, we have invariably had from the troops of the State, wherever they were stationed, a great tide of desertion. One cause of the depletion of HOOD's army, on its retreat from Nashville, was in the desertion of thousands of the Tennessee soldiers, who declared they would never again fight out of Tennessee; and there have been very many other illustrations of the same phenomenon in the course of the war. The latest development of the kind has occurred since SHERMAN's army passed triumphantly across the State of South Carolina. The conscripts of that State, serving with LEE, are now passing over into our lines in large numbers. Our correspondent, writing from the right wing of the Army of the Potomac, on Saturday last, says: ""Another lot of fifty-three deserters, from a South Carolina regiment, who also came in on Thursday night, reported themselves as 'peace commissioners.' One of this number declared that they had gone into this war to 'put down the heresy that a negro is as good as a white man;' but as that doctrine was now apparently about to be adopted at the South, and the negroes were, to be placed in the ranks there and made their equals, they wished to go North, where there were fewer of such equals to be found."" Again, on the same subject, the same correspondent writes: ""The number of deserters reported at army headquarters, in the last twenty-four hours, is one hundred and eleven. This makes an aggregate of over three hundred in three days, on this side of the Appomattox, and two hundred on the north side. Those received here generally hail from South Carolina and Georgia. Many of them bring their arms with them, and the cavalry, in some instances, horses and equipments.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL DESERTERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL DESERTERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8375a63e-b089-51dc-b106-adcc58f748dc,345,nyt://article/8375a63e-b089-51dc-b106-adcc58f748dc

On escaping from Copenhagen, the vessel was found to be entirely unseaworthy; and PAGE, her commander, therefore made for the Spanish port of Corunna. The Government of Her Catholic Majesty, it is reported, lost no time, after the vessel came to anchor, in asking information from the French Government as to her real character. At first, it is said, an evasive answer was returned by M. DROUYN DE LHUYS. But on more mature consideration the Spanish authorities were advised to refuse to the Olinda the privilege of making repairs at Corunna. The United States frigate Niagara, meanwhile, had taken up a position at the entrance of the harbor, so as effectually to prevent all chance of the pirate's escape. The Sacramento has likewise been sent to reinforce the Niagara, and thus the career of the Olinda, now christened the Stonewall, may be said to be as good as ended, before it had well begun.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL RAM OLINDA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL RAM OLINDA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Spain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15efb75e-ee29-5e03-b606-1c1af171d015,179,nyt://article/15efb75e-ee29-5e03-b606-1c1af171d015

Hotel Keepers' Liability; Follet vs Leland,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/02/archives/liability-of-hotel-keepers-for-proverty-stolen-from-their-guests.html,Hotel Keepers' Liability; Follet vs Leland,"Dexter H. Follert vs. Simeon Leland et. al. -- This action was brought by the plaintiff against the Messrs. Lelands, proprietors of the Metropolitan Hotel, of this city, for the recovery of the value of a gold watch and chain, and $85 in money, which the plaintiff alleged had been stolen from a room of the hotel in which he was a guest in November, 1863. The testimony in the case went to show that plaintiff, when he retired to his room at night, turned the key in the lock, hung his watch and chain on a chair, and placed his wallet on a table. When he awoke in the morning the door was unlocked, and the watch and money gone. The defendants denied their liability, and gave testimony to show that they had posted a notice in the room, in a conspicuous place, wherein, among other things, they warned all guests to bolt as well as lock the door. The plaintiff admitted that he had not bolted the door, but maintained that neither the notice or bolt were conspicuous. The court held that the question was one of fact for the jury as to whether the notice was sufficient, and whether the bolt was so placed that a stranger in the room would naturally see it when turning the key in the lock. Judge LEONARD at the same time decided that the case did not come within the Act of the Legislature of 1855, when provides that if hotel keepers post bills in conspicuous places in the rooms of their guests, saying that they have provided a safe in the office where all valuables could be deposited, &c., they will not be held liable for loss. The money and watch in this case claimed to have been lost, the Judge said, was property which a guest had a right to carry about his person. The jury, after being out some time, returned into court saying they were unable to agree upon a verdict without seeing the lock of the door in question. By consent of parties, the court directed toe lock to be produced. The jury, after long consultation, rendered a verdict of $435 for the plantiff. The case will be appealed to the General Term.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Liability of Hotel Keepers for Proverty Stolen from their Guests.; SUPREME COURT CIRCUIT.

Y.; Our good Understanding with; Church Service in New-York; Church, Service in New-York","The Liturgy of the Orthodox Oriental Church was celebrated yesterday in Trinity Chapel by Rev. AGAPIUS HONCHARENKO. The service is perhaps more popularly known as that of the Russo-Greek Church. In itself this event may be regarded as historic, it being the first public celebration of the Russian (or Greek) Church, not only in this city, but on the American Continent. But throughout Christendom, and especially in Europe, it cannot fail to be regarded as an event of great religious and political significance. It is well known that the leading minds of the Episcopal Church both here and in England have for some years been earnestly engaged in an effort to establish intercommunion with the Russo Greek Church, and there are two committees of churchmen here and in England working conjointly with vigorous activity and very great zeal for this object. The ecclesiastical importance of establishing cordial fraternal relations, if not unrestricted intercommunion, between the Russo-Greek Church and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States, which most resemble each other in structure and historical antecedents, was distinctly recognized by the latter body in its last general Convention, held in the City of New-York in October, 1862. A motion made by Rev. Dr. THRALL, clerical delegate from California, was earnestly seconded by Mr. SAM'L B. RUGGLES, lay delegate from New-York, for a committee to inquire into the expediency of opening intercourse between the two churches. A committee of eight members, embracing three of the American Bishops, three other clerical members and two lay delegates, was accordingly appointed. Two of its members -- Rev. Dr. YOUNG and Mr. S.B. RUGGLES -- since their appointment have visited Russia, for the purpose of fully possessing themselves of the information, ecclesiastic and secular, necessary for their report to the coming convention in October next, embracing not merely matters of doctrine and ritual, but the more practical and secular questions, such as burial of the dead, visitation of the sick, &c., necessarily growing out of the rapidly increasing intercourse between the two great nations, in their respective territories on the Pacific. The Bishop of Oxford, in presenting a petition to the Upper House of Convocation from the Lower, in England, in July, 1863, on this subject, said: ""If there is one matter upon earth which it would be a blessed thing to help forward, it would surely be the interchange of the visible acts of communion between our own branch of the church at home and in America with the orthodox branches of the Eastern Church. * * Those who have studied the controversy with Rome, know that there is nothing more important in maintaining our position against the usurpations of Rome than the independent position of the Eastern Church; and if we can strengthen the bonds of intercourse between that church and ourselves, it would be one of the greatest blessings that can be conceived."" And now it might be said that if the great point in view is not attained by this service in one of the great Episcopal edifices of this city, it is easy to see how far the members of the Oriental Church are influenced by the efforts made in this direction on both sides of the Atlantic.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOVEL RELIGIOUS SERVICE; Celebration of the Liturgy of the Orthodox Oriental Church at Trinity Chapel.

On the morning of the 27th ult., Mr. McKINLEY, of No. 261 West Forty-sixth-street, found a policeman's cap, coat, shield and belt on the sidewalk in front of his abode, and seeing no officer near, he sent a servant to the police station to inquire whether any member of the force had lost these articles. The reply was, that they belonged to Officer SCHUCK, and that he had not answered at the last roll-call. Commissioner ACTON asked the officer to explain, and he said that from 4 o'clock to 6 on the morning in question, he was unconscious, and that at the latter hour he found himself sick in bed at his abode, minus his cap, coat, shield and belt. A citizen appeared before the Commissioners, and deposed that on the morning of the 27th, he saw the officer in a stupor, but there were no signs of intoxication. Officer SCHUCK's record being good, the complaint was dismissed....Mr. NATHANIEL J. PERKINS, clerk in the employ of Messrs. SMITH & SANDERS, of No. 165 Chatham-street, appeared against Policeman RICHARD FLEMING, of the Fourth Precinct, and stated that on the 22d ult., Mrs. EMMA KOCH, of No. 1 Greenwich-street, lost her wallet, and called the officer into the store to arrest him. He declined to go with the officer to the station-house, and thereupon the latter took him without his hat. Hence the complaint. President ACTON told Mr. PERKINS that he should have gone with the policeman when requested to do so. Complaint dismissed.....JOSEPH MCGORRY, waiter in the St. Denis Hotel, complained that Officer MCARTHER, of the Broadway Police, had unnecessarily arrested him and taken him to the Tombs. MCGORRY had purchased, in the gift jewelry establishment, No. 178 Broadway, a watch-guard, and with it a ticket (No, 106,) was given him. Ticket No. 100 having drawn a gold watch, MCGORRY placed his thumb over the top of the figure six on the ticket, making it appear to be 100, and the watch was given him. The cheat having been discovered, he was called upon to restore the watch; but this he declined to do. Whereupon Officer MCARTHUR was called in, and MCGORRY was arrested. The commissioners dismissed the complaint....Complaint was entered against Officer EDWARD DEALING, of the Twenty-first Precinct, for disobedience of orders, and the use of profane language to a superior officer. DEALING said merely, in defence, that the complainant was in error as to time. Profanity not being permitted among the police force, the officer was convicted on his own showing, and may be required to pay a fine.....After other trials the commissioners adjourned to Wednesday morning next.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Trials.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Police Trials.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3aad1f9b-1a64-5f84-9a6f-03e89a6c8848,456,nyt://article/3aad1f9b-1a64-5f84-9a6f-03e89a6c8848

Life Insurance as Collateral Security Rymax vs Hicks,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/04/archives/life-insurance-as-collateral-security-supreme-court-circuit-before.html,Life Insurance as Collateral Security Rymax vs Hicks,"The action was brought by plaintiff as administrator of the estate of John Rymax, to recover of the defendant the amount of a life insurance policy, the sum being $1,000. The terms of the policy were that in case of the death of the insured the proceeds were to be paid to his executors, administrators or assigns, but ""for the benefit of Wm.T. Hicks as collateral security for the amount of his then subsisting pecuniary demands against the said Rymax, surplus if any, to go for the benefit of said Rymax's heirs and representatives.""Upon the death of the insured, the defendant collected the sum due on the policy, and claimed that according to the stipulations, he was entitled to hold it for m[???]es advanced, and debts due to him from the estate of Rymax. The plaintiff proved the policy, the receipt of the money by the defendant, and that a demand therefor had been made, and there rested. The court held that the plaintiff must prove the further fact that the defendant had not pecuniary legal demands to the extent of the same received on the policy. The plaintiff thereupon proved by the defendant' that the amount of his demands consisted of an advance of money made before the date of the policy, a sale of some property which was not consummated by delivery on that date, and some small items subsequent to the date of the policy, together with an item of $200, for expenses incurred in proving the death, and obtaining the money from the insurance company.

Inspector BOOLE in the chair, reports were received from the deputy inspectors, and it was shown that the laborers who recently undertook the exhumation of the city were making commendable progress. The deputy from West-street first rendered an account of his stewardship. He commenced operations, on the 24th of December last, by clothing his employes in Goodyear's rubber marine-armor and advertising for a supply of diving-bells. There was some necessary delay in making ready, and it was not until the middle of January that he was able to effect the initial soundings. These, however, were highly gratifying, showing, as they did, that, with favorable weather and by indomitable perseverance, excavations may be completed and terra firma reached in the neighborhood of the Jersey City and Hoboken ferries by about a week from next Autumn. The inspector from Whitehall believed that he could exhibit the Broadway pavement to a curious public by the middle of July next, and his colaborers of Fulton-street and Roosevelt were in high glee in being able to state that in their recent soundings they had brought up several lost stages and discovered the whereabouts of the twenty-seven teams that were supposed to have gone astray on New-Year's night. The inspector from Ann-street thought it possible to reduce the glaciers between Barnum's and Nassau-street in course of the season, and suggested the propriety of presenting Barnum and the Historical society samples of Ann-street compost. The inspector from Mackerelville here entered with a regiment of bell-ringers in his train, and the proceedings were waxing warm and delightfully rich, when the City Inspector, learning that a reporter had surreptitiously gained admission, summarily adjourned the hearing.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Unauthorized Report of the State of the Streets.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Unauthorized Report of the State of the Streets.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b7721be-3e8f-58ff-8f3a-c054a7f8be92,484,nyt://article/2b7721be-3e8f-58ff-8f3a-c054a7f8be92

On National Development,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/05/archives/natural-course-of-national-development-lecture-by-prof-john-w.html,On National Development,"Prof. DRAPER delivered the last of the series on Thursday evening, at the rooms of the Historical Society. His subject was the ""Natural Course of National Development."" Prof. DRAPER said that from the book of nature we gather the progress of men. Throughout the whole world of organization, the scheme of nature is the same. The progress of society is always determined by natural laws. He cited the differences between the people of the North and the South, the result of natural laws. During the past four years the people had endured hardships, shed their best blood, and submitted to taxation for the maintenance of an idea, -- the determination that but one nation should exist on this continent. For a season they had relinquished those organic laws which are the foundation of liberty; have created a navy without a rival, and consider their debt as nothing, compared to the object in view. A few years ago, who could have foretold what has come to pass. The events of nations are controlled by invisible laws; the unseen are more powerful than visible causes. There is a stern logic of events; a natural course through which nations must go. When ALEXANDER was pursuing the conquest of Asia, he gave ARISTOTLE money for the purpose of writing a history of Athens. The views of ARISTOTLE however, fell out of sight after the fall of Greece, and not until our own century, have men been able to embrace his great ideas. In this, the morning of human intelligence, we begin to comprehend the course of nature. The lower order of insects are controlled by instinct; as we rise in the scale, animals are governed by intelligence. The course of nature is toward elevation, and the concentration of intellect. Advancing to the human family, the lecturer said that in the tower tribes, the acts of man were purely mechanical; in men the automatic and instinctive apparatus are combined. Another important part, the brain appears. In the nervous system of man there are three distinct parts; the automatic, instinctive and reasoning faculties. The brain is the theatre of ideas, the realm of thought, through which the mind acts. He said that in animals the advance was gradual and regular. The brain first appears in the fish, and increases in birds, therefore giving them more intelligence. The same gradual advancement is true of man. The life of the world corresponds to the growth of man. The end of the successive shares of life is intellectual improvement. The sciences, affirm that the great aim of nature is to reach intellect. Man is the archotype of society; his advancement is the mark of the social progress of the world. The body politic must be ruled by its intellect. A social machine is composed of parts, each of which has its duty to do. Education is a term of wide import; that demanded by modern times must embrace the knowledge of the cotempor[???]neous races. The defect of education is, that too much labor is devoted to the past. Talent is a God-given gift. Education, though a great thing, is not everything. For stability to be attained, a nation must submit to be controlled by its intellect. There are only three things that can govern -- science, literature and reason. No education can make all men alike; a large portion of our race must be devoted to labor. Governed by external influences. It drifts along to its destiny. In our nation, there has been a degree of prosperity which has had no parallel in the world. Wealth has poured upon us until we have had no idea of anything else. How true it is, that for a nation to be anything, it must be something beyond its animal nature. We are passing from the animal to the intellectual. We are gaining discipline, which we could not have acquired except by war. A race is rising which will submit to be controlled by its reason. In asserting that in all human communities, as their life advances there must be a concentration of intellect, he was but following the experience of nature. He asserted what in the nature of the case must inevitably come to pass. Too commonly do we believe that the acts of men are controlled by free will. Believing everything we do is determined to our own will, or those around us, not until we reach the winter of the do we realize that we have been floating down a stream. For stability to be maintained, a nation must be controlled by its intellect. Believing that man is an emblem of society, the speaker looked upon his growth as the foreshowing of the growth of it. Passing from childhood to youth, from youth to manhood, and then to old age, man gradually advances involuntarily; so it is with nations. He would be satisfied if he had [???]te[???] a taste for studying modern sciences. In conclusion, he said that human civilization does not take place fortuitously, but by given laws, ever moving, resistingly advancing in an inevitable succession of events.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Natural Course of National Development.

That theory invariably represented the condition of the great body of the slaves as practically one of voluntary servitude. Their attachment to the patriarchal relation has illustrated many a score of texts from Hebrew history, and illuminated many a score of pulpit discourses that might otherwise have been dull and dismal. And yet, if Gen. LEE who may be presumed to have some acquaintance with the subject, had spoken a few years sooner, he would have made sad work among our modern patriarchs. He says. ""I think those who are employed (in the rebel army) should be freed. It would be neither just nor wise, in my opinion, to require them to serve as slaves."" Such a statement as this -- coming from such a source -- must be little less than startling to the venerable Bishop HOPKINS, and to those generally among us who have supported the ""institution"" out of a kindly regard for the negro, and for that alone. They will hardly, at least, understand Gen. LEE's philosophy of giving the slave his liberty as the prime reward of his becoming a soldier. It is evident that this war is working fearful havoc among a great many fine old theories.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

STEVENSON, the new Commander of the Department of West Virginia since the capture of Gen. CROOK, has been placed in our hands.

It is ordered throughout this department that, within five days after arriving within the lines, all persons, whether deserters or refugees, shall report at the nearest military post, to be sent to such point or points as may be demed necessary for their personal safety and the safety of the Government; and all who fail to report in compliance with this order shall be considered as spies, and dealt with as such.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL DESERTERS IN WEST VIRGINIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL DESERTERS IN WEST VIRGINIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'West Virginia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d626d91-a91b-59bb-b4f8-4621d5b6d674,561,nyt://article/2d626d91-a91b-59bb-b4f8-4621d5b6d674

The official bulletin this morning conveys to the country the astonishing and unexpected information, that Gen. PHIL. SHERIDAN has again made his appearance a hundred miles up the Shenandoah Valley, has attacked his old foeman, Gen. EARLY, and has captured him and nearly the entire body of his command -- some eighteen hundred men -- between Staunton and Charlottesville. The dispatches from Gen. GRANT, incorporated by Secretary STANTON in his bulletin, are all based on statements derived through rebel sources, from rebel deserters and refugees; but they come from so many quarters, from so many persons, are so consistent in themselves, and doubtless agree so closely with the anticipations of Gen. GRANT, that he sent three telegrams on the subject at different hours yesterday, each confirmatory of the other.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Victory in a New Quarter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Victory in a New Quarter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5fd40f7d-e6b4-5ff0-9d5e-abb00b42b4ce,667,nyt://article/5fd40f7d-e6b4-5ff0-9d5e-abb00b42b4ce

There is but one opinion current among competent judges respecting the eminent ability, care, and research displayed by him, in the performance of a laborious task. It is remarkable that, with all that has been written on the subject, there had hitherto been published no single work which sufficed to trace the history of New-England, as a whole, during the period in question. On the contrary, the present tendency seems to be toward a minute division of historical investigation into its separate particles. The histories of towns, counties, families, &c., succeed one another with unexampled rapidity, all containing valuable material, and calling the more loudly, from their very number, for the general historian to work up into a finished picture of the scattered fragments of information so lavishly supplied by the industry of antiquarians, archaelogical societies, &c. Prof. PALFREY's third volume takes up the thread of history from about the year 1665, shortly after the restoration of CHARLES H., and carries it forward to the Revolution of 1688, consequently including some of the most stirring scenes of the colonial annals. He does not belong to the rhetorical school of historians; fine writing forms no waste portion of his book, but it abounds in facts based upon original authorities, and will rarely be consulted in vain by the historical inquirer. Some fac-similes of ancient maps form the appropriate illustrations to the volume. The book will undoubtedly take rank as a permanent addition to the stores of our libraries, the industry of the writer having availed himself of all existing material, so that there is little chance of its ever being superseded.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; HISTORY OF NEW-ENGLAND DURING THE STUART DYNASTY.

By ten o'clock the streets began to be uncomfortably thronged, the citizen in gala dress, the soldier in full regimentals, and the countryman in his best coat and smartest vest mingling amicably together. The ladies, of course, seized the occasion for displaying their Spring bonnets and the pretty faces beneath, to the best advantage. Children ran about as if the procession was specialty got up for their benefits, and they were determined to enjoy it to the utmost. The sky was bright, and the air bracing, if not balmy, and New-York was in its very best humor and resolved to have, at least, one day of jubilee. On Broadway and the Fifth-avenue, every window of every house was filled with eager faces. Steps, balconies, doorways, gardens and even roofs had their quota of sight-seers, all well dressed, good humored and orderly. Every corner had its knot of gazers and every curb-stone its share of the living, moving multitude. In Broadway and the Bowery, windows had been engaged two or three days previously at fabulous rates, and in many of these places the chairs and sofas were numbered and ticketed, as though the establishment had been suddenly transformed into the dress-circle and upper tiers of a theatre. Many a humble vehicle, by the aid of a few chairs, two or three yards of canvass, and as many paper flags, became a desirable stand-point, to which access was obtained on the payment of a fee of fifty cents. These itinerant stands were usually placed at the corners of streets, thus rendering the movement of pedestrians, which had before been sufficiently difficult, almost impossible. But good humor prevailed, and these comparatively trifling annoyances were not permitted to interfere with the general harmony.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Streets.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Streets.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32ef7529-82d9-5640-bc78-ab2fd8ee68f2,1540,nyt://article/32ef7529-82d9-5640-bc78-ab2fd8ee68f2

"The announcement that there would be a fine pyrotechnic display, attracted an immense throng of people to Union-square in the evening. It is estimated that at least fifty thousand were present, the crowd extending from Fourteenth to Seventeenth streets, and from Fourth-avenue to University-place. The scene during the pyrotechnic exhibition was one of the most splendid ever witnessed in this city. The effect was much enhanced by the many illuminations around Union-square, some of which were beautiful. The Atheneum and the Union League Club houses were brilliantly illuminated, while the Union Square Hotel, and the two buildings corner of Fourteenth-street and Broadway, were hung with tri colored lanterns. The large eagle in front of the Maison Doree was lighted, forming an attractive feature of the display. At the corner of Fourteenth-street and University-place were two powerful calcium lights, which threw their rays over the up-turned faces of thousands of spectators, whose unceasing evolutions formed an interesting panorama. The exhibition of fireworks was considered to be the most beautiful ever witnessed in this city, while the number of pieces discharged was larger than has been displayed heretofore at one point. They were contributed by Messrs. J.G. & I. EDGE and J.W. HADFIELD. At 7:30 o'clock the firing of rockets began, which continued until 8 o'clock, when a motto piece with the words ""The President, 1860-04,"" was discharged, and greeted with enthusiastic applause. Several beautiful pieces followed, when an illuminated design, with the word ""Sumter,"" and the Confederate flag floating over it was lighted. During the burning of the piece an explosion took place which threw the rebel flag down and replaced it by the Stars and Stripes, amidst the huzzas of the multitude. This was one of the most successful pieces of the evening. The representation of the bombardment of Fort Fisher by the monitors and gunboats, terminating in the explosion of the fort, which was demolished and thrown down, was also very beautiful. The largest and most attractive piece contributed by Mr. HADFIELD was a design prepared for the occasion. It represented the eagle and shield, with the national colors festooned around. In the centres were the mottoes, ""One Country, one People, one Destiny,"" while on either sids were the names of GRANT, FARRAGUT, THOMAS, SHERMAN, PORTER, SHERIDAN, and Atlanta, Savannah, Charleston and Wilmington. This piece burned brilliantly, and at the close was loudly cheered by the people. The largest piece contributed by Messrs. EDGE, and which closed the entertainment, was a representation of the naval engagement between the Monitor and Merrimac, in Hampton Roads. The Merrimac first attacks the frigates, when the Monitor appears and drives her back. The piece was excellent, and as the little Monitor obtained the victory, the enthusiasm of the people was intense.

Celebration; The Great Loyal,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/07/archives/the-loyal-rejoicings-yesterday.html,Celebration; The Great Loyal,"The least thoughtful observer that witnessed yesterday's celebration must have been struck less by the vast aggregate of the population that turned out for the occasion, than by the preponderating numbers of hale, hearty and vigorous young men represented alike in the military and in the firemen's part of the procession, and among the dense and countless multitude of onlookers. Looking to this salient feature of the celebration, it became difficult to realize that the country had passed through four years of warfare, -- warfare, in presence of which the greatest of modern conflicts become almost dwarfed by comparison. In and along side of the vast procession of yesterday -- a procession which barely found room in seven miles of thoroughfare, there must have been gathered at least two hundred thousand men as fit -- all but in discipline -- for service with GRANT or SHERMAN or SHERIDAN or CANBY, as the veterans of the Potomac, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, or the Mississippi Armies. Contemplating such a demonstration, in these purely physical aspects, it would perhaps be difficult to present to the ordinary class of outside observers a more tangible and appreciable proof than was offered yesterday, of the exhaustless material forces which, after a prolonged and stupendous war, the country has at its disposition. As a mere congregation of the masses -- from among a city and suburban population of two millions -- there is nothing in the history of New-York celebrations to compare with that of yesterday. And if every other element of success had been wanting, that grand and impressive feature -- the outpouring of a vast community -- would have made the demonstration memorable for at least a generation to come.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Loyal Rejoicings Yesterday.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Loyal Rejoicings Yesterday.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/885539e6-93e9-5e18-92bd-c7859bcb7fe1,743,nyt://article/885539e6-93e9-5e18-92bd-c7859bcb7fe1

It occurred at an early hour yesterday, on the Trenton (New-Jersey) Railroad, at Bristol Station. The story is a short one. What is called the ""owl"" train, bound for New-York, after having waited four hours (behind its time) for southern passengers at Trenton, started on its journey about one o'clock in the morning, and shortly afterward overtook a freight train which it pushed on ahead of itself; the conductor and engineer being evidently indifferent to two facts of the most vital consequence to the ill-fated passengers. The first of these facts was the great lessening of speed caused by the double train which the engine had to propel. The second was, that the Washington night train was all but due, and was rushing after the coupled trains with lightning speed. The story need go no further. About forty persons were injured to the extent of broken spines, arms, legs and so forth. Six, perhaps more fortunate, were killed outright.

The Governor begins by complaining that Georgia was stripped of her troops by the Confederate Government, and had only a few boys and old men left to oppose SHERMAN's veteran army. The destruction of SHERMAN's army, he says, ""would have reinspired our people with hope, depressed the spirits of our enemies, and might have prepared the way speedily for the negotiation of an honorable peace. It could have been done by the Georgia troops if permitted. It should have been done at the expense, if necessary, of the evacuation of Richmond, and the use of Gen. LEE's whole army thrown rapidly into Georgia for that purpose. No one would regret more than I do to see that city, which has been so long and so nobly defended, surrender to the enemy; but it must be admitted, since the devastation of the country beyond, that it is now only a strong outpost of little military importance, compared with the great interior. It must also be admitted that Richmond is rendered insecure by the successes of Gen. SHERMAN in the interior, and the position he has gained in the rear of that and other strongholds, which were relied on for defence. If his unobstructed movement through Georgia must result in the the loss of Richmond, how much better it would have been if we had given the evacuation of Richmond for the destruction of this army.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GOV.

"Forty days in the Wilderness, (S. C.)",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/08/archives/forty-days-in-the-wilderness.html,"Forty days in the Wilderness, (S. C.)","Gen. SHERMAN's army has been forty days in the State of South Carolina -- that is to say if he has not yet emerged from it. It was on the 27th of January that the last of the forces composing his left wing (which subsequently effected a junction with the right wing near Branchville) left the City of Savannah, and struck off boldly and baseless for the heart of the Rattlesnake State- Of his movements and operations for the first half of that time the rebels kept us pretty well informed. By the 17th of February he had worked his way through the swamps on the north side of the Savannah River, had taken Branchville and Orangeburgh; and on that day he entered the capital of the State. But since that time we may say that we know nothing whatever of SHERMAN's great army, except the fact that after two or three days it left Columbia and marched onward with its face to the North. It is certainly a remarkable circumstance that we should be in complete ignorance of the movements and fortunes of an army of such magnitude, and whose operations are of such supreme importance, when it cannot be at a distance of more than 400 miles due south of Washington, and when it is certainly less than a hundred miles distant from the seacoast, which is thickly covered with our naval ships. But the probability is that neither Gen. SHERMAN nor Lieut-Gen. GRANT is over-anxious to give the Northern public and the Southern rebels very prompt bulletins of our army's daily movements, its line of advance, or its ultimate objective. It would be no great gain to us to have SHERMAN do this; all the gain would be to the rebels. Were they to give us any information they may have, we should be obliged to them, even though much of it turned out inaccurate; but the rebel soul, speaking through the rebel press, has been ordered by the rebel authorities to keep from us every item of news on this subject; and hence for twenty days we have only been able to screw from them the unintelligible intelligence that SHERMAN was not at Charlotte, that he was not at Fayetteville, that his army was marching in directions as divergent as Chester and Cheraw, and that there was a rumor in Richmond that he had been killed and his ""army routed and driven into the jungles."" Now, the last item has at least the merit of being of some size; but when we recall their old story about SHERMAN's army ""floundering through the swamps of Georgia,"" when, in fact, it was enjoying a charming promenade and daily dinners of turkey and chicken, we are inclined to take ""driven into the jungles"" with a considerable quantity of salt. As for the few rumors from our own side that have reached us during the past three weeks, time has already proven most of them to be incorrect.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Forty Days in the Wilderness.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Forty Days in the Wilderness.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e356302b-359a-5e84-a895-77d84e679a40,926,nyt://article/e356302b-359a-5e84-a895-77d84e679a40

Two methods had been proposed, namely: that the territory should be united to Canada, or erected into a separate colony.

The Richmond papers of Saturday announced the appointment of a special agent by Gen. LEE, to collect whatever in the shape of old muskets, swords, pikes, pistols and sabres could be found in any remnant of the Confederacy to which, he might be able to find access. The steamer Cuba, with news ten day old from Europe, brought word last night that the ""Confederate Government"" have countermanded large orders for torpedoes. These incidents convey to the world, in a far more pointed form than any official bulletin, the information that the Confederacy is and has been dependent upon importation for arms to make good the large stock that has fallen by capture, at different times, into the hands of our armies. They likewise advertise the complete exclusion of the rebels from commercial intercourse with foreign ports. Torpedoes are no longer a marketable commodity in the Southern market, because they can find no port of entrance and no blockade-runners to take them even as speculative freight. All the British blockade-running ports, from Nova Scotia to New-Providence, are filled with enterprising craft, laden with Confederate ammunition and stores, but unable even to venture within sight of the coast-line of the Confederacy.

The Virginia Legislature resolves almost unanimously in favor of arming. The General Assembly of North Carolina petitions against putting negroes into the army without the consent of the States. Such is the report of the Richmond Sentinel of Monday. It is clear, we take it, from this, that North Carolina is not anxious to see the depleted ranks of the rebel army filled up at all. She has less to lose from the partial emancipation which Gen. LEE says must accompany a negro conscription, than has Virginia. The mass of the citizens of North Carolina are far, less wedded to slavery as an institution, than the people of the rebel section of Virginia. The point is, that the latter believes Gen. LEE's declaration, when he urges that arming the negroes has become a necessity, if the South is to continue to fight; while the North Carolina Assembly apparently fails to see the necessity of continuing to fight, and, therefore, ignores, in a logical way, the other necessity -- of arming the negroes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA ON ARMING; SLAVES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA ON ARMING; SLAVES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Virginia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/516a7aa3-f15c-5b8d-9f9e-1443b8f5e0cc,196,nyt://article/516a7aa3-f15c-5b8d-9f9e-1443b8f5e0cc

In Russia, the Emperor acts and speaks for the great democratic masses, and the struggle which the last century witnessed in France, between the governing power of Paris and the rural noblesse, is repeated now between the Czar and the country nobility of Poland and Russia. The act of emancipation there, as here, has nearly destroyed a class. The gentry are in many cases, stripped of immense wealth; the emancipated serfs often refuse to pay rents for property which they regard as their own; the legal prerogatives of the masters are taken away, and their great privilege of selecting recruits for the military service is abolished by a new system of conscription. Some find themselves owners of large tracts of lands, forests and mines, which are unimproved and without laborers to work upon them. Others are entirely beggared and all have lost their prestige and high position with the peasantry. To add to the discomfiture of the smaller gentry, the law providing for the admission of delegates to one of the Provincial Diets, that of Moscow, required a certain amount of property, which these persons are deprived of by the Act of Emancipation, so that, after much discussion, they have been necessarily excluded from their own Provincial Assembly. So far has this deprivation of the nobility proceeded, that the representative of one of the oldest families of the Russian aristocracy, and holding the office of Grand Chamberlain at court, Count ORLOFF, ventured to say in open Diet that soon ""the Emperor will be not only the first but the only gentleman in Russia.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Reform Struggle in Russia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Reform Struggle in Russia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Russia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7949b3f9-faa7-536b-9aef-dc3f3a989f41,584,nyt://article/7949b3f9-faa7-536b-9aef-dc3f3a989f41

DUNNING, and he accordingly sent thither a reconnoitering force of United States detective officers.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/09/archives/war-department-special-agency-conflict-of-authority-an-assistant.html,,"Col. BAKER learned, recently, that gross irregularities, if not outright frauds, had been tolerated in the Ninth District, under the Provost-Marshalship of Capt. DUNNING, and he accordingly sent thither a reconnoitering force of United States detective officers. The information which they gathered during their first essay assured the Colonel that the rumor which had reached him was well founded, and he bade his subordinates keep on the alert. One of the results of their further researches (which may now for the first time be printed) was the apprehension of one JACOB DEPEW, Assistant Provost-Marshal under Capt. DUNNING, for compounding a felony. It is alleged to have been DEPEW's practice to take bounty-jumpers and other prisoners from DUNNING's office, in Broadway, near Forty-seventh-street, and permit them to escape while on the route to Hart's Island or elsewhere, and he is supposed to have realized large profits from this source. The case on which he was arrested was clear -- Col. BAKER's instructions to his force being that they shall clinch every necessary fact before undertaking to seize any person. They took the prisoner to the Astor Mouse, and as he had in charge several prisoners that were to be taken to the island, Col. BAKER released him on parole until 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the day of his arrest-Monday of last week. Promptly at 4 o'clock the Assistant Provost-Marshal reported at the War Department Special Agency, and demanded a view of the affidavits upon which he had been taken into custody. Col. BAKER exhibited the affidavits, and DEPEW, having read and revised the papers, desired to know what Col. BAKER intended to do in the premises. ""Send you to Washington for trial. Sir."" quietly responded the Colonel. ""Perhaps not,"" was the rejoinder of Assistant Provost-Marshal DEPEW, as he unfolded the order from Maj.-Gen. DIX, absolutely forbidding the taking hence of any officer within the limits of the Department of the East. Col. BAKER released the prisoner on the instant, resolved that if he was thus to encounter, at the hands of a truly loyal and highly esteemed officer like Gen. DIX, the obstacles which beset his path in the beginning in this city, and which obstacles he had scattered to the winds, he would yield his position.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""WAR DEPARTMENT SPECIAL AGENCY.; Conflict of Authority An Assistant Provost Marshal Sent to the Old Capitol Prison Removal of Col.

Those who entertain this theory think it not unlikely that the sentiments expressed by the Richmond press, antagonistic to the evacuation of the capital city of their inchoate nation, are purposely assumed with a view to mislead our authorities until the move is accomplished. In support of their theory, they call attention to the fact that cars are constantly running on the Southside Railroad, and the whistle of the locomotives can be heard at all hours, night and day. It is plausible to suppose that, if evacuation is intended, it will be sought to consummate it while the present favorable circumstances continue; but from any facts known on this side, the entire theory must consist of mere speculation.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Lee's Army Expected to Take Advantage of the Wet Weather and Evacuate Richmond A Rush on Adams' Express Office Cannonading."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Lee's Army Expected to Take Advantage of the Wet Weather and Evacuate Richmond A Rush on Adams' Express Office Cannonading."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8b08e9d-9b28-52ab-9287-fef692d49c73,337,nyt://article/c8b08e9d-9b28-52ab-9287-fef692d49c73

Jersey City; Collision on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/10/archives/ferry-accident.html,Jersey City; Collision on,"The passengers by the train from Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia, which arrived at 11 last night, were subjected to a long delay by an accident in crossing the river. The ferry-boat D.S. Gregory had just left its dock at Jersey City, when, in the dense fog, it was run into by the J.S. Darcie, going the other way, with great violence. The forward cabin of the Darcie was completely crushed, and all the forward wood-work on the Gregory was demolished. It was found also that the two boats were so closely locked together that they could not be separated, and both, therefore, drifted downward with the tide. They came almost immediately upon two schooners anchored in the stream, head up, one of which thrust her bowsprit with a tremendous crash entirely through the cabin of the Gregory, and the other just escaped a similar performance. All four then, drifted together upon four or five more, but without any further damage. Signal lights were immediately shown, whistles blown and bells rung, but it was not until half-past one that any assistance could be brought. The Jersey City, belonging to the same line, then came down and took off the passengers landing them at New-York dock at 2 o'clock. No one was injured, but the two ferry boats were considerably damaged. There seemed to be nobody in effective command of either, and it was not until Mr. WOOLSEY, the Superintendent, arrived, that anything practical seemed to be done toward relieving the passengers from their awkward predicament.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ferry Accident.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Ferry Accident.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ferries', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/830224c4-6e10-5094-9a8a-8efcbde70063,254,nyt://article/830224c4-6e10-5094-9a8a-8efcbde70063

This is the nucleus of the force which JOE JOHNSTON has in North Carolina, in SHERMAN's front. Beside this, part of HARDEE's refugee army from Charleston may have gotten up with JOHNSTON, wherever he may be. Then there is HOKE's refugees from Wilmington, which, according to the great rebel policy of concentration, lately adopted, were to be sent to increase JOHNSTON's numbers; but which, according to our latest advices, were contesting SCHOFIELD's advance up the western side of Cape Fear River, by resolutely remaining on the eastern side of that stream. Then there are the three divisions which we have been fifty times told LEE has sent to North Carolina. Then we have been told, but do not believe it, that the remnant of HOOD's well-flogged veterans have made an astoundingly rapid march across the broad States of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, and have joined their old Commander, JOHNSTON, under whom they were so frequently whipped before HOOD superseded him.

Since the paint was applied, the vessel has made a passage from this port to the West Coast of Africa, and now, on being docked, for the purpose of having her bottom cleaned, it was found that the side on which GISBORNE's paint had been used was not only free from all fouling by vegetable matter and marine animals, but there was no need for the use of the scraper or paint brush before the vessel again proceeds to sea. Not so on the other side, on which was used the paint that was to test the comparative qualities of Mr. GISBORNE's. Barnacles covered the bottom of the ship on that side, at stem and stern, where the two paints joined, and it was remarkable to see the one side comparatively covered with marine animals and the other completely free. This is the only Liverpool ship upon which the efficacy of the GISBORNE paint has been fairly tried and the result known, but she is not the only one on which it has been used. In addition to the satisfaction which the experiment on the Achilles gave, several London merchant vessels have been coated with the paint, and with equally satisfactory results. The best proof of the entire satisfaction given to the African Steamship Company's agents is that they have instructed the Liverpool agents of the GISBORNE paint to have the entire bottom of the Macgregor Laird covered with it before she leaves the dock.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Preservation of our Iron Ships.; The Liverpool Shipping Gazette, says:', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Preservation of our Iron Ships.; The Liverpool Shipping Gazette, says:', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c98f537-2c62-52d9-a419-fd4a3d9d7869,381,nyt://article/9c98f537-2c62-52d9-a419-fd4a3d9d7869

Some emphasis appears to be laid upon the fact that a number of emigrants had arrived from the United States, at Vera Cruz. These emigrants are represented as being the pioneers of an American Colony which, before the war closes, will include a population of 25,000 settlers. If we are to credit the reports from Vera Cruz, this emigration is largely subsidized. Those that have already arrived are furnished with money and provisions to enable them to take possession of certain lands appropriated for their special use. It is not easy to discover whence the subsidies for such a scheme of emigration as this can be drawn, in the present condition of the Imperial exchequer. Nor is it less difficult to found upon the report any theory of political advantage which can accrue to the ""empire"" from a large influx of American citizens, whose instincts, training and tendencies must necessarily be supposed to lean strongly toward republicanism. In the absence of any feasible theory to justify a vast scheme of subsidized colonization, we conclude that the scope of the enterprise has been magnified far beyond what the actual facts will warrant, or otherwise that the project is one of a different character from what it is represented to be.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MEXICAN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MEXICAN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a39d1ab6-c884-5501-965d-34856d2cb59b,382,nyt://article/a39d1ab6-c884-5501-965d-34856d2cb59b

One of the most important features of such a measure is the construction of the board. All our present evils arise from the necessarily inefficient organizations which are to execute the health laws, and it is from this dilemma that we are endeavoring to escape. In a word, we need an intelligent, efficient and non-partisan Central Board, so related to the Police Department as to be able to avail itself constantly of its power and its vigilant inspection, while carrying on special sanitary inspection through its own skilled agents. The bill, therefore, created a Board of Health, composed of the four Police Commissioners and of four experienced physicians, with power (1) to establish a thorough and constant sanitary inspection of the city by skilled medical men; this inspection to extend to a constant search after the causes of unhealthiness, the existence of contagious diseases and the conditions upon which they depend, and all that relates to the internal sanitary state of our dwellings, with daily suggestions to the Central Board of remedial measures; (2) to direct a constant supervision by the police force of the streets, vacant lots, courts, alleys, cesspools and everything pertaining to the external sanitary condition of the houses of the people; (3) to execute any measures deemed necessary to protect or promote the public health.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE METROPOLITAN HEALTH BILL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE METROPOLITAN HEALTH BILL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4f02ffd-6793-5226-a5e7-38bab128cf97,417,nyt://article/a4f02ffd-6793-5226-a5e7-38bab128cf97

Pacification of the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/10/archives/pacification-of-the-south.html,Pacification of the South,"There has probably been no result of the war so gratifying and reassuring to those who have been troubled with dismal forebodings as to the difficulty of pacifying the South, even after the rebels have ceased to be able to maintain large armies, as the revelation which it has made of the large vein of practicalness running through the character of the Southern people. There was probably nothing, for which, four years ago, we at the North were less disposed to give them credit. Their language as well as their acts, before and after the outbreak of the rebellion, fairly warranted the conclusion that they were a breed of crazy enthusiasts or romancers, -- moonstruck theorists whose conduct was not regulated by the ordinary rules or animated by the ordinary motives. The hairbrained speculations of their political philosophers upon the nature and objects of civil society, the wild rant of their orators and newspapers about slavery, the frantic style in which their politicians were in the habit of denouncing and threatening their enemies, the reckless disregard of parliamentary convenances displayed by their Congressmen, and the Indian ferocity and contempt for consequences which marked their mode of avenging private injuries -- all justified the belief that, if once roused into war, we might look for exhibitions of desperation that would throw Carthage, Thermopylae, Saragossa, Moscow, and even the defence of Holland against Louis XIV., into the shade. Many people expected that their resistance would not be regulated by policy; that passion -- and such passion! -- would preside over it from first to last, and that even the abolition of slavery would only be accomplished through the extermination of the white race.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pacification of the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Pacification of the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a94fde52-20a2-54e3-9d76-fb0d8e00e3a8,766,nyt://article/a94fde52-20a2-54e3-9d76-fb0d8e00e3a8

Capt. DUNNING, on taking the Marshalship of the Ninth District a year ago, found DEPEW acting in that capacity, and as he displayed marked ability in the peculiar business of a detective officer, Capt. DUNNING retained him in that capacity. It is not true that subsequent to DEPEW's arrest he hastened to Capt. DUNNING, and, with that officer, went to Gen. DIX, or that Capt. DUNNING knew anything of the application to Gen. DIX for an order forbidding any officer to remove DEPEW from the Department of the East. Capt. DUNNING accepted the office of Provost-Marshal at the solicitation of many substantial citizens of the Ninth District, and having taken the position, he entered upon the work with a resolve that he would pursue and punish the same class of rogues that Col. BAKER has so successfully trapped of late, and the Captain's annual report to Provost-Marshal-Gen. FRY shows that up to the 1st of January last he had arrested 215 persons, of whom 148 were deserters and 67 civilians; that of the alleged deserters 107 were sent to their regiments, 36 were discharged, and 5 only escaped the guard, and that during his administration in the Ninth District he has sent to regiments in the field an average of nine deserters a month. Of the civilians whom he arrested during the year many were bounty brokers, whom he compelled to restore the money of which they had defrauded recruits; and it is to this class that he traces any reports that may have been set afloat prejudicial to his character, and he further believes, as do many other officers, that affidavits may be obtained by the cord at a shilling apiece from bounty brokers and bounty jumpers and detective officers, testifying of their own personal knowledge to the most calumnious and absurd statements.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Provost-Marshal Dunning The Arrest of Depew.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Provost-Marshal Dunning The Arrest of Depew.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56506126-5fcf-5921-9e18-62b29403fdf5,546,nyt://article/56506126-5fcf-5921-9e18-62b29403fdf5

Their arrangements are nearly perfected, and by the 15th they will be ready to proceed with the drawings. It is not yet known whether the draft will be made in all of the districts on the same day. The number of names to be drawn in the six districts will be about thirteen thousand. The original quota was twenty-one thousand, from which twenty-five per cent. was deducted by Gen. FRY. A few men were credited to the city at the time the quota was apportioned, which, with two thousand one hundred and fifty-one recruited by the Volunteer Committee within the past twenty-two days, reduces the number of men required of this city to thirteen thousand. It is claimed that the quota of this city is excessive, having been based on the enrollment of 149,000, which has been reduced by the new enrollment to 90,000. Gen. HAYS signified his willingness to allow the revised enrollment, and it is understood that Gen. HINKS admitted its justness. If allowed by the Government, the new enrollment would have reduced the quota of the city to 14,000 men, which, with the credits, would have further reduced it to between eleven and twelve thousand. Recently, the Volunteer Committee has secured over one hundred men a day, and sometimes one hundred and fifty. The committee desire a postponement of the drawings, believing that the quota of the city could be filled sooner by volunteering than by a draft. Since the recent order for the draft, very many persons have deposited money with the County Volunteering Committee to procure substitutes.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE COMING DRAFT.; Preparations for Putting the Wheel in Motion Thirteen Thousand Men Required The Result of the Last Draft in ""Men and Boots"" A Strong Argument in Favor of Filling the Quota by Voluntary Enlistment, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE COMING DRAFT.; Preparations for Putting the Wheel in Motion Thirteen Thousand Men Required The Result of the Last Draft in ""Men and Boots"" A Strong Argument in Favor of Filling the Quota by Voluntary Enlistment, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7763f825-92c3-5353-b69f-e960fd724af9,846,nyt://article/7763f825-92c3-5353-b69f-e960fd724af9

Trotting Season Reopens,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/11/archives/sporting-intelligence-reopening-of-the-trotting-season.html,Trotting Season Reopens,"There was a very large attendance at the Hone-house Friday night, when entries for the various stakes and purses offered by the proprietors of the Fashion Course, L.I., for the Spring season were advertised to close. All the leading owners of trotting stock, trainers, and drivers of trotting horses were present, and the opening of the envelopes containing the nominations for the various stakes, and purses, created quite a furore among the host of interested parties present. The greatest excitement, perhaps, was manifested concerning the entries for purses numbers one and two, each of $1,000. The first being mile heats, best three in five in harness; the second, to wagon. The entry of Dexter, whom HIRAM WOODRUFF asserts can outtrot any thing on four legs, elicited a buz of applause. Then came the beautiful mare, Lady Emma, for the same stakes -- next the gallant black stallion, Gen. Butler, whereupon people began to discuss the probabilities of the result, whilst the entries for the otherstakes were progressing, toward the bottom of the box containing the enveloped entries, there was one which caused the reader of the nominations to pause ere he pronounced, with sonorious voice, ""GEORGE WILKES enters for purses numbers one and two, the bay mare Flora Temple."" A bomb-shell thrown among the crowd could not have created greater consternation. There was silence for a moment, and then, as if by common consent, all present rose to their feet and gave three rousing cheers of welcome to the return of the Queen of the Trotting Turf to the scene of her many triumphs, after so lengthened an absence. It need scarcely be added, that the faces of the owners of the other horses entered for these valuable prizes elongated considerably when they discovered that the peerless Flora Temple had emerged from her long-time obscurity, to contest the trotting-laurels once more with them. The entries for the different stakes and purses were so numerous, and of such sterling quality, as to warrant the conviction that the coming Spring meetings will be affluently productive in sport.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sporting Intelligence.; REOPENING OF THE TROTTING SEASON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sporting Intelligence.; REOPENING OF THE TROTTING SEASON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97eb70fc-7fdb-5b32-88a0-ab1ea23c77a9,345,nyt://article/97eb70fc-7fdb-5b32-88a0-ab1ea23c77a9

This rate can and will be kept up, we are assured, if the supply of bounty-money continues. There are men, healthy, vigorous, willing men to be had in abundance. But the bonus must be paid them promptly, and in view of this the Volunteer Committee must be kept in funds by some means. That secured, we can see no occasion -- either of military necessity or any other -- why the draft, which has been set down for Wednesday next should take place at all. If every other community within the loyal States were contributing to the recruitment of the national army at the same rate as New-York, the daily enlistments would reach three thousand. That is at the rate of nine hundred thousand a year. These are facts, to which we have no doubt the delegations about to visit Washington to urge a postponement of the draft will give due prominence in their interview with the Secretary of War. But they are facts which might be rendered far more impressive, if the delegates were enabled to give the military authorities the assurance that the State Bounty Bonds were all subscribed for, and the County Volunteer Committee in a position pecuniarily to prosecute their task from day to day, until the requisition of the city was met.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EFFORT TO HAVE THE DRAFT POSTPONED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EFFORT TO HAVE THE DRAFT POSTPONED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c46c2b2-5d66-55a4-bcec-4256f6e5185e,359,nyt://article/9c46c2b2-5d66-55a4-bcec-4256f6e5185e

The collection, however, for the most part, consists of studies and sketches of European scenery, which are painted with great and unaffected truth to nature. The street views are distinguished for a masterly rendering of gray tints, a quality which is as rare as it is estimable. Portraits of President LINCOLN, WM.H.

The game was most remarkable for its tediousness, as both parties, but more particularly BENJAMIN, seemed to regard generalship in leaving the balls safe, of much more importance than scoring; thus a game of one thousand points up was spun out to 144 innings, consuming nearly six hours of time, BENJAMIN played 40 times, and HEWINS 22 times for safety. From the 70th to the 76th innings there were thirteen safe miss shots in succession; but HEWINS was finally ashamed to continue this useless skirmishing, and played to count.

On Constitutional Amendment; Gov. Bramlette Urges Ratification Constitutional Amendment,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/12/archives/the-amendment-in-kentucky.html,On Constitutional Amendment; Gov. Bramlette Urges Ratification Constitutional Amendment,"Gov. BRAMLETTE, of Kentucky, has sent a message to the House of Representatives in that State, in reference to its rejection of the Constitutional Amendment. After showing that the rejection only remits the question to the people and the succeeding Legislature, and that nothing but ratification forecloses the right of action, Gov. BRAMLETTE expresses his earnest dissent from the Legislative resolution rejecting the amendment, on the ground that slavery is irrevocably doomed to speedy extermination; that no one can entertain the faintest hope of its possible continuance; that it has ceased to be valuable, and has become burdensome to the people, and must grow more and more so until relieved of it; and that compensated labor taxing the place of present slave labor can only restore Kentucky to advancement and prosperity. Gov. BRAMLETTE argues that the true policy and real interests of the State would be observed by an unconditional ratification of the proposed amendment, with a concurrent but independent enactment emancipating the slaves in Kentucky, to take effect and be declared when Congress shall have appropriated and secured to the State the last assessed value of slaves (in 1864) to enable the State, in conformity with the Constitutional requirement, to make ""compensation,"" and declare immediate emancipation, thus leaving the onus upon Congress of retaining slavery in Kentucky for an indefinite period, or immediately relieving her of it by enabling her to emancipate by making compensation. This last proposition, to say the least of it, is a cool one, but coming from Gov. BRAMLETTE will excite no surprise. He concludes his message as follows:",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Amendment in Kentucky.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Amendment in Kentucky.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Kentucky', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/26d882db-f09a-5b11-9ccf-847b345a223e,354,nyt://article/26d882db-f09a-5b11-9ccf-847b345a223e

With all respect to the gentlemen participating, we submit that their confessions are very excellent arguments in favor of the change. Taking their resolutions, prepared (so said our report) by Mayor GUNTHER, we find them complaining that the new movement is going to put an unmerited degradation upon the present organization -- a statement entirely gratuitous, and as far as possible from the fact. They further complain that the movement was a surprise. If it were, an organization so virtuous and so perfect as they tell us theirs is, should have been proof against any such trick. But we distinctly remember that the idea of a Paid Fire Department has been discussed at times for a dozen years. Their resolved complaint winds up with the stale cry of Legislative interference; with the assumption that this city is possessed of civic rights peculiar to itself; that anything may be done in any other section of the State, but here there must be no meddling; that the people of this city have such a superabundance of Roman virtue, such a solemn appreciation of the rights and duties of sovereignty, that they should be permitted to do all their own lawmaking; that the enactment of bills by the State Legislature, (without first consulting the knot of men who run the machine here,) is an outrage not to be tolerated.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2cf1ad66-a27e-5ad2-8043-4433fce24029,538,nyt://article/2cf1ad66-a27e-5ad2-8043-4433fce24029

In Cumberland Valley; Petroleum in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/12/archives/petroleum-in-the-cumberland-region.html,In Cumberland Valley; Petroleum in,"It is now pretty generally conceded that there are abundant indications of the existence of petroleum underlaying the coal measures and sandstone strata of the Cumberland coal field. And so convincing are the more recent discoveries, a company has already been formed, comprising some of our most practical and sagacious citizens, to commence at once the sinking of welts. Oil has been found (and exhibited in our city) at Wellersburgh, near the Cumberland coal basin, if not forming a continuation of it. Should these developments result in success, as from what we learn seems almost certain, it would be difficult to fix a limit, even in imagination; to the vast wealth about to be poured out from the Cumberland region. The product of the coal, sent from the region for the year 1864 about 300,000 tons only, measured in value by its present price at tide-water, is about $3,000,000. That product is likely to be nearly, or quite double the present year. Now, if, as seems very probable, inexhaustible supplies of Petroleum underlies our great Coal Basin, who shall be bold enough to fix a limit to the wealth and prosperity of Allegany County, within whose limits is embraced the entire coal field of Maryland? We understand that the large coal companies, owning in the aggregate the great bulk of the coal lands in the Cumberland Basin, such as the Cumberland Company, the American Company, the London Mining Company, the Central Consolidation and others, are declining to sell any of their lands, although all of them, and especially the Cumberland Company, are the owners of very large tracts beyond their capacity to work for a century to come. We shall anxiously but hopefully watch the progress of the developments now taking place, and at an early day take up the subject again.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Petroleum in the Cumberland Region.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Petroleum in the Cumberland Region.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Cumberland Civilian, March 9', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'March', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8da30fda-a8f3-5637-b307-aa349db4ec85,302,nyt://article/8da30fda-a8f3-5637-b307-aa349db4ec85

A short time since, at about 10 o'clock at night, two negroes went to the residence of Mr. GARRITY, who is superintendent of DICK CHRISTMAN's plantation, about sixty miles above that city, on the Mississippi side of the river, and, knocking at the door, demanded admittance. Mr. GARRITY at once opened the door, when they demanded his money and pistols. He replied he had neither, but had scarcely spoken when he was fired upon by both the ruffians, the shots striking him in the back of the neck and completely paralyzing him. Passing over what they supposed to be his dead body, they entered the house, murdered Mrs. GARRITY and two children, and shot through the shoulder a little girl. She fell, and though enduring intense pain, she feigned death so well that the inhuman monsters really thought her dead, and proceeded with their work of plunder without noticing her further. After plundering the house of everything valuable that they could carry off, they set fire to it and went away. The little girl, thus wounded and alone in the burning building, got up, and going to her father, who was dying, near the door, with desperate courage and strength, she managed to drag him outside of the house into the yard. The rain, which was falling, revived him, and with the assistance of his little daughter he managed to crawl to an out-house. The little girl then returned to the house to attempt to get her mother from the burning building. She failed to accomplish her object, though her severely-burned s[???] leaves evidence of the heroic devotion with which she struggled to rescue the dead body of her beloved mother from the flames. Returning to her father, she made a little [???] and sat watching by his side. He conversed with her until daylight, when, to me her own pitiful expression, he stopped talking and she thought he was dead. When daylight came the poor child, wounded as she was, by the assassin's bullet and by the flames, made her way to the house of a neighbor, some two miles distant, and related the horrible story. This gentleman got others of his neighbors and proceeded to the scene of murder and arson. Mrs. GARRITY's body was not entirely consumed, and was taken from the ruins and buried with those of her husband. The bodies of the children, had been entirely consumed. From the little girl's description of the officers of a gunboat near the place were of the opinion that they were two deserters from that vessel.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HORRIBLE MURDER--A HEROIC LITTLE GIRL.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HORRIBLE MURDER--A HEROIC LITTLE GIRL.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dbd39b28-3239-51f3-8456-fc526cd862d9,446,nyt://article/dbd39b28-3239-51f3-8456-fc526cd862d9

Compromise implies mutual concession; but all the concession in the present instance has been on the side of Peru. Her submission to the dictation of Spain has been, in fact, most abject. By the treaty of peace recently made between the two Powers, Peru, in consideration of receiving back the Chincha Islands, and for the sake of avoiding war, agrees to allow an investigation of the Talambo case, to indemnify all Spaniards for the losses and confiscations sustained by them during the struggle for independence, and to pay Spain the $3,000,000 which this expedition to the Pacific is said to have cost her. These terms are equally hard and humiliating, and by assenting to them the Lima Government has evinced an utter disregard of its own dignity and the national honor. Submitting the Talambo case to judicial arbitrament gives a color to those calumnies which the Spanish agents have been reiterating against the Peruvian Executive and President; undertaking to indemnify Spanish subjects for the pecuniary losses which their grandfathers suffered amid the turmoil of revolution, affords scope for interminable litigation and fraud; while the repayment to Spain of the cost of the expedition, will be a virtual admission that the enterprise was necessary and just.

In other constitutional countries the sovereign generally contents himself with one political adviser at a time; but in the land of the Hellenes, the monarch who watches over its destinies must have two -- Admiral KANARIS his Prime Minister proper, and Count SPONNECK, who is not a minister at all, yet who is retained about the person of royalty in order to correct the indiscreet suggestions of the Governmental Coryphaeus.

But New-Brunswick and Prince Edward's Island have, informally, rejected the measure. Newfoundland has postponed it; and Nova Scotia shows scarcely any sign of acquiesence. The ""Union,"" therefore, is practically as far off as it was before the late conference was held. New-Brunswick is the keystone of the whole projected fabric. Without the cooperation of that province, the relations of the colonies must remain essentially what they have been.

It has always been a matter of wonder to investigators into the resources of this country, that such great stores of wealth were continually derived to the nation from the auriferous regions of our western coast, and yet that so few individuals are ever known, who have made fortunes from mining; with a yield of bullion, which it is expected during the present year, will reach $75,000,000 from California, there seem to be so few private fortunes of great extent made from it, and so many companies which are failures. So notorious is this fact, that capital is drawn with great difficulty into mining operations on the Pacific Coast, and in a business which will pay from two to three per cent. a month on good security for loans and advances, our eastern capitalists cautiously stand aloof.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mining in the Pacific States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mining in the Pacific States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a57070b-04e0-5044-bcf9-d381280da15b,825,nyt://article/4a57070b-04e0-5044-bcf9-d381280da15b

We need hardly say that nothing whatever is proved as to the comparative state of discipline in the two bodies by these figures. The fact that there are so many charges preferred and passed upon before the Police Commissioners may prove that the men are guilty of many delinquencies, but it also proves that the commissioners do make constant and steady efforts to enforce discipline. In fact it would be difficult to cite a fact affording stronger evidence of the efficiency with which the force is administered. The very number of charges, prove that offences are punished, for if they were not, people would soon get tired of complaining of them. Moreover, there is no doubt in the public mind of the excellent condition of the police force. The policemen are not angels, but we can safely say, that if they were neater in their dress, they might compare favorably in every respect with any similar body of men in the world.

One chief drawback to reform instituted from this influential quarter arises from the fact, that many of those city officials who most need reproof are too hardened to go to church, and too ignorant to be able to read a church discourse, or any other discourse, when it appears in print. Still, we cannot afford to disparage any agency -- least of all that of the church -- that aims to rouse whatever remnant of civic virtue there is left among us, to an appreciation of the fearful dangers of our present sanitary condition. Next in evil to the all-pervading municipal corruption to which our present wretched situation is primarily due, is the astounding indifference of the great mass of our citizens to the real peril of the situation.

Even the bounty-brokers, who were in high glee over their hairbreadth escape, applauded the work for its audacity; and the barkeepers, who have lost more than five hundred of their most constant, if not most profitable customers, spoke admiringly of Col. BAKER as the ""smartest man in New-York."" Everybody wished to learn something of Col. BAKER's biography; and the conjectures that were to be heard on street-corners, at the threshold of the church, in the hotel reading-rooms, indeed, everywhere, were amusing, to say the least. The roughs thought him the notorious LEW. BAKER; Western men believed him to be a citizen of Chicago; Californians, who certainly could not have read the newspapers, wondered whether he was not the illustrious and lamented Col. BAKER, who fell in the slaughter-pen at Ball's Bluff. But nobody's curiosity was gratified, and the inquiries everywhere closed as they began, ""Who is Col.

"Rev. Dr. JOHN McCLINTOCK preached this mornning, at St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, Fourth-avenue and Twenty-second-street. The church...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/13/archives/discourse-by-rev-dr-john-mcclintock.html,,"Rev. Dr. JOHN MCCLINTOCK preached this morning, at St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, Fourth-avenue and Twenty-second-street. The church was crowded with a large audience, among whom we noticed the Chairman of the Senatorial Investigating Committee, Hon. Judge MUNGER. The sermon, while very eloquent, was eminently practical and full of common sense. Reverend gentleman took for his text: ""Therefore glorify God in your body."" I Cor., vi. 20, and proceeded to speak of the importance of activity in all the affairs of life. Nature, he said, taught us this lesson. The law of activity is the law of force, and force is action. This law is seen everywhere in nature where the action of nature is healthy. The river flows on without stoppage: or, if the water stops, it becomes sickly and makes those sick who partake of it. We hear the voice of activity in the roar of floods and the rush of storms; it is seen in the swell of the heaving sea, or in the gentlest ripple on the surface of the river. The life of the Son of God was activity itself -- the exemplar of mankind, ever working, ever doing good. The active man shall get ahead of the slow man. The slow man may be very good, very conscientious, and very pious; the active man may be a very bad man, but he will beat the slow man in the race. The tradesman understands this; and he studies the laws of trade if he wants to succeed; the slow tradesman, because he is religious, does not study the laws of trade. He thinks God will do his work for him, and he fails. The former fulfills so far the conditions of the laws of God. And so it is with government. Those who would be rulers are active. They understand their business. There are powers, and powers are forces; they get the powers and grasp the prizes; and so long as good men are idle bad men will rule. Christianity, some think, is a medicine, but it is a discipline, a duty, a life, and it is a religion of the body as well as of the soul. The pagans understood this religion of the body -- the culture of the body in constant baths -- in the training of the boxer, the racer, the gymnast, in order to give physical development. It was just as necessary to be physically as morally developed. Greece understood this. Over that land the spirit of beauty, as well as physical culture, held sway. If we wanted to get the highest types, the ideals of beauty, as far as they can be seen in marble, we must go to Greece. The same principle was enunciated by the philosophers of Greece. The stoics, which Zeno was the apostle, hold that a man's powers should be strong, vigorous. But there was a weakness as well as a strength in philosophy. It might make a good pugilist, a strong man, but never a loving, kind-hearted member of society. Christianity settled all that. In the Old Tetament, the care for the body was set forth in innumerable forms and passages. The purification of the body was deemed coeval with the purification of the soul; and it was laid down as the ancient law, that a person afflicted with any physical taint or defect should not come to serve at the altar. This calling required specimens of the highest type of God's creatures, in body, mind and soul. The aptness of those prefatory illustrations were applicable to the object of his sermon. The object of every man's life was real, stern work. There was no mystery, no spiritualism, in the work of Christ. It was as much temporal as spiritual. ""Glorify God in your body.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Discourse by Rev. Dr. John McClintock.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Discourse by Rev.

The news of this battle was received in Richmond just in season to shed a dim light over the ""darkness visible"" of the day appointed for humiliation and prayer throughout the South.

Here, on the flank of the rebel capital, on the northern bank of the James River, was Gen. SHERIDAN, with his splendid cavalry force, four days ago.

It is not an obnoxious State Church, the want of a local Parliament, the absenteeism of landlords, the uncertain tenure of tenants, the potato rot, nor the wholesale emigration from large pastoral districts of the country. It is simply the want of capital. This, Lord PALMERSTON thinks, the Government of the United Kingdom cannot undertake to supply; but he would have been willing that a Parliamentary Committee should sit for another year to endeavor to discover where the capital necessary to redeem Ireland could be found.

The line was then taken up for the boat, which lay at a pier near the ferry, and the gang was put aboard under an escort of well-armed regulars, and taken off to the fort. There were very few spectators, the hour at which the prisoners were marched down Washington-street being rather earlier than suited the convenience of our neighbors over the river.

Police-Station Lodgers; Statistics,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/14/archives/police-station-lodgers.html,Police-Station Lodgers; Statistics,"BARNUM's temperance drama is very good in its way, but it is all tame recital when compared with our daily morning reports from the police stations. At the Tombs, every morning at 6 o'clock, at the Jefferson Market Police Court, or at the Police Court on the East side, may be seen the real drama, and in it all the actors are up in their parts. But even here in the police courts the story does not fully appear; for among all the prisoners there are no station-house lodgers. This class -- a large one, as will presently be shown -- includes no felons that policemen drag to the bar of justice; the lodgers find shelter over night in the cells of the police stations, and are dismissed in the morning to go whither they will. Nobody knows them by day; they spring to the surface like mushrooms at night. They are masculine, feminine, of youth, of middle age, and of the sere and yellow leaf; but they are mainly in appearance males of middle age -- young men who have grown prematurely old, females of twenty-two, whose haggard or bloated visages are not be described. The aged and very young are seldom of their number; for their vagabond life is not conducive of age, and rum rarely does it work so rapidly as to drag children down to the necessity of seeking lodgings in the police stations. The males are in this time of draft seemingly excellent subjects for army duty in place of men of sedentary habits and comfortable incomes. But ask a Police Captain why he does not enlist them, and the almost invariable reply is, that they have offered to enter the field as substitutes and been rejected by the Surgeons.

Sheridan at,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/14/archives/the-rebellion.html,Sheridan at,"Official dispatches have been received from Gen. SHERIDAN, dated at Columbia, Va., March 10th. This place is on the north side of the James River, about fifty miles west of Richmond, and very nearly midway between that city and Lynchburgh. The destruction by SHERIDAN's men has been wide-spread and important. While at Charlotteville they destroyed two large iron bridges, one over the Rivanna River, the other over Morse's Creek, and also the railroad for eight miles southwest, in the direction of Lynchburgh. On Monday, 6th inst., Gen. DEVINS was sent to the James River, at Scottsville, and worked along the river and canal to Dugurdsville, 15 miles east of Lynchburgh, destroying as he marched all the bridges, culverts and locks of the canal, and the tracks of the railroads in the way. He intended to cross the James at Dugurdsville, doubtless to strike the Southside Railroad, but the rebels destroyed the bridges. In the meantime, another division moved down the direct railroad from Charlotteville toward Lynchburgh as far as Amherst, ruining the road as far as they went, burning and breaking down a great many large bridges. The sweep of these two divisions spread over a triangle of thirty or forty miles on a side, and within that space the destruction of railroads and other public property is complete. The James River Canal, which (says SHERIDAN) had been the great fender of Richmond, was cut at Rockfish River, and at New-Canton, where the dam is across the James, the guard-lock was destroyed, and the river let in, carrying away the banks and washing out the bottom of the canal. Gen. SHERIDAN says that the weather has been very bad, but he has, nevertheless, done excellent work. He reports the capture of fourteen guns and a few prisoners, Commodore HOLLINS, of the rebel navy, was shot near Gordonsville while attempting to make his escape from our advance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d010c7f2-bb3b-5357-b38f-e11627e63e47,437,nyt://article/d010c7f2-bb3b-5357-b38f-e11627e63e47

Our position at,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/15/archives/our-position-at-kinston.html,Our position at,"The temporary check which COX's forces received last Wednesday at Kinston, was succeeded, two days later, by a decisive repulse of BRAGG, who was rash enough to attack our troops in their intrenchments. In the former affair, with about equal loss in killed and wounded, the enemy, according to BRAGG, captured three guns and 1,500 prisoners; in the latter he was driven off with severe loss, leaving his dead and badly wounded on the field, and several hundred prisoners in our hands; and eventually he retreated across the Neuse River. The balance of victory, therefore, is in our favor, for we hold the field. The first day's issue excited some apprehension, because it was an anomaly in the unchecked series of victories with which the year has greeted our arms thus far.

With Fort Totten sweeping the entire area between the Neuse and the Trent, which make their confluence at the city, with the other earthworks protecting both banks of each river, and the numerous gunboats patrolling them for long distances, the capture of Newbern by an army of forty thousand rebels was impracticable, even with its ordinary garrison.

The County Volunteer Committee seemed to think that the draft would be enforced generally.

The flames spread with great rapidity, and entered the fourth story before the firemen had adjusted their machinery, and by the time when the engines had got fairly at work the fire had made such progress as to render it doubtful whether any part of the building could be saved; but at about 10 o'clock the firemen had gained the mastery, and checked the fire on the second story, leaving Messrs. RICH & BREWSTER's hardware establishment, on the first floor, uninjured, except by water. Messrs. LEHMAN & FERST's stock of clothing, on the second floor; Messrs.

"New-Hampshire held her annual election yesterday, for Governor, Legislature, and Members of Congress.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/15/archives/the-elections-yesterday.html,,"New-Hampshire held her annual election yesterday, for Governor, Legislature, and Members of Congress. Two years ago there was no choice of Governor by the people. EASTMAN, the Democratic candidate, had 32,833; GILMORE, Republican, 29,035; and HARRIMAN, Union and Independent, 4,372. GILMORE was, however, elected by the Legislature. At the same time the Democrats succeeded in electing one Member of Congress -- DANIEL MARCY, in the First District -- by 80 majority. Last Spring there were but two candidates for Governor, and the vote was: GILMORE, (Republican,) 37,006; HARRINGTON, (Democrat,) 31,340; Republican majority, 5,666. In November, LINCOLN had only 3,529 majority. Yesterday, the Republicans did better than in 1864. Although the vote was rather light, and the interest (outside of the First Congressional District,) nothing like that of last Spring, they carried the State by more than 6,000 majority. Their best work, however, was the defeating of Gen. MARCY, who was again the Democratic candidate for Congress; and that defeat was achieved in spite of a split in our own ranks, which threatened an easy victory for the other side. As we write we receive returns from 127 towns, giving 24,665 Republican to 18,313 Democratic votes. Gen. MARSTON's majority over MARCY is about 1,500; the other Republican Congressmen, have each about 2,000 majority; all of the Councillors, nine of the twelve Senators, and about three-fourths of the members of Assembly are Republicans. Altogether, New-Hampshire has done well, and nobly responds to the great military victories now being won almost daily in the heart of JE[???]F DAVIS' dominions.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Elections Yesterday.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Elections Yesterday.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ac6315f-5198-5304-bde7-a1f88ac6599f,402,nyt://article/9ac6315f-5198-5304-bde7-a1f88ac6599f

He said that the vessel was bound for Newbern, and that she encountered a violent storm, which began on Sunday and continued up to. Tuesday night, when the vessel was driven on a bar, and in about fifteen minutes had seven feet of water in the hold; that in a few minutes the boats were lowered, and officers and men took to them. A raft, he says, was constructed and launched, on which the rest of the crew took refuge. Rockets were fired as signals of distress, and the steamer Ellsworth, for Boston, took them all off and brought them to this port. All escaped, according to his story, but the Chief Engineer, an assistant and the coal-heaver, who were in the engine and boiler rooms when the vessel struck. Though the man tells a very plausible story, there are good-reasons for believing that the whole thing is a fabrication. He represents the Ticonderoga to have been a side-wheel steamer, which is not a fact; nor does he give the proper name of the commander of the vessel. He Says that she carried eight guns, whereas her armament consists of twenty guns. Besides, no one about the Navy-yard has heard of her loss, nor have officers or sailors from her been landed there. It is not probable that the man could have been mistaken in the character of the vessel, if he had been, as he says, several months on board of her, nor in the name of the commander. -- Philadelphia Ledger, March 13.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SUPPOSED TO BE A SAILOR'S YARN."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""SUPPOSED TO BE A SAILOR'S YARN."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e9d30880-5515-5883-a156-e355ce9593e4,293,nyt://article/e9d30880-5515-5883-a156-e355ce9593e4

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/15/archives/a-bountyjumper-brought-to-grief.html,,"-- Since the advent of Col. BAKER, the military subordinates attached to the Department of the East have been slightly aroused to the importance of their duty, and have of late exhibited more energy in dealing with cases where soldiers of the United States army have been robbed of their bounty. A case occurred last October, which should have been attended to at least three months ago, where a mere child was kidnapped by a notorious bounty-jumper named THOMAS HEANEY, residing at No. 15 Prince-street, Brooklyn. HEANEY, it is stated, is a member of a gang of bounty-jumpers, who, practiced their nefarious profession all last Summer at Elmira -- some of them taking the rounds as often as two or three or four times. A gambling-house was established by this gang at the corner of Hudson-avenue and Johnson-street, where they assembled nights to dissipate their ill-gotten gains. This HEANEY, as represented, induced a boy, named WM. MCCLOSKEY, to accompany him to Staten Island for the purpose of enlisting, promising to give him $1,000 as soon as he was examined by the doctor. He was handed $300, as stated, and immediately thrust into the guardroom without giving him time to remonstrate. HEANEY being acquainted with the premises, went to a window looking into the guard-room and induced a boy to give the money to a brother-in-law in Brooklyn. The money was intrusted to the boy but never returned. Complaint was made to Gen. DIX, and after considerable trouble the applicant succeeded in having an order of arrest granted which was placed in the hands of Detective CHARLES FROST, who brought the culprit before Gen. DIX yesterday.

It is entitled ""Articles of Separation,"" and sets forth that, whereas, divers unhappy differences and disputes have arisen between JACOB KAISER and ANNA KAISER, his wife, they have agreed to live separate and apart from each other during their natural life. The document then goes on to state that JACOB doth covenant, promise and agree with ANNA, his wife, that he will allow her to be in such a place and family as she may from time to time choose; that he will not interfere with her or with any person for harboring her, provided she leaves the city of Detroit and State of Michigan within eight days from the date above given, and that he will not interfere with any of her possessions, provided she accepts from him the sum of $35 in full for all demands and claims against him. ANNA, on her part, covenants with JACOB, in consideration of the sum of $35, in hand paid, to renounce all claims on him, and agrees that she will not in any manner disturb him henceforth nor claim any share of the real or personal estate which he may acquire, and that she will treat him henceforth as though she had never been married to him. The document is signed and sealed in the presence of witnesses, for which it is said that the justice received a fee of $20. Truly a novel and original method of divorce. The separation lasted but a few months, when the parties lived together again and continued to do so until JACOB enlisted into the army, where he now is, fighting the battles of his adopted country, -- Detriot Tribune",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOVEL METHOD OF DIVORCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOVEL METHOD OF DIVORCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21cc870b-cda6-5988-8900-324fad3cc32a,303,nyt://article/21cc870b-cda6-5988-8900-324fad3cc32a

Rome and Modern Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/16/archives/rome-and-modern-reform.html,Rome and Modern Reform,"-- The Cardinal Vicar of Rome, according to to-day's European news, has followed up the Encyclical by another rescript, in which modern views of reform are severely, stigmatized. From the terms and the tone adopted by the Cardinal Vicar in this missive, it is not difficult to see that both MAXIMILIAN and NAPOLEON are specially aimed at. The error of regarding ""liberty of conscience"" an a legal right it stigmatized with severity, as is also the doctrine of the freedom of religious worship, and the still more heterodox theory, that the will of the people is the supreme law. If there is not much policy in this disposition of modern liberalism, there is at least courage displayed in the ennuciation of the principles to which the church holds itself bound. It will remain to be seen how far these repeated assaults on popular systems of government tend to promote Roman Catholic unity. The Archbishop of Baltimore has already openly declared -- in opposition to the views of Rome -- for every one of the rights denounced in the Encyclical, and anathematized in stronger terms by the Cardinal Vicar. The American prelate not only holds liberty of conscience, and the freedom of religious worship to be legal rights, but their guarantee by the Constitution of the United States, he regards an act of supreme wisdom. These political lectures from Rome, however, are probably not intended for this country. Certainly they will disturb the views of no one fit to exercise the rights of a citizen, or entitled to the heritage of a freeman.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ROME AND MODERN REFORM', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ROME AND MODERN REFORM', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'ROME', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2edadb07-bf8d-5c4b-b5c9-7a198b172547,262,nyt://article/2edadb07-bf8d-5c4b-b5c9-7a198b172547

In June, 1864, the parties to the suit entered into a written agreement, whereby Miller and his wife agreed to sell to the plaintiff a house and lot in the Eighth-avenue for the sum of $16,000. The negotiations of sale were conducted through a real estate broker. By the terms of the contract $500 was to be deposited with the broker, and all the necessary disbursements and expenses attending the examination of the title were to be defrayed by the defendant. The stipulated $500 was deposited with the broker, and subsequently an attorney for plaintiff searched the title to the house and lot, and found it, as he claimed, defective; he therefore advised his client not take it. The attorney alleges that for attention to the searches, and for disbursements therein, he is entitled to $200, and for the recovery of this amount, and the $500 deposited, the suit was brought. Some of the witnesses on the trial testified that $75, exclusive of disbursements, was a reasonable fee for such services. At the conclusion of the evidence, the court, on motion of defendant's counsel, excluded from the consideration of the jury the $500; he holding that plaintiff had failed to show a defective title.

McCabe vs. Cauldwell and Whitney. -- At the opening of the court, yesterday morning, this case was called up, and the Judge, in giving his decision refusing to grant the dismissal of tha complaint asked for by defendant's counsel on Monday last, said that as to some of the points raised he had had doubts. One of the questions argued on the motion for a non-suit, was whether the body known as a Grand Jury was a judicial body, and whether the proceedings and investigations which take place in the Grand Jury room were of such a nature as came within the statute of 1854 of this State, which in substance provides that no reporter, editor or proprietor of a newspaper shall be held accountable for fair and correct reports of proceedings in any judicial or administrative body. The Judge said that while he disapproved of the manner in which the secret sessions of Grand Juries were by law held, and while he knew that in many instances the characters of innocent persons were often blackened by reason of the ex parte proceedings of a Grand Jury, he did not like to establish a precedent, whereby it might become possible for a Grand Jury room to be thrown open to reporters of the public press. He thought it better that, inasmuch as the case had been already spread to some extent before the public, that the whole matter should be allowed to go to the jury. The defendants would be permitted in their defence to give testimony as to the truth of the alleged libelous publication. According to the law, as it now exists in this State, the defendants are permitted to prove the truth of the matter which is charged to be libelous, and in the absence of any malice being shown this constitutes a valid defence. In conclusion, the Judge said, the trial must go on.",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Libel Suit Against the Sunday Mercury The Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Denied.; SUPERIOR COURT TRIAL TERM.

BRILLAT SAVARIN is an acknowledged authority of world-wide renown on all questions connected with the pleasures of the table, and their bearing on the higher faculties of man. His principal work is the ""Physiologie du Gout,"" a book remarkable for its brilliancy of style as well as for the sound sense and hygienic wisdom of its precepts. On it Mr. SIMPSON's book is founded or adapted, with a reference rather of an ad captandum sort, to the questions of corpulency versus leanness, now regarded with great interest in England, through the publication of Mr. BANTING. This gentleman is a retired London tradesman, who, finding himself more unwieldy than was comfortable, reduced himself to a moderate size by adherence to a regimen, when none of the regular faculty were able to relieve him. From a fellow-feeling for others in the same cause, he printed a simple account of the method that had succeeded with himself, and in so doing, raised a storm of controversy that still resounds through the public press. The doctors, probably, were irritated at his unprofessional interference, and continue to denounce fiercely the dangerous consequences of adopting his system. There is little chance that Mr. BANTING ever heard o BRILLAT SAVARIN, but, curiously enough, the experience of the two exactly agrees, and may be expressed as briefly as possible. If you would avoid fat, partake not of farinacious or saccharine matter, as these two articles -- flour and sugar -- are the chief component parts of the ""too, too solid"" adipose tissue that clothes the ribs of those disposed to corpulence. The Hand-book of Dining is not confined to this topic, but reproduces much of the airy epicurean philosophy and gastric learning of the Physiologie, where the veteran gourmand rambles on in a mingled strain of theory and reminiscence, recalling the good dinners he has eaten, or explaining the principles involved in their conception. It is a book to provoke an appetite, while it confers a dignity on the function of eating, derived from the earnestness and attention employed on a consideration of the subject in all its bearings. The translation is idiomatic and correct, but scarcely reaches the fine ironical tone of its original.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e74e1da2-04d6-5f2a-9f75-3b5cdc8ff1bc,1104,nyt://article/e74e1da2-04d6-5f2a-9f75-3b5cdc8ff1bc

Mr. MILLER, of the committee whose duty it had been made to visit the school edifices in the Eleventh Ward, reported that of eight school buildings which they had visited, five were utterly unfit for school purposes, and three were barely tolerable. Of these, Grammar School No. 36, which was erected in 1847, was the most noteworthy as having a basement below the level of the sidewalk, under which tide water flows. In this ill-ventilated, ill-lighted room an average of seven hundred pupils are imprisoned daily, and on days of storm it is found necessary to take them to the attic to find light and air. The committee experienced great difficulty in reading the school-books in this dismal dungeon on the occasion of their visit, Grammar School building No. 15 was built in 1838, on a lot to which no play-ground was attached. The primary department is in a basement below the sidewalk level, and is dark and noisome. Here more than seven hundred children are imprisoned daily. Upon the committee's recommendation, the board authorized the Trustees of the Eleventh Ward to erect an additional story on this building, and recommended that the present primary department be converted into a play-ground. Primary School No. 31 is a rear building, of wood, combustible, dangerous and altogether unfit for a school-house. Primary No. 3 has only a narrow passage through which the pupils enter, and may escape in the event of fire, and the Board of Trustees asked power to construct a staircase on the street. The committee reported favorably, and the board authorized the work.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/18/archives/literary-gossip.html,,"-- There has been very little activity in the American publishing trade during the present year, so far as the production of novelties is concerned. With a general state of business acknowledged to be highly satisfactory, there exists an apparent hesitation to venture upon new enterprises among the prominent houses, that seems difficult to reconcile with the steady demand that all good books of standard character readily meet with at the present time. Undoubtedly, the increased cost of material and manufacture has something to do with this state of apathy, in connection with the presumption that any change occurring in these particulars must be toward lower prices. The public, however, have readily met the advanced cost of books, and there is no complaint on that score, so long as the article furnished is of good quality and execution. Even announcements for the future are scanty. Good historical literature seems in the ascendant, most of the important works forthcoming being of that description, as DYER's History of Modern Europe, and Prof. GEORGE LONG's History of the Decline of the Roman Republic, to be issued by Messrs. HARPER & BROTHERS, who have also, we believe, secured the courtesy-right of republication of LOUIS NAPOLEON's Life of Julius Caesar, at a somewhat less price than the extravagant sum at first demanded for the early copy sent over here on speculation by the English publishers, Messrs. CASSELL & Co.; Mr. C. SCRIBNER's edition of FROUDE's History of England from Henry VIII, to the Death of Queen Elizabeth, shows the prevalence of the same taste for historical research. It will be comprised in the same number of volumes as the English edition, beautifully printed in post 8vo, at the Riverside Press. FORSYTH's Life of Cicero, in two volumes octavo, is also in progress at this establishment, for the same house, and will speedily appear. An original translation of TAINE's History of English Literature, undertaken with the cooperation of the author, will be published by Messrs. SCRIBNER later in the season. Messrs. WALKER, WISE & Co., of Boston, have met with success for their first installment of Miss BOOTH's translation of HENRI MARTIN's History of France, containing the age of Louis XIV., in two volumes; and have announced the completion of the entire work, to form seventeen volumes octavo. Their reprint of Miss MARTINEAU's History of the Peace of 1845-'46 has also been well received, and the first edition disposed of. The Spring trade-sales are now approaching, but, from the expense of manufacturing, there is no surplus stock of books on hand in any quarter, and prices are consequently expected to rule ""high.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/94bbdf1e-c595-545e-87e4-de908840a213,1410,nyt://article/94bbdf1e-c595-545e-87e4-de908840a213

The picture there drawn of the condition of the poor in New-York, and verified by extracts from the reports of the medical volunteers who examined it, ward by ward, last Summer, considering that it describes a state of things existing in one of the richest cities on the globe, in a new country, amongst a people preeminent for their intelligence and religious feeling, and under ""the best Government the world ever saw,"" is certainly somewhat disheartening for what are called ""the friends of progress."" What is worst about it all is not so much the amount of physical misery it reveals among the poor, though this is revolting enough, but the decay of public spirit -- the growth of a shameless and cynical indifference to what concerns the public fame and credit among the well-to-do classes. There are forty-four ""Health Wardens"" in New-York, persons whose duty it is to inspect our streets, alleys and houses, and see that the proper sanitary precautions are taken. A large number of these are liquor dealers; all are grossly ignorant, and many disreputable in character, and it has been ascertained that they do not visit infected districts through fear of contagion. Dr. SMITH asks, and he may well ask it, ""To what depth of humiliation must that community have descended, which tolerates as its sanitary officers men who are not only utterly disqualified by education, business and moral character, but who have not even the poor qualification of courage to perform their duties?""",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-York City and its Citizens.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-York City and its Citizens.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc611274-5dac-58f6-8011-ae33b347a4db,859,nyt://article/dc611274-5dac-58f6-8011-ae33b347a4db

"JACK SHEPPARD AT THE TOMBS. -- Detective Officers FARLEY and GOLDEN found concealed in MICHAEL NEWMAN's place, at No. 82 Mercer-street, about $700 worth of fancy cassimeres which a party of burglars stole on Monday, night from Mr. CHARLES ANSTATT's tailoring establishment at No. 914 Broadway.

"On the night of the 27th of January last, Officer JACKSON, of the Eighth Ward, apprehended KATE GORMAN, of No. 104 Prince-street, on complaint of JOSEPH PETTY, of the Broadway Theatre, alleging that, as she was passing from that place of entertainment, he saw her steal a lorgnette from the pocket of a lady. The lorgnette was found on the sidewalk at the feet of the accused at the moment of her arrest, and the lady to whom it belonged identified it. The case was clear, and the prisoner was held on Mr. PETTY's complaint at the Eighth Ward Station-house, and on the morning of the 28th she was committed by Justice DODGE, without bail. Four days subsequently, however, $1,000 bail was accepted, and the accused was liberated. A fortnight or three weeks thereafter, Capt. PETTY, of the Fifth Ward, who had repeatedly tried to send this KATE GORMAN to State Prison, went to the District Attorney's office to ascertain what disposition had been made of her case, but nobody appeared to know anything about it, and the papers were nowhere to be found. But the Captain pressed the case, and Mr. HALL bade him to summon the witnesses and have their statement given to Mr. WHITE, that he might send it before the Grand Jury, with the District Attorney's request that they bring in an indictment. Capt. PETTY acted upon this advice, and an indictment was found, and a bench warrant was issued by Recorder HOFFMAN and delivered to Officer FIELD, of the Fifth Ward. The officer then sought KATE GORMAN, and at length took her into custody, but as the Court of General Session was nor sitting, the prisoner was held two nights at the Fifth Ward Station-house. While here, she offered Capt. PETTY a $600 diamond ring of he would liberate her; but he declined and sent her to court, and on her appearance there the papers were suddenly found. Mr. HALL accepted CHARLES MITCHELL, a wealthy liquor-dealer, who transacts business on Wooster-street corner of Prince, ad her bondsman for $1,000, and releasing her from imprisonment, agreed with Capt. PETTY to try her himself and try to accomplish a conviction. Nothing further was heard of the case until the 7th inst., when Capt. PETTY received a note from Mr. HALL, inquiring whether he wished KATE GORMAN tried in March, before City Judge RUSSEL, or in April, before Recorder HOFFMAN. It was then arranged that the prisoner should be tried on the 13th or 14th inst., but on Friday, the 10th, Capt. PETTY happened to be in court, and found Mr. GUNNING S. BEDFORD, Jr., addressing a jury, Mr. ROBERT C. HUTCHINGS in conversation with Judge RUSSEL and KATE GORMAN and her associate, HENRIETTA HUNTINGTON, outside, talking with ex-Judge STUART. The upshot of the matter, Capt. PETTY learned, was that a plea of guilty of petty larceny was accepted, and KATE GORMAN went abroad snapping her fingers at the officers of the law, repeating her old tale about having friends at court. It is said that this female was treated thus tenderly in furtherance of the ends of justice -- that through revelations which she may make, thieves whom our law officers are pursuing may be caught and punished. KATE GORMAN is twenty-eight years of age, and has been fourteen years a pickpocket. She was at one time worth $35,000, and every dollar of this money was realized from her nefarious trade.

"Scarcely a day passes that complaints are not made at Police Headquarters, or at some of our Police Courts, by unfortunate persons, who have been relieved of the contents of their pockets, either while walking the streets, or riding in stages or railroad cars. In one case, perhaps, out of fifty, the perpetrator of the theft is caught, but in the majority of instances the light-fingered gentry practice their nefarious trade so adroitly that the victim is either unconscious of his loss, or is unable to take any efficient measures for the recovery of his property. Selecting a crowded car or stage, the pickpocket ascends, and choosing his victim by an intuitive perception, peculiar to himself, he places himself near him, or her, as the case may be, and soon succeeds, by a series of imperceptible manipulations in relieving his neighbor of the contents of his pocket. He usually has a confederate, who engages the victim in conversation, if possible, or, failing that, treads on his toe, or contrives to stick his elbow in his ribs or face -- anything, in fact, to distract his attention -- while his comrade possesses himself of whatever his nimble fingers can get hold of. Their work being completed, the pickpockets take an early opportunity of leaving, before their victim is likely to discover his loss. But this is not the only method they employ. Jumping on the platform of a crowded car, they push against those near them, and thus oblige them to keep their hands fully employed in retaining their perpendicular. Their pockets being thus left unguarded, the result, of course, is that wallets and watches change owners with lightning celerity. There are still other methods, however, employed by the professional pickpocket which he does not hesitate to put in practice when all others fail. The professional prefers, if possible, to do his work quietly and without attracting attention, and as a general thing it is only the clumsy inexperienced operator that works openly and takes by force.

He of course seized the hand and collared its owner but his confederates obliged Mr. JONES to let go his field and the rascals escaped with $45 and an fine opera glass. A few nights before an intoxicated Irishman, who got into a stage in the upper part of the city, was robbed of a $50 bill by three fellows, who were in the stage at the time the man got in. The Irishman, who was very tipsy, handed up a $50 bill to the driver, with a request that he would change it. This, of course, the driver could not do, and handed it back. But instead of the owner receiving it one of the three roughs took it from the driver, and immediately left the stage, his retreat being covered by his confederates.

Brittan vs. Ira Chase, Jr. -- The action was brought to recover the sum of about $10,000 damages, which the plaintiff alleged he had sustained by reason of the wrongful taking and converting to his own use, by the defendant, of a large amount of property belonging to the plaintiff. The goods consisted of army bedsteads made of iron, divers articles of household furniture, and a quantity of shafting and other machinery. It is claimed that a portion of it was taken from a foundry at the foot of Forty-sixth-street, and other portions from a store at No. 522 Broadway. The complaint set forth, and plaintiff's testimony went to sustain it, that twenty-five loads of the goods in question had been removed under and by the direction of the defendant from Forty-sixth-street to his store in Mercer-street, and about five loads had been taken to the latter place from No. 522 Broadway. On the other hand the defendant's witnesses testified that not more than ten loads had been removed at any time from either place to defendant's store in Mercer-street. The evidence was very conflicting, and from among the great amount of testimony taken, the court, in charging the jury, said he found it very difficult to distinguish the true from the false. A bill of sale, dated Feb. 11, 1863, had been put in evidence, and he charged them that if they found that any or all the goods had been transferred to Mercer-street subsequent to the last-named date, they were to give a verdict for the plaintiff accordingly. The plaintiff was entitled to recover for those goods taken from his two establishments after the bill of sale was made. The questions involved were purely those of fact, and he could give them very little aid in coming to a right conclusion. The jury were directed to bring in a sealed verdict.

The colony is no longer to be a penal settlement. Some less powerful and less contumacious province will probably be found -- possibly some district on Hudson's Bay or the Island of Anticosti. Both have been spoken of not unfrequently. The probability, however, is that the colonies that, have the most interest in the Hudson's Bay settlements and in the unsettled Island of Anticosti, would be as little disposed as Australia to receive the vast convict population of England.

from Le Follet,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/19/archives/fashions-for-march-from-le-follet.html,from Le Follet,"Although the temperature at the present time might lead one to imagine the Spring weather very far in the future, it is our duty, as chroniclers of fashion, to give our readers an idea of what toilettes should be prepared for the bright days which we may hope will cheer us before the month of March has passed. Foulard -- perhaps one of the most suitable materials for such dresses -- is now being made in plain colors, particularly green and mauve, a mixture which hitherto has been considered impossible. It is also made with the pattern on a ground of very narrow stripes -- blue and white, green and white, mauve and white, cerise and white, &c. It would be impossible to describe the different designs, on account of the great variety; but there is no doubt that quite plain shades or small patterns will be the most in vogue, as with them a paletot of the same material can be worn. We cannot deny, however it may shock the good taste of some, that the rage for bright, sparkling, or tinsel-like trimmings and ornaments is very great just now. Steel is still much in favor. Crystal is also employed as an ornament, not only in the hair, but little drops of it are dotted over the blonde on dresses, or upon the ribbons trimming them; sometimes sewn on black velvet or ribbon, in the form of a grecque on the body of the dress, especially when made of velvet. It is placed at the bottom of tulle dresses, or in the centre of blonde trimmings. We have also ribbons and galons of gold blonde, embroidered with beads; blonde embroidered with beads or crystal in dew-drops; with satin or velvet ribbons, for dresses. We give an example how these ribbons are used. For instance, on a tunique of tulle, ends of satin ribbon, red or blue, about an inch and a half wide, are placed at equal distances all round, commencing at the waist and finished off by a bow fringed with silver rain (plule d'argent), or white beads. Gold, silver, beads, or steel rain, and feathers are in mode this season for trimming evening dresses -- both bodies and skirts -- and also upon the chignone, and nets in the hair. Peacocks' feathers form a truly elegant trimming, especially used for ball dresses or bonnets. For visiting dress, satin and velvet dispute the palm. Moire antique is no longer so fashionable as it formerly was; partly, perhaps, because with the two former may be worn a paletot or mantle of the same.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fashions for March.; From Le Follet', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fashions for March.; From Le Follet', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/75d54a4c-f7fb-5b4e-beae-addb4eb44837,1739,nyt://article/75d54a4c-f7fb-5b4e-beae-addb4eb44837

HILTON, Master, which left this port on the 20th ult., arrived at Greytown, Nicaragua, on the 3d instant, after a smooth but long passage, which was owing to an accident to the port boiler, making it necessary to reduce the steam to three or four pounds. At Greytown, took on board 704 California passengers, consigned to the Central American Transit Company, the Western Metropolis being chartered to take the place of the Golden Rule. Left Greytown 6th at 6:45 P.M., and being short of water, sailed direct for Havana. Had a heavy cross sea in the Carribean Sea and a norther in the Gulf. Arrived at Havana at 9 A.M. on 11th. On 11th, the Confederate steamer Wren came in with 700 bales of cotton, from Galveston. There were numerous threats from the shore that the Western Metropolis would be burned before she got to New-York. They were so prevalent, that the American Consul sent off word that the officers must be on the lookout. The watches were doubled and armed for all emergencies.

But the policy which he is now pursuing in Mexico, though excellent in the abstract, may prove suicidal in his very peculiar circumstances. It is dangerous for even an old-established sovereign to bid defiance to public opinion, yet how much more perilous is it for a ruler, who holds his seat by the most precarious tenure, to do so? By issuing those decrees (liberal and just in themselves) confirming the secularization of church property and proclaiming universal religious toleration, MAXIMILIAN has alienated the only party among the Mexican people which was at first disposed to sustain him, without conciliating any large number of that national party which has been waging war to the knife against him from the beginning; and, as a consequence, he at present stands divested of any really solid basis for his power, save that French army that originally established it.

Y., the","The Underground Railroad Bill is again before the Legislature, and there is no conceivable reason why it should not pass. The only persons to whose interests it can prove in the slightest degree prejudicial are the street railroad companies, and omnibus proprietors. To all complaints made against these worthies for the shameful and indecent overcrowding of their vehicles, their reply is that it would be impossible for them to put on conveyances enough to give seats to all the passengers, or even carry them all, who now pour up and down this city; and yet whenever any attempt, like this underground railroad, is made to relieve them of a portion of their burden, they rush up to Albany and use every means, fair and foul, to defeat it. The health, as well as the prosperity of this city, depends in a great measure upon the discovery of some means of lightening the pressure of population in the middle and lower part of the island. Whatever brings Westchester County within half an hour of the City Hall, may fairly be said, to all intents and purposes, to double the size of the island. The underground railroad will do this, and nothing else will. Horse railroads take so long to get up to Harlem, that they cannot afford any great aid in the distribution of population, and all the avenues will shortly be so laden with traffic, that we cannot look forward to any such increase of the means of locomotion on our streets as will bear the needful ratio to the probable increase of population.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Underground Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Underground Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2fe14ce6-3396-5644-92df-651fa81e85cf,563,nyt://article/2fe14ce6-3396-5644-92df-651fa81e85cf

Ram at Ferrol to attack U. S. Fleet,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/20/archives/the-francodanish-rebel-ram.html,Ram at Ferrol to attack U. S. Fleet,"Included in the interesting budget of news from Paris, which we publish to-day, is a report which promises a sensation equal to the famous fight of the Kearsarge and Alabama. At a rebel Council, composed of the chief emissaries of the Confederacy, and which closed its sittings at Paris, on the 2d inst., it is understood that a decision was come to, authorizing PAGE, the commander of the ram Stonewall, to attack the United States fleet in Ferrol harbor. That fleet is composed of the Niagara, the Sacramento, and (it is presumed) the Iroquois. There are, at all events, three of our national vessels watching the Stonewall in Ferrol harbor. These vessels are bravely manned, are subject to the orders of a commander -- Capt. CRAVEN -- who will take up the challenge the moment it is given, and should speed become an element of account in the expected engagement the Niagara can, with ease, out-distance (at seventeen knots an hour) any armed vessel afloat. But in the matter of armor-plating, unless Capt. WINSLOW's invention has been extemporized, our fleet would stand at a considerable disadvantage. The rebel ram, moreover, has a formidable 300-pounder on board. Such an engagement as is anticipated would, of course, be a violation of the neutral rights of Spain. But if the rebels commence the fight, there will be no alternative left Capt. CRAVEN but to return their fire.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRANCO-DANISH REBEL RAM.-', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRANCO-DANISH REBEL RAM.-', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d909a9d1-b63f-536f-8c53-200d41beab75,234,nyt://article/d909a9d1-b63f-536f-8c53-200d41beab75
Inauguration Speech as Vice-President,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/20/archives/the-vicepresidents-speechwe-copy.html,Inauguration Speech as Vice-President,"from the Congressional Globe a report of the remarks made by Vice-President ANDREW JOHNSON, on taking his place as President of the Senate, on the day of the Inauguration. There may be differences of opinion as to the timeliness and good taste of some of the topics which he introduced on that occasion, -- but few will venture, we presume, to question publicly the justice of the sentiments which he expressed. Still less will any basis be found in the speech for the unmeasured and intemperate vituperation of the Vice-President for which it was made the occasion. Two years ago the same journals which have been specially vehement in denouncing Mr. JOHNSON, teemed with similar charges upon Secretary SEWARD, and subsequently Gen. GRANT was subjected to the same ordeal. Indeed, it would not be easy to name any prominent member of the Government, who has not, at one time or another, been visited by personal assaults of the same general character, if his opinion on certain phases of public affairs happened to conflict with those of the parties in question.

"Johnson, Rev Evan M.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/20/archives/death-of-rev-evan-m-johnson.html,"Johnson, Rev Evan M.","-- This venerable minister of the Gospel departed this life at his residence in Pearl-street, near Myrtle-avenue, yesterday morning shortly after 9 o'clock. His complaint was general debility consequent upon old age. The deceased was born in Newport, R.I., Jane 1792, and was consequently in the 73d year of his age. He was ordained to the ministry in Trinity Church, Newport, by Right Rev. A.V. GRISWOLD, July 8, 1813. Removed to New-York City in 1814 and became assistant Rector of Grace Church; which position he held for one year, when he took charge of St James' Church, Newtown, L.I., as Rector. In the year 1824, he settled in Brooklyn, and built St. John's Church, situated on the corner of Johnson and Washington streets, two years thereafter. This thickly built portion of the city was then a farm, owned by Mr. JOHNSON himself. In this church he preached the free gospel until 1847, when he retired and hired a little place in Marshal-street, near the Jackson Ferry, for the purpose of continuing his services for the benefit of the poor, for a short time. The building proving inconvenient for the purpose, he established St. Michael's Church, in High-street, of which he remained Rector up to the day of his death. During the years of Mr. JOHNSON's ministrations he united nearly 4,000 couples in marriage, and christened nearly 10,000 children. He was, at the time of his decease, the oldest settled Episcopal clergyman in the State of New-York. The last ministerial rite he performed was the baptism of one of his grandchildren. Mr. JOHNSON was twice married. The only child by his first wife was the Hon. SAMUEL E. JOHNSON; and by the second, HENRY B. JOHNSON, EVAN M. JOHNSON, Jr., and two daughters, (both dead.) One was the wife of Capt. RICHARD THORNE, and the other of Mr. F.E. HAGERMEYER. Mr. JOHNSON's second wife died in January, 1860. He leaves property valued at about $200,000, mostly in buildings on Fulton-street, Myrtle-avenue, Adams, Washington, and Pearl streets.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEATH OF REV. EVAN M.

Time was, when its chief anxiety was to levy taxes; to conscript men; to stamp paper into money for its treasury; to fabricate powder and ball, guns, sabres, and bayonets; to gather food and forage from its vast corrals in Florida and Texas, and its granaries in Georgia and the Shenandoah. These were the ordinary and natural means and appliances of war, and to these accordingly the rebellion bent its attention. But now its shafts have all been sunk, and its mines explored and exhausted. Stripped of resources, beggared of material and supplies, with its interior communications all cut, impoverished in men, money, ships, guns, and in food itself, girdled about by a daily contracting circle of fire, the Confederacy shrieks for a man, to evolve safety out of its imminent peril.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Confederacy Doomed.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Confederacy Doomed.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Davis, Jeff', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1369aace-45ba-5844-b27a-19072c44aa29,1082,nyt://article/1369aace-45ba-5844-b27a-19072c44aa29

A great many things that were pardonable in the persecuted East Tennessean loyalist, really do not look very becoming in the highest civil functionary of the State, and we would, therefore, earnestly entreat the Parson, if only for the sake of the cause for which he has suffered so much, to make a thorough revision of his manner of expressing himself. The public both North and South is now familiar with his sentiments on the subject of secession and the war, as well as with regard to his rebel neighbors, and we believe we express the opinion of the best portion of the community when we say that nothing that Gov. BROWNLOW can add to what he has already said about them could increase our abhorrence of these persons and their doings.

PRATT and ROBERT GREEN, passengers on the steamer Corsica, which arrived on the evening of the 17th inst. from Nassau, are in custody on charges of being officers of the steamer which furnished the Frenchrebel ram Stonewall with her armament. The passports of the prisoners were imperfect. It is charged that PRATT was mate, and GREEN steward, of the City of Richmond, which was loaded with arms and fitted out at London, by CRANSHAW, the rebel agent in that city, and cleared from that port on the 3d of January last, for Bermuda, or any of the West India Islands, with the understanding on the part of the prisoners that she was to run the blockade. After leaving London she took on board between sixty and seventy officers and men, and about three hundred barrels of gunpowder and many small arms, at a place called Greenhithe. The regular crew comprised about forty-five officers and men, who went on board at London. The vessel steered for the coast of France, and reached Belle Isle in about seven days, where she met the rebel ram Olinde, (Stonewall,) to which she transferred all the officers and men taken on board at Greenhithe, besides a large quantity of provisions and small arms. The City of Richmond then steamed for Bermuda, anchored in the harbor of St. George, landed some of her provisions and the remainder of her gunpowder, and sailed for Nassau, N.P., where she arrived on the 4th or 5th of March. After remaining in port four days, Capt. SCOTT, of the City of Richmond, ordered the officers and men on shore. The order was enforced by an officer from the town, some difficulty having occurred between the officers and crew and Capt. SCOTT, owing to the mannner in which the Captain had discharged the crew from the ship. Capt. SCOTT subsequently gave the vessel into the hands of Capt. DAVIDSON, not a British subject, the agent of the owner, CRANSHAW, and who had come out in the vessel from London. The City of Richmond was still at Nassau when the Corsica left. The prisoners were taken to Gen. DIX's headquarters, and subjected to a rigid examination by Col. LUDLOW, of Gen. DIX's staff.

These bonds, nearly all of which are the property of persons who deal with the bank -- the institution owning only $19,000 of the $69,000 that were in the two bundles, were of small denomination of $50 and $100; and as the number of every bond is on record at the bank, and by this time has been made known to nearly every banker or broker in our principal cities, the thief will probably find his prize as valuable as the traditional elephant. The bank offers $10,000 reward, or a proportionate sum for the recovery of any number of the bonds. If this liberal offer does not induce the thief to restore the now worthless bonds, the bank will, of course, apply for duplicates, and the total loss to the institution, instead of reaching the large figure of $69,000, will be merely the cost of advertising, employing defective officers, &c., and perhape one year's interest, at five and six per cent., gold, on $69,000. Mr. W.H. FOSTER, Cashier of the bank, says that no person was in his office when he inadvertently left the bonds on his desk, and went for a moment into an adjoining room to consult with a clerk, and on his return he saw no one, and was unable to account for the mysterious disappearance; but a boy, who was on the street, witnessed through the window the movements of the thief, as he dodged into the bank and seized the packages, ran out and up Broadway, and this boy has given our detective policemen a minute description of the fugitive.

At the time of the grievance complained of -- namely, the early part of the year 1863 -- the plaintiff was a Custom-house officer, and the defendant was, and still is, a Sandy Hook pilot. Early one rainy morning the two were crossing in a Brooklyn ferryboat to New-York. The testimony given showed, that the gentlemen's cabin was filled. The defendant took a seat in front of the wheel-house, and placed a small bundle, which contained his slippers, on a vacant seat beside him. Plaintiff came in immediately after, looked around and concluded that the slippers occupied the only seat not taken. He took up the bundle, and, as one witness besides himself testified, asked the persons sitting on either side if it was their property. Receiving no answer, he either gently placed, or violently threw it on the floor. The testimony on this point was conflicting. Plaintiff took the seat, however, and in a few seconds the defendant asked him if he knew whose bundle that was. Plaintiff said no, nor did he care. Defendant said. ""For aught you know it may contain articles of value, and you have thrown it upon the wet floor;"" whereupon the latter caught up the bundle, and with a sudden movement struck plaintiff with it a violent blow in his face. The result was a profusion of blood from plaintiff's nose and great excitement among the passengers in the cabin, the most of them insisting that it was a great outrage for a large man like defendant to strike a small old man like the plaintiff. One passenger insisted on defendant's taking $10 from him and then fighting a man of his size. When the boat reached the New-York side, defendant was taken into custody by a policeman, and conveyed to the Tombs. After a hearing in the case the magistrate fined defendant $20, and severely reprimanded him for having made an assault so unprovoked. In the Police Court, and also on the trial yesterday, the defendant admitted having struck the blow, but he insisted that plaintiff gave him great provocation for doing so. Defendant and his witnesses testified that plaintiff did not ask to have the package removed from the seat, but threw it violently into the mud and filth of the gentleman's cabin.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Ferry-boat Scene in Court An Action for Assault and Bettery.

There was a rumor, however, that a reinforcement of 5,000 troops was to be sent shortly to Mexico. The draft of the address to the Emperor, which is principally a paraphrase of the speech from the throne, had been read in the Senate. The address applauds the proposed measures of home policy. Speaking of the relations existing between the Church and the State, it says: ""France will not allow the law of 1802, which is a defence against possible abuses, both from within and without, to fall into abeyance."" It approves the Emperor's foreign policy, and hopes are expressed for the consolidation of the new Mexican Empire, and, however serious may be the questions that are still to be settled, the Emperor MAXIMILIAN will be able to decide them by prompt and energetic action. France will learn, from the testimony of her soldiers, soon to return to their country, that MAXIMILIAN reigns over a people sheltered henceforth under the banner of order. Alluding to the words of the Emperor, that the temple of war shall be closed, the address says: ""Peace will be the policy of the future.

The Colorado is one of a fleet of floating palaces that Messrs. WILLIAM H. WEBB, HENRY STEERS, and other eminent marine architects have constructed within a year for the Pacific Mail Company. She is 363 feet in length, 45 feet in width, 31 feet 6 inches in depth, measures 3,890 tons, and cost about $1,000,000. Her engines, which were built at the Novelty Works, have cylinders of 105 inches diameter and 12 feet stroke, and are of the finest workmanship. The cabin accommodations on the Colorado are not inferior to those on the great Cunard steamship China, there being on the main deck fifty-two commodious state-rooms for families, and in the second cabin comfortable berths for fifteen hundred passengers. In fire apparatus the ship is completely equipped. From the main boilers several great tubes extend to stem and stern, and to these are attached twenty-four hose-pipes, with inch and a quarter nozzles, capable of flooding every part of the ship at five minutes' notice; a steam-pipe communicates with the hold, to be used there in the event of fire in the cargo, and in addition to these ample precautionary provisions there is in the forecastle a donkey engine to run the force-pumps independent of the main engines amidships, so that if the central engines were disabled by fire, the engineers could flood the ship from the forecastle. With such enormous hydraulic power aboard, there would seem to be absolute safety; but further to provide for the contingency of fire, or of a leak over which the twenty-four force-pumps cannot gain mastery, there are on the hurricane deck a large number of metallic life-boats, in each of which are constantly kept several sealed cans and casks of water and bread. Not the least interesting display which the Colorado is able to make in these days of Chesapeake piracies is her armament. She carries two twenty-pound field pieces on her quarter, and two thirty-pounders at the fore, and in her arsenal are Sharp's rifles, common muskets, revolvers, pikes, and axes in abundance, and the ship's crew of 120 men may be armed and marshaled on the hurricane deck on two minute's notice.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Ocean Palace on Exhibition.; THE PACIFIC MAIL STEAMSHIP COLORADO.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Ocean Palace on Exhibition.; THE PACIFIC MAIL STEAMSHIP COLORADO.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a41676e-92b1-54f5-8d08-e2b52cfc732c,572,nyt://article/2a41676e-92b1-54f5-8d08-e2b52cfc732c

The light draught gunboat Eolus, Capt. KEYSER, was sent up the Cape Fear River a few days ago. Some thirty odd miles above the city, the hull of the piratical craft was discovered half burned and partially submerged in the brown waters of the Cape Fear. Capt. KEYSER forced his way five miles above the sunken wreck of the Chickamauga. The water grew very shallow, the keel of the Eolus grating over the bed of the river. The trees, too, offered serious impediments to the further progress of the little gunboat. The limbs of the trees growing on either bank extended out over the river, often interfacing their gnarled arms, forming impassable barriers, Capt.

But the Police Commissioners do not intrust their detective officers with money to buy up those more adroit thieves who lead the riff-raff of pickpockets and burglars, and it is only when a large reward is offered that the officers can afford to risk their private means. The $10,000 reward which was offered by the Central National Bank for the restoration of $69,000 in United States bonds that were stolen from their cashier's office on Monday afternoon, was a prize worth the detectives' best efforts. If it had been $5,000, they could hardly have accomplished the work; for they could not have afforded to give the chief of the thieves' organization $5,000 to distribute among his underlings, and this douceur wanting, not a thief would have divulged, and the Central National Bank might have whistled for its bonds. We are not at liberty to disclose the detectives' precise mode of operation; but it can be said that twenty-four hours subsequent to the robbery they were in possession of information which led them to ""pipe"" an up-town dwelling, and that therein on Tuesday afternoon, they found and seized the bonds. But prior to the seizure, it is said to have been necessary to enter into a compromise, in which the bank had its choice of the thief or the bonds. The officers of the institution, it is further alleged, seeing that there could be no hope of getting both the thief and the securities, took into view the fact that $50,000 of the bonds belonged to their depositors, and elected to take the bonds, and these were deposited in the detectives' safe at the Central Department of Metropolitan Police in less than six hours from the time when the bank officers made known their decision. Three persons have been apprehended on ""suspicion of complicity;"" but their names are withheld from the public, and will scarcely go beyond a Grand Jury room. Thus the Central National Bank robbery resolves itself into what the light-fingered gentry style ""a good thing all round."" The bank has recovered its securities, and lost only about $12,000; Detectives YOUNG, MCDOUGALL, GILMORE, RADFORD, KELSO and Capt. JOURDAN have credit for ""working up"" an intricate case; certain somebodies have each a share of $10,000; the public are gratified with the assurance that three arrests have been made, and the Police Justices may complacently look upon the prisoners as three persons who may never give them trouble for a moment.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Recovery of the Central National Bank Bonds.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Recovery of the Central National Bank Bonds.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/596a93d6-986d-52cb-af73-3e440985c7f0,460,nyt://article/596a93d6-986d-52cb-af73-3e440985c7f0

UNDERHILL, Greenpoint. About 3,000 ladies, gentlemen and naval officers were present, curiously examining the formidable war craft as she lay on the stocks. Every available place upon and around the vessel was filled, while three or four tugs and innumerable small craft kept plying in the stream, ready to take charge of the vessel when she should glide into the water. Flags were unfurled from every house and vessel. Among the distinguished gentlemen present, we noticed the following: Rear-Admiral GREGORY, Chief-Engineer W.W. WOOD, Commodore RINGGOLD, Capt. WORDEN, Rev. Dr. CLAPP, Rev. Mr. PARTRIDGE, Messrs. ENGLISH, WHITLOCK, ROWLAND, Capt. PERINE, and other eminent shipbuilders. Hardly had the last block been knocked away, when the vessel moved swiftly into the water. At this juncture, Miss AMANDA UNDERHILL, the charming daughter of the builder, amid loud buzzas and waving of handkerchiefs, broke the champaigne bottle across the bows, and said, ""In the name of Neptune, I christen thee Modoc!

The papers are much more interested in discussing the probable condition of the relations of their own country with the United States.

The Duke DE MORNY died on the 10th of March, in his 54th year. M. DE MORNY was born on the 23d of October, 1811. His mother was Queen HORTENSE, the daughter of JOSEPHINE, and the mother of the reigning Emperor. The late Duke was, therefore, half-brother of NAPOLEON III. He commenced his career as a soldier, having joined the First Regiment of Lancers in 1822. He served with considerable distinction in Africa; but M. DE MORNY's name came first prominently before the world on the occasion of the coup d'etat of Dec. 2, 1851. To him NAPOLEON first disclosed that enterprise, and since then his influence, as a diplomatist, as a legislator, and as President of the Corps Legislatif, has steadily grown, until it exceeded, probably, that of any subject of the Empire. His ruling passion -- aside from his political ambition -- was his acquisitiveness.

The removal of eight hundred odd cartloads of night soil, in six working days, is at the rate of something less than a load for every thousand of the population. But the accumulations extend over a period of three months, and as these accumulations were found to include over one hundred dead horses, thirty-seven dead goats, and nearly two hundred dead dogs, besides over six thousand barrels of offal, we are probably safe in making the two-fold deduction, that much necessary work was done within the week, and that much more remains to be done.

It seems, from the statement of the Richmond Whig, that there are many non-combatants in the city, in the shape of women and children, and that they are merely consumers in the military estimate of values. The organ of the chivalry, indeed, puts it impressively, that they are ""pitiless leeches,"" but at the same time commends ""the delicate character of the effort for their removal."" We presume that it is unnecessary to call in question the right of the Richmond Common Council to turn the whole non-combatant population out of doors, if it chooses. But those among us who have been worshipers of Southern -- and especially of Virginia -- chivalry for the best part of their lives, will be apt to feel somewhat perplexed over this crusade against a class, whose helplessness, in the crisis of war, even the savage seldom fails to respect.

His Military Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/25/archives/lieutgen-grant.html,His Military Administration,"It is not generally known, because it was not desirable until now that it should be known, that Gen. GRANT, as soon as it became necessary to prepare SHERMAN for his march through Carolina, stripped himself of a very large portion of his own troops, in order both to reinforce him and to strengthen the columns at Charleston, Wilmington, Newbern and elsewhere, which were to operate in combination with him, so that the lines at Petersburgh and on the James were occupied for the time by barely enough men to hold them. This, we admit, is a circumstance which now possesses no great military or political importance, but it deserves the attention of the public, as illustrating in a very marked manner the character of the man to whose hands it has been the rare good fortune of the nation to have had the management of its armies confided during the past year. We venture to repeat that there have been few instances in the history of war -- we can ourselves only think of one -- of such discrimination and perspicuity in the choice of subordinates as Gen. GRANT has displayed. He was no sooner placed in the chief command than he brought to the front and placed in high command, in the persons of such men as SHERMAN, SHERIDAN, THOMAS, MCPHERSON, an array of talent such as has been seldom seen in any army; and they have not been in any sense his creatures, the blind, devoted followers of his own fortunes, loving him better than the cause or the country, and ready to ruin either the one or the other to advance his private interests or their own. The public has been spared, under his administration, the pain of seeing the staff, field and corps and divisions led by henchmen of the General-in-Chief, converting the war into a Presidential campaign, and fighting without more thought of principle than highland gillies. Every man whom he has been instrumental in placing in a prominent position, has proved himself not simply an able, but a devoted, self-sacrificing, silent servant of the nation, obeying orders faithfully, holding his tongue diligently, and doing his duty without reference to the effect which his action was likely to have, either on his own interest or those of the people.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lieut.-Gen.

On one side is represented, by little figures in alto-relief, the birth of Eve in Paradise, on the other what is supposed to show the Fountain of Immortal Life, with figures drinking from It. The work is of French origin, circa 1850, and cost the museum £700. Another example of similar character is a circular jewel, formed of gold with precious stones, and elaborately enameled; this is lent by Mr. GLADSTONE. There is also an eseigne mounted with gold, and bearing enameled figures of Venus and two Cupids; this specimen has three pendent jewels. In the case containing these articles, which is at present in the north court of the museum, west of the model of St. Peter's, Rome, will be found the elaborate rosary belonging to Col.

DAVIS and Gen. LEE. This fearful and wonderful policy, it seemed, consisted in evacuating all the cities and centres of population, giving up all the strategical positions, retreating from all the military lines, from the mountain strongholds, the rivers, the seaboard and the railroads, and, after having done all this, taking up a position defiantly somewhere among the swamps, and forests, and deserts of the interior.

"Montholon, M, French Minister to United States, Biography",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/26/archives/the-new-french-minister.html,"Montholon, M, French Minister to United States, Biography","Our last foreign intelligence announces the appointment of M. DE MONTHOLON represent the Court of Paris in this country, in the place of M. MERCIER, who was appointed July 4, 1860, but has been for some time absent. The Marquis DE MONTHOLON is the son of CHARLES TRISTAN DE MONTHOLON, Count of Lee, who died in 1853. The father was one of the most intimate and trusted of all the Emperor LOUIS NAPOLEON's friends, as he had been of NAPOLEON's. He was a Chamberlain and Brigadier-General to the latter; sought to accompany him to Elba; fought with him in the hundred days, accompanied him to St. Helena, and there witnessed his death. On his return to France he published his Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire de France sous Napoleon, ecrits a Sle. Helene sous sa dictee, in eight octavo volumes. True always to the idees Napoleonees, he accompanied LOUIS NAPOLEON in his attempt at Boulogne, in 1840, and for a short time shared his imprisonment at Ham. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly, in 1849, and witnessed the investment of LOUIS NAPOLEON with the purple. We recall these facts concerning the father of the new French Minister to show that he is likely to be a man of some weight with the Emperor, and that whatever personal abilities he may have, he is possessed of strong personal claims on a man who never overlooks such indebtedness.

"Stonewall, Description of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/26/archives/the-stonewall.html,"Stonewall, Description of the","The correspondent of the Army and Navy Journal, dated Paris, March 2, says: The Stonewall, late Olinde, is still in a Spanish harbor, undergoing repairs. Two Federal frigates, the Sacramento and the Niagara, are lying off the port, waiting for the Confederate to run out. It is not probable that the Stonewall will move just at present, as her Captain is still in Paris, waiting for final instructions. Capt. PAGE is of opinion that his vessel would prove more than a match for either of the powerful frigates told off to watch him. The Niagara only carries 12 guns, but her metal is heavier than that of any other vessel of her class. The Stonewall, amongst other guns, has a 300-pounder, and, besides this, she is protected by 5 1/2 inches of iron. Should a battle take place, some light will be thrown on the intrinsic merits of American and French frigates, and the relative value of wood and iron. The United States Consul tried hard to get the Stonewall seized by the Spanish Government, on the plea that she had escaped from a French harbor, and that three French war steamers had been sent in pursuit of her. A telegram from Paris soon satisfied the Cabinet of Madrid that the Consul had been fabricating. The question of who sold the Olinde to the Confederates is still shrouded in mystery. All the damage she may do will have to be paid for by some one.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE STONEWALL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE STONEWALL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e28cc0a-6885-59cd-bcfb-729326208e9b,245,nyt://article/9e28cc0a-6885-59cd-bcfb-729326208e9b

The income of great numbers of the producing classes was, in a day, as it were, trebled or quadrupled. People who had been poor, found themselves suddenly rich. The consequence was, for a time, an unbounded extravagance. Silks, wines, liquors, rich furniture, and other imported luxuries, were bought at a most profuse rate. Having been shut out from indulgences so long, the whole population, who had any meant to purchase, poured forth their means to gratify taste or appetite in a lavish manner, scarcely considering expense, though there hardly existed a currency worthy of the name, south of New-England.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Effect of Peace on Trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Effect of Peace on Trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PEACE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6fcbc48-f045-5d73-9db1-ecfb264eba77,756,nyt://article/e6fcbc48-f045-5d73-9db1-ecfb264eba77

One was prepared by the Committee on Ordinances, after gathering all the information they were able from the trade and other parties interested in the matter.

Alderman JEREMIAH's ordinance is also less restrictive in its character than that prepared by the Committee on Ordinances.

It is a most elegant edition, -- upon fine paper, in clear, tasteful type, reproducing all the illustrations of the original edition, and in every respect among the most beautiful issues of the American press. THACKERAY's reputation with his cotemporaries has not been equal to that of some of his rivals, -- but we are confident his writings will be more highly valued in coming years than those of any novelist of the present day. In his analysis of character, his knowledge of human nature and society, and in the graphic and remorseless truthfulness with which he has delineated the marked features of both, he is without a rival. His style is the perfection of the language. His works will constitute as permanent a part of the treasures of English literature as those of ADDISON, FIELDING or any of the great masters of the past, and no better service could possibly be rendered to the reading public than a complete edition of his works, in the superb style of these three volumes, just issued and containing Vanity Fair.

"Tony Butler; Fullerton, Lady; Too Strange Not to be True",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/27/archives/new-books.html,"Tony Butler; Fullerton, Lady; Too Strange Not to be True","Lady FULLERTON is well known as one of the most accomplished women of the day. Her works of fiction have not been numerous, but they live individually in the minds of all who have read them, and to that large class of the community her name is a sufficient recommendation of any new book. She is one of the very limited number of persons of English birth who have been successful authors in a foreign language. Her Comtesse Bonneval Histoire du Temps de Louis XIV., is received as a classic book in France, like BECKFORD's Vathek, and Lord MAHON's Histoire du Grand Conde. Her familiarity with the literature of continental Europe has probably guided her choice of a story, for the present work. Too Strange Not to be True, is founded on a tradition currentduring the last century, and recorded in M. BOSSU's Travels in Louisiana. It relates to the mysterious fate of a royal personage, reminding one of the more recent momentary excitement that followed the question, ""Have we a Bourbon among us?"" The older story was based on the startling events that occurredin the dynasty of PETER the Great, of Russia. His eldest son ALEXIS, who afterward fell a victim to his father's severity, married a daughter of the house or Brunswick, the Princess CHARLOTTE SOPHIA, of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. The plea of insanity offers the best excuse, for the wayward conduct of the heir to the throne of all the Russias. Among other acts of brutality, repeated attempts to rid himself of his unhappy bride by violence or poison were notorious, and at last it was asserted that she died from the consequences of a ferocious assault in one of his paroxysms of temporary frenzy. According to the romantic version or her fate, however, the death of the Princess was a feigned one, and she was rescued from the lot that seemed to await her by some attached adherents, and after many, adventures succeeded in reaching the French Territory of Louisiana. Here she resided in peace many years, having married the Chevaller D'AUBAN, an officer who held a position in the Colonial Government. She finally returned to Europe on account of his health, and is reported to have died a widow, at an advanced age, after a lengthened residence at Brussels. It is in the New World, among the virgin forests, the floral splendors and atmospheric radiance of the tropics, that Lady FULLERTON introduces her heroins. Her former career is related to her husband, who has recognized the scion of royalty under a humbler garb. It will readily be seen with what facility a story of the kind adapts itselfto the purposes of the novelist. The authoress is one of the recent converts to Catholicism, who had left Protestantism for a more imaginative faith. Accordingly the labors and sufferings of those saintlikemen, the Jesuit missionaries, and their self-denying career among the Indian tribes, meet with their due share of notice. The course of the narrative, whether in Europe or America, is marked by a vraisemblance and fidelity to nature that show that Lady FULERTON writes like a true literary artist. Her aim is always good, and it is skillfully wrought out, with no extravagance of thought or language, but in a stylve remarkable for its purity and simplicity. Too Strange Not To Be True is destined to be widely read.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/51e94e00-c3be-508c-ba3b-f3d477ce0872,1098,nyt://article/51e94e00-c3be-508c-ba3b-f3d477ce0872

on the Offensive,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/27/archives/lee-on-the-offensive.html,on the Offensive,"The rebel General-in-Chief seems to have been seriously deceived as to the scope and bent of certain movements ordered early last week by Gen. GRANT, on the left of our lines. These movements were made the subject of comment in the Richmond papers on Wednesday; and the Whig of that date, while doubtful whether Gen. GRANT's apparent activity was not intended to deceive, pointed out at the same time the probability of his taking advantage of the weather to advance. LEE seems to have attached some weight to the latter conjecture, when he ordered an attack by three divisions upon Fort Steadman before daylight on Saturday morning. The attack, in the first instance, was made with a suddenness and a dash which made it a temporary success. Striking a portion of our lines held by the Third Brigade, First Division of the Ninth Corps, the rebels wheeled, and made an overpowering attack upon Fort Steadman, of which they soon got possession. Having made good their position on the hill adjoining the fort, they turned our guns upon our men, and gaining confidence by the turn fortune had given them, they made a subsequent dash upon Fort Haskill. But here their luck, and probably their spirits, forsook them. Portions of WILCOX's and HARTSUFF's divisions bravely opposed a further rebel advance; and, after one or two attempts by our troops to retake this Fort Steadman, which were only partially successful, the gallant men of the Second Brigade, with the troops of the First Division on either flank, came to the rescue, for a determined and final assault, and finally regained possession, three thousand rebels having fallen in the terrible struggle, and twenty-seven hundred surrendering themselves prisoners.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lee on the Offensive.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Lee on the Offensive.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80c2a634-652e-5c12-9150-b679ff411eea,355,nyt://article/80c2a634-652e-5c12-9150-b679ff411eea

"Emancipation in Brazil has, to a certain extent, been a practical matter for a number of years, by the mild laws regarding the manumitting of slaves.

The entire line of rebel rifle pits at this point was shortly in possession of our forces, and four hundred and sixty-nine of LEE's men, probably nothing loath, surrendered themselves prisoners.

In fact during the years 1861-2, hardly a speech was made, or an article written in England on American affairs, in which this was not spoken of as something as well known and recognized as any provision of the Constitution. One might fairly have inferred from much of what one heard and read, that Mr. LINCOLN and Mr. SEWARD were in telegraphic communication, night and day, with our ward politicians, and that no State paper of importance was ever written at Washington without taking the advice of the leading grogshop-keepers and shoulder-hitters of this city.

"WINTER GARDEN. -- The theatrical tendency of the present day is toward effect, action; and a rapid succession of brilliant scenes and costumes are accepted as accomplishing all that the manager requires. The literary merit of a piece is now of little consequence. It is indeed the last thing thought of. If the work will play itself -- that is to say supply a pantomime which, in its quickness, is intelligible without the aid of language, then it may be safely inferred that it possesses the elements of popularity. Such is certainly the case with the new drama of ""Corporal Cartouche,"" produced at this house on Saturday evening. The story tells itself, and is not in any way assisted by the very ordinary dialogue with which it is occasionally padded. Indeed it is a striking illustration of the truth of our remarks that the Corporal himself is most interesting when he is dumb, and only becomes tedious in the last act, where the gilt of speech is restored to him. The drama has the usual pedigree. It is derived from the French, and, has been adapted by ""a gentleman of this city,' Mr. S.R. FISK, who somewhat coolly claims the whole merit of the affair. The matter is of no importance to the public. It is enough that a very excellent and spirited drama has been produced in a singularly felicitous manner. With a little curtailment it will unquestionably become a great public favorite. The title role is played by Mr. HENRY PLACIDE. The whole interest of the play is centred on the grand figure of the faithful old soldier thus personated. It is to him that a dying General bequeaths a last trust -- to protect his daughter, and it is while trying to fulfill this, amid the wiles of rascals, that in a fit of passion he loses the power of speech. Being unable to read or write, he is thus reduced to the terrible necessity of witnessing the perpetration of great wrongs, without any power to prevent their execution. The incident is not probable, but it is eminently impressive. In its elaboration the action is kept close, and, as we have before remarked, the story tells itself. The opening scene is of a military character, but beyond this and the title, It is emphatically a domestic drama. Mr. HENRY PLACIDE belongs to the old school of loud-voiced comedians; and, according to the lights of that school, is a fine specimen of its best member s During three acts his business is confined to dumb show, which was as intelligible to us as that sort of thing is apt to be. We were occasionally surprised at the earnestness and feeling which he imparted in this embarrassing manner. In the first act, as the bluff Corporal he was excellent, and in the last scene, where he recovers his voice, he was powerful, although hurried. A pause of astonishment or joy would add materially to the effectiveness of the scene.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/28/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- The theatrical tendency of the present day is toward effect, action; and a rapid succession of brilliant scenes and costumes are accepted as accomplishing all that the manager requires. The literary merit of a piece is now of little consequence. It is indeed the last thing thought of. If the work will play itself -- that is to say supply a pantomime which, in its quickness, is intelligible without the aid of language, then it may be safely inferred that it possesses the elements of popularity. Such is certainly the case with the new drama of ""Corporal Cartouche,"" produced at this house on Saturday evening. The story tells itself, and is not in any way assisted by the very ordinary dialogue with which it is occasionally padded.

"-- New-Orleans papers ofthe 12th publish the execution at Natchez, Miss., on the 4th March, by sentence of a general court-martial, approved by Gen. CANBY and Lieut.-Gen. GRANT, of ALEXANDER MCBRIDE and DAVID GEER, privates in the Twenty-eighth Regiment Illinois Infantry, convicted of the murder of Mr. GEORGE W. SARGENT, a citizen of Adams County, Miss., in May, 1864. The culprits were two out of a party of five who, in an attempted robbery by night of Mr. SARGENT'S dwelling, killed him under circumstances of peculiar barbarity. The deceased was between 60 and 70 years old, a gentleman of high standing, and esteemed and respected alike by the citizens of the county and the United States authorities, and unusual interest was taken in the detection and punishment of his assassins. Three of these, however, are yet at large, having deserted and escaped thus far.

SARGENT, a citizen of Adams County, Miss., in May, 1864. The culprits were two out of a party of five who, in an attempted robbery by night of Mr. SARGENT'S dwelling, killed him under circumstances of peculiar barbarity.

The carriage was, of course, violently jerked to one side, and a little child in it only saved from falling under the wheels of both car and carriage, by the grasp of a lady in the back seat. It is a wonder that the horse did not run away. Having done this, the driver of the car instantly drove on faster than ever. The conductor, when spoken to, answered civilly enough, but with a statement that makes the Railroad Company look sufficiently reckless of life. He said, ""I have cautioned him for such conduct two or three times before!"" It appears, therefore, that such reckless brutalities, at most, elicit a ""caution.""

"-- The connected story of SHERMAN's progress from Fayetteville to Goldsboro, which we publish to-day, reduces to an intelligible form the disjointed reports of the fighting which attended his advance. Two battles proper, and only two, were fought on the march. HARDEE's Charleston and Savannah troops made a stand at Moore's Cross Roads, a point about half way between Fayetteville and Bentonsville. The resistance offered here was of such a nature that for part of two successive days, (the 16th and 17th,) the cavalry under KILPATRICK and a portion of the Twentieth Corps were engaged in dislodging the rebels from a position of considerable strength.

The ""Yosemete"" is a cleft in one of the lateral spurs of the Sierra Nevada. By some volcanic convulsion the mountains have been torn asunder to the extent of some nine or ten miles in length and a width varying from three to five miles, forming stupendous walls of granite, with a valley at the bases of the same, through which flows the Merced River. By a wise and munificent act, Congress, by a special law, has granted this cleft to the State of California to be forever dedicated as a public resort for health and recreation. By the same act there is also granted to the State what is known as the ""Big Oak Grove,"" some thirteen or fourteen miles south of the cleft. The Grove contains 427 trees, from 275 to 400 feet in height, covering 2,589 acres. These mammoth trees are the cane-bearing evergreen of the redwood genus, and known as the sequoia gigantea, with bark on the largest of them of 18 inches thickness, and bear two different kinds of leaves. One of the largest of the species which has been hewn down indicates an age of from two to three thousand years.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'YOSEMETE GORGE AND BIG OAK GROVE, IN; CALIFORNIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'YOSEMETE GORGE AND BIG OAK GROVE, IN; CALIFORNIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38537ba4-6ee0-5017-91b2-fec1e4c1e328,223,nyt://article/38537ba4-6ee0-5017-91b2-fec1e4c1e328

on Cheerfulness,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/30/archives/jeff-davis-on-cheerfulness.html,on Cheerfulness,"In Thursday's issue of DAVIS' Richmond organ, there is an exhortation to cheerfulness which is altogether touching. It seems that letters addressed to soldiers in the rebel army by their families, urging desertion, have been intercepted, of late, by the postal authorities. Here are specimens of these unpatriotic missives: Says one girl -- a sister, doubtless: ""Father and George think you had better go to the enemy."" Another: ""Billy and Mother and Jane wants you for to get home."" And yet again: ""If a big crowd comes, you come too. That is my advice."" DAVIS' organ, naturally enough, thinks that this sort of exhortation is discouraging to the conscript mind. The editor, therefore, suggests that the ladies of the Confederacy, in addressing their relatives in the army, should adopt a more cheerful style, as for example, thus: ""Be a brave man, dear brother. Be a good soldier, dear husband. We'll bear our privations with fortitude and cheerfulness."" An excellent specimen, certainly, of the complete rebel letter-writer. ""Write cheerful letters to the soldiers in camp!"" once more urges DAVIS' henchman. ""Don't wait to think whether you are cheerful or not,"" says this Richmond Gradgrind; ""thinking and imagination ought to have nothing to do with it. Write that you are cheerful -- that is the plain duty before you."" And yet, for all this urgent remonstrance, it does seem as if the rebel soldier oftener heard the appeal of ""Billy and Mother and Jane,"" than DAVIS' cheerful substitute.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JEFF.

"On Friday evening last, Mr. JAMES SMITH, of Cincinnati, who was tarrying at the Belmont Hotel awaiting the departure of a steamer for California, went abroad and encountered MARY O'BRIEN, of No. 405 Pearl-street, and with her went to Mrs. GANT's eating-saloon in West Broadway. The syren there robbed him of $1,000, and left him to wake in the morning and make the best of his loss. She then went straightway to her associate, CATHERINE FLETCHER, of No. 62 West Broadway, and the two, it appears, immediately ""went on a bender,"" for, on the same night, both were committed, under assumed names, to a cell in the Fifth Ward Police Station, and thence taken, on Saturday morning, to the Tombs, where they were locked up for one day each for intoxication and disorderly conduct. On entering the Tombs, CATHERINE FLETCHER, fearing that she might be robbed, gave the matron, Mrs. FOSTER, $210, and one of the keepers of the prison $500, offering him $100 to retain the money until her discharge.

Duke de la Torre on Slavery in; In Spanish Colonies; Duke de la Torre on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/03/30/archives/slavery-in-the-spanish-colonies-interesting-speeches-on-the-slave.html,Duke de la Torre on Slavery in; In Spanish Colonies; Duke de la Torre on,"The Duke DE LA TORRE -- I come now to the most important question, and I am sorry to see it treated in the terms made use of by the Minister of the Colonies. I refer to slavery. His Excellency has apparently confounded it with the slave trade, whereas they are two distinct questions. In my opinion the subject that most affects slavery is the slave trade, and the greatest scandal we offer to the world consists not in maintaining slavery, but in not having been able to abolish the slave trade. Whilst I was Captain General of Cuba I proposed at four different times that the slave trade should be declared piracy. And why? Because if those who plunder at sea are pirates, others who steal men and sell them as slaves should surely be treated as pirates. In reply I had the mortification of receiving most romantic and sentimental effusions, never permission to adopt efficient measures to abolish this most abominable traffic. But if these steps were not taken then, why not take them now? If the evil undoubtedly exists, why not apply the remedy? And what is the slave trade? It is the most scandalous crime, the most horrible abomination ever practiced. If it were legally permitted, the ships destined for the purpose would only carry the number of unfortunate beings that could be comfortably accommodated; surgeons would accompany them, there would be abundant space and comfort, and the sexes would be separated. But the slave trade is contraband, and a most lucrative contraband, and decency induces me to hesitate from explaining the mode in which these unfortunate beings are transported. These unhappy creatures are stowed together in a ship, and although the passage lasts a month, sometimes two or three months, they are never allowed to move from the one spot; destitute of any garment, men and women are indiscriminately huddled together, many of the latter with child, near their confinement. Thus packed, these unfortunate beings reach the coasts of the island of Cuba. And now can it be said by a Minister of the Crown that no resolution has been taken on this question? that it is not yet decided whether the traffic in slaves is to be a crime or not? [The Minister of the Colonies: That is not the question.] His Excellency said -- these are his words -- ""the question concerning the crimes of the slave trade is not quite decided upon."" For my part, Gentlemen, I cannot comprehend any greater crime than the slave trade; there is no crime more abominable than that of treating human beings in so cruel a manner. I believe that these people, settled in a sugar plantation in the Island of Cuba, are happier than in their own country; they are carried there against their will, they leave their wives, their children, the dearest objects of their homes, but still they are relatively happier. As to the consequences of the slave-trade, the Minister must know, he is acquainted with the evils it gives rise to; he knows that a state of complete demoralization prevails wherever this abominable traffic is carried on, all sorts of atrocious crimes are committed under cover of the slave trade, and the dagger is often employed as an arbiter to settle the differences and disputes which are of constant occurrence. While I was Captain-General of Cuba, the deaths by small-pox, brought over from Africa, exceeded the number of slaves landed in the same period, so that even there was no increase of population, because less labor was to be had than before. Nor can the Minister be acquainted with the position of the authorities at Havana, destitute as they are of efficient power to stop this trade, or how humiliating it is for the Governors of the island to listen to the complaints of the British Consul about the landing of slaves, sometimes exaggerated, at other times correct. The Spanish authorities have thus to suffer reproaches and indignities which the honor of their country repel. The law is inefficient -- completely inefficient, Neither the Marquis DE LA HABANA, who possesses energy and decision, nor I, who employed as much energy and activity as possible, could put a stop to the trade. The Marquis DE CASTELFLORITE did more than either of us, for he went beyond the law, and yet he was unable to suppress it. If the slave trade is declared piracy, does it give the right to the English to try Spaniards and hang them from the yard-arm? No, for we could make a law by which we alone should have the rigth of trying our countrymen for piracy without the interference of England.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SLAVERY IN THE SPANISH COLONIES.; Interesting Speeches on the Slave Trade in the Colonies Made in the Spanish Senate on the 23d of January, 1865.

It is a misfortune that these materials -- reminiscences, autobiography, letters, documents, &c. -- have not fallen into hands that could make an artistic use of them, instead of being presented crudely to the public, as many of them are of value, and with ordinary constructive skill a portrait of the man and his work might be elaborated from them, that would yield in attraction to scarcely any modern biography. The interest of such a life would extend far beyond the circle to whom the perusal of this work in its present shape will probably be limited. Dr. LYMAN BEECHER, on many accounts, deserves to be held in remembrance. Though the magnetic influence of his eloquence and personal presence has passed away, many institutions and organizations yet feel the impetus originally derived from his vigor and energy; his writings have a large circulation, and members of the remarkable group of children that he, patriarch-like, lived to train up and qualify for mental exertion, are foremost among the leaders of popular opinion at this day, conspicuous through the pen or the pulpit for their hold on the hearts and convictions of men. Never, perhaps, was there a person better adapted for the work that he delighted in than Dr. BEECHER. Fluent and prompt in speech, rejoicing in action, ardent in all his conceptions, and impatient to reduce them to practice, as a pulpit rhetorician and popular reasoner, impressing by vivid argumentation, enriched from boundless stores of illustration -- almost unequaled -- every phase of clerical life found him equipped for its strenuous fulfillment. Until strength failed him, through extreme age, nothing obstructed or retarded his course. He was not a man to be frightened by obstacles, and wherever the scene of action might be -- East or West -- there he was to be found, throwing his whole soul into the performance of the absorbing duty of the moment. The space of time occupied by the volume before us is from 1824 to Dr. BEECHER's death, January, 1863, in his eighty-eighth year. Its opening pages find him still working in a field comparatively narrow for a man of his superabundant energies -- the rural district of Litchfield, in Connecticut. The outward landmarks of his life after this were, his removal to the Hanover Church in Boston, in 1826, his acceptance of the Presidency of Lane Seminary, Ohio, in 1830, and his return to New-England, in 1857. The record of the ceaseless labors -- professional, literary, controversial and social -- that fill up the interval, must be sought in the book itself. To general interest, the second volume is inferior to the first, heavy ecclesiastical matters, documents, &c., overlay the page, with but very little attempt at order or arrangement. As a contribution to the religious history of the last fifty years in New-England, the work has an importance independent of, or rather additional to, its biographical purpose. Some portions are undoubtedly conspicuous for what, in any other family, would be called a singular want of good taste and reticence, on matters of the most private and sacred concern, but as they are made public by the parties themselves, it is evident allowance must be made for strongly marked idiosyncracies of character.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; AUTOBIOGRAPHY, CORRESPONDENCE, &C., OF LYMAN BEECHER, D.D.

One of the interlocutors said: ""Mr. LINCOLN, as SHERMAN's army advances, the rebel forces necessarily concentrate and increase in number. Before long SHERMAN will drive the columns of JOHNSTON, BRAGG, HOKE, and others, within a few days' march of LEE's main army. May not LEE suddenly march south with the bulk of his army, form a junction with JOHNSTON's troops, and, before GRANT can follow any considerable distance, strike SHERMAN's column with superior force, break his lines, defeat his army, and drive his broken fragments back to the coast, and with his whole army give battle to GRANT, and perhaps defeat him?""",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S IDEAS OF THE MILITARY; SITUATION."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S IDEAS OF THE MILITARY; SITUATION."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e5ad63d6-ca11-537f-952f-3263369d718f,286,nyt://article/e5ad63d6-ca11-537f-952f-3263369d718f

The public are looking with anxiety toward the James for stirring intelligence; but whether of war or peace they cannot decide. Meantime the air is full of rumor, which everybody repeats and nobody believes. The official paper at Washington admits the conference on between our leading Generals on the James River, but says that nothing is known of its present or prospective results. Secretary SEWARD, accompanied by the Spanish and British Ministers and a few personal friends, has gone to City Point. It is called a mere pleasure excursion, but the eager public will doubtless insist that it is a new feature in the supposed reopening of peace negotiations. The Richmond journals of Monday have the following paragraphs about the movements of our forces: ""On Thursday a heavy column of the enemy moved down the Jerusalem plank road. This movement is supposed to be a diversion in favor of SHERMAN, made overland for the purpose of striking Weldon, and at the same time destroying the railroad between that point and Stony Creek."" Perhaps this mysterious movement hastened LEE's attempt of Saturday morning. There was nothing from SHERMAN yesterday; according to his own order, his men are having a season of rest. A portion of SHERIDAN's cavalry has ben dismounted.

Under such circumstances DAVIS and LEE, in whom the whole power of the rebels cause is now vested, have a fearful responsibility upon their hands.

The Professor's chief object is to collect facts for the purpose of testing his glacial theory. This theory is, in substance, that at some past period among the geological ages, a very large part of the earth was long covered with two vast caps or saucers of snow and ice, centered at the poles, lapping far down toward the equator, and perhaps in many parts 12,000 or 15,000 feet thick. It is to trace records of their work, or to compare them with the glaciers of to-day that the expedition goes, and it will also make as extensive investigations and bring home as extensive collections as possible, in zoology and other natural sciences. The expense of the trip itself will be defrayed by NATHANIEL THAYER, of Boston, and the preparations, purchase of instruments, &c., were at the cost of the Massachusetts Museum of Comparative Zoology, which is to receive specimens brought home.

We have rarely heard our great pianist to better advantage than on the three evenings of his recent performances. The clearness, delicacy and strength of his style are, in fact, perfect. They have been illustrated, too, in many new pieces. The best of these, the ""Battle-Cry of Freedom,"" was performed for the first time on Wednesday evening. It is an effective arrangement of a well-known patriotic air, and is mainly valuable for the introduction and the quiet variation which precedes the finale. Mr. GOTTSCHALK played this taking morceau with complete gusto, and was encored as usual. At the concert last evening a large portion of CHICKERING & SONS' ware-room was present to wit: six grand pianos. This alarming manifestation was occasioned by the appearance on the programme of the ""Faust"" march arranged for that number of instruments by Mr. GOTTSCHALK, and played by that gentleman and Messrs. SANDERSON, FRADEL, MUZIO, LASSCRUE and TRASTOUR. The effect of this piece may be left to the imagination. It brought down the house, and in truth nearly brought down the entire block. At both these entertainments Miss LUCY SIMONS sang with rare skill, and entirely to the acceptance of the audience. Mr. HARRY SANSERSON contributed also, in a large manner, to the brilliancy of the programme.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9003936-19c7-5c88-ba7d-d71d6925585d,390,nyt://article/d9003936-19c7-5c88-ba7d-d71d6925585d
