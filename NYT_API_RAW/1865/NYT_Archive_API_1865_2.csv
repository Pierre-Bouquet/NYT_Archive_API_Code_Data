These charges have been made not alone by the rebels. We should expect them there. The necessity which has been upon them of using every means to keep up the determination of their people, and their unscrupulousness in the choice of means, made such calumnies upon the Northern people one of the most natural and readiest weapons which they could use. That similar charges should be rife among our enemies abroad is also not surprising. They are further removed and have had less opportunity for actual knowledge of facts, while the atmosphere has been filled with misrepresentations almost as persistent and nearly as effective as those which have poisoned the Southern air. But there have been some counter influences also. Light has been thrown in upon the unwilling darkness.

They are among the ablest and best-informed citizens of the South, and cannot help knowing that both the Government and people were never more determined to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union than they are at the present moment. They must know, moreover, that upon LEE's army at Richmond rests their sole hope of prolonging the contest, -- and that the chances are three to one that LEE cannot maintain himself against the Union forces that are rapidly and resistlessly combining against him.

Strict watch was then kept, and the committee daily conferred one with another until they had gathered information showing conclusively that numerous burglaries which had been committed in Westchester County were the work of a gang whose headquarters were in their midst. The Committee then set themselves to the task of capturing the entire band. It was not desirable to apprehend one or two of the thieves, since their confederates, learning that their den had been discovered, might take flight; and therefore the Committee and officers SLOWEY and MONTGOMERY winked at the thieves' transactions until everything, had been made ready for a descent simultaneously in this city and in Westchester. This was made early in the week, on a warrant which was granted by Judge MEEKS; and AUGUST CHRISTMAN, JOHN FINK, JACOB CUSICK (otherwise ""Dutch CHARLEY,"") JOHN MULLER, JACK ALDER, GEORGE SLONER, PETER SMITH, and three women named MARY JOHNSON, ELLIOTT and MOOLE, were apprehended and taken to White Plains for trial. Several of the prisoners were committed to prison, and others have been admitted to bail. It is alleged that ROBERT CHURCHILL, who was recently shot by an officer, was leader of the gang, and that they held their midnight councils at the abode of Mrs. ELLIOTT, one of the prisoners above named.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GANG OF BURGLARS CAPTURED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GANG OF BURGLARS CAPTURED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06bd9aa8-512b-51ca-bf45-818cfabb0e4c,274,nyt://article/06bd9aa8-512b-51ca-bf45-818cfabb0e4c

Several interviews between our officers and the rebel officers had been held under flag of truce, and it was generally understood that the absence of Gen. GRANT from City Point accounted for the delay in granting the so-called Commissioners permission to pass the lines.

We can conceive of no reason on which these petitions can possibly be based, except a prevailing, but ill-grounded fear, that a bankrupt measure which should afford relief to insolvent traders residing in the loyal States would necessarily carry absolution to dishonest and disloyal traders residing in the South. If this were a valid reason in itself for defeating the bill as it now stands, one would think that an easy way of depriving Secessionists of the benefit of the measure would be to make its operation exceptional in their particular case, instead of denying its benefits to the large loyal community among us here whose insolvency, in a vast number of cases, is primarily due to secession. By refusing to make the measure retroactive, a disability upon the Northern trader is maintained. But that in no degree affects the liability or non-liability of the Southern trader for debts contracted prior to the rebellion epoch. Refusing to legislate at all in bankruptcy, or passing a law merely prospective in its operation, leaves the rebel or Southern merchant precisely where he is left to-day, by the old State laws, or by the confiscation enactments of the so-called Confederate Congress, which professed to outlaw all the debts owing to loyal citizens of the United States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Bankrupt Bill Southern Statutes of Limitation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Bankrupt Bill Southern Statutes of Limitation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5673c18-77c7-5b78-88b4-382c53618f0c,805,nyt://article/a5673c18-77c7-5b78-88b4-382c53618f0c

The rooms there selected were formally opened yesterday, and consecrated to the service of Oil, and the event was deemed of such interest as to call forth several speeches in glorification of Petroleum. The magnates of this great and growing interest, assembled at the Exchange at noon, and before the meeting was called to order, entered into social converse and discussion concerning oil, wells, derricks, steam-engines, pumping-wells, spouting-wells, gas, &c. From the talk of the members of the new Exchange, a stranger would conclude that the glories of ancient Greece were nothing to the grease of modern times. Some oleaginous HOMER must arise to sing its story, its romance, and its reality. The oil men are largely given to painting in their favorite product bright-clouded pictures of its future. They depict it mounting the throne of the defunct King Cotton, and swaying the sceptre of commerce over the universe. They point to it as an instance of the compensating laws and overruling of Providence, which supplies the wants of man from new and unseen resources when the old ones fall. Three years ago, the world in general and New-Bedford in particular, lamented the scarcity of whales and the decadence of the fisheries. Now, Titusville has taken the place of New-Bedford, and is the centre of light. But however the members of the Petroleum Exchange may be given to praise of oil, it is undeniable that the oil interest has become one of the largest in this country.

It will be remembered that on the 25th of February, 1862, an act was passed by Congress exempting United States Bonds from taxation, and, availing themselves of the provisions of this law, the city banks and insurance companies refused to pay the demands of the Tax Commissioners for the assessment on such portion of their capital as was invested in these securities. The banks that refused payment of the taxes imposed were the Atlantic, Bank of Commerce, National, American Exchange, Continental, Hanover, Shoe and Leather, Importers' and Traders', Irving, Mechanics', Mechanics' Banking Association, Mercantile, Ocean, Tradesmen's and Union, the total amount of taxes due from these banks being $256,355 86. In the meantime, the Board of Supervisors applied to the Legislature for an act specially empowering them to levy a tax on the capital of Banks and Insurance Companies, and a bill to that effect having been passed by the Legislature, a number of the Banks and Insurance Companies came forward and paid the Tax Commissioner's demands. Twenty Banks however, and fifteen Insurance Companies persisted in refusing payment, and carried their cases to the Court of Appeals.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The State Tax on the Capitals of Banks and Insurance Companies.; THE AMOUNTS LEVIED TO BE RETURNED THREE MILLIONS TO BE ADDED TO THIS YEAR'S TAX LEVY."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The State Tax on the Capitals of Banks and Insurance Companies.; THE AMOUNTS LEVIED TO BE RETURNED THREE MILLIONS TO BE ADDED TO THIS YEAR'S TAX LEVY."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-02-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6f81295-9902-5164-9670-09e92ba38cda,804,nyt://article/f6f81295-9902-5164-9670-09e92ba38cda

She was in superb voice, and threw into the role of Zaida all that subdued intensity which belongs to the best school of Italian art, but is exhibited us but rarely on the American stage. Sig. MASSIMILIANI's rentree is memorable for the fact that it marks a distinct improvement in his style. His manner is no longer indifferent. He acts. In the ritornelli, which are embarrassing to the best dramatic artists, he succeeded last evening in giving a bearable idea of the emotion -- or change of emotion -- intended by the composer, and throughout he exhibited strength, individuality, and even power. We record these facts with pleasure, because the defect of Signor MASSIMILIANI's style, so far, has been a lack of warmness and identification with the character he was interpreting.

The map is known as ""Mitchell's Map,"" was made in 1755, and is the only one of the kind in this country. It is the one upon which the boundary question between the United States and Great Britain was settled. After some further business, the President introduced Mr. F.B. HOUGH, Superintendent of the State Census of 1855, who read a historical sketch of the census in New-York, and a statement of the plan of the census to be taken in this State during the present year. He commenced with a review of the census in colonial times, mentioned the alterations and improvements made since, the introduction of Agricultural Statistics in 1821, the great improvement made in 1850 of giving the name of each person; said that in 1855 the State had adopted the Federal system of taking the census, with additional columns for the material and value of dwellings. The census was then arranged by the Secretary of State and Marshals appointed by him to the number of 1,744, it being the intention to appoint one to each election district. That law is still in existence, and that will be the basis of the coming census, except that large election districts will be subdivided. Each enumerator in the country will have a population of about 2,000 persons, and in the city about 3,000. To do this it will be necessary to appoint about 2,500 enumerators. The most serious obstacle which lies in the way of taking a full census, is, that by many it is believed to be in some way connected with military matters or with taxation. The only remedy for this is an official statement that it is required by the State law, under the constitution, and that it has no connection in any way with either of these matters; and in order to relieve the collectors of information from all, even seeming, connection with draft or taxation, they will be called Enumerators instead of Marshals. The principal improvements recommended in 1865 are as follows: The ages of persons under five years of age will be reported by months; the place of employment, if different from the residence of the family; a separate table of information concerning deaf, dumb, blind, idiots, &c., and all facts connected with them; an inquiry as to all who are now or have been in the army or navy, their original position, promotions and present positions, or if they have left the service, whether wounded, sick, or in what condition; the statistics of marriage, same as in 1855, except that the names of both parties will be given, and how the ceremony was performed, whether by a clergyman or by civil authorities; death statistics, same as in 1855, except to give name of party deceased; agricultural statistics same as in 1855, except that in each crop, the number of acres planted the previous year and now in crop, will be inquired into, and the yield of the present year; a special inquiry will be made regarding epidemics among domestic animals; the manufacturing statistics will be given the same as in 1855, except that particular blanks will be given for great manufacturers, and particular blanks will be given, also, for all institutions, orphan asylums, &c. At the conclusion of the lecture, a vote of thanks was passed to Mr. HOUGH, and a request for a copy of the paper, to be deposited in the archives of the society, alter which the meeting adjourned.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""American Geographical and Statistical Society.; INTERESTING PARTICULARS OF THE COMING CENSUS.

Its Importance to Rebels,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/04/archives/wilmington-and-charleston.html,Its Importance to Rebels,"However dim and dubious may be the prospects of peace through the negotiations at Fortress Monroe, the most cheering hopes may certainly be entertained as to the prospects of peace through victory in the field. SHERMAN's South Carolina campaign is, and has for some time been, in active progress. It has not been as rapid as the public expected it would be, when his right wing first moved out from Savannah; but it has been quite as rapid as the local and military conditions would permit. The topography of the country in Northern Georgia made SHERMAN's Atlanta campaign sufficiently difficult; the topography of the country around Richmond makes campaigning there exceedingly difficult, as has been attested by half a dozen Generals, successively, in command of the Army of the Potomac. But we suppose that if we could denote the most difficult locality in the whole land for military operations, it would be precisely the region surrounding Charleston, for a distance of forty miles. It is bottomless swamp, tangled brake, inextricable jungle -- a region of that amphibious character which marks so much of the Southern coast -- the raveled and unfinished ends of nature's web, where sea and land keep up a natural warfare. Military men have always considered it virtually impossible to move an army with its heavy guns and great wagon trains through this section. The small movement made by SHERMAN from Pocotaligo toward Charleston ten days ago, had to be turned back because of the impossibility of getting through the swamp; and we are sure that nothing could more astonish those acquainted with the locality than a successful military march along the railroad to Charleston.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Wilmington and Charleston.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Wilmington and Charleston.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Wilmington', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/750341bd-dde3-594c-bae0-3ef31f04178c,655,nyt://article/750341bd-dde3-594c-bae0-3ef31f04178c

DIX, Commander of the Department of the East, for the purpose of checking the rapidly increasing crime of desertion. A perfect system of bounty-jumping has been adopted by recruits, until it has become a serious evil, which the authorities have resolved to stop. The accused, JAMES DEVLIN, was about thirty years of age, of compact, well-built form, and five feet nine inches high. His features were full, and his complexion dark, with a sensual face.

Gen. PAREGA has been dispatched to Lima to offer the Peruvians the alternative of war or submission; while a bill to repeal the law of 1861 incorporating the territory of the Dominican Republic with the Spanish monarchy, has been introduced into the Cortes by the Minister, who, if it passes, will be armed with the power necessary to give the new ordinance effect, and then the Spanish troops will be withdrawn from the island, and the Dominicans will be left to the enjoyment of their former liberty. But though this measure is creditable to NARVAEZ, it is, nevertheless, quite evident from the preamble to the new bill that the Premier abandons the idea of re-annexing San Domingo with the greatest reluctance, and that the natives will stand indebted for their future autonomy and freedom rather to the dangers and difficulties of the enterprise, than to the moderation and magnanimity of Spain.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain and San Domingo.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain and San Domingo.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/064cda2b-b804-581a-a040-abcbdfdcfefb,658,nyt://article/064cda2b-b804-581a-a040-abcbdfdcfefb

There is manifest injustice in the charges brought against DAVIS by his irresponsible opponents. The head and front of his guilt is that he took part in the rebellion at all; that he assumed the principal official position in an organization whose object was to overthrow the Government of our common country; and not that he has failed to conduct the insurrection successfully to its end. History will give him no credit for profound wisdom, neither will it pronounce him a fool, as do the rebel editors. He, in common with all those who instigated rebellion, was unable to forecast its inevitable ruin. He and they alike miscalculated the value of the elements in their favor and the stability of the Government against which they lifted treasonable hands. The foresight which they lacked was within the scope of human reason, and was exercised by that statesman who, in the Georgia Legislature, denounced the crime that was about to be committed and predicted the blight which must follow. Men who thus madly undertake revolutions are known in history as political adventurers. Thus will DAVIS and his compeers be known. But they will also be known as men who well understood themselves and their own aspirations; who knew upon what they might calculate, though they miscalculated, and what they must count out; and who, in an ill-advised war, had yet a remarkably well-advised scheme for its conduct, when considered in relation to the proposed end. Where all schemes must have failed, this was more consistent and promised more than any other.

The Condition of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/05/archives/the-condition-of-savannah.html,The Condition of,"The news from Savannah, published in Friday's issue of the TIMES, is not exactly of that rose-colored character which marked the reports immediately succeeding the surrender of the city to Gen. SHERMAN. And yet, we think, both the citizens and the military that garrisoned Savannah, may be cordially congratulated on this most important matter, that the former have shown no disposition to thwart the purposes of the National authorities, and that the latter have not only been careful not to infringe upon the rights of non-militants, but have, thus far, endeavored to deal leniently with their prejudices. The city has been the scene of a great disaster, due, no doubt, to incendiaries, prompted and paid by secret rebel agents. A large portion of the city has suffered from a fearful conflagration. Two hundred and fifty houses -- of the smaller class, we assume -- were burnt down almost simultaneously with the arrival of the friendly offering of provisions, sent from New-York and other Northern cities. The calamity, it seems, was further aggravated by the explosion of a rebel arsenal within the city, whose contents, by some unaccountable oversight or neglect, were left undisturbed after the city was surrendered to our troops. No doubt the whole thing was the work of some rebel plotter; but if it could be conscientiously shown that proper precautions were taken by the loyal force now garrisoning the city, against the evil which has befallen it, we could learn, without any excessive alarm, that Savannah, even now, to-day, harbors a large number of professional incendiaries, intent upon reducing the place to ashes. New-York, at this hour, harbors hundreds of the same class. Why should they not be counted by the score in a town barely six weeks released from rebel bondage? Even were the leaders of the rebellion to surrender to-morrow, and peace to be proclaimed before the season of Lent commences, it would be but reasonable to expect that hordes of desperate rebel ruffians would, for a time, have full swing to prey and to plunder in many parts of the South. We are, therefore, not disposed to magnify into undue importance this incendiary plot in Savannah. Its worst feature is, that it does not appear to have been in the remotest degree a matter of forecast by the loyal military authorities.

I saw him for the first time in August, 1813, more than a half century ago, on my examination for admission to Harvard College. I was then 12 years old, he 19. He was, at the time, the college tutor of the Latin language, and for one quarter at Cambridge our class read with him the first books of LIVY. A marvelous account of the ability he had displayed in the four years of his student's life, his undisputed reputation as the best scholar that had been graduated within the traditions of that day, a grave, and sedate, and earnest manner, a sanctity of appearance, that made him in youth an object of veneration, gave him over our class an influence such as no other instructor exercised. In a few weeks he was invited to take the place left vacant by the lamented BUCKMINSTER, and at the end of the term he bade us an affectionate farewell. I remember to this day the aspect of holiness which he wore, as he made us a parting speech, full of the best counsels and exhortations. In the pulpit his manner at that time was more sober and calm and solemn than at any later period. Crowds thronged to hear him; he loved occasionally to treat subjects of critical learning; the oldest doctors in the temple were amazed at his skill in disputation; and the young of both sexes hung with delight on his fervid but chaste and modest eloquence.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EDWARD EVERETT.; BY GEORGE BANCHOFT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EDWARD EVERETT.; BY GEORGE BANCHOFT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the New-York Ledger', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab3cb8f4-9812-5ff4-bac6-8aae5bbee17c,5231,nyt://article/ab3cb8f4-9812-5ff4-bac6-8aae5bbee17c

During the week 43 were admitted, 64 were discharged as cured or relieved, and 8 died. The hospital library, of which Dr. JOHN L. VANDER VOOET is librarian, has recently been enriched by the addition of about six hundred rare old medical works, the bequest of the late Dr. JOHN WATSON, who was for many years an attending surgeon in the institution. The library now contains about eight thousand volumes. One thing further is needed by the institution to make it one of the finest hospitals in the land, namely, the appropriation of from $12,000 to $20,000 which the Legislature annually made toward its support before the beginning of the war, or rather, before certain gentlemen of a speculative turn cast longing eyes upon the hospital lots. It is alleged -- and there would appear to be a degree of plausibility in the allegation -- that a number of gentlemen, who are desirous of purchasing the eligibly-situated hospital property with a view to the erection of extensive warehouses, have interposed objections to the annual appropriation by the Legislature, hoping that by withdrawing State aid from the institution they might compel the Board of Governors to sell their edifice of revolutionary memory and erect a new building on one of their lots up town. And so the Legislative appropriations have been withheld for several years past. But the Board of Governors, with public spirit which ought to endear them to every New-Yorker, resolved that there should be a hospital down town, where it may be, as it has so long been, useful; and they have thus far made their resolution good by contributions of from $5,000 to $10,000 annually from their private means. The city, also, formerly contributed liberally; but the same influences which are said to have operated in withdrawing Legislative aid stepped in between the hospital and city government; and the result has been that hundreds of pauper patients whom the hospital admitted in other days have necessarily been sent, at great expense to the city, far over to Bellevue Hospital, on the east side of the town. The hospital records show that four-fifths of the accidents that are reported occur south of Broome-street. Nearly all of the Broadway stage accidents are reported below that street. Our stages, prolific of accidents, centre below Canals and the railway lines, which are supplanting the stages, and which promise to yield more hospital cases than the stages ever yielded, all centre not half a mile from the New-York hospital. And here it occurs to us that the railways, which enjoy very valuable franchises at the hands of the city, and which may do so much toward filling our hospitals, might not improperly be called upon to aid in supporting a hospital institution down town. Suppose that gentlemen of the Sente[???] Assembly, when our city railroads apply for those privileges which the Legislature alone can grant, required the directors to appropriate a small percentage of their surplus profits toward sustaining the New-York Hospital.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-York Hospital.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-York Hospital.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9a857a6-b196-5a0b-a276-e333c3e8f388,508,nyt://article/d9a857a6-b196-5a0b-a276-e333c3e8f388

"Atlantic, Plans and Prospects of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/05/archives/the-atlantic-telegraph.html,"Atlantic, Plans and Prospects of","On Thursday, the somewhat tedious process was commenced of shipping a portion of submarine cable which has been made for this great undertaking, from the works at Greenwich on board the hulk Iris, for transference to the Medway, and final stowage in the tanks of the Great Eastern. The shipment was began early in the morning, and will continue without intermission now until nearly the end of May, by which time it is hoped all will be coiled away snugly on board the great steamship. The total quantity of rope required to connect Valentia with Bull's Bay, Newfoundland, allowing for the ""slack"" which must run out to prevent too great a strain on the cable, is about 2,300 nautical, or nearly 2,700 statute, miles. With this length a liberal margin is given of nearly 600 statute miles of rope for slack caused by currents, possible rough weather and the avoidance of anything like unusual strain on the cable in the deepest water. Over one part of the route the depth is as great as from 2,000 to 2,500 fathoms, or nearly three statute miles -- a depth, however, which is only considered of moment in case of rough weather in paying out the mere strength of the cable being sufficient to bear its own weight in eleven miles of still water. In this respect, as, indeed, in all others, the new cable has an enormous superiority over the old and ill-used rope which was first laid, and which, to the amazement of all those who knew its real condition, nevertheless remained in fair working order for a few days. If such unexpected results were obtained from the old cable, which the advancement of electrical science since then shows to have been thoroughly ill-adapted for its purpose, it is not over sanguine to enterprise, every step in the conduct of which has been marked with the most jealous care, not only to guard against the dangers known to exist, but against other emergencies which experience shows may arise, but which five years ago were unknown. In size, in strength, in better condition, better insulation, and better outer covering, the new rope is never less than three times as good as the old one, while in many cases, and these the most important, its superiority is four or five times greater. Though a much larger cable, its weight in water per mile is less than half that of its unfortunate predecessor, its breaking strain is 7 3/4 tons, against 3 1/4 tons, the maximum strength of the old rope. The method of joining up the two-mile lengths in which it is constructed is also a great improvement upon the soldered joints in the wires of the first cable, while the standards for insulation and ""conductivity"" are as high as those devised for the Persian Gulf cable, and the tests are continuous in every portion of the manufacture. Nearly 900 miles of the cable have already been made, and are beautifully coiled away in the large tanks in the Telegraph Construction Company's works, lately those of Messrs. GLASS & ELLIOT. Fifteen hundred nautical miles have yet to be manufactured to complete the tale, exclusive of the shore ends, which will be most massive, and in length some 30 miles. The factory now turns out 14 miles a day of completed rope, which in four months' time will give 1,350 miles, at the present rate of working -- though, of course, as the days grow longer, so in proportion will the hours of labor. It is considered, therefore, that the work would be well advanced if 2,000 miles had to be completed, instead of 1,500. Two hulks have been placed at the disposal of the company by the Admiralty -- the Iris and the Amethyst. As soon as the Iris, now off the works, is filled with her quantum of 250 miles, she will be towed down to the Great Eastern, and the Amethyst will take her place, and in this manner, for the next four months, the shipment of the cable will be continuous. The cable is wound on board these hulks at the rate of a little over two miles an hour, and, as the days are short, and there is little night work, the rate of shipment is not much ahead of the rate of manufacture. During this winding on board the hulks, as during every other process, the tests for insulation and ""conductivity"" are continued with the same scrupulous care.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, Jan. 21', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Jan', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f09bca15-4d22-5a8e-9342-1ac289fa481d,1360,nyt://article/f09bca15-4d22-5a8e-9342-1ac289fa481d

12 years in Kentucky Jail,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/06/archives/local-intelligence-twelve-years-in-a-kentucky-jail-sufferings-for.html,12 years in Kentucky Jail,"Rev. CALVIN FAIRBANK, who was for more than twelve years confined in the Kentucky State Penitentiary for the crime of assisting a slave woman to escape from bondage, delivered a very interesting lecture last evening in Shiloh Church. Mr. FAIRBANK commenced by relating the circumstances under which he was arrested. He said that his father died in Lexington, Ky., in 1849, and that he visited that State in the Fall of 1851, for the purpose of removing the remains. On the 2d of November a young slave woman appealed to him for help to escape from her master, which he granted by secreting her, and at night removing her beyond the reach of her enemies. On the 9th of November, while on his way in church in Jeffersonville, Indiana, he was assaulted by three irresponsible persons from Kentucky, one being the owner of the fugitive, and without requisition from the Executive of Kentucky, was forcibly taken from Indiana to Louisville, Ky. On the 24th of November, he was arraigned before a police court on a charge of aiding a slave to escape to a free State, and held to bail in the sum of $5,000, in default of which he was thrown into jail, where he was heavily ironed. On the 21st of December Attorney ROSSEAU (now General) made affidavit before the Circuit Court concerning the absence of witnesses, and the case was postponed to the 23d of February, when an attempt was made to further postpone the case until May. The postponement being resisted by the District-Attorney, the court ordered a hearing for the 25th. On the day of trial the case was called, and no witnesses appearing for the defence, the accused was compelled to go to trial without them, though legal summons had been issued to rescue their attendance. Mr. FAIRBANKS was summarily tried and convicted, and sentenced to a term of fifteen years' hard labor in the penitentiary. On the 9th day of March he was incarcerated, and remained in confinement until the 15th day of April last, a period of over twelve years, when he was pardoned by Lieut.-Gov. R.T. JACOB, then acting as Governor, in absence of Gov. BRAMLETTE. The lecturer spoke of his treatment while in prison, and gave a vivid description of his privations and sufferings. He stated that during his confinement he was put to tasks beyond his ability, and for failure to perform them was frequently whipped, receiving during his imprisonment over thirty-five thousand stripes. The speaker concluded by saying that ""the force of public sentiment in dissolving the bonds of the slave has dissolved mine.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE; Twelve Years in a Kentucky Jail Sufferings for the Slave.LECTURE BY REV.

The act in question, so far from having been desired by the thinking Statesman of England at the time, was passed through Parliament with the greatest difficulty; the King in his usual peremptory way ordering Lord NORTH to have the measure become law at all hazards, and to have care taken that those who voted against it should be specially marked for exclusion from the Royal Drawing Rooms. The bill was passed under this pressure, as many other bills were passed at the time, in defiance of whatever liberal opinion had a voice in Parliament. There was, however, one mitigating clause in the Act. The Prince or Princess desiring to marry had a right of appeal from the disapproval of the Sovereign to the Privy Council On giving this notice of appeal the royal person interested might marry twelve months thereafter, unless Parliament in the interim passed a law expressly prohibiting the proposed alliance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PRINCESS MARY OF ENGLAND, AND THE; ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PRINCESS MARY OF ENGLAND, AND THE; ROYAL MARRIAGE ACT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f2a799ed-9f5a-5e04-b9f7-bcebd1215364,580,nyt://article/f2a799ed-9f5a-5e04-b9f7-bcebd1215364

DAVIS which will decide whether it is a failure or not;"" that ""the Government gives out that it has been a failure for reasons of its own;"" that ""the meeting at Fortress Monroe has materially hastened the day of reunion,"" must work mischief and only mischief if the public pays the slightest heed to them. They are evidently manufactured in the hotels and bar-rooms of Washington -are the veriest tattle of the most scatterbrained and untrustworthy loungers served up as startling political news. The currency which this sort of stuff has had now for some days has already had a most unfortunate effect on the public mind. It has excited false hopes, spread apathy about the war, paralyzed the work of recruiting, and, in fact, accomplished in a limited degree the very object which, in our opinion, DAVIS desired that the peace movement should accomplish, viz: the slackening of those exertions on our part to prosecute military operations through the Winter, from which the Confederacy has so much to fear, and which it now witnesses for the first time.

Claim to extend Fair,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/07/archives/the-goodyear-patent-extension-the.html,Claim to extend Fair,"family of the late CHARLES GOODYEAR have petitioned Congress for a further extension of the celebrated patent for vulcanizing india-rubber. The grounds upon which this extension is asked, we are informed, are the following: Mr. GOODYEAR devoted twenty-seven years to the investigation of the properties of india-rubber, during which, he made the discovery from which the greater part of the india-rubber manufactured in the civilized world is now founded. The business employs, in the United States alone, about fifty thousand persons, and yields an annual revenue to the Government, in duties and taxes, of about three quarters of a million. But, while creating this vast and important business, GOODYEAR was involved in immense expenses in defending his rights against infringement, and in applying the material to new uses. Consequently, he died insolvent, leaving a wife and six children without provision. His heirs represent that it was his devotion to the development of his discovery, from which the public derive great advantages, that prevented his reaping the pecuniary reward which the patent law was designed to secure to inventors. The claim of this family to a fair hearing seems unquestionable, and, we trust, they will have it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GOODYEAR PATENT EXTENSION.

Paid and Volunteer,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/07/archives/a-paid-fire-department-this-evening-a.html,Paid and Volunteer,"statement is to be laid before the Legislature at Albany, in which a pointed comparison is drawn between the economy of our Fire Department and those of other American and European cities. We cannot, at the moment, vouch for every one of the ""facts"" advanced in this memorial, but such as they are, they demand the attention of every tax-payer of the city. It is alleged in the memorial that we have here in New-York one hundred and twenty-five houses to maintain for the accommodation of the engines, hose-carriages, and men belonging to the Fire Department; that these houses are kept up at an annual expense of $10,000 each, making an investment in the first instance of $1,250,000. The annual interest and taxes on this make up a sum of $112,500, to which has to be added the annual appropriation for repairs and so forth, making in all an expenditure of $628,000. Even with all this outlay, we are told, the rates of insurance are far higher here than in Cincinnati, where the expenses of the Fire department, even taking population into account, are barely one-third those of New-York. Compared with Boston, our rates of insurance are found to be double what they ought to be, and four times greater than those of London, which has a population four times that of New-York, crowded mostly into narrow streets, and covering an area of about sixty square miles. But the contrast becomes still more startling as between London and New-York, when we find that the cost of the Fire Department of London is little more than one-eighth that of this city, or about $75,000 annually.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT.

His general temper, never, perhaps, too sweet and gentle, ought to be considerably mollified by the assurance that the war must still go on. In common with a good many other opponents of the Administration, he seems to have been greatly exasperated of late by the efforts of the President to ascertain whether peace was possible without sacrificing the object for which the war is waged -- the integrity of the Union. We do not suppose that the result of these endeavors will soften his indignation against Mr. LINCOLN for having made them, but it may do something toward healing the wound which the possibility of peace was likely to make incurable. Mr. WADE, and those who sympathize with him, can rest easy in their minds. There is no immediate danger of peace. It is now quite certain that the rebels are not prepared to surrender. They are preparing to fight with new vigor and to make fresh sacrifices in the attempt to destroy the Union. We shall have more battles, more taxes, more drafts, -- quite enough of all, we are sorry to believe, to satisfy the patriotic rapacity even of those who have come to love war for its own sake, because it gratifies certain resentments and hatreds in their natures, which have long since overborne their love of the Union and their regard for the Constitution of our common country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'President Lincoln and the Peace Con- ference.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'President Lincoln and the Peace Con- ference.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc2daccb-5c64-5ab2-869b-704a6808694a,943,nyt://article/fc2daccb-5c64-5ab2-869b-704a6808694a

The Second Corps took up its line of march in a westerly direction, on the Vaughan road, to a point about a mile across Hatcher's Run, the scene of several former engagements, where a strong line of the enemy's breastworks was developed. The Second Division of the Second Corps, under Gen. SMYTHE, before reaching Hatcher's Ran, turned to the right, advanced in a northwesterly direction, but before going more than three-quarters of a mile, the enemy were discovered in a strong position and in considerable force, four divisions of Gen. GORDON's corps bring reported in the vicinity. Our troops threw up some slight breastworks, and at 11 o'clock P.M. the rebel la [???]ies opened for the purpose of feeling our lines. Soon afterward the rebels advanced their infantry to the attack in regular line of battle, with a heavy skirmish line, and charged across the fields in the style, but were at once driven back by a galling fire of musketry from our men. The attack was renewed several times, but the enemy suffered a severe repulse with every attack. An effort was then made to turn our right flank, but it was completely foiled by Col. MURPHY's brigade of Gen. SMYTHE's division, who caused the rebels to suffer severely, and finally compelled them to abandon the attempt to break our lines. During the day the Fifth Corps captured a large rebel commissary train. Our entire loss for the day did not exceed one hundred.

The Report on; Colored Troops; Troops and the Petersburg Mine,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/08/archives/the-mine-under-the-rebel-works-at-petersburgh.html,The Report on; Colored Troops; Troops and the Petersburg Mine,"We venture to say that the authorized abstract of the Congressional report on the Petersburgh Mine disaster, sent yesterday to the Associated Press, will challenge no common share of attention hereafter in the history of the war. What the report itself, in the fullness of its wisdom may be, we cannot presume to say, until we are favored with a complete copy of it. But the sum of the story, as it comes to us by telegraph, demands attention. The mine in question was due to the genius of Lieut.-Col. PLEASANTS, of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers -- the mining being mainly done by this regiment. The enterprise had the express approval of Gen. BURNSIDE, from which it is to be inferred that, in entering on his task, Col. PLEASANTS acted under the direct authority of the officer in question. The work took a little more than a month for its completion. It was then submitted to the judgment of Gen. MEADE, with a recommendation from Gen. BURNSIDE that an enterprise of so daring and hazardous a character ought to be intrusted to colored troops. Gen. MEADE, no doubt remembering that from Blenheim to Bunker Hill the white race had now and again distinguished itself by considerable prowess, suggested to his subordinate that the negroes had never been under fire, and that if there was danger of an extraordinary character to be gone through, it would be only fair to put the experienced white soldier in the forefront, so that the Commanding-General might not be liable to the charge of indifference to the lives of the black soldiers. In this view the Lieutenant-General, as might be expected, at once concurred. It seems, however, that Gen. GRANT subsequently expressed the opinion, that as the project was Gen. BURNSIDE's, and as he had drilled certain colored regiments for the special purpose of carrying it out, it might have been better if that officer had been allowed to take his own way in matters of detail as well as in the general scope of his enterprise.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mine Under the Rebel works at Petersburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mine Under the Rebel works at Petersburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4565057a-1af1-52c5-8717-d196b15fb183,522,nyt://article/4565057a-1af1-52c5-8717-d196b15fb183

Cost. >amp;c.,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/08/archives/the-public-printing.html,Cost. >amp;c.,"Not the least interesting of the annual reports ordered by Congress is that which has just been issued from the Washington Printing Bureau. The rebellion had been conceived, but scarcely brought forth, when the joint resolution of Congress was passed which authorized the establishment of a public printing-office and bindery; and since then the influences operating toward the derangement of all sorts of industrial enterprise have necessarily been felt, in as great a degree in this department of public labor as elsewhere. Indeed, it may be doubted whether, looking to the scope of business, which the public printing has embraced during the past four years, as compared with that of the fat contract era, there is yet room to form an entirely satisfactory comparison between the system now in operation, and that which has been abolished. This, we assume, would hold good, even if all the material that enters into the furnishing and working of a complete public printing office and bindery had not changed its value to such a degree as it has.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Public Printing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Public Printing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e6522e5-b7aa-573d-9b7b-08378c8861b8,685,nyt://article/4e6522e5-b7aa-573d-9b7b-08378c8861b8

The convictions and instincts of the nation but foretell the decision of history, that the day on which that great act of emancipation becomes law, is only second to one other day -- the birth-day of the Republic. For, when that new provision is incorporated in the Constitution, the proclamation of human rights contained in our Declaration of Independence has become embodied utterly in our organic law. All men under the American flag are then ""free"" and ""equal"" in the sight of the law. A race is forever emancipated. The last stain on our political Constitution is wiped away. Freedom under the great Republic means freedom for all races, colors and classes. The ideas which inspired our heroic Fathers have at length borne their full fruit, and universal liberty is installed under the Constitution. Indeed, we may, without exaggeration, say more, that that day or that year when slavery is forever abolished by the highest law on American soil, is, like the era of Magna Charta, or of the Reformation, or the emancipation in the West Indies, one of the great epochs in human history, to which the respect and admiration of mankind will return for many centuries to come.

W. L. McDonald; a Newark Rebel,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/08/archives/a-nawark-rebel.html,W. L. McDonald; a Newark Rebel,"WILLIAM LAWRENCE MCDONALD, who figures in the papers as the rebel agent in Canada, and the leading spirit in the Chesapeake, St. Albans, and New-York hotel-burning affairs, was formerly a resident of this city and of Orange, where he has relatives and is well known. He was a steamboat Captain on the Mississippi River for ten years, and became largely acquainted with Southern people. In 1860, he associated with Mr. B.M. WHITLOCK, (his brother-in-law,) in the carriage business, and opened a Southern repository at No. 514 Broadway, in New-York City. His trade, which had been almost exclusively with the South, having been shut off by the war, he became a most bitter and consistent partisan of the rebels. Having become heavily indebted to Mr. GREEN, carriage-maker in this city, ""Larry,"" as he is familiarly called, tendered his services to him to pay his obligations, and on the former gentleman being appointed sutler to the Twenty-sixth Regiment, he accompanied him to Virginia. After the first stock of goods had been sold, LARRY came North and purchased $2,000 worth of goods for Mr. GREEN, and, on his return to Virginia, deliberately drove them into the rebel lines, where they were, of course, confiscated. While in Richmond, as is since ascertained, he lived in luxury, affiliating with all the rebel leaders, giving them information as to the number and position of our forces, and other valuable facts. He was then released on a pretended parole, and came to this city, and while visiting his wife at Westchester, New-York, learned that his exploits had been divulged to the War Department, and detectives were after him. He immediately shipped as a sailor on a schooner for New-Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the authorities. MCDONALD is about forty years of age, and a native of Canada, but came to Orange when very young, ""GUS"" MCDONALD, a brother of the above, who also lived in Orange, but recently a resident of New-York, is in custody on a charge of harboring the incendiaries while they were in that city. -- Newark Advertiser.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NAWARK REBEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NAWARK REBEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d90f2e6-a957-52db-b125-190fccc4944d,349,nyt://article/9d90f2e6-a957-52db-b125-190fccc4944d

There has always been somebody who had it ""on the best authority,"" that it had been fully decided on, and generally he has been able to fix the precise number of days, inside which it would happen, and it is somewhat remarkable that this has generally been thirty or a multiple of thirty, say sixty or ninety. There has, however, from the outset, never been the slightest warrant, beyond the suspicion of people who knew nothing of the policy of either of these Powers, and were incapable of framing any rational calculation about it, for the supposition that either France or England would depart in this matter from the established usage. What that usage is was very clearly set forth in the letters of ""Historicus,"" and his statement of it is very well known to meet with the entire concurrence of the English cabinet, and, we have very little doubt, with that of France also. It is simply this, that no rebels are entitled to recognition as a separate and established nation, no matter how strong the probability may appear of their final triumph, as long as the Government against which they have risen continues to make serious efforts for their subjugation. This rule has grown up in the interest of peace and order, and its observance is urged by considerations of the same nature. Every Power owes it to its neighbors, as a matter of courtesy, to regard every revolt against its authority as likely to fail, until it has itself admitted its success by the abandonment of all attempts to suppress it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebellion and the Law of Recognition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebellion and the Law of Recognition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/312a2c74-774e-502f-b7b0-0dc3ca6579c8,850,nyt://article/312a2c74-774e-502f-b7b0-0dc3ca6579c8

They were not the best-humored multitude that ever gathered under the Astor's hospitable roof; they had been outrageously cheated, and they did not care to conceal their feelings; but as nothing was to be gained by reiterating curses upon the heads of the bounty-brokerage banditti, and as Col. BAKER had done them a favor rather than otherwise, in exposing and exploding the enlistment frauds, they were disposed to treat him quite courteously. He, however, could do nothing for them; he could exhibit the official records of the York-street Naval Rendezvous and of the Governor's Island office, showing what enlistment papers were genuine and what fictitious, and that was all. He dared not undertake to say whether the Government would require them to supply soldiers in lieu of the thousands that its agents on Governor's Island have aided in deserting; but he felt assured that Gen.

DRAPER delivered an instructive lecture on Thursday evening at the rooms of the Historical Society -- the first of a series on ""The Historical Influence of Natural Causes."" The subject of last evening's address was ""The influence of Climate."" The lecturer introduced his subject by a comprehensive review of the steady advancement of civilization. He said that everything is influenced by physical agents, and the progress of humanity is guided by immutable laws. The laws of nature, acting under physical influence, hold a dominating control over all living things. HUMBOLDT's essay on plants first drew the attention of the world to the influence of climate over vegetables. The climate regulates the nature of the plants and trees, and if anything should occur to change the climate of the zones, the vegetable life would likewise change. The influence of changes of temperature is seen when we examine plants of the same species in different climates. Instead of offering any resistance to change, the vegetable creation hopelessly yields. The lecturer said the color and form of man oscillates between two extremes, the effect of climate. The one extreme is dark, the other fair, with intermediate grades. The form of the skull also changes. No race will hold its own and experience changes of climate but will descend or advance. That climate does change men is seen in the Jews, who come of a common stock. In northern Europe they are fair, with blue eyes, while in Palestine they are tawney, and in Malaga, almost black.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Historical Influence of Natural Causes.; LECTURE BY PROF.

CAMPER, who is said to have served twenty-seven years in State Prison, and to have acquired the grammar of several spoken languages while there, is described as one of the most accomplished counterfeiters in the country. His workmanship is really excellent -- so fine that it has yielded him a considerable fortune. The new counterfeits of the fifty-cent fractional currency, which were seized in his house, are very close imitations of the genuine. CAMPER was caught by stratagem. Mr. MARTIN WOLFERT, an acquaintance, introduced Mr. STOUT as a Sutler for a New-Jersey regiment in the field, and STOUT bargained for a quantity of counterfeit money. CAMPER agreed to supply bogus ten-dollar notes on the Mechanics' Bank, of New-Haven, at the rate of $100 for $20; fives on the Northfield Bank, of Vermont, for $3, or in sums of $5,000 at $12 per hundred; and fractional currency at the rate of five spurious for one genuine. STOUT ordered $100 in counterfeit United States currency, $5,000 in fives on the Northfield Bank, and $1,000 in tens on the Mechanics' Bank, of New-Haven, to be delivered on Friday night, in a porter-house in Eighth-avenue, near Fifty-first-street.

He howed that even while the King and VON BISMARK were winning glory in foreign war, the work of oppression at home never ceased. The Liberal press was persecuted; Liberal officials were ""disciplined;"" the Royal assent was refused to the election of men of Liberal opinions to municipal dignities; Liberal sentiments were placed under a ban; and Liberal citizens were continually abused, insulted and calumniated by the servile journals of the Court. This pointed censure of the Government was received with storms of cheering by the Chamber, and so irritated Ministers that Count ENLENBURG, in the name of his colleagues, reprimanded the President, and told the Deputies that their plaudits could have no effect on the Government.

What a noble head he had, and what a rollicking humor! How splendidly he told a story, and how he brought the house down in delight as, with uplifted eyebrows, and a swing of his lame leg, he would exclaim in 'The Brigand,' 'Why, now I look at it again, 'tis more like me than Massaroni!"" He was one of the best stage-managers of the day, and he knew thoroughly all stage requirements.

The amount paid for teachers' salaries alone exceeded this sum by over four hundred thousand dollars -- a result, no doubt, due in great part to the advance in the scale of remuneration, rendered necessary by the depreciation of the currency.

The signs are that they will be supported by overwhelming majorities in both Houses. The difficulties of the case will not, however be entirely surmounted when these anticipated results are reached. There is a strong feeling of opposition to federation in the maritime colonies. Prince Edward's Island andNewfoundland will almost certainly reject the scheme. Its acceptance by Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick is by no means assured, and although such an issue in the Eastern colonies would not prevent Upper and Lower Canada from establishing a federal system of their own, it would leave the separate provinces practically in the same isolated co[???] in which they are now. All the anticipations of forming a powerful maritime State would be at an end. All the fine promises on which the English Government have been lain to rely in the matter of transferring the burdens of colonial defence from the Imperial shoulders, would fall to the ground. A mutually hostile system of tariff would still prevail along all the inter-provincial frontier lines; and the building of the inter-colonial railroad would be indefinitely postponed. All this, and worse, will come of a non-agreement between the maritime provinces and the West. If the present coalition Government is thwarted in the prime object for which it was formed, it is improbable that another can ever be brought together of sufficient strength to carry such a scheme hereafter. Party lines in Canada would be reestablished at once.

"THE ARION BALL. -- The annual fancy dress ball of the Arion Society took place at the Academy of Music on Thursday last. The attendance was unusually large; so large indeed that the convivality, good will, and jollity hitherto characteristic of these anniversaries were on this occasion impossible. The policy of aiming for an increased attendance each year is a questionable one. It seems to us indeed that the time has already come when the excessive hospitality of the society is likely to work its ruin. After all, the most liberal of hosts must regulate his invitations by the capacity of the building in which he hopes to entertain his guests. To be jolly under difficulties is to be miserable under compulsion. These facts were amply demonstrated on Thursday. The Academy was crowded to suffocation, and we take this opportunity of saying, with a mixed but unusually good attendance. We have never seen so many first-class people at a public entertainment of the kind. The effect, of course, was extremely animated and delightful -- to the eye. Seen from the dancing-floor it was really a suggestion of Paris, and had with it a brighter gaiety in the upper regions than can be found there. But to see is not the sole object of a visitor to a masquerade ball -- and even if it were, the average visitor had but a small chance of gratifying that object. Inconvenience, amounting to absolute annoyance, prevailed from floor to roof. Dancing was out of the question; even the debatable ground of the promenade -- that compromise which the uninitiated rejoice in -- was impossible. Impossible! why, at one period of the evening, even movement was out of the question. It is ungraceful, we know, to quarrel with success, but we may at least object to the way that a particular kind of success has been obtained. A society whose reputation insures a public response to any notice of its intentions, ought, it seems to us, to pay some kind of respect to that public. To sell every ticket that can be sold, with the absolute knowledge that the majority who buy them will never receive their money's worth, is, to speak mildly, not politic. Nor do we derive consolation from the knowledge that, in the end, the society will suffer by such grasping avarice. We do not wish the society to suffer. All that can be expected, in morals or in life, is to put a proper restraint upon excess. We have nothing to say in praise of the Arion Ball, except that it was overcrowed with maskers whose dresses would have done credit to the French opera itself. The wearers were unusually dismal, but they were justified in being so. The inconveniences to which they were subjected were enough to make Rome howl. The accommodations in the hat-room were exasperating to a degree which led to many personal altercations; in the supper-room they were mediocre. During the night several rencontres took place of an utterly disgraceful character. Indeed, a species of fistic skirmishing was going on all the time, rising sometimes into the dignity of a fight, but resulting always in the humiliation of the society. The Academy was not constructed for ball purposes, and its accommodations for any purpose are of the worst. When it comes to a question of providing for six or seven thousand people, it is of course helplessly inadequate.

In a ring-fight, time and a breathing spell is allowed to the combatants to recuperate, and renew and prolong a struggle of its moment to the nation, however interesting to that nation's refuse. The savage, wiser, because natural -- (the soldier as well as the sailor must act instinctively, naturally, as it were) -- concedes no such pauses in the conflict. He knows it is slay or be slain, and so, when his adversary is down, he leaps upon him, kills him, if necessary, or makes him a captive, a spoil, or a prey, enmeshing him in bonds. The fate of the hunter, in the very claws of the cougar, if he refrains from using his revolver or hunting-knife before his strength and courage fails, is exactly the fate of the North, if we make any terms with the South short of the absolute submission of the seceded states. Our fight with them is the struggle of the Templar with the Saracen, truceless and inevitable until the great end is accomplished, the liberation of our own patrimony -- that soil purchased with Northern blood and the whole nation's money -- from the yoke of a military despotism, founded upon a slaveholding oligarchy. The whole South may be styled the patrimony of the North. How few know that Great Britain had almost, if not altogether, reconquered, in September, 1780, what now constitutes the basis of the seceding States. GEORGE III. was ready to offer peace and independence to the Northern Provinces if they would abandon the Southern. They refused; and it was Northern cool valor and Northern indomitable energy, the capture of BURGOYNE, and the revival of confidence at the North, which enabled the South, with Northern aid, under a Northern General, GREENE, first to hold their own, and then, united with the North, to achieve their ultimate liberation.

But if, on the contrary, Peru still defers the payment of her debts, if she still refuses to pay the expenses of Spain, why, even in that case, we may expect that our vessels of the Pacific will return to Europe about the 1st of March -- but not till after having taken as a guarantee the equivalent of all the sums due, -- suck that Peruvian squadron which has been so much vaunted,"" and ""left in the ports of Peru the marks of the indignation of Spain.""

ROBT. M. THOMAS, Fifth New-Jersey Volunteers, who nobly fell whilst engaged with his regiment at the battle of Chancellorsville. At that time the brave boy's father was doing valiant service in the First New-Jersey Cavalry; but, after nearly a score of battles, his naturally robust constitution gave way, and he is now at home lingering in the last stages of consumption. After the death of his elder brother, and discharge of his father, the only remaining member of the family old enough to bear arms, resolved that at least one of the family should be represented in the Union Army. Accordingly, he entered his father's old regiment, and served faithfully for more than a year, setting a good example to many an older soldier. But he was naturally delicate, and finally was stricken down by disease, when he was conveyed to a hospital in Washington, where an affectionate mother watched his bedside until he expired, when she had his remains brought to his home (Jersey City) for interment. Upon some Christian lady expressing sympathy with the bereaved mother in her application, she resignedly remarked: ""Dear boy! he died for his country.""

These works, we will venture to say, have been heard by every grown and half-grown person in New-York. But there is a country beyond New-York City, and a stream of strangers -- called the floating population, because it keeps the heads of our managers, hotel-keepers and dry goods purveyors above water -- sets in from it. Italian opera is the great treat which our country cousins propose to themselves. The operas of which they have heard the most are those which they prefer and desire. Hence ""Il Trovatore""' is a never-falling attraction, and ""Norma"" and ""Lucia"" and ""Lucieda"" are sure to fill the house. Mr. MARETZEK, in fact, is compelled to repeat himself in order that he may satisfy the country as well as the town. He is now about to do something for both.

"PROBABLE MURDER. -- About 2 o'clock yesterday morning a shooting affair occurred in Green-point, which will probably prove fatal.

Some time after 9 o'clock Saturday night, however, it is said, friends of the absent man called upon HILL and entered into an agreement with him to give a certain sum of money to prevent further proceedings, which he expressed a willingness to accept. A meeting between the two men was then agreed upon, and they met with some friends, at a grocery store at the hour above named, After everything appeared to be amicably settled, HILL suddenly drew a horse-pistol, heavily loaded with shot, and discharged the contents into the head of JURGEN and then beat him over the head with the stock of the weapon. The injured man was conveyed to the City Hospital, where he lies in a senseless condition. He was visited yesterday by Coroner BARRETT, who had HILL committed for the offence.

The reasons for the change in the governmental programme are such as have been recently developed, and have no reference to the original plan for filling the ranks of depleted regiments, or the President's proclamation for a draft. It has been determined to postpone the draft solely on the ground of expediency. The disposition so recently expressed by our Supervisors to meet the exigencies of the Government by offering extraordinary inducements to enlist, has convinced the authorities at Washington that the quota of this county will be filled, if the present arrangements are permitted to continue, sooner than the number of men required of the city could be raised by draft. It has also been argued that the time which would be required of Provost-Marshals to carry into effect the draft, if employed in active efforts to recruit, would result in securing the men necessary to fill our quota. Unwillingly many of our citizens, most anxious to assist the Government in filling the ranks of our armies, have been indirectly the means or encouraging a spirit of dissatisfaction among a class of people ignorant of the law. This has been specially the case in the disposition manifested, sometimes even in official circles, respecting the correctness of our enrollment lists. It would be difficult to find a man, however loyal, who has not his doubts that more men are required of New-York than of any other city of the Union, in proportion to its population. This arises more from a disposition to find fault than from a knowledge of the facts. It is possible the new enrollment lists now being prepared by Supervisor BLUNT may tend to reduce our quota considerably, but this will be done only because of the new enrollment and not in consequence of imperfections in the old lists. That class of people who engage in riots delight to have some excuse, however poor, to disturb the quiet of the city by resisting the law, and the statement that our quota is oppressive and unfair is quite sufficient for them to base an argument in favor of the ""rights of the individual."" It should be remembered but seventy-five per cent. of the present call for troops will be required of this city under the President's proclamation, and that the remaining twenty-five per cent. will be held in reserve to provide for the loss of men from sickness in hospitals, fraudulent enlistments, desertions, &c.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE DRAFT.; Its Probable Postponement Rapid Recruiting in the City-Our Quota Likely to be Full in a Few Days Action of the County Volunteer Committee Heavy Bounties Offered Three-Years' Men Receiving $1,000 No Trouble About Enlistments in Future Raid on Bounty-Brokers.

TREMAINE, eldest son of Hon. LYMAN TREMAINE, of Albany, aud at the time of his death Lieut.-Col. of the Tenth New-York Cavalry. He was born in Greene County, in this State, in June, 1843, His character as a boy was distinguished by those qualities of generosity, firmness and courage, that marked him as a man, and endeared him to all who knew him. After careful preparation at the school of Dr. REED, at Geneva, in the Fall of 1860 he entered Hobart College, with the highest hopes and the highest prospects. There he remained until the Summer of 1862, when, unable longer to resist the promptings of patriotism, he was made Adjutant of the Seventh Regiment of New-York Heavy Artillery. He accompanied the regiment to Washington, where, much to his regret, it was detailed for the defences of that city. Although constantly engaged in his duties as Adjutant, and in the acquisition of military knowledge, Col. TREMAINE was ever eager for active service in the field. At last, in September, 1863, he was appointed by the President Assistant Adjutant-General, with the rank of Captain, with orders to report to Gen. DAVIES, of the cavalry, of the Potomac army. He was assigned to the staff of that officer, then commanding a brigade in KILPATRICK's division. He was transferred to the staff of the First Brigade, Second Division, then under the command of Col. TAYLOR, after, and now by Gen. DAVIES. He remained on this staff, distinguished himself by his bravery in many engagements, by the courtesy of his manner, and the prompt and intelligent discharge of every duty until December last, when he was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tenth New-York Cavalry. He ever won the affectionate regard, as he always secured the respect of his superior officers, and the warm friendship of his companions in arms.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lient.-Col.

Did any people, on the face of the earth, ever show such an utter lack of reason and of self-respect? In the other years of the war, they could be admired for much; and with all their errors, we were not ashamed to claim them as our fellow-countrymen. It was a crime in them to lend themselves to the treason of their leaders; but nobody can deny that once having committed themselves to this bad cause, they have fought for it with a gallantry seldom exceeded in human history. Nor have we, heretofore, been able to charge them with the folly of struggling for the impossible. There were, at the commencement of the war, large chances that it would end in Southern triumph and independence. Even the most sagacious men could reckon with much confidence on foreign intervention in favor of the South; or on a North so divided that President LINCOLN's administration would be paralyzed, and be succeeded by another which would take peace from the South at any price. There was during the first three years of the war no time in which the patriot had not reason to tremble for the final result; and no time in which the rebels could not reasonably look forward with at least some degree of hope. But the period in which it was possible for the higher qualities of manhood to serve the rebellion has passed.

The enormous amount of contracts and, the certainty that many such applications will be made, if any of them are favorably entertained, induces many persons to oppose them indiscriminately. If the door is once opened, it is said, to such claims, there will be no end to them, and the Treasury will be drained in the attempt to satisfy the demands that will be made upon it. The country cannot afford, it is urged, to enter upon such a work, and the only thing for Congress to do, therefore, is to refuse all applications of the kind, and hold every contractor to the strict performance of his engagements with the Government.

Bounty-brokers' Frauds; Col Baker's Investigations,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/14/archives/bounty-brokerage-frauds-a-city-provostmarshal-in-trouble-swindling.html,Bounty-brokers' Frauds; Col Baker's Investigations,"Our readers will be pleased to know that Col. BAKER remains in the city, and does not propose to return to Washington until he has thoroughly exposed, shown up and broken down the infernal system of bounty swindling, which seems to have entered into the very heart of the service, affecting not only the men who make rascality a trade, but also our most respected and reputable citizens. The developments already before the public are enough to disgust our honest people, but we are pained to assure them that as yet they know comparatively nothing of the extent to which the frauds have succeeded. Thus far but few names of note have figured in the list of rascals detected by the shrewd management of Col. BAKER, but a discerning public has doubtless ere this concluded that bounty-brokers, bounty-jumpers, recruit-runners and professional rogues could not alone compass so great a villainy. The cooperation of officials, the sanction of men in power, and the connivance of those whose duty is the detection of crime, rather than its shielding, was needed, and we are convinced by the most tangible demonstration that nothing of the sort has failed the villains in their hour of need. The scenes at Col. BAKER's rooms, yesterday, were most exciting; were it not so mortifying an exhibition of the worst side of human nature, they would have been amusing. All day long Supervisors from interior counties of this and other States jostled against the scallywags who swindled them, and with tearful eyes watched the unfolding of the villainous schemes by which they had been defrauded of men, money and time; all day long fiercely moustached individuals, with diamond pins and jeweled hands, hung nervously about the Colonel's apartments waiting their turn for examination; Captains in the regular and volunteer services obeyed the beck and call of the ""Special Agent;"" Provost-Marshals, divested for the nonce of pomp and power, excused their little irregularities or meekly submitted to the ""parole to city limits,"" which was the alternative to the ""old Capitol"" -while ever and anon a subordinate would come in with his head full of new points and his pockets full of forged papers. One of the most interesting cases was the following, which in its developments exhibits a well-known city Provost-Marshal in a light at once unpleasant and disgraceful: It seems that some months ago a fine stalwart young Englishman named M, came to this city from Liverpool with the intention of entering the army. He had served his time in the regular British service, and brought with him official testimonials and certificates as to good conduct and general efficiency, which he thought would aid him in securing a commission in our service. After weeks of unsuccessful endeavor, he made up his mind to enlist as a volunteer and take his chance for promotion. In pursuit of this he fell into the hands of a bounty brokerage firm, in this city, who took him at once to the office of the Provost-Marshal above-mentioned, an officer of prominence, politically and socially, and presented him as a recruit. The Provost-Marshal examined and passed him, made out the necessary papers, and desired him to sign them. M. perceived by the wording of the papers that he was placed as a substitute, and to this he objected, saying he didn't care ""to sell himself; he wished to enter the service as a volunteer."" The Marshal told him it was"" all right; it was only a matter of form, and something which all recruits were obliged to sign."" This satisfied the man, who signed the papers, took his $400, put on his uniform, and was sent to the rendezvous at Governor's Island. The Provost-Marshal being fold of filthy lucre, posted at once to the store of a merchant in Beaver street, who a day or two previous had requested him to find a substitute for him. The merchant listened with pleasure to the glowing account of M.'sphysique, and jumped at the chance of securing him for the moderate sum of $900. The bargain was arranged, and on the following day the merchant called on the Marshal with nine $100 bills, for which he obtained a receipt and the necessary exemption papers. Of this $900 the recruit had already received $400, and was, of course, entitled to the remaining $500. Of course he didn't get it. A few days thereafter he was in the city, and, meeting the Provost-Marshal, asked him for whom he was a substitute. The Marshal thoughtlessly told him: the two met, and the recruit found he had been cheated out of $300, while the merchant concluded he had been badly sold. The matter was brought to the attention of Gen. HAYES, who at first noticed it, but, for some reason, subsequently rebuffed the friend who attempted to arrange it for M.M. then called on the Marshal, but received not only no satisfaction, but was disgraced and returned to the Island. There the matter dropped until Col. BAKER came. The friend called on him, and told the story. He sent for the merchant and the soldier, got all the affidavits necessary to prove the case, and then sent for the Provost-Marshal. At first this officer was disposed to stand on his dignity and all that sort of thing, but facts and papers soon convinced him that it was easier to cheat a poor soldier than to confront the ""Special Agent"" He denied having received the money, but his own signature condemned him; he then said it was all given to the brokers, This they denied, and their books corroborated their assertion. At last, it turned out that he had kept $200, his clerk had kept $100, and the two brokers had received the other $200. When the gallant Captain saw that he was found out, and that there was literally no escape for him, he did the best thing he could, and said nothing. He was then permitted to return to his work, which will probably be under his control but temporarily, however. The brokers who also were brought before Col. BAKER are held for other charges, of which, however, we can say nothing to-day.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BOUNTY BROKERAGE FRAUDS.; A CITY PROVOST-MARSHAL IN TROUBLE.

SHERIDAN'S command, to report to Major-Gen. DIX, and was most of the time during his sojourn in this city the guest of Col. WM. H. LUDLOW, of Gen. DIX'S Staff. It is understood that the alternative was presented by our authorities to Mr. FOOTE of returning to Richmond, or of going abroad, and he chose the latter. Mr. FOOTE represents the ""Confederacy"" to be on the eye of disruption, and that the struggle on the part of the rebels is nearly over. High military authority in Richmond admits that the capture of Branchville must compel the evacuation of Charleston, Wilmington, and even of Richmond itself. Desperate battles would probably be fought before this latter evacuation takes place; but if GRANT and SHERMAN were successful in them, LEE, with his army, would fall back to Lynchburgh, and there endeavor to make a stand.

"Fractional Currency, ingenious Counterfeit",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/15/archives/an-ingenious-method-of-counterfeiting-the-postal-currency-united.html,"Fractional Currency, ingenious Counterfeit","An interesting case was brought before the Commissioner yesterday. It appears that some weeks ago some workmen, who were engaged in removing the ruins of a building in Fulton-street, destroyed last Summer by fire, discovered some copper-plates of the United States postal currency, of the denomination of 25 cents. At first they seemed fac-similes of the genuine, but closer inspection showed that at the bottom of the plates, separated a little from them, was an additional line, containing the words: ""Postal Currency Liniment;"" and on the plates for the back of the notes the line: ""None genuine unless signed."" These extra lines were so situated that when the notes were struck off the additions could be cut off, leaving the note the exact size of the genuine, and an excellent counterfeit of the twenty-five cent postal currency notes. The matter was placed in the hands of Government detectives to work up, and they found that a portion of the burned premises had been occupied by an engraver. The engraver being found, made a statement to the effect that some time last Spring a man had called on him and given him an order to engrave these plates, claiming that he wished to use the impressions as labels for a newly-invented nostrum to be called the Postal Currency Liniment. The engraver being a highly respectable party and perfectly innocent, application was made to the commissioner for the arrest of the man who employed him, and who evidently intended by this ingenious method to obtain the plates for a good counterfeit on the Postal Currency. The commissioner, however, held that under the act of Congress he could not issue a warrant in a case where the party had never had the counterfeit plates in his possession or issued any of the spurious currency.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""An Ingenious Method of Counterfeiting the Postal Currency.; UNITED STATES COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.

His State papers, as a general thing, have been very creditable productions -- clear, terse, pointed and admirably adapted to produce the intended effect. They have all been marked by an air of dignity, self-restraint and moderation, which, as they have mainly been written for the European public, even when nominally addressed to bodies or individuals in the Confederacy have been just what was wanted to win confidence and respect for their author. The speeches, however, are mostly delivered for home use, and in them the real man shows himself; the real, thoroughbred Mississippian is seen in every sentence, without any of the gloss of civilization. He is exceedingly boastful, of course, and full of promise; disposes of whole Federal armies with a few phrases; sketches out great campaigns with a confidence worthy of NAPOLEON, and not a little comical in the mouth of a warrior whose short term of active service was passed as a Colonel of militia. He inflicts (on the stump) the most disastrous defeats on Union Generals; sends SHERMAN and GRANT reeling like drunken men hither and thither over the continent, and is always able to tell his audience all but exactly what will be the military situation three months afterward.

Mrs. OLYPHANT's novels, in particular, are remarkable for their careful painting of English rural life, and the skill that composes an interesting story out of the ordinary incidents of ever-day existence. She appears to have made a minute study of the clerical profession, and to be perfectly at home in the various relations of the pastor and his flock, as displayed in the humble walks of dissent, or in the more assuming precincts of the National Church establishment. The prominence given to clergymen in late English novels is a remarkable proof how strongly the clerical character exercises an influence in every branch of society, from the lordly Bishops and Deans that ANTHONY TROLLOPE has made us all familiar with, to the independent minister of the ""Little Bethel"" Chapel, badgered to death by the leading butcher or baker of his congregation, such as we find portrayed in the ""Chronicles of Carlingford."" All who delight in a healthy novel, when the interest is legitimately created by the play of character brought out by a natural succession of events, instead of startling incidents by fire or flood, will follow with attention and sympathy the fortunes of the bachelor ""Perpetual Curate"" until he exchanges that title for a charming wife and a benefice of his own. The three maiden aunts who exercise an important influence on the story, are fine specimens of portraiture, elaborated with the skill of a practiced artist.

Proposes to Settle with Lee this Summer,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/15/archives/general-news.html,Proposes to Settle with Lee this Summer,"The various Live Stock markets have received only a very limited supply of animals this week, especially of beef cattle; those reported a week ago at Buffalo and Suspension Bridge have failed to arrive for this market, but are yet back, having made but little progress. Most of the bullocks on hand were from the Eastern and New-England States, only about 500 being reported from the West, and these have been nearly four weeks on the way. The scarcity of animals this week is caused by the cold and snow almost putting a stop to railroad transportation. Great numbers of animals are detained all along the railroad between Dunkirk and Buffalo. Wholly on account of this short supply prices of beef cattle have reached a height never known before in this city. These high prices are only for this market, however, as under favorable circumstances an ample supply must reach this place for the next market. Prices of Beeves run from 18c.@28c. lb., fully 2c. lb., net weight, higher than last week. The receipts of Sheep are also very light, and those in market sold at 12c.@15c. lb. -- an advance of about 1 3/4c. lb. The demand for Milch Cows is very light, and prices remain about the same. Veal Calves sell at 11c.@15c. lb., -- about 1c. lb. above the rates a week ago. The arrivals of Live Hogs are not in sufficient numbers to supply the demand, at an advance of 1/4c. lb. live weight.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/98c2d7e8-e865-57db-a43a-b6b98de29dab,870,nyt://article/98c2d7e8-e865-57db-a43a-b6b98de29dab

The Judge and his partner, THOS. PEARSALL, Esq., had been in and out of the office several times, and the door meantime was left unlocked. At one period the office was closed for about half an hour. The Judge came in about 6 P.M. to get his valuable papers for the purpose of taking them to his house and found them gone. The key had been left in the safe where his document were deposited, and it was an easy matter for any one so inclined to take any thing he wanted. The bonds stolen are described as follows: Kings County Bonds (three) Nos. 646, 647, 648, each for $1,000; coupons attached, dated Aug. 1, 1864, 6 per cent. These bonds are payable to bearer and can therefore be disposed of without difficulty. Kings County Treasurer's certificate dated June 29, 1864. No. 158, for $6,000, 7 per cent. This note is payable to SAMUEL GARRISON, but is not payable before the County Treasurer has prepared the necessary plates, which are not yet ready. It will therefore be useless to the thief.

Duty of Recruiting; Firing the Southern Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/15/archives/firing-the-southern-heart.html,Duty of Recruiting; Firing the Southern Heart,"The view expressed in these columns from the beginning, that the peace negotiations were devices of DAVIS to strengthen his position with the disaffected in the confederacy, are fully confirmed by events. We doubted the expediency of such individual missions as BLAIR'S, and anticipated their natural results. They commit the Government at least to the appearance of negotiation with the Confederate authorities, they weaken the probability of separate State action, and give DAVIS material for ""firing the Southern heart."" He is able now to say to the whole Southern people that he had made the most humane and Christian efforts for peace, but that all were ignominiously rejected, and that nothing is left but fighting to the last. And this ""firing the Southern heart"" is a thing by no means to be laughed at, as we learned in 1861. The Southern masses are ignorant, and capable of being deceived to an unlimited degree. They are now doubtless fully instructed by their leaders that LINCOLN will hear to nothing but the absolute spoliation, banishment or death of every rebel. They will hear that war with all its horrors cannot bring them more damage and loss than peace would; that they will be, after fighting is over, the servants of slaves, and their wives and daughters given up to the lusts of a brutal soldiery, and their children exposed to every insult and injury.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Firing the Southern Heart.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Firing the Southern Heart.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f0e6283-5bd2-554b-9af5-a004b5720a57,678,nyt://article/9f0e6283-5bd2-554b-9af5-a004b5720a57

"County Clerk's Office, Reorganization of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/15/archives/reorganization-of-the-county-clerks-department.html,"County Clerk's Office, Reorganization of","The complaints made as to the management of the County Clerk's office during the past three or four years have been both loud and frequent. Those who have had business to transact with the department have experienced delays and obstacles which showed plainly enough that the County Clerk's office stood sadly in need of a managing head. All this, however, has been entirely changed since the commencement of the present year, when Mr. WILLIAM C. CONNER entered upon the duties of his office. Mr. CONNER, being a man of business and accustomed to the control of a large establishment, saw the necessity of reform, and, assisted by his cashier, Capt. JOSEPH H. TOONE, instituted radical changes in the administration of the affairs of the department, important alike to the public and to those employed in the office. It was found that many of the books were in arrears, the records of lispendens being three years behind, and other records for even a longer period. Mr. CONNER at once employed, at his own expense, three clerks and an extra messenger, to write up the books in arrears, much to the satisfaction of those who found it necessary to consult them. The whole of the offices were repainted and thoroughly cleaned. The basement in which papers had been allowed to accumulate for years in most admired disorder was emptied of its contents. Valuable papers were there found which were fast passing into a state of decay. These were cleaned, copied if necessary, and filed away under the superintendence of Mr. WILLIAM WILKS, and the same gentleman was placed in charge of a Repository Department where all the old writs, executions and documents dating as far back as 1750, are kept in a systematic manner. Among the new regulations introduced by Mr. CONNER are the following:",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Reorganization of the County Clerk's Department."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Reorganization of the County Clerk's Department."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a477359c-4cb3-525e-ba49-f1f66d333e8e,666,nyt://article/a477359c-4cb3-525e-ba49-f1f66d333e8e

This time may not come until the accused are brought to trial. We have, however, the gratifying assurance that there is to be no unnecessary delay in arraigning the prisoners, it being Col.

The operations of the right wing, of which we have not heard much lately, are becoming of vital importance in view of its near approach to the city of Charleston. The rebels announce that on the 9th a strong force of Union troops was landed at Grimball's Plantation, on the Stone River, James Island, within two miles of the city of Charleston. Another force had gone up Edisto Inlet, and reached the main land, with the evident design of connecting with the maiu body of the right wing which was advancing toward Charleston along the line of the Savannah railroad. This column had crossed the Salkehatchie, driven the rebels from a strong line of works, and advanced as far as Blue House, a station on the railroad less than thirty miles from Charleston. The progress of the left wing under Gen. SLOCUM, in the interior of the State, is likewise rapid and successful. On the 8th inst. his forces crossed the Edisto River about twenty miles west of Branchville, pushed on and struck the railroad to Columbia at Orangeburgh, sixteen miles northwest of Branchville, which puts the entire system of railroads in the State completely in SHERMAN's possession, isolates Branchville, and compels its evacuation without the necessity of occupying it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-02-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2be726f2-f2b3-5dc4-a1bb-bbcb9fc6eb27,608,nyt://article/2be726f2-f2b3-5dc4-a1bb-bbcb9fc6eb27

The large and brilliant audience which usually attends all the public exercises of this time-honored institution of learning was not wanting upon this occasion. Upon the stage we noticed among other distinguished gentlemen, President BARNARD, of Columbia College, and Professors PECK, JOY, NAIRNE and SCHMIDT. The music, under direction of Mr. HELMSMULLER, was, as usual, faultless. After a prayer by President BARNARD, Mr. CHARLES KING GRACIE, the presiding officer, delivered an interesting address, in which was convincingly set forth the great and good results to grow from the establishment of the School of Mines of Columbia College. Mr. JAMES M. BRADY followed in an oration on ""Liberty,"" which he treated in a masterly manner, his reward being a shower of bouquets and a tumult of applause. He was followed by Mr. GEO. L. RIVES, on the ""Island of the Scots."" Next in order, Mr. HENRY A. BARCLAY delivered, in a very able manner, a poem entitled ""Farewell to Earth."" which elicited the hearty applause of the audience. These pieces were then delivered, as follows: ""King Rampsinitus,"" by Mr. H. CRAIG, F. RANDOLPH; ""Pausanias,"" by Mr. JAMES M. BRUCE; ""About Four Years Ago,"" by Mr. WM. E. SMALLEY; ""The Ages,"" by Mr. JULIAN JAMES, and ""The Era of Progress."" by Mr. WM. B. WALKER. Mr. H.R. BEEKMAN, the representative of the Philolexian Society, then delivered an oration eulogizing that association.

"Scarcely a day passes that an accident, resulting in the loss of life or limb, does not occur on the city railroads. Only a few of these casualties come under the cognizance of the police, and not a tithe of them find their way into the public journals; but a fearful record might be made of those who are suffering from broken bones and crushed limbs, These accidents are especially common during the Winter season, when the iron steps of the cars are slippery, and are attributable in part to overcrowding, and in part to the carelessness of passengers in getting on and off the platforms while the vehicles are in motion. Granting that railroad companies always will be rapacious, and that citizens always will be careless, the practical question presents itself of finding a remedy. We are supposed to be an inventive people, yet, through all the years that our city railroads have been in operation, no person so far as we remember, has offered a suggestion for preventing these far too common accidents, which often result in death, or else leave the victim to go maimed and crippled through life. It certainly must be an easy matter to provide against these casualties.

Even should a person be run down and fall before the wheels, this curtain or shield might be so constructed as to act like the cow-catcher of a locomotive, throwing the obstruction from the track, not, perhaps, escaping bruises, but obviating broken bones. One of these railroad accidents has been brought painfully to the notice of the writer during the past few days, in the case of a noble lad, the only son of his parents, who was crowded off the front platform of a car in University-place, and, slipping under the wheels, suffered such injury that his right leg had to be amputated.

Fire Department Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/17/archives/the-fire-department-question.html,Fire Department Question,"The Board of the City Fire Department held a meeting on Tuesday evening, to protest against the movement now in progress at Albany for the abolition of the existing organization, and the substitution of a small paid department. The speakers were very energetic in their defence of the present system, and declared it to be their intention to contest the passage of the bill now before the Legislature to the last. What strikes us as singular about all this is, that the firemen should be so dreadfully reluctant to go out, when nobody wants them. They are all volunteers, the services they render to the public are of a very trying and arduous nature, and they receive no compensation. The sole basis of their organization is in fact the desire of the public for their assistance. They have no divine right to extinguish fires any more than anybody else. Those who live in houses and are liable to be burnt up, are the only persons who have the right to decide what should be the nature of the measures taken for their protection. It is neither very dignified nor very civil, therefore, for the Fire Department to persist in forcing their good offices on people who have, as distinctly as good manners and gratitude for past favors will permit, signified their desire to be rid of them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fire Department Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fire Department Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/66ff84ae-a42f-5595-8668-7fe6c097b923,700,nyt://article/66ff84ae-a42f-5595-8668-7fe6c097b923

The news received from America on the 4th, per steamship China, indicating a continued war in the United States, imparted a decided improvement to the cotton market, and rather unfavorably affected United States Securities.

SHERMAN, which is marching through the central part of South Carolina, is meeting with nothing but success. It is quite a week since he reached Orangeburgh, and as the capital of the State is but two days' march from that point, it was doubtless entered the early part of this week. It is now clear that SHERMAN's line of conquest is to be across Middle South Carolina, demolishing the Confederate power in the State as he proceeds, and then continuing his advance. It was reported yesterday that his cavalry had reached Florence, some eighty miles northeast of Orangeburgh, and not far from the North Carolina line. If he should at once hold Columbia and Florence, HARDEE's army at Charleston, as well as the city itself, would be in a predicament, and HARDEE would certainly have to take to the swamps. He could not go southward, for we hold the railroad; nor northward, for the same reason; and the only other, railroad, that easterly to Florence, would also be useless to him.

The philosopher BERKELEY maintained that a people, as well as an individual, might go deranged. If derangement consists of such a confusion of the faculties that things can no longer be regarded in their just relations, and of such an exaltation of the imagination that fancies sway the mind and the will instead of facts, there can be no doubt that, so far as regards this case, at least, BERKELEY was right. Ninetenths of the inmates of Bloomingdale are there to-day on less conclusive evidence that they are out of their senses, than what daily comes to us in respect to the people in rebeldom.

The facts are too patent and too well authenticated to be directly denied by Mr. MASON; but he attempts to palliate some of the rebel atrocities, such as starving our prisoners, by asserting that our armies have devastated the South and destroyed the supplies. Now, the point where the worst treatment of this kind was visited most extensively upon our prisoners was at Andersonville, in Georgia -- the very region which SHERMAN's army traversed two months ago, and found to be abounding in all the necessaries of life to such an extent that it furnished supplies on the line of march for an army of fifty thousand men. MASON also tries to excuse the rebels for their savagery, by asserting that Confederate prisoners are maltreated and starved in the North. This will be news to the rebel prisoners at Point Lookout, Columbus, Chicago, Rock Island, Indianapolis, Johnson's Island, and Elmira.

"House, Rise of and Remedy",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/18/archives/a-subject-of-much-concern-the-increased-rent-of-dwellinghouses.html,"House, Rise of and Remedy","One of the time-honored customs of our city requires both landlord and tenant to ""declare their intentions"" on the 1st of February, in relation to the rental year commencing the 1st of May. The house-owners have made their declaration, and, to the horror of pater families, struggling to keep himself and babies from the contamination of a ""low neighborhood,"" his landlord demands an increase of rent fully averaging 25 per cent. above the rates of last year. The intentions of the tenant becomes, therefore, the question of vital importance in the family circle; they agitate the breakfast table and disturb the serenity of the bedroom confab; they penetrate even to the nursery. Especially is this the case in the middle stratum of humanity, where the entire social economy now turns upon this all-absorbing matter -- the rate of the yearly rental. The salaried man, whose annual income is a fixed quantity, looks despairingly toward Brooklyn or to the shores of New-Jersey, and presents to himself the alternative of emigration or a boarding-house. And it is upon this class that the rise in rents is about to press most heavily. By means of trade associations, combinations, strikes, &c., mechanics and craftmen have brought about a rate of increased remuneration for their labor proportionate to the increased cost of living, but no regular or commensurate rise in the salaries of clerks. Government employes and others receiving fixed wages, has taken place, and to them the rent question is of absorbing interest. Even emigration offers but little relief to the harried clerk, for the rush to Brooklyn and Williamsburgh, Hoboken and Jersey City, is so great, that rents which are, of course, dependent on demand, have risen more than fifty per cent. in all accessible suburbs of New-York.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A SUBJECT OF MUCH CONCERN.; The Increased Rent of Dwelling-Houses --Causes of the Rise-What Can be Done to Provide Homes for the People.

Statesmen and journalists abroad have been possessed with the idea that the condition of this country repeated that of Europe -- that our States stood upon their nationalities, and that a wide expanse must necessarily produce an irreconcilable antagonism, both of interest and feeling. They regarded the rebellion as the commencement of the natural disintegration of the country into numerous communities, to ripen in time into distinct nationalities, and that it was the height of folly even for our own Government to resist a tendency so inevitable and irresistible.

Dr Von Vleck's Exposures of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/19/archives/spiritualism-exposed-an-exhibition-at-the-astor-house-by-day-light.html,Dr Von Vleck's Exposures of,"Within the last few years, a number of persons calling themselves ""mediums,"" have attracted public attention, by professing to be the means through which disembodied spirits communicate with the material world. At the seances given by these mediums, a regular course of performances is gone through. Musical instruments are played, bells are rung, tables are uplifted and overturned, the most intricate knots are untied; and articles of furniture go gyrating round the room, and all this, apparently, without the aid of the physical forces. As these manifestations invariably take place in a dark or dimly lighted room, and as the mediums always insist on certain conditions being observed, the spectators, (if they can be so called,) finding it impossible to detect any artifice or deception, naturally become impressed with the idea that the mediums are really endowed with more than mortal powers. Of course, among the investigators, are many hard of belief, who feel unwilling to ascribe the manifestations to spiritual agency, merely because they cannot detect the physical means employed. Yet there are others, who are so firmly convinced of the truth of all they hear and see that they have given up both friends and fortune to aid in disseminating the peculiar doctrines of the Spiritualists. These unfortunate victims of the dela[???] [???] may be counted by thousands. The Spiritual Telegraph and other organs of the Spiritualists affirm that there are some sixty or eighty thousand believers in spiritualism in Europe alone, and that the number is daily increasing. Lunacy, suicide and the disruption of family ties are some of the common results of a belief in the doctrines of the Spiritualists. A jargon has been adopted by their lecturers and writers, solely, it would seem, for the purpose of confusing ordinary intellects and ""making the wrong appear the better reason."" The evil is wide-spreading, and those who undertake its exposure should receive encouragement. There is now in this city a Dr. N.F. VON VLECK, who professes to have made the exposure of the trickery practiced by the ""mediums"" his study for the last ten years. He believes that he has discovered the means by which all the manifestations are made, and that the whole thing is a deception from beginning to end. The writer, with several other representatives of the press was invited to be present, Thursday, at a private seance given by Dr. VON VLECK in his apartments at the Astor House. The Doctor clearly demonstrated in what manner four or even five musical instruments could be played upon at once, how the tightest and apparently most inextricable knots could be slipped, iron rings placed on a person's arm, while his hands were retained in those of the medium, rappings produced, and in short, fully exposed the hundred and one tricks familiar to all who have attended spiritual seances. The writer was requested to take a seat at the table, on which were a number of musical instruments, to close his eyes and to place his hands on the doctor's head. Dr. VON VLECK, being seated before him, then clasped both his hands round the writer's arm. While in this position, no one else being within ten feet of the table, the musical instruments were played on, sailed over the writer's head, struck him on the face, and, in fact, made themselves felt in a manner more forcible than pleasant. The writer was somewhat astonished by the demonstrations until the modus operandi was explained to him, when the only wonder he felt was that he had never thought of so simple an explanation before. Dr. VON VLECK also explained the method adopted by mediums in answering sealed letters and in producing spirit writing, and convinced all present that a little skillful manipulation would account for all the wonders the clairvoyant and writing mediums profess to perform.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spiritualism Exposed.; AN EXHIBITION AT THE ASTOR HOUSE BY DAY LIGHT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spiritualism Exposed.; AN EXHIBITION AT THE ASTOR HOUSE BY DAY LIGHT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09385af3-71e3-5f37-9e42-35ecd7bea2bc,687,nyt://article/09385af3-71e3-5f37-9e42-35ecd7bea2bc

That of the Montezumas, which CORTEZ overthrew, had existed for centuries, but the empire which the Third NAPOLEON has founded for the benefit of the Hapsburgs, already totters. On every side of MAXIMILIAN, the storm-clouds are looming above the horizon. His determination to confirm the law secularizing ecclesiastical property, has converted the Church party, once his most steadfast supporters, into his most bitter enemies. True, their late attempt at insurrection has failed, VALDEZ, who had placed himself at the head of the movement having been defeated by a division of French troops near Texcatitlan. This discomfiture has not, however, in the least disheartened them, or caused them to desist from essaying to undermine the throne which they contributed to effectually to set up. If the champions of the priesthood cannot encounter the mercenaries of MAXIMILIAN in the field, their emisaries can traverse the country and prepare the way for that universal uprising which bids fair to overwhelm the usurper, by sowing the seeds of disaffection in the minds of the people. VALDEZ may not prove a very formidable antagonist to the French Generals, but VICARIO and his columns riding over the land and disseminating proclamations, which ""attack the Emperor, accuse him of having broken faith with the nation, and call on all Mexicans to take up arms against the foreign dynasty,"" are opponents whom the Austrian and his Gallic friends may well dread.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Second Empire in Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Second Empire in Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/144402bd-0165-532f-b36f-479088014c39,634,nyt://article/144402bd-0165-532f-b36f-479088014c39

From the opening speech of the counsel for the Crown, it appeared that at the time of the fire, which was a very destructive one, no suspicion was raised as to its origin, but that a short time after, there was discovered in the hemp-house in the same dockyard, a machine containing combustibles, which showed that an attempt had been made to fire this house also. Suspicion being then excited; it was remembered that this HILL, who had been in the yard, was found locked up in the hemp-house the day before the fire. Other circumstances combining to strengthen the suspicion thus directed against him, a reward was offered, and the man was at last arrested. As it was understood that he had been in America, it was surmised that the Colonies, which were then in rebellion, and interested in the destruction of the English navy, were in some way concerned in the affair, and another man, named BALDWIN, who had been in Philadelphia, was called in to prove that he had seen HILL there, but was unable to identify him. HILL, however, as BALDWIN was going out, called him up, and, after some talk, requested a visit from him. BALDWIN visited HILL in prison, and an intimacy sprang up between them, until HILL took BALDWIN entirely into his confidence, admitted that he set fire to the rope-house, and gave a full account of his coming over from France under a French passport, for the purpose of firing the dockyards, and of all the steps which he took to make his infernal machines and to fire the buildings. BALDWIN thereupon made the matter known to the Government Officers, who were enabled to verify the story by the evidence of the man who made the machines, the women with whom he had boarded, and other witnesses, making out a full chain of proof against the accused, and corroborating to the full his confession to BALDWIN. He was convicted and executed, having confessed his guilt.

His time was apparently unoccupied, and after dinner we fell into conversation on the state of the nation and general politics, which lasted, with great interest to me, till sundown. In conversation, JEFF. DAVIS is the most engaging and instructive of all rebels. Upon introduction his manners have a tinge of military exactness and formal courtesy, but once engaged in talk upon his favorite themes, no public man could be more lavish of his mental wealth, or more agreeable in his mode of displaying it. It was plain even then, in a time of profound peace and great national prosperity, the South never so flourishing, and his own party in undisputed power, that his heart was set on the establishment of a separate republic, and that he had contemplated and loved to contemplate all the advantages which the South might hope to derive from such a step, and anticipated all the difficulties in the way of successful secession.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JEFF.

BENJAMIN publicly confesses that the able-bodied white population is used up, and that Richmond must be evacuated unless the negroes be conscripted. Gen. LEE favors the measure the army calls for it, as we may see from the letters from the camps in the Richmond papers; DAVIS has long been an advocate of it. The strong aristocratic slaveholding caste must at length yield, and all its slaves, as well as its children, must be offered a sacrifice to the ambition of DAVIS and the pride of LEE. The so-called Congress, it is true, rejects any comprehensive measures for arming great numbers of slaves; but it allows twenty or thirty thousand to be employed as ""pioneers and teamsters."" How long will it take Gen. LEE to make passable soldiers of these pioneers and put them in garrison or on guard at bridges in his rear? Still time flies, and SHERMAN presses steadily on. Whatever regiments are to be drilled for the Spring and Summer campaign, must be drilled now. The area for conscripting the black population diminishes every day; the time for arming and exercising and organizing such a mass of raw troops grows continually shorter. It is not improbable that approaching ruin and the feeling of desperation will finally drive the rebel administration into the forcible conscription of masses of blacks, and the insurgent armies will be reinforced with these unwilling Sepoys.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARMING SLAVES FOR THE REBEL SERVICE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARMING SLAVES FOR THE REBEL SERVICE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2cc81d8b-fe95-5493-8747-bf6f475a0a38,321,nyt://article/2cc81d8b-fe95-5493-8747-bf6f475a0a38

"Grand Trunk, Canada; Train over Embankment",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/19/archives/railroad-accident-in-canada.html,"Grand Trunk, Canada; Train over Embankment","-- An accident of a very serious character occurred on the Western division of the Grand Trunk, one mile east of Guelph, yesterday morning, about 10:30 o'clock, by which a passenger car, containing some thirty five persons, was precipitated down an embankment about thirty feet high, and where it now lies bottom upwards. It appears the morning train from London to Toronto left Guelph at its usual time, but had got only a mile below that station when the engine, by means of the ice and snow at a crossing, got off the track, and in doing so broke a rail. It dragged the train about twenty rods, when the passenger car was thrown off the track, and hurled down the embankment. Information was immediately sent to Guelph Station, and in the meantime the persons who were on the baggage car and engine used every exertion to rescue the inmates of the passenger car, who miraculously escaped with their lives, although about six of them were seriously injured. The names of some of the injured are: Hon. M.H. Foley, bruised and injured in chest and shoulders, but not considered dangerous by his medical advisers; Conductor Robert Johnston, (formerly a member of the Toronto City Police Force) seriously injured, his collar bone being broken in three places and his skull fractured. Johnston was conveyed to this city by train yesterday, and sent to his house on Camden-street, where he was placed under the care of Dr. Russell, W. Phin, J.P., Eram[???]sa; J. McNab, Knox College, hands and face burnt by overturning of stove; Wm. Carson, A[???]blon, badly cut on the leg; A. Thompson, Toronto, hands burnt by the stove; -- Rowe, C. Chadwick and A. Lemon, Guelph, the latter two slightly injured; Miss Thompson, Esquesing, shoulder hurt; James French, Hamilton, side and shoulder bruised. The baggage car was thrown off the track, but did not go down the embankment. The wheels and axles of the passenger car were broken to pieces. A special train was dispatched from Toronto at once to render assistance and to bring away the passengers, all of whom, with the exception of Mr. Foley and Mr. Thompson, resumed their journey to their several destinations. A passenger describes the scene in the car at the time of the accident as frightful. One was thrown on top of another, and for the moment all were in perfect terror. -- Toronto Globe, Feb. 14.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RAILROAD ACCIDENT IN CANADA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RAILROAD ACCIDENT IN CANADA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d10063e-b5bf-5624-8af6-01af8fab9af6,404,nyt://article/4d10063e-b5bf-5624-8af6-01af8fab9af6

The fire was first discovered in Messrs.

The firemen now turned their attention to saving properity in the immediate neighborhood of the conflagration; but no withstanding the floods of water which they poured into the schoolhouse adjoining No. 178 and into Mrs. MONROE's house, No. 174, both buildings were materially damaged before the firemen gained mastery of the fiery element. At one time several dwellings on the west side of Wooster-street were in imminent danger of destruction; but they were, happily saved with little damage beyond a slight searching. At about 10:30 the lofty walls of Nos. 176 and 178 fell and sent up dense volumes of sparks and cinders, which, being swept on the wind far over eastward, threatened Greene-street, Broadway, and Elm-street; but they kindled fire on only one roof -- that of the Jewish Synogogue, in Greene-street.

On Historical Influence of Natural Causes,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/19/archives/the-historical-influence-of-natural-causes.html,On Historical Influence of Natural Causes,"Thursday evening Prof. JOHN W. DRAPER, gave the second of a series of lectures before the Historical Society, on the ""Historical Influence of Natural Causes."" The subject treated was the ""Effects of Emigration."" Prof. DRAPER, in beginning his address, said he would treat late subject as compactly as possible, and therefore classified it under two heads: First, the effect on the coun- try left; and Secondly, the effect on the country joined. In considering the effect upon the country left, we must bear in mind that in every country the people are made up of three distinct classes: First, a superior order, who, by their talents, rule with unresisted power; second, an intermediate class, which understands what is explained; and thirdly, the lower orders, who do not understand at all. If the class which leaves a country belongs to the lower order, the effect is not serious. The places of the ignorant are easily supplied, and no material strength is lost. Should the migrating body, however, seriously diminish the higher class, it is a more serious matter, as it is impossible to recruit that class at will. The discovery of America by COLUMBUS agitated Europe to its deepest foundations; the people went wild for the lust of gold, the excitement extending from the prisoner's cell to the throne. In Spain, the men of influence -- civil, military and ecclesiastical -- all rushed across the ocean, the thirst for gold becoming too strong for family pride. The melancholy Peruvian Inca, when he placed his finger on the prison wall, and offered to give gold to that height for his freedom, only added to the fierce thirst. Spain acted with the greatest atrocity toward the natives, treating them as though they did not belong to the human race. It was an unutterable outrage, producing universal ruin. Whole races, numbering millions of people, were remorselessly exterminated. From Mexico and Peru, a civilization that might have instructed Europe was blotted out. The crime of Spain, the speaker said, became her punishment. Her intelligence was swamped in American wilds, and the emigration of her best and bravest blood wrought her ruin. The Mexican and Peruvian are terribly revenged. In Europe, there is another class of emigrants that is worth our study. For three centuries a large portion of the world has been peopled by the English, principally from the second and third classes. The first order has emigrated to but a limited extent. In the colonization of North America and Australia, there has been but little inducement for those who desired a life of learned ease or social distinction. The removal of forests and building of cities presented but few temptations for the aristocracy. In a double manner, these circumstances tended to restrain the upper class, and the intrinsic strength of that nation has not declined. On speaking of the second point -- the effect of emigration on the country joined -- the lecturer said that when a people is suddenly transported from its original seat to some new abode, in a different climate, it involuntarily commences a movement to come into harmony with its new estate. There is an increased risk of life, but the change once perfected, everything moves forward harmoniously. The result may be expedited by mixture of blood. A small tribe intermingling with a large one becomes absorbed by the greater. This is illustrated by the history of the Romans. That people spread around the Mediterranian Sea, conquered Greece, Egypt, Spain, and other countries, only to be themselves contaminated and conquered by intermingling. The blood of the Romans was transferred into all, and that people was literally dissolved and lost in the nations. With them went down all their ideas and institutions; the thoughts of the conquered people conquered the thoughts of the Romans. The lecturer spoke at much length of the dissipation attending the adulteration of the Roman blood, and the extraordinary prevalence of crime, especially in relation to the conjugal relations of the people. The middle class, in which the worth and virtue of nations exist, became extinct. History proves, the speaker said, that nations cannot be continually modified without changing their natures. The extinction of races is never consummated by force, but by insidious influences, which gradually wean them away. Blood-degeneration implies thought-degeneration. These principles are illustrated with equal emphasis in Asiatic history. The Mahomedans overran Asia so rapidly, and their mass was so small, that instant extinction appeared to await them; yet for centuries they held the conquered country. The explanation of this surprising political result turns on the position of the female race in Asia. There woman is a slave, while in Europe she is a companion. The political pewer of the polygamic system is prodigious. The lecturer spoke of the greater power, which a large family of children gave, especially when the women are excluded from the public. In Europe, the area of influence is in society, while in Asia it is in the person. The sword made the conquest of the Mohommedans, and polygamy secured it. The speaker next illustrated his subject by referring to the history of this country. From the Atlantic States the West has been peopled. The emigration has been in equal proportions from the then social grades, and the social state has remained comparatively permanent. The speaker said we lost much by the extent of territory; if the area was smaller, and the population more condensed, the intellectual competition would be greater, and the advancement proportionate. The lecturer said our faculties were turned to the development of machinery rather than the science of agriculture, because land was so much cheaper than labor. If emigration should set toward the South, the effect would be different. The blood admixture with the white people of the South will make itself powerfully felt in the consequences that will ensue. There is a great difference between a civil and foreign war. The feuds of civil war, the speaker said, rapidly disappear. The vanquished in a civil strife avoids a recurrence to his failure, while the victor abstains from a contemplation of his success. The memory of such things speedily pass away, and society stands one new basis.

Murder of British Officers,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/19/archives/another-japanese-trouble.html,Murder of British Officers,"The nobles of Japan make it a point to evince the intensity of the hatred which they bear toward foreigners, by the periodical sacrifice of one or more of the obnoxious race. Their latest victims have been two British officers, Maj. BALDWIN and Lieut. BIRD, who had started from Yokohama on horseback, on the morning of the 21st of November, for a pleasure excursion to a place about sixteen miles distant. But they never returned alive, and in the evening of the same day, information reached the Governor of Yokohama that two foreigners were lying dead near the temple gardens of Kamakura. This intelligence, of course, caused great excitement and consternation among the European residents, and immediately a troop of mounted artillery, accompanied by a number of civilians and several Consuls, set out for the locality indicated, where they found the corpses of Messrs. BALDWIN and BIRD horribly mutilated -- the neck of the former half severed, and his cheek cut off; the arm and cervical vertebrae of the latter cut through in two or three different places, and his body disfigured all over with gashes. The killing was evidently the work of some of those armed bravos whom the Damios keep in their service for purposes of violence and assassination, and must have been perpetrated with no lees of treachery than of ferocity, since the revolvers of the murdered officers were undischarged, and no sign of a struggle anywhere to be seen.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Japanese Trouble.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Japanese Trouble.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Japan', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/92f073c4-53a5-581a-80a8-d6ead39f369e,471,nyt://article/92f073c4-53a5-581a-80a8-d6ead39f369e

Among the amendments adopted were the following: imposing a tax of two and a half per centum on the net receipts of railroads, steamboats, ferryboats, stages, bridges, &c., when the receipts are under $3,000, and five per centum where they are over that sum. The tax under the old law was two and a half per cent. on the gross receipts. On diamonds, emeralds, precious stones and imitations thereof, and all other jewelry, the duty is reduced to five per centum ad valorem.

"the late Mrs. MARY HYDE was attended yesterday from the residence of her husband's father, ROSWELL HYDE in Hubbard-street. It was a large funeral. Rev. Mr. STRONG and Rev. Mr. LAMPHEAR conducted the exercises. Her remains were buried in the family lot in Evergreen Cemetery. Among the persons present on the mournful occasion, were the near relatives and friends of the deceased and of her unfortunate husband; her father, who came from Milford, the Provost-Marshal of the Second Congressional District. Deputy-Marshal AUGUSTUS PUTNAM, and all the clerks and employes attached to the office of the Board of Enrollment in this city, and other persons officially connected with the recruiting service. Much sympathy was expressed for Mr. HYDE, who, while beating himself with moderation, appears to be fully sensible of his loss, and the peculiarly painful position in which he is placed. Toward evening -- some time after the funeral -- Constable JOHN MCGEE arrested Mr. HYDE, on a document issued by the Grand Juror, Col. GEORGE M. GARDINER, and in about an hour Mr. HYDE gave bonds -- or a friend did for him -- in the sum of $1,000, to appear this morning, at 6 o'clock, before Judge HOLLISTER, to answer to whatever complaint or charge might be brought against him. It is not probable that there will be any hearing of this sad affair to-day, as in case the State shall wish an investigation, witnesses will have to be summoned, which will take time. We saw Mr. HYDE at the office of the Chief of Police. He expressed a desire to have all the facts of his melancholy story laid before the officers of justice, and has no doubt of establishing the truth of his statements as he made them to the police on the night of the death of Mrs. HYDE.

"Paris Letter, Jan 20",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/20/archives/from-europe.html,"Paris Letter, Jan 20","We have what may properly be called three day's later news from Europe by the arrival of the Saxonia from Southampton, Feb. 8. We have also fuller details of the news by the Europa. The principal item of British domestic intelligence is the assembling of Parliament, which took place on the 7th. The Queen's speech, which is of little general interest, will be found elsewhere, as also a portion of the debate thereon in the House of Lords. The Queen did not appear in person at the opening. We have additional particulars in the summary by the Saxonia, as well as in our Paris letter, relative to the strange proceedings by which the so called Danish ram Olinda has passed, presumably, into the handsof the rebels, and received an English outfit as a pirate. The ""peace rumors"" appear to have caused an extraordinary excitement in Germany, and United States securities at Hamburg advanced to 53 1/2, which is about 5 per cent. higher than their selling price here, was at the date of the Hamburg report. The London press is occupied more than ever with American continental affairs. The Army and Navy Gazette points to the rapid decline in the rebel cause -- looking solely to the military situation. The foreign enlistment case -- that of one RUMBLE, a British naval officer, engaged in fitting up a British gunboat as a rebel ram (the Rappahannock,) had been disposed of by the acquittal of the accused, although all the evidence went to establish his guilt. The news of the cession of the Mexican Provinces of Lower California, Sonora, &c., to France, had caused much comment. The British press seemed disposed to credit the report, although it was plumply denied by the French organ.

It also gives the same bounty to those who would have been entitled to discharge, by reason of wounds, but whose terms of service had expired within two years from the date of enlistment. Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio, offered a joint resolution, providing for the appointment, by the Secretary of the Treasury, of a commission of three persons, to enamine into and report upon the subject of raising revenue by taxation, and the articles most fit for taxation. After some debate, the resolution was laid over. 2,000 copies of the report of the Naval Commission, in reference to the establishment of a Naval Depot in the Western waters, were ordered printed. The Army Appropriation Bill was taken up, and the recommendation of the Finance Committee to strike the proviso in the House bill, that no money shall be paid to land-grant railroads for transportation of troops and munitions of war for the United States, was adopted. An amendment making an appropriation of $7,000,000 to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for the present fiscal year, was adopted. Mr. WILSON offered amendments increasing the commutation price of rations to officers on duty in the field, below the rank of Brigadier-General, to fifty cents per ration. Also, that all officers of volunteers below the rank of Brigadier-General now in commission, who shall continue in the military service to the close of the war, shall be entitled to receive three months' pay, the provisions of this section not to apply to officers not on duty. That commissioned officers serving in the field shall be permitted, hereafter to purchase rations for their own use on credit from the Commissary Department, and the amount due for rations so purchased shall be reported monthly to the Paymaster-General to be deducted from the payment next following such purchase, which were adopted. Mr. WILSON also offered an amendment which was adopted, that the Secretary of War be directed to furnish, at cost, not exceeding 16 ounces of tobacco per month to each soldier who may deserve it, the cost to be deducted from their pay. The bill as amended was then passed.

the Franco-Danish Rebel Ram,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/20/archives/the-franco-danish-rebel-ram.html,the Franco-Danish Rebel Ram,"-- Our Paris correspondent supplies us to-day with sundry particulars of great interest relative to the agency employed to smuggle the iron-clad ram Olinda within reach of the clutches of rebel agents, while the craft was, ostensibly, being transferred from the hands of her French builder into those of her so-called Danish owners. It seems the enterprising person to whom this task was intrusted by M. ARMAN, the builder of the ram, was M. DE LA RIVIERE, who was formerly known here in connection with ship-building contracts for the Italian Government. He is known in Paris now as one of the shrewdest as well as the most ardent sympathizers with the rebellion in Europe. And his game, in this instance, lay mainly in having the vessel land at Copenhagen in such a condition that it should at once be rejected by the Danish Government. Whether he has so managed matters that neither the Government of France nor that of Denmark can be held to accountability for the appearance of this new scourge, we shall learn anon.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRANCO DANISH REBEL RAM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRANCO DANISH REBEL RAM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9922ec93-2d7b-5b38-830b-bd1b23588e16,176,nyt://article/9922ec93-2d7b-5b38-830b-bd1b23588e16

Swindling his Government,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/20/archives/the-rebellion.html,Swindling his Government,"Dispatches from Gen. GRANT to Secretary STANTON, containing extracts from the Richmond papers of Saturday, give the cheering news that SHERMAN has captured Columbia, South Carolina, and is there with his whole army. The probably immediate evacuation of Charleston is announced, and a dispatch from the Charleston Mercury states that the publication of that paper will be suspended for a short time, until the office can be removed to another place. The Richmond papers seem to be in the dark as to the future movements of SHERMAN's army, but think that he may go to Charlotte, N.C. They say that he may possibly establish a new base at Charleston, but think it is needless for him to have any base, as he is living on the country, and has fought no battle that would diminish his supply of ammunition. The ""brag"" appears to have been entirely taken out of the Southern journals, their tone being despondent, and conveying the impression that they believe SHERMAN can go where he chooses, consuiting only his own convenience. BEAUREGARD had retreated before the advance of SHERMAN, destroying large quantities of medical stores; but no intimations are given as to the direction taken by his forces. It is evident that SHERMAN will now sweep through the States of South and North Carolina unopposed, completely destroying the main lines of communication with the beleaguered capital of Virginia, and join GRANT by Spring in the final struggle with the only organized rebel force in the whole South.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab036d7a-b0f8-5294-ac57-c9473ba3f85d,655,nyt://article/ab036d7a-b0f8-5294-ac57-c9473ba3f85d

"The system of bounty brokerage inaugurated in this city in 1863 has grown to be a business of no mean magnitude. In the Summer of that year parties bringing recruits received but $10 hand money. They are now getting $100. Under the palmy reign of Gen. SPINOLA, when it was only a question of bargain and sales between the broker and recruit, it was not a difficult thing for the former to so arrange matters as to send the latter penniless into the ranks. Although it cannot be said with truth that Gen. SPINOLA had anything to do with the ""arrangement,"" still he proved a means to the end, and hundreds of poor fellows were swindled out of their just dues without his knowledge or consent. So flagrant became the abuse that the authorities at Washington were led to investigate the official transactions of the General, who, upon trial by court-martial, was acquitted of all complicity. The investigation, however, developed the fact that there were a number of men in the city who had banded themselves together for the purpose of wronging volunteers out of their bounties, and it was determined to stop further nefarious transactions by introducing stringent local measures. The State Legislature passed an act prohibiting brokers, in fact, any person, under a heavy fine, from taking men from this State to another for the purpose of enlistment, and the Common Council passed an ordinance prohibiting recruiting in the city for other localities. Unfortunately, so stringent were the provisions under the new law that honest brokers were included with the dishonest, and this class of people who had acted as semi Provost-Marshals, were thrown out of business. The result was trickery and complete dishonesty on the part of the brokers. They were under the suspicion of United States officials and the County Volunteer Committee, and in a short time became to be regarded as thieves and swindlers. Under such circumstances, it was not at all strange that the bounty brokers should band themselves together for the purpose of ""running"" men out of the State to localities where they could receive some compensation for their services. How well the combination succeeded, the efforts made by Supervisor BLUNT to fill our quota under the last call, before increased bounties were offered, will attest. When it is remembered that there are over two hundred ""private recruiting establishments in the city in charge of brokers whose aggregate number is not less than three thousand, it can easily be seen what a powerful element the County Volunteer Committee had to contend with. Now, however, Supervisor BLUNT has partially modified his plan of attack on the brokers, and an honest man of that class is permitted to receive the premium due him for bringing a recruit.

All the adverse elements and rebellious powers fly in confusion before him. After conquering the bogs of the State and outmanoeuvering the forces of the enemy, he planted his troops in the capital of South Carolina on Friday last; but he seems to have remained there only long enough to complete his work, and perhaps to offer up a Te Deum early on Sunday morning. For Lieut.-Gen. GRANT forwards to the War Department official rebel intelligence, published in the Richmond papers of yesterday, that upon Sunday SHERMAN's main force was striking north from Columbia, and was advancing toward Winnsboro, and toward Charlotte, in North Carolina, whither BEAUREGARD had fled. Another force had been also moved down the Charleston road, probably to threaten HARDEE, so as to hasten his evacuation of that city; and we have a brief but thrilling official dispatch from Admiral DAHLGREN, dated on Saturday last, that Charleston was then abandoned by the rebels, and that our forces were then on their way up to and into the city. Thus BEAUREGARD fled one direction and HARDEE in another; while the Southern papers show that those of the Palmetto chivalry who are not clad in gray, are fleeing westward into Georgia and eastward into North Carolina.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Sherman's Great Triumph."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Sherman's Great Triumph."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5da560c2-7dc9-5de7-bc56-df2853819d2e,691,nyt://article/5da560c2-7dc9-5de7-bc56-df2853819d2e

"ED. -- A very unusual opportunity is presented to the citizens of New-York, and one that claims from all a mutual and hearty cooperation. To get one's coal at the actual cost of mining, transportation and delivery, will save at present prices, $3 50 to $4 50 per ton. by subscribing to the Consumer's Benefit Coal Company, No. 71 Broadway. This, as an investment, should not be overlooked, and then too the principle of thousands of people combining together on the mutual plan as joint partners, thereby becoming one great company of individuals in furnishing so indispensable an article as coal at cost, must make the enterprise what it deserves to be -- a great success. As this is the season of year when yearly supplies of coal are contracted for, for the coming year, we would advise all such consumers to unite with this company and secure their shares before it is too late. The coal is unsurpassed for manufacturing and domestic purposes. Its long use in our community proves that there is no better coal for making steam or for domestic use. Of the quality of the coal all who have used it agree that there is no better nor finer coal. The veins of coal lay between strata of rock (and not of dirt as is usually the case) and thereby comes out perfectly clean and pure. We welcome this movement as worthy the confidence and cooperation of all who desire a good investment, and believe that the cash dividends (after delivering the coal to the shareholders) on the sale of the remainder of the annual product of the colliery, will reimburse the original cost of subscription in less than two years.

The railroad building contained 200 kegs of powder, which exploded with terrific effect, killing and wounding upwards of one hundred people. It is supposed that 6,000 bales of cotton were consumed in the warehouses. The dwelling houses in the lower part of the city were found to be completely riddled by our shot and shell. The wealthy part of the population had deserted the city, the poor who remained were suffering for want of food. The Stars and Stripes were raised over Fort Sumter by Capt. H.M.

SHERMAN, while he was conducting his great campaign in Georgia, last year. ""Amid the sound of battle,"" he recalls to his correspondent the days long gone by, when he knew her as a school-girl playing on Sullivan's Island beach, near Charleston, and says that then he little dreamed that he should ""control a vast army, pointing, like the swarm of Alaric, toward the plains of the South."" ""Why,"" he exclaims, ""oh, why is this?"" And he goes on to say that it is from no animosity toward the Southern people, though they call him ""barbarian, vandal, monster, and all the epithets that language can invent, significant of malignity and hate."" It is because of his devotion to the Government and to law -- because man must submit to some arbiter, and must not throw off his allegiance without just cause -- because the South bantered and bullied us to the conflict, and we were forced to accept battle, which, once begun, has gone on till the war has assumed proportions at which we stand aghast, but which, had we declined, America would have sunk back, coward and craven, meriting the contempt of all mankind. ""God knows,"" he says, ""how reluctantly we accepted the issue, but once the issue joined, like in other ages, the Northern race, though slow to anger, once aroused, are more terrible than the more inflammable of the South.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

The value of cotton now in port and en route from Savannah will probably exceed $15,000,000. The vessels in the harbor have on board about 15,000 bales, valued at $5,000,000. The cotton arrived is being stored in the Government warehouses on Staten Island, and temporary buildings are being erected near Quarantine for the accommodation of cargoes not yet provided for. The revenue cutter Crawford, Capt. KELLOGG, will go down this morning, from the Navy-yard, to guard the cotton on Staten Island. No arrangements have been made for the sale of the article, and the probabilities are that the cotton now in store will remain in possession of the Government for several weeks. Many of the vessels recently arrived from Savannah, not being able to find dock accommodations at Staten Island, have anchored off Sandy Hook. Some are at Jersey City and others are lying in the stream. Although the weather since the sailing of the cotton fleet from Savannah has been the most severe experienced along the coast for years, still not one bale has been lost.

"Amos R. Willetts et al. vs. The Sun Mutual Insurance Company. -- This is an action to recover the sum of $1,480 damages, alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiffs on account of the injury done to 223 barrels of cider. The facts of the case are as follows: In December, 1863, the plaintiffs shipped at this port, for Washington, by the schooner Francis Satterly, the barrels of cider above mentioned. At the time of shipment, the plaintiff applied for and obtained from the Sun Mutual Insurance Company, a policy which guarantied all the risks incident to the sea. Before leaving the port of New York, and after the insurance was effected, the schooner Satterly became unseaworthy and the cider was transferred to the deck of the schooner Charles Demise. By the latter vessel the cider was conveyed to Washington. When it arrived there it was in a greatly damaged condition. The plaintiffs, by the advice of Mr. Whitehead, President of the Sun Mutual Insurance Company, had the cider gauged, inspected and sold upon its arrival in the City of Washington. There had been no notice given by the shippers or their agents of the transfer of the cargo. It was badly damaged and sold for much less than the value. The important question in the case is whether the plaintiffs can recover for partial loss of goods, insured on a specified vessel, when the goods were transferred to another vessel without the knowledge or consent of the insurers.

But even the rebel newspapers do not represent that there is any wanton destruction, or any attempt of any kind to make the scourge of war fall with needless severity. The army holds on its resistless way in order and sobriety, pervaded with no other than the military spirit, seeking no other than military ends.

That day, like many a preceding one in our experience of the war, had opened dark, gloomy, lowering. Many of the best and most devoted friends of the Republic had begun to despond over the reverses which seemed to have no turning tide. At home there was an apparent indigence in everything like skillful enterprise or thorough executive action in our military leaders. Abroad there were thrown at us, from every quarter, taunts and jeers which were altogether ill to be borne. On all sides the prospect was as cheerless for the national cause as it well could have been. How much more of misadventure, of ill-success, or of sluggish routine, the nation could have borne before giving up its title to existence, we cannot presume to conjecture. Happily, the test of endurance to be applied to loyal men had been reached before that gloomy 16th day of February had closed. It was on that memorable date that Brig.-Gen. U.S. GRANT sent from his headquarters the following dispatch addressed to Gen. BUCKNER, commanding the rebel forces holding Fort Donelson.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Washington's Birthday The First and the Latest Great Victories of the War."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Washington's Birthday The First and the Latest Great Victories of the War."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': ""WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY"", 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b8f9d8a5-cd88-5834-9802-c461356a300b,601,nyt://article/b8f9d8a5-cd88-5834-9802-c461356a300b

"Admiral PORTER officially reports to the Navy Department, under date of Feb. 19, the evacuation of Fort Anderson on the night of the 18th, and its occupation by our troops on the morning of the 19th. On the 17th, Gen. SCHOFIELD, with a force of 8,000 men, moved up from Smithville and at the same time, Admiral PORTER attacked the fort with a portion of his fleet, the monitor Monadnock being placed closed to the works, and other vessels pouring in an enfilading fire. On the 18th, the fleet moved up still closer, and kept up a heavy fire during the day, silencing the fort by 3 o'clock. In the meantime Gen. SCHOFIELD moved around in the rear of the rebels, but they didn't wait to get caught, and hastily evacuated the fort during the night, leaving the heavy guns, mostly unspiked.

The manner in which the day was celebrated yesterday will long be remembered. The last four anniversaries of the event have been more or less overshadowed by gloom and doubts. The curse seemed to have fallen upon us; the blessings of peace, union and prosperity, which WASHINGTON left to us as an inheritance, seemed to have departed, and none could hopefully predict the time of their return. But the spirit of the people yesterday evinced a change, and, except among the few who wished it otherwise, the general opinion was that our days of trial were almost over. Four years ago Charleston resounded with noisy boasts that she would make herself the great commercial emporium of the American continent, and that her citizens, attracted by curiosity as tourists go to Rome, would come to New-York to see streets overgrown with grass and a city in ruins, bewailing the day when it offended South Carolina. Yesterday saw Charleston as black, desolate and uninhabitable a waste as the Cities of the Plain, and New-York one of the richest, most prosperous, gayest cities in the world, dressed out with streaming banners, pealing with joyous bells, brilliant with military pageants, commemorating the triumph of justice and truth over the miserably wicked folly of treason.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NATIONAL REJOICING.; Celebration of Our Victories and Washington's Birthday.

"Praed, W M; Poems; Mattie--a Story",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/23/archives/new-books-the-poems-of-winthorp-mack-worth-praed-revised-and.html,"Praed, W M; Poems; Mattie--a Story","Twenty-five years after the death of the writer, appears the first authentic collection of his poetical remains. It seems to have been retarded by the illness and death of Mr. PRAED's widow, as well as by the desire to make the edition as perfect as existing materials would admit. It now appears, superintended by the daughters of the poet, and inscribed to the memory of his widow, by whom some of his most beautiful verses were inspired in the first buoyancy of happy wedded life. PRAED's friends and school-fellows have all done their part, not less by identifying fugitive pieces of his composition, than by clearing away a mass of poems, the production of an imitator, wrongly attributed to him. The memoir, written by DERWENT COLERIDGE, has the sole disadvantage of being too brief, when looked at as the only record we are likely to receive of one that the world would willingly know more of. It is a matter of notoriety, that while this English edition has been in preparation, five or six different impressions of the poems, selected on internal evidence only, from the periodical literature of the day, were published in America. That the wide circulation they met with has kept alive the poet's fame, and perhaps been the means of procuring us this edition of his authentic versions, it is impossible to doubt. The fact, indeed, is acknowledged in the editor's notice. The poems themselves are too familiar to the American public to need criticism here. Many of those, however, now first published, show the versatility of the writer, and his power over the elements of feeling and pathos, in a higher degree than would be supposed possible by readers acquainted only with the gaiety and brillancy of his more widely-known compositions. If ever there was a born poet, it was certainly PRAED. What such natural and instinctive gifts and graces might have ripened into with genial culture, it is now impossible to say. By a strange perversity of judgment, it seems to have been the sole aim of his family and friends to convert a heaven-born poet into a middling second or third-rate politician and orator. They succeeded, indeed, but at the expense of the life of PRAED, who died confessedly from the injurious effects of late Parliamentary hours and over-exertion in political and legal affairs, on a frame always weak and delicate. Never was there a more complete realization of RETSCHZ's drawing, ""Pegasus in Harness,"" and there was the less excuse for it, because he belonged to a wealthy family, and was always amply provided for. It is a striking instance of the absolute want of any status in society conferred by literature in England -- the old complaint of men of letters, from POPE to THACKE[???]AY. It is easy to imagine how differently would have passed the poet's career in France There his exquisite talents, expanding in the warmth of genial appreciation, would have placed him on a height that politicians might in vain aspire to reach. Everything told us about the man is in keeping with his writings, and creates a desire for further revelations of his literary and social life. Prophecies are proverbially in safe, but it may be that when TENNYSON and BROWNING occupy the relative position to future generations that COWLEY and DONNE do to us, and are unintelligible without glossaries and commentators, thousands will delight in the sunny clearness and brilliancy, the airy fancy and unequaled felicity of diction, that distinguish the poems of WINTHROP MACKWORTH PRAED.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE POEMS OF WINTHORP MACK WORTH PRAED.

It goes down regularly and steadily, just as public confidence in the overthrow of the rebellion goes up. Every Union victory puts down gold, -- every Union reverse puts it up. But it is going down now quite as rapidly as is consistent with the public welfare. It has fallen fifty per cent. within three or four months, and is now falling even more rapidly. To this rate of depreciation the business of the country can accommodate itself, but a more rapid fall would prove disastrous. A sudden decline of thirty or twenty per cent. would ruin thousands of our most thriving and substantial business men, -- not because they have speculated in gold, but because the price of the property they bought when gold was high, goes down with it. We hope that before many months gold will be nearly at par, -- but to be safe the decline must be gradual. A sudden and heavy fall would sweep the business of the country like a hurricane. Steady, but slow and sure, is the kind of progress that we require.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DECLINE OF GOLD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DECLINE OF GOLD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a510c869-260a-517c-9a73-478c5e876165,201,nyt://article/a510c869-260a-517c-9a73-478c5e876165

"The unpropitious weather yesterday had no effect on the business of the County Volunteer Committee. From ten o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon, Supervisor BLUNT was busily engaged in receiving recruits and paying them their bounties. Under advice, most of the volunteers immediately upon receiving their money deposited it in some bank for the benfit of themselves or families, and the business of swindling recruits by brokers, who infest the enlisting stations, has almost entirely ceased. Yesterday one hundred and twenty-three men were sworn in by Supervisor BLUNT and the several Provost-Marshals; twenty-seven for one year, twelve for two years and eighty-four for three years. The men now being enlisted are immediately after receiving their bounties, furnished with uniforms, and their citizen's dresses are given to any person whom they may designate. This proceeding lends additional interest to the many queer scenes that happen daily at the City Hall Park recruiting stations. Waiting for old clothes has become one of the principal excuses of the hundreds lounging about Mr. BLUNT's office, and women are not unfrequently seen carrying off a man's entire wardrobe. The complaints made by friends of men who have been enlisted in this city and sent to other States still continue to be numerous, and more stringent measures are about being adopted by the Volunteer Committee to prevent our city being defrauded by unscrupulous brokers. It is understood that Mr. BLUNT intends to inaugurate a detective police, the men to be selected from the shrewdest brokers.

The Problem to Co e; Loyalty of Defeated Rebels,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/25/archives/the-problem-to-come.html,The Problem to Co e; Loyalty of Defeated Rebels,"-- Many of our people have very unreasonable expectations in regard to the loyalty of the inhabitants in Savan nah and other recaptured cities of the South. They complain that these people at heart do not love the Union a whit better than they did before their towns were taken. Why should they? The mere fact of conquest cannot be expected to change the hearts of those who have been defeated.

The bill is auxiliary to the Bounty Act which originated with the Senate. And it is now understood that all the necessary legislation has been secured to enable the Governor, in concert with the Comptroller and the banks, to obtain at once the necessary funds. This is satisfactory as far as most counties are concerned. As regards Kings County it is most unsatisfactory, simply because local effort seems to have been there suspended, in vain and delusive expectation of something turning up that would prevent the enforcement of the draft. Three days ago the Volunteer Committee of the Board of Supervisors presented their case to the Governor as one of hardship, and asked his influence to secure more time for volunteering, on the ground that the local bounty fund had given out just as the draft was upon the city. We have no doubt there is hardship in the case.

I find the name of Capt. CHARLES S. MONTGOMERY, of the Fifth New-York Veterans, a very gallant officer, and who had for some time commanded the regiment to which he belonged. This is the second commander that regiment has lost during the present campaign. Capt. MONTGOMERY's military career extends through the entire war, and his record was a noble one. Enlisting as a private in the celebrated Duryee Zouaves (Fifth New-York Volunteers) in April, 1861, he carried his musket at the battle of Big Bethel, and subsequently became a corporal. In the fall of that year he was promoted to a Second Lieutenancy, and in that grade served with distinction with his gallant regiment during the Peninsular Campaign in 1862. Received a First Lieutenancy at Harrison's Landing and subsequently a Captaincy, and while in command of his company at the disastrous battle of Mannassas Plains, was wounded and taken prisoner. He was soon after exchanged, and rejoined his company after the battle of Antletam; served in the battles of Fredericksburgh and Chancellorsville, and in May, 1863, returned with the Fifth New-York, at the expiration of its term of service, as senior Captain. On the reorganization of the Zouaves as a veteran regiment, he returned to the field as Captain, and would have been made Major had the command reached the maximum number. The regiment went into battle for the first time in this campaign at the battle of Bethesda Church, and up to the present time Capt. MONTGOMERY has been constantly in active service. He was killed at the head of his regiment as its commanding officer, and his loss is deeply felt in the division of which he had so long been a member. Had he lived, speedy promotion awaited him, as his reputation was very high, and he had been complimented repeatedly by his superiors for gallant conduct.

On the Political Force of Ideas,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/25/archives/the-political-force-of-ideas-lecture-by-prof-john-w-draper.html,On the Political Force of Ideas,"On Thursday evening Prof. DRAPER delivered the third of a series of lectures on ""The Historical Influence of Natural Causes,"" at the hall of the Historical Society, in the presence of a large and select audience. FREDERICK DE PEYSTER, President of the society, presided. The subject of last evening's lecture was ""The Political Force of Ideas."" The speaker said that philosophical conceptions of the material progress of man must not be considered entirely from a physical point of view. He proposed to show the political force of an idea, and how a sentiment, expressed in a few words, break up religions venerable for their antiquity, rearrange the places of men and revolutionize the world. Rome would afford a text, but he would direct his attention to the eastern shore of the Red Sea. After giving an interesting sketch of Arabia and its products, the lecturer spoke of the birth of MOHAMMED, whose history was to illustrate his subject. He rapidly glanced at his life, his early penury, and his subsequent marriage to an opulent widow, which enabled him to abandon his mercantile pursuits. Subsequently he grew melancholy, and became the victim of mental illusions, unseen visions and phantoms, until he warned his wife that he might become insane. The lecturer gave the different causes which produce mental illusions, which are chiefly occasioned by disease, but art also frequently superinduced by the use of opium, as was the case with DE QUINCEY, who saw vast processions pass before him, which were immediately followed by the theatrical representations of more than earthly splendor. In one of his visions MOHAMMED became impressed with the idea that his mission was to preach. His wife became his first convert; she was soon followed by a small band of believers, and since that time nine thousand millions have become followers of MOHAMMED. His religion was simple, embracing the idea that there was but one God, and MOHAMMED was his prophet. The last sentiment was the one the speaker was to consider. He gave a brief review of the rapid growth of MOHAMMED's empire, and said there was nothing wonderful in the propagation of thought from man to man. The time was opportune, and the occasion was improved by MOHAMMED. There is no political force like an idea; it can shake humanity to its foundation, and governs the world. The sword can never affect the opinions of men. In conclusion, the speaker said that, in America, so great has been our national prosperity, that until the rebellion began, we thought gold, iron and cotton were all powerful, and would guide the opinions of the world. At last our soldiers, our merchants and the people have learned that there is something more powerful in this world than wealth. Of what avail are all national products, unless driven on their way by the impelling force of ideas? [Applause.]",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Political Force of Ideas.; LECTURE BY PROF.

Financial Schemes and Resources,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/25/archives/rebel-finances-schemes-of-revenue-and-taxation-and-currency.html,Financial Schemes and Resources,"Two schemes of revenue, taxation and currency are proposed in Congress. That of the Financial Committee of the House of Representatives was set forth with some detail in these columns the other day. It proposed to raise three hundred million of dollars by a tax in currency, equivalent to one and one-fifth per cent. in specie on the old assessments of general property; and also to raise one hundred and fifty millions of currency by a tax on incomes, trades and special subjects. It proposed in addition to continue the present tax of one-tenth in kind. It estimated that these three classes of taxation would produce an aggregate revenue, in currency or commodities, of five hundred and ninety millions of dollars; and that there would be needed, beside this sum, for the current calendar year, about four hundred and seventy millions of dollars. This deficit was expected to be supplied; First, from the sale of six per cent. non-taxable bonds; second, from the use of deposits and loans on call certificates, under a new plan of deposits about to be instituted; and third, from the sale of Government cotton on band for specie or foreign bills.

Mr. BRACE, in his report of the Children's Aid Society just published, shows by the figures that juvenile delinquency is materially decreasing; and that, too, notwithstanding the vast increase of our city population, and the loss of natural protectors occasioned to thousands of young children by the war. Mr. BRACE goes back to the criminal records of 1855, and, comparing them with the last which are yet completed, he shows that, though the population of the city increased at least forty per cent. from 1855 to 1863, commitments for vagrancy decreased from 3,376 in the former year to 2,908 in the latter; commitments for petit larceny from 3,299 to 3,099; and that there was a decrease of twenty-five per cent. in commitments for pocket-picking. These comprise the principal offences that are committed by minors, though of course they are not committed by them exclusively. The increase occasioned by the orphanage and other unfavorable effects of the war, has been very slight. All the commitments to the City Prisons of those under twenty years of age, amounted in 1860 to 4,975; in 1863 to 4,998.

In this work, as in ""Il Trovatore,"" ""La Traviata,"" and ""Un Ballo in Maschera,"" we anticipate the verdict of London and Paris; a fact of no importance, in itself, but tending, at all events, to show the practical advantage of having a liberal and enterprising musician at the head of our principal musical establishment, instead of an entrepreneur who must, necessarily, follow, not lead. ""La Forza del Destino"" was written for the Imperial Italian theatre of St. Petersburg, and it was produced there on the 10th November, 1862. It is difficult to estimate the success of a work by its reception at the Russian capital; but cotemporary criticism was rapturous on the subject of its merits. Subsequently the work was played at Madrid, and again glowing accounts were received of its excellence. Both cities are -- comparatively speaking -- small, and the work did not ""run"" as it would have done in London, Paris, or New-York. Doubts were even expressed as to the genuineness of the favor thus twice recorded, Mr. MARETZEK nevertheless obtained the score, and after a careful examination declared that, in some respects, it was the finest work in the modern Italian repertoire.

BLISS, of the Union League, interested himself in the undertaking, and established at No. 385 Fourth-avenue the Soldiers' Rest. Previous to the opening of this institution there was, with the exception of the New-England Rooms on Broadway, and the Relief Association corner of Howard and Mercer streets, no place where discharged and furloughed soldiers could find a home except in the station-house or on the street. Hundreds of poor fellows, whose term of service had expired, found themselves suddenly turned adrift from a railroad train, and being penniless, were compelled to depend upon the charity of strangers or appeal to the Commissioners of Charities and Corrections. Strong men, unused to begging, who had fought for their country in many battles, reached New-York after being honorably discharged from the army, without sufficient means to buy food. They were consequently driven to beggary or starvation. The establishing of the Soldiers' Rest has resulted in the accomplishment of the long sought for object, and the weary soldier can now find a home until provided with employment or pensioned by the Government.

Price of; Price of Slaves in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/26/archives/the-price-of-slaves-in-the-south.html,Price of; Price of Slaves in,"-- The local trade in slaves appears to be anything but flourishing, if we judge from some of the latest authentic reports. We find a healthy negro, thirty-six years of age, going off at Salisbury, N.C., for $4,900, which, at the latest quotations for Confederate money is about $200; a negro girl, fifteen years, at the same time was knocked down for four hundred dollars less. Hiring rates, according to the Salisbury Watchman, are much higher in proportion than the selling prices. Black mechanics go off by the year at two thousand dollars in Confederate notes, or eighty dollars in money. This would seem to indicate that buyers think the hire of a negro for a year worth about half as much as his purchase for life. There is much meaning in this new proportion established between the hiring and purchasing rates in the slave market. In a business point of view, we think, the Salisbury dealers show great shrewdness. Getting the lease of the negro for one year is probably just as valuable an investment as getting a lease of him for life. A still more advantageous arrangement might be to hire these black hands, say for three or six months, or even a shorter term. Salisbury lies in the line of Gen. SHERMAN's march -- doubtless.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PRICE OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PRICE OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46ed4e7a-da86-5c1c-b75f-3a50306c271c,218,nyt://article/46ed4e7a-da86-5c1c-b75f-3a50306c271c

Lecture in Hoboken,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/26/archives/frederick-douglas-in-hoboken-lecture-on-prejudice-and-progress.html,Lecture in Hoboken,"FREDERICK DOUGLAS delivered a lecture, last evening, at the Odd Fellow's Hall, in Hoboken, before a large audience of ladies and gentlemen, who gave him a hearty reception. The speaker commenced by saying that the progress made and the charges wrought during the past four years were vast and wonderful. Great errors most hurtful to all parties, in respect to the character and possibilities of the colored race, had been swept away under the educating power of the rebellion. We had been living and moving at immense rate, and the work of an age had been compressed into a day. Millions of prayers had gone up to the Eternal Throne from bleeding hearts, desiring to see the day in which it was our privilege and our opportunity to live. Events had occurred so rapidly -- and overlapped -- and interlaced each other so thickly, that we are dazzled beyond the power of comprehending them. Only after coming generations, far remote from our stormy period of war, would we be able to appreciate and describe each separate event, and accord to each its true grandeur and importance. Four years ago we were upon our knees supplicating our Southern masters, blotting out with fears of penitence the most sacred laws upon our statute books -- laws for the protection of the hunted and helpless, innocent of crime. The lecturer thanked Heaven that we had lived to see the end at such humiliation. His object was to advocate the immediate and unconditional enfranchisement of the whole colored population of the United States, as an act of wise statesmanship and justice to the race. Time was precious and events were hastening. He would not waste time in the discussion of dead issues. To denounce the rebellion was cheap. To explain its causes was needless -- to eulogies our brave generals and our armies was unnecessary. The last rebel would soon be made to bite the dust or dance upon thin air.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Frederick Douglas in Hoboken.; LECTURE ON PREJUDICE AND PROGRESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Frederick Douglas in Hoboken.; LECTURE ON PREJUDICE AND PROGRESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-02-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/567bf192-d555-5fef-ad7b-695db0de4af8,370,nyt://article/567bf192-d555-5fef-ad7b-695db0de4af8

From his address, which was that of a young man of good breeding and considerable wealth, the family were led to offer him a parlor when he applied for board; but he chose a little chamber with ordinary furniture, and particularly desired seclusion. He appeared regularly at the family board at the usual hours, and was ever urbane and cheerful; but before the removal of the cloth he invariably sought his room, and spent nearly every evening therein, perfecting certain discoveries in window-glass staining. If he went abroad, he usually returned with a book or some other thing indicating that he had been at the Mercantile Library; but this seldom occurred. He seemed wedded to his room, and a light which nearly every evening shone thence far into the watches of midnight would indicate that he was busy therein. He never visited billiard-saloons, bar-rooms, or places of amusements, drank no wine, used no tobacco, and seemed altogether a gentleman whose tastes or pursuits led him to seek retirement.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REMARKABLE SUICIDE OF RENE GAUTIER.; He was Apprehensive of Arrest for Crime His Brother Killed in an Attempt to Take the Life of Louis Napoleon Inquest by Coroner Gover.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REMARKABLE SUICIDE OF RENE GAUTIER.; He was Apprehensive of Arrest for Crime His Brother Killed in an Attempt to Take the Life of Louis Napoleon Inquest by Coroner Gover.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7fc07c88-4e19-5b9f-8348-462a66fa303b,1573,nyt://article/7fc07c88-4e19-5b9f-8348-462a66fa303b

It says: ""If the Confederate guns are capable of comparison with our own, the question of ships against forts may prove to have been considerably advanced by these experiments."" Saying nothing about the quiet assumption in these words that that controversy can only be settled by English guns, we think the Times might have spoken more positively, for there was certainly one portion of the Confederate artillery as to which it ought to be satisfied beyond a doubt of the possibility of such comparison. We refer to the famous Armstrong guns, alleged to have been a present to JEFF. DAVIS, which were mounted in the forts, and which do not seem to have done much, if any, more execution than the others.

The case was heard at Special Term, and judgment given against the defendant. A reference was then ordered to Hon. John J. Hoffman, to ascertain the amount of the judgment and the value of the property, but the plaintiff objected to the referee on the ground of his intimate social and business relations with Horace F. Clark, Vanderbilt's son-in-law, one of the counsel, and also a witness in the case. The court then left it to the parties to select a referee, but, after trying in vain for two years to agree upon a suitable party, they were obliged to come into court again and ask for an appointment. Mr. Hoffman was reappointed, and plaintiff's counsel then addressed him a note, stating that while they had the highest confidence in his integrity and honor, their duty to their client compelled them to ask him to decline the appointment.

To a certain extent only is this true. So far as a superficial knowledge of the great elementary branches is concerned, there is no nation so universally educated. Our young people of both sexes, both in the cities and in the country, generally receive a rudimentary education; but if they require any instruction beyond this, if either their necessities or their aspirations require a deeper or more scientific education, they are compelled to pay for such instruction from their own resources. The State gives no opportunities for prosecuting studies that will fit them to enter into any of the so-called learned professions. It is true that the Government gives a most complete and thorough special education to a few young men who wish to enter either the army or navy; but their services are afterward required by the Government, and they are confined to the professions for which they were trained. The State of New-York has, we believe, made one exception to the rule just spoken of, and that was in the granting of the charter of the New-York Medical College. Their charter required (and we have heard that they always fulfilled the requirement) that the faculty of the college should annually educate, free of all charge, five of the graduates of the New-York Free Academy.

The Tribune cannot understand why any honest business man is to be injured by a precipitate fall of gold to par. Simply because business men have been compelled, if they would do business at all, to buy property at the high rates which the high price of gold has involved: -- and if they are compelled to sell it suddenly at very low rates, they are ruined by the operation. The Tribune, for example, may have bought printing paper at 20 cents a pound to last until July: -- if a sudden fall in gold and everything else compels it to reduce its price at once from four to two cents, it would lose very heavily by the operation. Now it may not have laid in any such stock of paper and so may escape; but merchants are compelled to buy very heavy quantities of goods at ruling rates, whatever those rates may be; and sudden changes, therefore, in the currency take them at a disadvantage.

to be dropped,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/27/archives/the-bankruptcy-bill.html,to be dropped,"-- The Senate, on Saturday, refused to make the Bankrupt Bill the special order for the ensuing session. This is equivalent to an intimation that the measure is to be dropped. We cannot say that we had any great hopes of a different result. Nothing was ever more clearly shown than that the great body of our citizens desire and pray for this, or for some measure of commercial relief. We do not speak alone of the almost unanimous opinion of the public press, nor of the deluge of petitions poured into Congress from all quarters in favor of the measure. We refer especially to the promptitude and energy with which the bill of last year was revived in the House at the opening of the present session. Congress had barely been assembled a week when the measure was taken up and passed by a vote of 76 to 56. Since that time the only outside opposition offered to it has come from one or two second and third-rate Boards of Trade, that professed to find in the measure the appliances for a general whitewashing of rebel debtors. To meet these silly averments, more argument was wasted inside and outside of the House than they were worth. The measure had to be killed to gratify certain local cliques. It will be for the new Congress to revive it and give the relief prayed for.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BANKRUPTCY BILL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BANKRUPTCY BILL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/577a777a-a2f0-597d-aa9e-92299b3fb0ec,234,nyt://article/577a777a-a2f0-597d-aa9e-92299b3fb0ec

Her dimensions are: Length between perpendiculars, 330 feet; breadth of beam, 43 feet 6 inches; depth of hold, 27 feet; 4,100 tons burden. The frame of the Montana is composed of white oak, chestnut and hackmetack; floor of oak, and solid the whole length of the vessel; futtocks of oak and chestnut, and top timbers of hackmetack. She is braced with diagonal iron straps 4 1/2 inches by 7/8 inches, running from heads of floors to heads of top timbers; longitudinal straps, 5 by 7/8 inches, runs completely around the vessel, at heads of timbers, connected with and thoroughly bolted and riveted to diagonal straps. She has nine tiers of keelsons running fore and aft, thoroughly bolted to the floors. The bed keelsons for engine are each 60 feet long, 6 feet 6 inches high, and 4 feet 9 inches wide. These bed keelsons contain about 45,000 superficial feet of timber, and the keelsons together contain nearly 100,000 superficial feet. The ceiling commences, at turn of bilge, 10 inches thick, and extends upward to upper deck-clamps, which are 8 inches thick. She has three complete decks, besides orlop decks. The beams of berth and main decks are of yellow pine, and the spar and orlop decks of white pine. The gallows frame is of yellow pine, with legs 22 inches square at head and 24 inches square at heels, built and fastened in the most complete manner, to support the engine. The outside planking of the ship is of oak; garboard streak 6 inches thick; thence to lower turn of bilge, 4 inches, and gradually increasing to wales, which are 6 inches thick. In order to increase her longitudinal strength, she has been double-planked from the flat of the floor to lower side of between-deck ports with oak planking 3 1/2 inches crossing the inner course, all strongly fastened with copper bolts and locust-tree nails, wedged both inside and outside. In point of workmanship, model and finish, this ship will compare favorably with any ever built at this port. Her engines, which are being constructed at the Novelty Iron Works, will be 105 inches cylinder, and 12 feet stroke of piston.

Only a few years ago it was considered good taste to cavil at, and take exceptions to the music of this great master. When ""La Traviata"" was produced, a writer on the weekly press stated -- after giving vent to all his contempt -- that if the management persisted in playing it he would not notice it again; so unworthy did it seem to him of any kind of distinction. After such a threat it was clearly VERDI's duty to have withdrawn from public life, or if he obstinately persisted in writing, to cancel the offending score in question. Instead of doing so, he has permitted ""La Traviata"" to become a favorite, and has given us ""Un Balle in Maschera,"" -- a work which many competent judges regard his best -- and ""La Forza del Destino."" Concerning the last, we have no hesitation in predicting that it will take its place for many years to come as one of the best standard Italian operas. It may not reveal the freshness of ""Ernani,"" or the exquisite feeling of ""La Traviata,"" but it is a firmer and better made work than either. Youth is prodigal; age is thrifty, and in the end it is thrift that we admire. How to make a little go a long way is the science of life, and all true art is human in this respect. It was knowledge that made MEYERBEER, not inspiration. For the first time VERDI places a value upon his own ideas. Instead of scattering them with idle programmes he selects the best and elaborates them with conscientious regard to their varying phases. There is a degree of strong, healthy coherence about ""La Forza del Destino"" which we shall seek in vain in his other works. The melodies are reticent, not blatant; they are vitally connected with the orchestral tissue, not trumpery excresences that may be cut out at pleasure. The ensembles are dramatic, and occur naturally, not artificially, at the end of each act. In short, the work exhibits the ripened knowledge of a master -- the careful intention of one who knows what he is about, and the indispensable charm of a natural melodist. A single hearing may pique curiosity, but it takes many hearings to fully gratify it.

On Effete Ministry and Public Morals,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/27/archives/a-sharp-discourse-by-the-rev-henry-ward-beecher-the-weak-and-effete.html,On Effete Ministry and Public Morals,"Yesterday was a field day at Plymouth Church, whose spacious auditorium was densely thronged by thousands of citizens from this and the adjacent cities. Mr. BEECHER's opening services were marked by a significant emphasis on all points which could in any way be connected with the events of the day, and long before the evening's discourse was begun it was evident to the impatient audience that a sermon practical and pointed in reference to things of living interest was in store for them. Taking for his text the words: ""For your field is the World,"" Mr. BEECHER commenced by defining his position in regard to creeds written and unwritten, to doctrines old and new, and to theology in general. He contended that creeds were of use, but were by no means sacred; that doctrines and forms were serviceable, and that liturgies and robes were not to be despised, for the very reason that plows, and hoes, and rakes are of use and service to the farmer, simply because he needs them; but further than this he could not admit. To him a gown would be an embarrassment physical, as a liturgy would be a hindrance mental, but so long as other people need them and enjoy them, it was not his business to ridicule or despise them. Branching from this, he alluded to the sacredness of days and ordinances, such as Sunday, fast days, peculiar modes of baptism, and so on, as of use simply to educate and assist Christians in their several lines of spiritual development, while mere is and should be no intelligent recognition of sacredness or holiness about them. ""This,"" said he, ""is an era of progress, and the church must be prepared for changes and improvements, as the body politic is, and as all human organizations have been since the dawn of Eden's sun. It has been customary for the great body of Christians to regard the church and its days and ordinances and its ministers as something different from everything and everybody. This is changing somewhat, and will change still more. Far be it from me to say a word or suggest a theory which can move one of Christ's littlest ones from the rock of ages or this firmest landmark of all time, the Bible; and I only fear lest I may be misunderstood when I say that from these old superstitions of our infancy, from this reverence of means, we must move, and that right speedily. Young men, you who are casting about for employment, and who seek to know by what avenue of life's labor you arc to become useful, avoid, I beseech of you, the overcrowded pursuits of the law, the bestuffed hospitals of medicine, the hot and dreary and unsatisfactory roads of merchandise. Remember that your ""field is the world,"" and look with me for a moment at the grandeur of your opportunities. No place in life is so full of possibility, so rich in promise, so powerful, so full of liberty as the pulpit. ""Oh,"" says some good, pious soul, ""now you're going to advise preaching politics."" Preaching politics! And why not? You have your little men in pulpits, who can preach of Moses and the prophets, who can show you the length and breadth of their creed, who can explain the meaning of this term, and of that text, who can talk learnedly of original sin, and of the wickedness of men who lived two thousand years ago; but where is the minister who teaches you of the duty of to-day -- who exposes the corruptions of the time in which you live -- who expounds the duty of the men before him? In what book or newspaper can you find aught concerning the manner of using a vote? With the exception of Dr. LIEBER, a man born in Germany, but bred in America, I know of no publicist who has taught the people understandingly on this vital question of American life. I have attended many councils where learned divines examined youthful candidates for orders, but I have never yet attended or heard one where a single question was put to test the fitness of the man as a teacher on the point most vital to his congregation. They ask him all about original sin, and the fall of Adam, and the superlapsus and the sublapsus, and test him as to whether he believes in natural grace or acquired grace, whether man is wholly depraved or only in part, and if the latter, where the depravity stops and what relation it bears to the rest of his nature -- but they never, never suggest a question which would indicate that the souls or bodies of the men of the nineteenth century are of the least possible moment. These ministers are easy made. The doctors take a little of the regulation dough, they mold it into a pretty little cake of exactly the right shape, pinhole it with the necessary number of orthodox holes, put it on a patty pan, shove it into a properly built oven, and, when it is baked, you have your pretty cracker ministers. Out on them, and out on such a system. We are living in a land and in a time of peculiar temptation. We are, as a people, given greatly to lying. Why, the range of white lies alone is wonderfully long, running not only through the highest octaves but way up into the harmonies, while the sub-base of black lies is simply tremendous. We must have a change in our public men, and not only in the lower classes of officials but even in the halls of our most exalted national council. I do not propose to make charges, but I cannot forbear saying that the tone of public morals is low indeed, when we hear glibly spoken of the bartering of votes on matters of great moral purport, making our legislatures literal shambles of infamy and disgrace.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Sharp Discourse by the Rev.

It is a bitter complaint on behalf of the Border States, that they have been deserted by the Gulf States in their struggle for independence. Thus far, says this organ of the rebel Executive, Virginia and the other Border States have borne the whole brunt of the terrible war, into which they were pushed, against their judgment and will, by the Gulf States. They wanted to avoid the war; for they knew how much of misery and ruin it would involve, and upon whom that ruin would fall. They wanted to consult, to take advice, to concert for united and deliberate action. But they were not permitted to do so. ""The States further South repelled advice, rejected concert, and cast Virginia and her children adrift amid terrific and increasing war."" ""Nothing,"" says the Enquirer, ""could check the selfish impetuosity of those who risked little of disaster to be endured by others.""

The train, consisting of nine long passenger cars and the usual luggage and other cars, was running at high speed, when the locomotive struck a defective or broken rail on a culvert, and in a twinkling seven of the passenger cars were hurled down to the valley from an embankment of about twenty feet in height. The locomotive, tender, and luggage cars leaped the broken rail and ran on three-quarters of a mile before the engineer could check them. The gentleman who gives us the information was asleep in one of the sleeping cars at the time of the accident, and his first impression, on waking, was that the entire train had been crushed into one car; but upon extricating himself from the human mass that pressed on him in every direction, he plunged through a window and landed, cut and maimed, in his midnight attire, in a snow-bank, and then saw that the train had been turned bottom upward. Around him were throngs of unclad, shivering men and women, and before him were the overturned and shattered vehicles, whence the frightened travelers were escaping through the windows. The passengers had so crowded upon each other, that the work of extricating them -- the car doors being locked, as usual, and the only mode of egress being through the windows -- was exceedingly difficult. In one car they were heaped one upon another, and the vehicle had taken fire from the overturned stove, and several of the last who were dragged out were nearly exhausted from suffocation. In another car two women were suspended by the overturned seat, on which they had been reclining, and it was necessary to enter the car to drag them from their perilous position.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FRIGHTFUL RAILROAD ACCIDENT.; Train Thrown Over an Embankment--Many Passengers Injured, Several Perhaps Fatally.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FRIGHTFUL RAILROAD ACCIDENT.; Train Thrown Over an Embankment--Many Passengers Injured, Several Perhaps Fatally.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ae7fa41-b69f-5bfd-85a6-80990074cb37,476,nyt://article/9ae7fa41-b69f-5bfd-85a6-80990074cb37

Removal of Lower Jaw by Dr. Raphael,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/02/27/archives/removal-of-the-lower-jaw.html,Removal of Lower Jaw by Dr. Raphael,"-- A remarkable surgical operation for necrosis of the lower jaw was performed in this city about a fortnight ago on a German boy twelve years of age, by the eminent surgeon, Dr. RAPHAEL, Professor of Surgery in the Thirteenth-street Medical College. This terrible and fortunately rare disease was induced by the fumes of phosphorus arising from lucifer matches -- the boy being a worker at the match-making business, and having had a tooth extracted over a year ago, which gave the malady the opportunity to gain a foothold in his system. The disease had been going on for thirteen months, until it involved nearly the whole of the lower jaw; and the external appearance of the boy was pitiful in the extreme, the face being swollen to greatly abnormal proportions, and pus exuding from large sinuses or openings along the line of the bone on the left side of the jaw. With difficulty the patient was gotten under the influence of chloroform, and when the bone was exposed from its upper left extremity to the middle of the chin, it was found that the whole mass was in the worst stage of disease. At the latter point the bone was severed with the saw, and a hope entertained of saving the right half of the jaw, or a part of it; but on examination, the disease was found to extend upward on that side also, and involved a farther removal of half of that half of the bone, which was also executed with masterly skill and great delicacy. The fleshy parts were then brought together with the suture, and tastefully dressed by the operating surgeon.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REMOVAL OF THE LOWER JAW.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REMOVAL OF THE LOWER JAW.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c936390c-a05b-5f89-ab3d-6a68fbdca307,359,nyt://article/c936390c-a05b-5f89-ab3d-6a68fbdca307

It appears that Mrs. BEISS came to this country recently, bringing with her about $3,000, leaving her husband behind to dispose of some property. She engaged in the Prescott House, Broadway, as a domestic, where the complainant, who was acquainted with her in the old country, visited her, and becoming aware that she had means, desired her to take a partnership in his business. Mrs. BEISS accompanied the complainant to Hoboken, taking along her effects, but after arriving there, declined to enter into partnership until she had an opportunity to see how the business prospered. On Saturday, as is alleged, BREFUSS desired to borrow $100, offering as security eight watches, which she declined. He then went out and shortly after returned and accused her of having stolen his watch, which she denied, and he then locked her up in a room, procured a warrant from Judge POPE and caused her arrest. After the arrest, Constable WHITNEY searched the woman's trunks and bedding thoroughly, but was unable to find the property. Persons in the same house stated that the accused had not left the premises. BREFUSS finally offered to withdraw the charge on her agreeing not to prosecute for false imprisonment, and on his part he agreed to publish an advertisement in the German papers stating that she was innocent, and thus the matter ended.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c9ea0c25-b7d2-51ce-a9b2-3cc2fea81479,555,nyt://article/c9ea0c25-b7d2-51ce-a9b2-3cc2fea81479

But no one who reads the rebel newspapers can doubt that he ""in spires"" their ablest and most brilliant leading articles. Their determination to be ""jolly"" under all circumstances is thoroughly and unmistakably Taplei-an. Every seaport they lose is so much clear gain. Every defeat they suffer is an advantage. The loss of the seaboard relieves them from the necessity of defending it. The stoppage of blockade-running relieves them from the necessity of paying for foreign supplies. The failure to get recognized by foreign nations concentrates their energies by throwing them back on their own resources. The defeat of HOOD released what was left of his army from duty in Tennessee, and enabled it to go where it was wanted more. The general military disasters which the Confederacy has recently suffered are of immense service to the cause, because they have forced DAVIS to make LEE General-in-Chief.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TAKING CHEERFUL VIEWS OF THINGS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TAKING CHEERFUL VIEWS OF THINGS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca9a33ab-3330-5c80-ab20-3a660538264d,478,nyt://article/ca9a33ab-3330-5c80-ab20-3a660538264d

Since then we have published a tepid proclamation from Gov. VANCE calling for assistance, and in this issue we give a chilly speech that the same functionary delivered at Goldsboro some ten days since. Gov. VANCE gave it as his unimpassioned opinion, that ""he who submits is a mean dog,"" and then mildly declared that he ""did not believe the people of North Carolina would submit."" He at once guarded and qualified this remark, however, by adding that ""when they understand the true issue, they will resist."" He soon thought it necessary to further bolster up his assertion, for it would seem he saw incredulity in the faces of his listeners. ""You think,"" said he, ""that I am speaking now to encourage you, and not to tell you what I expect."" He asserted, however, in the high-living style of Bunkum, that he did expect certain things, if certain things were so and so. The most decidedly cheerful part of this decidedly cheerless speech, is where, immediately after making the able remark that ""the voice of the people is the voice of God,"" VANCE goes on to exclaim: ""Four hundred thousand men -- living men -- were on the muster-rolls of the Confederacy, and almost one-half of them were absent."" We cannot, of course, dispute the proposition as to the ""voice of the people,"" but we would like to Know how we shall interpret the ""voice"" of the Southern people, if those of them who remain at home spend their time in dolefully repeating to each other ""we are nearly whipped,"" -- if furthermore, the ""women of the country"" will not stop ""writing letters to their husbands in the army, making them discontented;"" and if, beside all this, two hundred thousand out of the four hundred thousand troops in the rebel armies are ""absent"" -- not in mind, but in body; in other words, are deserters, and that, too, at this Confederate crisis; we should certainly say that under such circumstances the Confederate ""voice' is not as clear and harmonious in its tones as the occasion and the comparison demand.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'North Carolina.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'North Carolina.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'North Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-02-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e39f7cb-f7cb-5ee3-be37-7ce395d6742c,666,nyt://article/1e39f7cb-f7cb-5ee3-be37-7ce395d6742c

The flooring was extended over the orchestra seats, which, with the stage, gave ample space for dancing. In the rear of the stage was an Italian colonnade, in front of which were two terraces -- the upper one surmounted by gas lights, held by groups of children. In front were vases of green vines and gold fish, while in the centre was a posture of natural flowers. Over the stage was the word ""Charity"" formed by gas jets, in large letters, which was very beautiful. Around the boxes were festoons, vases of flowers. BRADY also adorned the house with many of his beautiful photographs, among which was a group of the lady managers of Sanitary Fair, many of whom are also managers of the Nursery and Child's Hospital. The guests began to assemble at an early hour, in full dress, and until 10:30 o'clock the line of coaches filled Fourteenth-street to Fourth-avenue. At that time the scone was most brilliant, the many gas-lights, rich decorations, and costly and magnificent toiletes of the lad[???] presenting a beautiful spectacle. The worth, the intelligence and the beauty of the great metropolis were ill well represented. The arrangements were excellent, carefully avoiding all confusion. The following were the executive committee: George Griswold Gray, Arthur Leery, Henry Clews, John Pyne, Daniel Kingsland, Peter Maric, Wm.P. Salboys, and James F.
