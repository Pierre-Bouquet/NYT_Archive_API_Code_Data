Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions Report,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/02/archives/local-intelligence-moving-day-and-the-weather-will-some-pied-piper.html,Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions Report,"Moving day yesterday proved to be most unpropitious for such unfortunate mortals as were compelied to change their abodes. Many persons differ as to the amount of moving which took place, but it was evident that there was less than on former May Days. This was owing to several causes, the chief one of which was the small number of dwelling-houses erected during the year. For several years past there has been a great scarcity of first-class houses, the increase of building not keeping pace with the augmenting population of the city. During the past year building has been still more limited, owing in great part to the high prices of material and labor. Landlords naturally took, advantage of the great demand for dwellings, and advanced their rents from twenty to thirty per cent., and in many instances still more. The increase was so uniform that tenants found it as profitable to remain and bear the extra burden as to move, pay an equal percentage to a new landlord, and suffer the expense and destruction of furniture incidental to moving. Many changes, however, took place last week in the upper part of the city, so that the full extent of the moving was not apparent yesterday. Such as were unfortunately classed with the migratory body suffered even more than the ordinary vexations and annoyances usually incident to that most unsatisfactory task. The drizzling, chilling rain made everyone fell uncomfortable and ill-natured, including that most amiable class, the carmen, and soaked many of the beds and blankets upon which the weary housewives rested their aching heads and tired bodies last night. Scores of coughs will be one of the legitimate results of moving day this year.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Moving Day and the Weather. Will some Pied Piper Appear?

The action was commenced nearly a year ago, in the Superior Court, by George, the Count Joannes, against Stephen R. Fiske, who was then connected with the New-York Leader, to recover the sum of $25,000 damages, alleged to have been sustained by the Count by reason of a libelous article published in the Leader on the 7th of May last. The suit was brought in the Superior Court, the defendant put in no answer, and when it came up before that tribunal in the ordinary manner, it was referred to a Sheriff's jury to assess the damages which had been sustained by the Count, all the allegations in the complaint being admitted by the defendant's not having put in an answer. The only question now was the amount of damages which the Count had sustained, and as the Sheriff charged, it was a part of their duty to look into the evidence and satisfactorily ascertain for themselves whether or not there was any malice in the publication of the alleged libel. The article complained of has been several times published in this journal in connection with the sull, and we refer to it now merely that our readers may see the points in controversy. The Court brought an action in the Common Pleas against the editors of the New-York Tribune, which was tried in February last, for having published substantially the same matter now charged upon the Leader. The result in the court last named, was a verdict for the defendant.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEORGE, THE COUNT JOANNES.; HIS LIBEL, SUIT AGAINST THE LEADER.

Meeting South with Liberality,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/03/archives/the-present-spirit-of-the-southits-auspicious-aspect.html,Meeting South with Liberality,"The people in all parts of the South, heard from since the surrender of LEE, accept the new situation with a good spirit. It is true there is little positive exultation. That could hardly be expected from a proud people, who have been overborne in arms. But there is an acquiesence which is yet more manly -a frank acknowledgement that further opposition is useless, and a readiness to take the oath without reserve. This is the general disposition both in town and country. Of course there are numerous exceptions. In the diversity of human nature, this could not be otherwise. There was never a public feeling yet that was strictly universal. Nor is it of any practical account that this should be so. Very few of the exceptions are found in that class of men who are capable of exercising a public influence; and these few can easily he visited with penalties for the past, and subjected to regulations for the future, that would entirely disable them from all power for mischief.

In the very face of victory, with gold in the forties, with labor comparatively cheap, with expenses of every sord reduced and on the eve of a long and prosperous season, these men deliberately profits from the pockets of their pations, and evince themselves mean in their avarice and unscrupulous in their pecuniosity. From the scriptural days of Solomon, who was accustomed to the best of everything, and who said, ""As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him,"" to these days of camp and hospital suffering, and of luxurious living, ice has been a necessity and a prominent article of commerce. With some, ice simply indicates the congelation of a fluid, a crystalline pyramidic prismatic formation, unavoidable in cold latitudes, pleasant for the use of skillful boys, and helpful to the iron-bound cutter or sled; to Solomon and to those of us who are disposed to regard that eccentric monarch as a well-informed and thoroughly cultured person, ice had and has a different significance. Cold water on the table, cooling pillows for the sick, antiseptic layers for meats and fruits, cobblers, juleps and smashes, neat plates of well moulded butter, wines not flat but bright and sparkling; these are the consequence of ice -- ice which gives useful refreshment to the parched lip and the burning brow; which has carried in triumph thousands and tens of thousands of our wounded soldiers from the hospital cot to the cot where they were born; which has eased the fretted brain of the dying, and lightened the sufferings of the sick; which saves annually millions of dollars from waste in this city alone, and which is now being used by the iron hand of monopoly as a lever of avarice and extortion.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ICE TRADE.; The crop Excessive, the Price Outrageous, the Dealers a Monopoly An Inside View of the Whole Matter--Interesting Statistics and Startling Figures.

Mr. Miles was a native of Watertown, N.Y., and was known while quite young for remarkable talents as a school-teacher and miscellaneous writer. Ten or twelve years ago he made a trip in Northern Europe, visiting the slightly out-of the-way region of Iceland. His observations in this strange land of snow and fire were published in a pleasant book of the gossippy sort, which attracted considerable attention. Of late years Mr. MILES devoted his time and talents almost entirely to the improvement of our postal system, with a view (until the breaking out of the war made it for the time impracticable) of achieving his grand idea of one cent postage on half-ounce letters for any distance. He was a plain but forcible writer, depending upon a laborious array of facts, rather than rhetorical effort. In person he was a striking figure -- tall, thin, of nervous-sanguine temperament, wearing a beard that never scraped acquaintance with a razor; a rapid walker, keen observer, talking with wonderful volubility, always cordial, open-hearted, and everywhere welcome for his agreeable social qualities.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; DEATH OF PLINY MILES, THE AMERICAN ADVOCATE OF CHEAP POSTAGE.

We learn of the early opening of an international line from New-York to Genoa, taking in Madeira and Cadiz as calling places; and so well do the Italian Government think of this enterprise that they have guaranteed for the company 4 per cent. interest on a capital of one million dollars. The first-class passenger traffic on such a line ought itself to form a good basis for a paying business. The trade of Cadiz, the principal commercial city of Spain, would unquestionably receive a large development from a direct intercourse by steam with this city. At present, we believe, it barely exceeds thirty million dollars, while that of Genoa has reached close to eighty million dollars. The great matter for this company to aim at will be to inspire confidence in the safely, the regularity and the thorough discipline of their line. It is useless, hereafter, for any company, we care not what financial guarantees it operates under, what promises of traffic, in freight and passengers, it has to open with, or what parade it can make in the shape of a directory, to overlook the fact that the public will demand thorough reliability in the working of the enterprise. To insure this, much more is needed than a magnificent fleet of fast vessels. Ships of moderate size, of moderate pretensions to decoration, and even of moderate speed, will do well enough to make a commencement with, provided there is the assurance, first, that they are properly manned, and commanded by officers of thorough experience, character and authority; second, that the line, when it does start, shall run at regular intervals, on stated days, and not be the subject of spasms, and breaks, and unforeseen delays; third, that the company shall compute, beforehand the full extent and depth of their resources, so that they shall not make the lack of public subsidies an excuse for failure.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ocean Steamship Enterprise--NewYork, Genoa, Madeira and Cadiz.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Ocean Steamship Enterprise--NewYork, Genoa, Madeira and Cadiz.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62812fc1-cbf6-5d4e-8d0a-cc02884ef1a8,652,nyt://article/62812fc1-cbf6-5d4e-8d0a-cc02884ef1a8

Mr. SCHILLER was insured for $300 in the Manhattan office, and WENCEL, who had packed up his goods and made them ready for removal, had $600 insurance in the Hamilton office.

It will be remembered that at the Saratoga meeting, last year, the hurdle race (dignified by the title of a steeple chase) was the great exciting feature of the meeting -- eliciting a display of enthusiasm not usually manifested on a race-track, and requiring an amount of skill and hardihood to which ordinary flat racing is mere child's play. The steeple chase is a thoroughly English institution, and none but a man accustomed to follow the hounds over ""moss and fell"" -- over brook, ditch, fence, stone wall, and through thicket -- would venture in the saddle, however competent he might be to steer a thoroughbred on the ordinary level race course.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.; The Paterson Spring Meeting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.; The Paterson Spring Meeting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8b7f1d20-e7cb-53bb-a4e0-6f7f512e2dd9,853,nyt://article/8b7f1d20-e7cb-53bb-a4e0-6f7f512e2dd9

Flight of and Price on his Head,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/04/archives/the-flight-of-jeff-davisthe-price-set.html,Flight of and Price on his Head,"ON HIS HEAD. -- The news that STONEMAN's cavalry had got on the track of JEFF. DAVIS, on his way to Charlottesville, S.C., was promptly followed yesterday by a proclamation of the President, declaring the existence of proof which implicates the fugitive rebel in the assassination of Mr. LINCOLN, and offering a reward of one hundred thousand dollars for his capture. The proclamation links together in the murderous plot the names of DAVIS, JACOB THOMPSON, CLEMENT C. CLAY, GEORGE N. SANDERS, BEVERLEY TUCKER and W.C. CLEARY, rewards amounting to one hundred and ten thousand dollars being offered for bringing to trial the five agents of the Confederacy included in the list of conspirators. We cannot doubt that the proofs on which this official announcement is made are all-sufficient; otherwise their existence would not have been proclaimed. The public will hardly be surprised that the murder is to be brought home directly to the leading rebels. Anyone who has carefully followed the progress of the conspiracies for burning down the Northern cities, for making indiscriminate havoc on all the railways of the North, and for doing secret murder by every available agency, will be forced to the conclusion that the Kennedys, the Bealls, the Booths, and the Harrolds were all the hired and desperate instruments of the Richmond conspirators -- organized and drilled for the service by the ""Peace Missionaries"" in the neighboring provinces.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FLIGHT OF JEFF.

The injunction is understood to have been based upon the opinion of the Attorney-General of the State that the law is unconstitutional, inasmuch as it exempts the City of Brooklyn from its operation, and leaves New-York alone under the control of the Metropolitan Fire Commissioners, virtutually making them city officers, who, according to the State Constitution, can only be elected by the people or appointed by such authorities of the city as the Legislature shall designate. Without attempting to dispute whether this point of the opponents of the law is well taken or not, it seems very clear, from the spirit which actuated the representatives of the Fire Department at their meeting on Wednesday evening, that the attempt to establish any paid system will meet with factious opposition. Chief-Engineer DECKER and his colleagues announced their determination, even before the injunction was obtained, to recognize in no manner the authority of the new commissioners, and to hold tenaciously, in spite of law, the control of the old department and its property, threatening with immediate disbandment any company which might be found favoring the new order of affairs. We can assure the members of the Volunteer Fire Department, that in yielding to this improper spirit, they are committing a grave error, which will condemn them before the public, whose good opinion, in so far as they, as a body, are entitled to it, has never yet been withheld.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT--A TEMPORARY; INJUNCTION.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT--A TEMPORARY; INJUNCTION.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1dee464d-bb93-5fe8-945b-a820dfab8ba9,351,nyt://article/1dee464d-bb93-5fe8-945b-a820dfab8ba9

Chamber of Commerce and National Affairs,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/05/archives/the-chamber-of-commerce-and-national-affairs.html,Chamber of Commerce and National Affairs,"There is no doubt much to be said in favor of the expression of the sentiments of such a body as the New-York Chamber of Commerce upon the question of restoring peace throughout the country. Every commercial man is interested directly in the revival of industry in the South, which promises to follow the closing up of the war. And it is altogether proper for the Chamber to recognize, by a formal resolution, the promptitude and liberality which dictated the recent order of the President, relieving well-disposed citizens in the late seceded States from unnecessary commercial restrictions. But we doubt whether resolutions affirming of deprecating a particular line of policy on the general question of pacification, can be introduced into such a body with advantage. The future management of the South involves problems which can hardly be disposed of in a few hastily considered propositions. The question, moreover, is one which will mark the great division line hereafter between opposing parties. Of this fact the members of the Chamber themselves had practical evidence yesterday in their own body, one set of resolves being adopted apparently to neutralize the effect of another set, and thus establish something like a party equipoise.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND NATIONAL; AFFAIRS.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND NATIONAL; AFFAIRS.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ec6eb40-8e68-5d72-ab7c-f6fcb8b8f977,342,nyt://article/5ec6eb40-8e68-5d72-ab7c-f6fcb8b8f977

No such picture of national mourning has, probably, ever been witnessed before. None such will, probably, ever be witnessed again by the living generation.

"A long official report on the Russian epidemic has been published at St. Petersburgh, in answer to a series of seven questions put by the English Ambassador to the Russian Administration. To the first question, as to the names by which the epidemic is known, the reply is that it presents simply the ""typhoid character with different modifications already known, such as typhoid fever, petechial typhus, bilious typhoid fever (the bilioeses zyphoid of the Germans,) fievre recurrente (febris recurrens,) in German recurrirende Fieber, and in English relapsing fever."" Russian acquaintance with the latter fever is due chieftly to English physicians. In reply to the second question, it is stated that, although the relapsing fever had never before been known in St. Petersburgh, it had declared itself at various times since 1840 in other parts of Russia -- at Moscow, at Novo-Archangelsk in Russian America, and last year at Odessa. At present it prevails in various places beside the capital, along with petechial typhus. In reply to the third question, the relapsing fever, simple and bilious, it is stated, like typhus in general, to have shown itself to be contagious. Only two deaths have occurred among the physicians, and a few among the attendants and nurses. In reply to the fourth question the following particulars are stated. They have mostly already been published, but it is desirable to snow what portion of the various unofficial statements has received official confirmation:",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/05/archives/the-epidemic-in-russia.html,,"A long official report on the Russian epidemic has been published at St. Petersburgh, in answer to a series of seven questions put by the English Ambassador to the Russian Administration.

A second injunction was also obtained on behalf of the people of the State, restraining the new Fire Commissioners from acting in their capacity as such. These injunctions are, of course, merely temporary ones. They were obtained by Attorney-General COCHRANE, acting in behalf of the people of the State, and thus far they are wholly ex parte. The object of the injunction, we understand, is to test the constitutionality of the law creating the new commission. All the legal questions involved will be fully argued and determined before and by the Supreme Court, at an early day. Mr. WM.H. WILSON, of No. 125 Bowery, and JAMES E. NOLAN, of West Twenty-seventh-street, signed the bonds required to obtain the injunction order.

He asserts that he knows that no other amounts of specie, not in the pockets of its owners, were taken from Richmond, and that this lot was all stolen. He states further, that the amount has been vastly over estimated, and confirms the statement heretofore made by Gen. GRANT, that it amounted only to $200,000. Col.

"The trees in our streets and squares will soon be in full leaf, but how long they are destined to remain clad with verdure depends on the greater or less degree of vigor with which that intolerable nuisance, the measure-worm, prosecutes its ravages. Many suggestions for the destruction of the worm have been made, and not a few tried, but without success. In Brooklyn, a few years ago, small troughs were placed around each tree, and filled with oil, but without any perceptible effect in protecting the trees from the attacks of the worm. The eggs from which the measure-worm is produced are deposited by the ""miller"" moth in the bark of the trees during the previous Summer, and are warmed into life by the power of the sun during the ensuing Spring. No sooner do the leaves expand than the worm, which grows with their growth, attacks them, and in two or three weeks the tree is divested of its foliage. It is known that where birds are plentiful, the worm never becomes troublesome, in the Central Park the trees preserve their foliage to the end of the season. The birds feed on the worm, and thus prevent its undue increase. But birds cannot be induced to remain in the populous parts of our cities.

This remedy has been successfully applied, and there appears to be no reason why our steam fire engines should not be brought into play against this rapacious and disgusting creature.

Tyng, Jr.","Passengers by the New-Haven or Harlem Railroad may have lately observed an edifice going up in East Forty-second-street, in the immediate neighborhood of the depot, the exact purpose of which may have puzzled them somewhat, the walls being so low and the roof crowned with a ventilating turret so cut up with gables and valleys. This edifice is the Church of the Holy Trinity, erected for Rev. STEPHEN H. TYNG, Jr., from the designs and under the superintendence of W.J. WREY MOULD, architect, and is most admirably adapted to the requirements of the congregation for whom it has been built. The enterprise, commenced under circumstances of no little discouragement, and carried forward through many difficulties, has been singularly blessed, both in its spiritual growth and its temporal affairs. A year ago last January a proposition was made to the young pastor, then Rector of the Church of the Mediator, to unite with the Church of the Ascension in establishing a new Episcopal Church on Murray Hill. The chapel of the Rutgers Institute had been alraedy engaged and opened for public services under the supervision of Dr. DYER, of whom the present rector speaks with affection, as really the father of the parish. It was then thought that five years at least would be required to establish the enterprise in an edifice of its own; but the encouragement met with was such that on the 4th of April following it was decided to organize a new, independent parish, under the title of the Church of the Holy Trinity. On the 1st of May Rev. Mr. TYNG was invited to serve as rector, and on the 8th of September the corner-stone of the present edifice was laid, at the northeast angle of the intersection of Madison-avenue and Forty-second-street. The plan is that of a cross, with four entrance porches filling up the angles made by the transepts with the nave or main body of the church, Extreme length, 127 feet; width of nave, 40 feet; extreme breadth through transepts, 81 feet. There are one hundred and sixty pews, seating over nine hundred persons, all on the ground floor. The walls of the church are low, and the building, as approached from Murray Hill, presents a somewhat stunted appearance; but on entering the interior proves sufficiently lofty, the roof trusses being framed so as to show. There is a ventilating spire for light and air at the intersection of the nave and transept roofs, forming an elevated central feature to the whole composition. The organ and choir screen form the sole decorative features of the interior, and are situated behind the chancel and altar -- the radiating pipes of the organ being decorated and illuminated, and so disposed as to show the rich stained-glass windows in the extreme rear wall. Mr. MOULD has not assumed to embody any features of the so-called Gothic, Byzantine, Italian or renaissance styles, but simply such a combination of architectural elements as are best adapted to produce a temporary, economical and yet commodious church building, in which design he has succeeded very thoroughly; indeed for charming novelty of effect, and a cheerfulness of interior aspect that most effectually combines the church with the home, we know of no ecclesiastical edifice in the city at all comparable to it; and we earnestly advise our readers to take an early opportunity of visiting it. Divine service has been held there since Easter Sunday, although the building is not yet quite complete. A word for the trustees: they had the good sense to go right straight to Mr. MOULD and place the commission in his hands, without beating about the bush, consulting the ideas, and exciting the hopes of half a dozen architects -- as is too often the case. How excellently Mr. MOULD has carried out their wishes, every one connected with the Church most willingly testifies, and we feel sure the general public will sustain their verdict.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Church of the Holy Trinity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Church of the Holy Trinity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79606bc2-f6f7-56ac-8ed7-0ee47ef49ff3,697,nyt://article/79606bc2-f6f7-56ac-8ed7-0ee47ef49ff3

DIX's headquarters in Bleeckerstreet, any day after the arrival of a transport from the South. A day or two since we were present when a batch of Southerners, some thirty in number made their appearance forlorn and desolate, seeking aid and comfort. Men, women and children, dirt, squalor and vermin, wretchedness and discomfort. In the lower hall were several ordinarily good looking men, whose long hair fell disheveled over gaunt faces and hungry eyes; their garments were of gray homespun, worn, threadbare and ragged, into whose very fibre the dirt from without and the uncleanliness from within, had worked and become ingrained. They stood listlessly waiting for somebody or something to turn up; they were from the broad belt of destruction made by the track of SHERMAN's army; their homes were burned, their properly gone, their means of subsistence entirely swept away, and their [???] and preserved by the kindness of the General, who pitying their helplessness took them with him to the coast and ordered them North. The women differed in this respect, that while their husbands presented an unbroken front of abjectness, they varied, some seem'ng bright and hopeful, some morose and sullen, others simply downcast and broken-hearted. The children played about the hall, crept up the stairway guarded by the orderlies, peeped at the prim face of Col. Van Buren, looked wistfully at the door of Capt. RIVES' office, wherein went their parents to take the oath or obtain transportation, grasped eagerly the piece of biscuit extended by a friendly hand, or cuddled close to their mothers and cried for rest.

SALA says distinctly that SANDERS told him of the plotting of atrocities which would make the world shudder. These atrocities have been committed; and, if SANDERS desires to save his own neck, he may turn States' evidence against his Confederates. He knows who planned the murders. He boasts of knowing it.

NOTT, Judge of the Court of Claims (and late Colonel of United States Volunteers) and the Executive Committee of the Protective War Claim Association. It shows the interest a true officer takes in the welfare of those who have risked their lives, and, in many instances, given their limbs in behalf of their country; and we hope it may awaken a responsive echo in the public heart. Now that the war seems to be drawing to its close, and the fair presumption is that not many more of our noble volunteers will be disabled in their country's service, there may be a tendency to forget, in a most important particular, those who have saved the life of the nation. This must not be. Hundreds and thousands of worthy men are returning to their homes from battle-fields where they have received the stroke which unfits them for the duties formerly performed by them, and it now rests with us as individuals, and as a nation, to see that these men shall be provided with work suitable to their crippled condition. We appeal to every private individual and public officer, to see that every situation at their disposal shall be filled by men who have served their country, in preference to those who have not raised an arm in its defence, but who have, during the past four years, lived in ease and safety. Our returned braves have a claim upon us; they have served us faithfully, and it is now our duty to serve them, and we urge upon all, who require employes, to apply at the ""Bureau of Employment for Disabled and Discharged Soldiers and Sailors,"" No. 35 Chambers-street, where can be furnished men of all grades and conditions.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bureau of Employment for Disabled and Discharged Soldiers and Sailors.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bureau of Employment for Disabled and Discharged Soldiers and Sailors.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6199b854-76e2-5983-8769-fcfbfddf50e4,620,nyt://article/6199b854-76e2-5983-8769-fcfbfddf50e4

"Disbandment of, Astonishing the World",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/07/archives/astonishing-the-world.html,"Disbandment of, Astonishing the World","It seems that this country is never able for any length of time to avoid ""astonishing the world."" We suppose this must be the real ""mission"" of the United States. The nations of Europe are rarely astonished at anything that takes place in Asia or in Africa. It is rare that any one of them is astonished at anything that takes place in any other one. But all of them seem to be in a condition of ceaseless astonishment at each and every successive development of affairs in the United States. Before the war we astonished them all by our industrial and peaceful republican glories; during the war we have astonished them every day by the wonderful exploits of our soldiers and sailors. We astonished them at the close of last year by carrying through a political campaign and Presidential election in the very heat of the war -- votes being cast, in thousands of cases, in the brief lull of battle; and last month we astonished them by the regularity with which the administration was continued, and the orderliness in which the country maintained itself after the assassination of the Chief of the State. The steamer of yesterday took out a new astonishment for these unhappy people -- the news, that though our gigantic war is but a few days over, we have already begun the disbandment of the great Army of the Union. On this point the Army and Navy Journal of yesterday pertinently remarks: ""In a few weeks a very large part of those gallant soldiers who have saved the country from destruction, and crowned it with unfading laurels, will be dispersed. They will go to improve the coming season in tilling the land they have saved, and to set an example of loyal and useful citizenship, such as only our army of citizen-soldiers can furnish. The most singular and striking aspect of the whole scene is, however, the perfect assurance, self-confidence, and independence of foreign criticism, advice, or action, which the country shows in this course. For a month past the English and French press has been filled with articles on the relations of the United States with Canada on the one hand, and with Mexico on the other. All the possibilities of an invasion in either direction have been canvassed. The fall of Richmond, momentous and decisive as it was on the rebellion, was but briefly discussed, in press or in public, upon its intrinsic importance, but its possible influence on the Canada question and the Mexican question, became of the profoundest interest. Like men guilty of beating an antagonist already in a death-struggle with a powerful opponent, and who fear, when he has thrown his adversary to the earth, that he will serve upon them well-merited punishment, England and France watch with intense anxiety the future course of America. What will be the astonishment of those countries when they see that this Western Republic, without the slightest regard to their hopes or their fears, their predictions or their costly preparations, without regard to the daily and excited discussions in Parliament and in the Corps Legislatif; and at the very moment when upon this Mexican and Canadian question, the French Government has proposed an offensive and defensive alliance to protect MAXIMILIAN's ill-gotten Franco-Austrian empire on the one hand, and to protect Canada on the other, our self-reliant republic disbands its armies, sends home its faithful soldiers, closes its recruiting tents, stops its contracts for material, and prepares to abandon the gloomy path of war for the broad and shining highway of peace?""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': '""Astonishing the World.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '""Astonishing the World.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/662923d3-ad81-5668-8f66-442963318cdd,665,nyt://article/662923d3-ad81-5668-8f66-442963318cdd

"Mill, John Stuart, on Parliamentary Reform",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/07/archives/john-stuart-mill-on-parliamentary-reform.html,"Mill, John Stuart, on Parliamentary Reform","Mr. JOHN STUART MILL, as our readers are aware, has been brought forward in the Liberal interest as a candidate for the representation of Westminster in the British House of Commons. For such a position Mr. MILL is believed to be fitted not less by his profound training as a student of political science, than by his long experience in a vastly important department of the civil administration -- that of the government of India. By his opponents Mr. MILL's unequated skill as a reasoner is readily admitted. But he is represented as a mere theorist, whose views are so far from being practical, that even the most advanced of his own party would not dare venture to follow where he would lead. There is just a grain of truth in this estimate of his character as a politician, sufficient to give plausibility to the objections urged against his candidature alike by Tories and so-called Conservative Whigs. Mr. MILL is unquestionably far in advance of his party on all the broad questions of political philosophy. But he has never sought to conceal from himself or from others that he does not expect, in the present state of public education in England, to carry into practical effect a tithe of the reforms which he thinks will one day be introduced into the fundamental laws of the United Kingdom. He might be called a visionary, were he going to Parliament to urge the introduction of what has been called a ""fancy franchise."" But he proposes to accept a seat in the House of Commons -- if it is tendered to him voluntarily -- with no such purpose before him.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'John Stuart Mill on Parliamentary Reform.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'John Stuart Mill on Parliamentary Reform.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db8ed0d8-e43a-5258-80ae-873fd78517e0,1066,nyt://article/db8ed0d8-e43a-5258-80ae-873fd78517e0

The manufactory comprised two buildings, one four hundred and fifty feet long and eighty feet wide, and the other three hundred feet long and seventy-five feet wide. Five cars were standing in the shop when the fire broke out, and three of them, unfinished, were burned up, while the others were seriously damaged.

Anecdote,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/08/archives/a-hard-story-about-gen-wade-hampton.html,Anecdote,"AND HIS FATHER. -- Young WADE HAMPTOM was sent, when a very young man, to the West with a large sum of money to buy land. His father was very rich. When young WADE reached New-Orleans, he had a desire to look at the pictures and see the sights. He went one evening to a gambling-house, and was induced to play at a faro-table. He was cleaned out, having lost twenty-five thousand dollars. He wrote to his father and confessed his folly and his loss. The old gentleman came on to New-Orleans, and caused his son to point out the gambling-house where he lost his money. Dropping in he looked at the play for a while and then threw down a purse upon the table. He lost, and the keeper emptied the purse of five hundred dollars in gold. He threw down another purse, and this time he was a winner. The keeper opened the purse and counting the gold was about to pay over the amount won, when Mr. HAMPTON remarked that he had not emptied it of all its contents. A little examination discovered in the purse a check for twenty-five thousand dollars, which had been so concealed that it would not fall out with the gold. The keeper of the bank made no objection to paying over the sum, which Mr. HAMPTON quietly put in his pocket and walked off. The next morning he handed the twenty-five thousand dollars to his son, told him to be more careful of his money, never to gamble again, but to go about his business and complete his purchase of land. -- Troy Whig.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A HARD STORY ABOUT GEN.

Inasmuch as up to the present season the cricket grounds of the Park have alike been unattainable by the cricket clubs of the metropolis, who have applied for the use of the field for match games, the decision of the commissioners in the matter has been quietly acquiesced in; but now that English cricketers have been allowed the privilege of playing their national game on the cricket field of the Park, it is hoped American Base Ball players will be allowed the use of the ball grounds of the Park for playing their national game. It appears that the principal objections of the Park Commissioners to the use of either field is, that the turf will be injured and partially destroyed by practicing these games, and also that the crowds of spectators, each contest attracts, will lead to infringements of the rules and regulations of the Park in reference to walking on the grass, &c.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUT-DOOR SPORTS.; Base Ball--The Central Park Ball Grounds.

"Bounty Jumper, Tossed in a Blanket",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/08/archives/initiating-a-bountybroker.html,"Bounty Jumper, Tossed in a Blanket","HALES was yesterday formally initiated into the O.W.B.B.S. of U.S., (Order of Well-Beloved Swindlers of Uncle Sam.) I.C. of U.B.J., (Inner Circle of Unlucky Bounty-Jumpers,) A.S.I.C. of P.M.P., (Albany Squad in Clutches of Provost-Marshal PARSONS.) For the information of our readers we will describe the manner of initiation into this squad of the inner circle of these swindlers. Whenever a beloved brother graduates from the outer circle, which operates freely in the outer world, loses his standing in that circle, and from lack of shrewdness falls into the hands of the Provost-Marshal, the Marshal details one of the guard to act as Grand Usher, and conduct him into the inner temple, where he is received by those who have preceded him, who immediately proceed to divest him of all his apparel, save his shirt and pants. They then place him on a large blanket, and a sufficient number take hold of the corners and sides, and elevate him into mid-air, and then toss him up and down. Now he strikes the ceiling. Anon, the blanket is slacked, and he reaches the floor. Again, by rapid movements, he files quickly between the two. During all this time it behooves the candidate for orders to hold his temper and his tongue, else sundry rapid evolutions from side to side, caused by the brawny palms of his worthy companions, might be the result. So he silently, and often with grim smiles, rides this new-fashioned ""goat"" until it is the will of the Inductors into the Inner Circle to cease their initiatory rites.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INITIATING A BOUNTY-BROKER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INITIATING A BOUNTY-BROKER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c607cff-b4ec-5115-bd2a-0865728c0a05,408,nyt://article/3c607cff-b4ec-5115-bd2a-0865728c0a05

At Williamsburgh,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/08/archives/williamsburgh.html,At Williamsburgh,"FIREMEN's FIGHTS -- ARREST OF FOUR OF THE BELLIGERENTS. -- Yesterday afternoon a man named KELLY was badly beaten by some men who were on bad terms with the company from which he halled. KELLY then applied to his friends of Engine No. 1, situated at the corner of North Second and Third streets, for help. He succeeded in getting a large crowd together at the corner of North Eighth and Fifth streets, where KELLY and his assailants also assembled. The latter were composed principally of members and friends of Hose Company No. 10, whose house is situated in Sixth-street, near North Second. The battle then opened and raged furiously for a short time, when Capt. WOGLOM and Sergt. MADDOX, of the Forty-fifth Precinct, with a posse of men came on the ground on a double quick, when the rioters dispersed and fled in all directions. Some time after this, a party of Engine Co. 1's men were passing Hose Co. 10's house, when they were assaulted by the latter, it is said, and another and more serious fight took place, in which the hose-cartmen were badly defeated, seeking refuge in their house and closing the door. Four of them then ascended to the roof and threw missiles on the crowd below, injuring severely several persons. Sergt. MADDOX and some men again made their appearance and forced the door of the house, intending to arrest those on the roof, but finding the ladder gone, they were unable to ascend. They then ordered the rioters to surrender, but this was at first refused. After considerable parley, however, they capitulated unconditionally, and were taken to the station-house and looked up. Their names are WALTER BASTWICK, MICHAEL QUINN, PATRICK CONNISKY, and HUGH MORAN.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7c5fddc-3913-53c7-bda5-13056335a72f,290,nyt://article/c7c5fddc-3913-53c7-bda5-13056335a72f

The funeral services were held at No. 192 Atlantic-street, and were attended by a large concourse of citizens, Anglo Saxon Lodge F.A.M., and the officers of the Fourteenth and DeKalb Regiments.

Miners' Strike in Pennsylvania,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/08/archives/the-coalminers-strike.html,Miners' Strike in Pennsylvania,"The strike among the coal-miners in the vicinity or Mahoning still continues, and, with one or two exceptions, none of the banks there are being worked. The state or the case is briefly stated thus; Coal has fallen in Cleveland from $10@$12 to $7@$7 50 per ton, rendering it impossible for the proprietors of the mines to sell their coat at any profit without reducing the wages of their workmen. In fact it became absolutely necessary to do this, to avoid a heavy loss. Notice was therefore given that after a certain date a reduction of forty cents per ton would be made in the price for mining coal, making the wages of miners amount to three dollars per day, instead of over four, as during the last Fall and Winter. The miners refused to work on these terms. They therefore ""struck,"" and are now all out of employment, except such as are called ""blacklegs"" or ""black sheep"" -- that is, men who do not belong to the miners' unions, and who work for lower wages than those prescribed by these associations. -- Pittsburgh Chronicle, May 3.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE COAL-MINERS' STRIKE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE COAL-MINERS' STRIKE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Coal', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fca49f52-72ae-5efb-867b-d2684f865692,187,nyt://article/fca49f52-72ae-5efb-867b-d2684f865692

We have of course seen, and with constant regret, that the attendance was not of a remunerative character, but the Academy has not been worse off in this respect than any other place of amusement. The mute agony of that terrible 14th of April, has not yet been comforted. With the last few days there has, however, been a more cheerful disposition on the part of the public, and we certainly expect that Mr. GROVER would be able to profit by it. He is the very last man to be discouraged. We have not in fact heard him complain. Still, as we see it announced that the season will posivively close with to-night's performance of ""Les Huguenots,"" we may reasonably conclude that he has urgent reasons for his course of action. The business, in truth, has been bad, and the company quarrelsome. So far as the members of the latter are concerned, it became absolutely necessary to disband them, and so dispose of certain antagonistic elements which interfered with the free action of the management. Mr. GROVER, who has, we believe, prospered with the German opera, will, we presume, speedily crystalize a new company. The public will be glad to see him return to management, for he has displayed energy and a desire to please. In the meantime the wreck will drift through the country. There will be half a dozen German opera companies, and in six months as many failures. No one should neglect the opportunity of hearing MEYERBEER's grandest work to-night. It is excellently rendered by Mr. GROVER's artists. The matinee on Saturday was, of course, badly attended. Who could be expected to go through such weather even for ""Faust?"" The distribution of the parts was not particularly interesting. Mlle. CANISSA, who appeared in the character of Marguerite, lacks voice, method, and personal appearance for the role.

It was never till now made so perfectly clear how thoroughly Western Europe, in spite of the prevailing sympathies with the rebellion, respected the honesty of purpose, the firmness yet temperateness of character, and the perfect purity of motive which appertained to all the official acts of the late Executive. We hear, without perhaps more interest than we attach to the natural condolence of friendship, the touching tributes paid to the memory of the dead President by the high-minded journalists of London, who have stood by us unwaveringly through all this bloody trial. We have tested their sympathy often on other occasions more or less calamitous, and we anticipated that now it would be what it has always been, free, generous, and intelligent. From the hostile press, on the other hand, nothing could be looked for beyond a decent regard to propriety in whatever it might say of the murder, or whatever results it might predicate thereupon. The pro-rebel British journals, among them the London Times, have gone -- whether wittingly or not, we cannot say -- much further than this, in attempting to give their own expression to the public sentiment. The ""leading journal "" discovers that ""nothing in political history has ever drawn forth a more unanimous feeling,"" than the news of Mr. LINCOLN's death. ""Personally,"" we are told, ""President LINCOLN enjoyed the kind regards of every one in England.""

Annual Exhibition,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/10/archives/institution-for-the-blind.html,Annual Exhibition,"The annual exhibition by the inmates of this Institution took place at Irving Hall yesterday afternoon. Quite a large audience was present considering the inclemency of the weather. On the platform were about 125 of the inmates of the Institution, the young ladies being dressed in white with red or blue sashes, and presenting a very beautiful appearance. After prayer a number of solos, duetts and quartetts, vocal and instrumental, were given. MENDELSSOHN's ""Wedding March"" was played on the piano by four young ladies, with surprising accuracy and delicacy of touch, and elicited great applause. A little boy named JOHN MAHONEY gave several solos on the piano, showing considerable power for so young a boy. The music was under the direction of Mr. THEO. THOMAS, Mr. S. BARCOCK, one of the blind teachers of the Institution then exercised some of his pupils in geography, the use of the globes and maps, having projections and hollows to indicate the different countries, seas and rivers. Several lads not over ten years of age, readily pointed out the principal countries, and described the routes by land and sea necessary to take in order to reach them. One young lady put a sectional map of the United States together in a few minutes. Afterwards the pupils read a number of verses from the Bible in raised print, almost as readily as if they had possessed the power of sight. One boy read with facility after the print had been covered with a handkerchief four times folded. The mental arithmetic class showed great proficiency -- the answers to very difficult questions being given with astonishing rapidity. The ordinary method of calculating was also shown -- letters being used instead of figures.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Institution for the Blind.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Institution for the Blind.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e146a81-df98-5cd5-a1c0-d39f2b3446de,352,nyt://article/0e146a81-df98-5cd5-a1c0-d39f2b3446de

These orders, it appears, fully coincide with the opinion of Attorney General SPEED in their definition of the rights which rebel officers and soldiers acquired by the surrender. The Lieutenant-General instructs Gen. ORD that paroled men residing south of Richmond must get home, by land, as speedily as possible, and by the most direct route; and that only those who, in conformity with the terms of the agreement, proceed toward their homes, can be supplied with transportation or subsistence at the expense of the government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""INTERPRETATION OF THE TERMS OF LEE'S SURRENDER."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""INTERPRETATION OF THE TERMS OF LEE'S SURRENDER."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10a245be-68c4-523b-b292-a2a6dbb84dd9,407,nyt://article/10a245be-68c4-523b-b292-a2a6dbb84dd9

From that fortunate year when Mr. WALLAOX succeeded to Mr. JOHN BROUGHAM and turned the utterly vacant and yawning Lyceum into a crowded boudoir of youth and beauty; from then until now--when a larger house and a vaster patronage bear witness to the success of the experiment -- hardly an actor or an actress has appeared on the Wallack stage that would not gladly be recalled, if that were possible. Alas! some are in the grave, and the rest are scattered far and wide in the eager search for fame. Could we draw them together again, how great would be our joy. A feeling so general in its application naturally has a peculiar intensity when directed toward Mr. J. LESTER WALLACK. From the beginning he has been the most prominent member of the combination. Few actors, indeed, have worked so persistently and conscientiously. Until his health failed, only a few weeks ago, (from causes which we all respect and keep silent,) he has never to our knowledge disappointed the public, or sought relief from duties which, although they rightfully fell to his share, were frequently overwhelming. Popular favorites are seldom so reliable. It is gratifying to know that in a small measure Mr. LESTER WALLACK had his reward last evening. His appearance on the stage was the signal for the heartiest round of applause we have ever heard in this usually sedate house. It was the recognition of a gentleman by gentlemen; of an artist by true lovers of art. Mr. WALLACK has been very ill, and is yet barely recovered. But as the grasp of a friendly hand imparts strength, so the cheering of many hands will, we trust, give vigor. We are glad to see that Mr. J.L. WALLACK will appear every evening this week.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4714a0c6-7fab-55fd-81c4-28ca66a96b1d,681,nyt://article/4714a0c6-7fab-55fd-81c4-28ca66a96b1d

--It has been proved that the increase of lunacy in France has kept pace with the augmentation of the revenue from tobacco.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/10/archives/foreign-items.html,,"-- It has been proved that the increase of lunacy in France has kept pace with the augmentation of the revenue from tobacco. From the years 1812 to 1832 that tax produced 28,000,000, and the lunatic asylums of the country contained 8 000 patients. The tobacco revenue has now reached the sum of 180 000,000, and there are no less than 44 000 paralytic and lunatic patients in the various hospitals devoted to their accommodation. This parallel has been drawn by M. JOLLY and laid before the Academy of Science. The last words of his speech on that occasion are worth recording in this age of universal smoking, and young boys, to whom this pernicious practice has not yet become second nature, would do well to reflect, ere it be too late, on the frightful warning the above statistics contain, as well as on M. JOLLY's words.

And we should presume that there can be no possible object which would lead the promoters of the scheme to deceive the public, by anticipating the date at which the great undertaking, after seven years of preparation, will be resumed. At the same time, we fail to find in the latest reports of the progress made at the manufactory of Messrs. GLASS, ELLIOT & CO., or on board the Great Eastern, a very strong assurance that the expectations of the well-wishers of the enterprise can possibly be met as to time. On April 24, some fourteen hundred miles of the wire had been placed in the tanks of the vessel; one tank was reported full, another a little more than half full, and the third only commenced filling. At the date named, there was still fully a thousand miles to be shipped. This uncompleted work, even if the wire were already finished -- which it does not appear to be -- would occupy, at the present rate of filling the tanks, fully forty days.

That Christianity he sees -- with the clearness that marks the vision of the philosopher and sage -- now exposed to attacks, differing both in kind and degree, from all former assaults, against its supernatural claims. The crisis that now agitates Christendom, he views as one manifestation of the great intellectual and social revolution, that after the fermentation and preparation of centuries, has broken out, and is in course of accomplishment in our generation. But the capability of Christianity to adapt itself to all the different forms of human institutions, is a mere characteristic of its divine essence and origin, and he, therefore, looks forward with confidence to its emergence from the struggle, purified and exalted. To bring forward and illustrate the alliance that subsists between the truth of revelation and the inherent spiritual wants of man, is one object that M. GUIZOT has in view in his present work. It forms the first of an intended series of four parts, and is destined to explain and establish what it is that constitute, in the mind of the writer, the peculiar features of Christianity -- that is to say, what those natural problems are, that correspond with the fundamental doctrines of revelation, that furnish their solution, and the nature of the supernatural facts on which these doctrines are based -- creation, revelation, the inspiration of the Scriptures, the Divine Being as manifested in holy writ, and the character and work of Jesus as displayed in the Gospel narrative. The subjects are to led in the meditations that compose the volume. There is a novelty in the mode of regarding [???], to English and American readers, [???] position of the writer as a [???] Protestant Church, independent [???] experience of the author, which [???] well be supposed to have extended the [???] of his views beyond what may be called the [???] of clerical mode of treatment that [???] familiar with. Unless we are mistaken, [???] will find this breadth and larger [???] ""meditations,"" and it [???]ds [???] attraction of the work. The success [???] will relate to the past history of the Christian Church, its present conditions, and [???] the future. The matured fruits of [???] that of M. GUIZOT, employed on the [???] momentous of subjects, cannot fail to attempt [???] [???]tion.

This diversity, which is one of motive and interest, was scarcely apparent in the telegraphic abstracts which have been heretofore given from the leading foreign journals. It will be seen to-day that, while the full bearing and gist of such sincere and eloquent tributes as Mr. LINCOLN's death called forth from the liberal press of England, might be given in a paragraph, the inspiration and the motive of whatever was uttered by the hostile journals could only be interpreted by looking to the tone of thought pervading what they had to say in its elaborated form. Applying this test, we discover in the spirit of the British pro-rebel journals precisely what we expected -- a species of eulogy upon the character and acts of the late President, employed to cover a bitter malevolence toward the people and government of the United States. The whole argument of the London Times, unless we greatly misapprehend it, is pointed to an illustration of the helpless, mierable state of anarchy into which this country has fallen by the death of a single one of its citizens. Hastening from insincere laudation of the dead, to contemptuous pity for the living, says this British oracle: ""The too probable effect of the crime is an accession of madness and anger, rendering all schemes of reconstruction impossible."" As if fearing that this might not fully convey an expression of its hopes for a revival of the Confederacy, the same journal proceeds to vilify President JOHNSON to the full bent of its desires, and brings itself to the conclusion that, whatever Mr. LINCOLN might have done to restore the Union, ""it is morally certain Mr. JOHNSON cannot do it.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Assassination and British Public Opinion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Assassination and British Public Opinion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Newspapers', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/390430c5-78a9-59ee-bad9-37e168c0bbf7,499,nyt://article/390430c5-78a9-59ee-bad9-37e168c0bbf7

Now and again a detachment of Franco-Mexican troops is surprised and made prisoners, as they were at Tacambare (Michoacan) on the 19th of April. The Imperialists, anon, find compensation in dispossessing the Republicans of some town or fortress on the west coast, as they did on the 27th of March, when Guaymas fell into the hands of the French without resistance; the garrison betaking itself to the interior on the approach of four French men-of-war. Again, we read land without any surprise) that CORTINAS, who sold himself a few months ago to the Imperialists, has ""repronounced"" in favor of the Republic; and has gathered around him, in the districts bordering on the Rio Grande and near Matamoras, a force so considerable, that extra precautions have been instituted by the French garrison at the last-named place to protect the empire.

There can be no difficulty about the matter, as a challenge has also been issued by the owner of the famous Gen. Butler to trot any horse, mare or gelding in the world, one, two or three-mile heats, for any amount of money the takers of the challenge may feel inclined to put up.

Rebel Crucities to; Rev. J. J. Gear's Lecture,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/12/archives/cruelties-to-union-prisoners-in-the-south-sketch-of-a-lecture-by.html,Rebel Crucities to; Rev. J. J. Gear's Lecture,"Rev. Col. J.J. GEAR, of the One Hundred and Eighty-third Ohio Volunteers, addressed an appreciative audience, on Wednesday evening, at the Attorney-street M.E. Church, and narrated many of the hideous experiences of our soldiers while held as prisoners of war by the ""Christian gentleman and scholar."" Generalissimo ROBERT E. LEE. Many veteran soldiers were present. The speaker, having been introduced by Capt. STEERS, of the Thirteenth Ward Police, said that he had been four years and fourteen days a soldier of the United States, and passed through three rebel penitentiaries, and after having been chained and bayoneted, had attempted escape through a swamp of two hundred and fifty miles, fed by negroes and hunted by bloodhounds, and at length captured and returned to Georgia, there tried and sentenced to death. In the court before which he was arraigned the speaker and his companion, Col. COLLINS, made a clean breast, confessing themselves to be United States soldiers, and bade the rebels do their worst. The prisoners' truthful words won them friends in the court, and pending a decision of their fate, a sanguinary encounter occurred, many rebels urging their immediate execution and many others speaking in their defence, until, when the crowd had tired of fighting, the Sheriff -- a humane, and, as has since proved, a loyal man -- assumed the responsibility of removing their chains. Col. GEAR and Col. COLLINS subsequently came North with this excellent county official. In the Macon prison, to the floor of which their feet were chained for eighteen days, our dear prodigal brethren of the Southern chivalry fed them by tossing their food in through the iron grating of the door, as though the prisoners had been dogs. At Atlanta, on the very night when Col. GEAR broke from the jail of that town, seven Union prisoners were hanged. When he passed through Richmond, on his way to Libby Prison, just before the Presidential election, the multitudes who were shouting for JEFF. DAVIS said to him: ""You'll go home soon, you prison-breaking Methodist preacher, for the North is about to vote with us, and the Northwest will join us outright."" The newspapers of the South, wielded by JEFF. DAVIS, had made the people -- even many Union prisoners -- credit this falsehood; and to our heroes who were languishing in prison the prospect was appalling. The speaker was at Andersonville when 10,000 prisoners were held there, and of the number he counted 287 men who had no feet; and on the Cape Fear River, into a prison in which he was thrust, 555 men out of 5,000 died in one season. He had been asked how it occurred that our soldiers lost their feet. They were left without shelter, and to keep their blood warm were compelled to walk in the sand continually until the blood ceased to circulate in the feet, and they dropped off at the ankle. Forty-five of these men are now on David's Island. The speaker read several affidavits, one of which we quote as follows:",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cruelties to Union Prisoners in the South; SKETCH OF A LECTURE BY COL. J.J.

About one mile north of New-Brunswick, a peculiar jerking motion of the train was perceptible, accompanied by the sharp whistle of the locomotive to ""down brakes,"" three times repeated. It was then discovered that a large log had been wedged in at the switch between the two rails, so as to infallibly run any train off that should attempt to pass over it. As an additional proof that it was by design, an examination of the switch showed that the person or persons being unable to unlock it, had withdrawn the bolts in order the better to effect their purpose.

Mr. RANDALL said that the system of common school government under which we are now working, had been fifty-five years established, and within that time New-York had erected fifty-five stately school palaces like that in which he stood, and from the time, within his memory, when the Public School system of this city cost but a paltry $5,000 annually, for the instruction of 500 pupils, our free educational institutions had risen to the dignity of a cost exceeding two millions a year for the education of more than 200,000 of the city's children; and now every year we are compelled to erect vast and costly edifices for school purposes; yet our tax-ridden people never murmur at taxation for the support of our schools. Mr. RANDALL said that there are 50,000 children in New-York who are to be reared to a career of crime, and he held that the State should be empowered to take these children from the streets, and constrain them to attend the Public Schools.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Dedication of Grammar School No. 55.; INTERESTING SPEECHES BY REV.

"Smith vs. Carver, Title to Island",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/13/archives/an-action-as-to-the-title-of-an-island-interesting-facts-relative.html,"Smith vs. Carver, Title to Island","Hugh C. Smith et al. vs. Phineas P. Carver et al. -- The plaintiffs brought this action to recover the proceeds of a cargo of guano, which was brought to this country and sold in the cities of New-York and Baltimore. The facts of the case, which are of considerable interest to the public, are substantially as follows: The testimony showed that the plaintiffs were connected with a Liverpool and Montevideo shipping house; that in the year 1857 they were owners of the northern half of a small island situated on the coast of Patagonia, which island was then, and is still, known by the name of the Island of Leon. At that time it was almost uninhabited. Owing to the enormous quantities of guano discovered there, it has since become partially settled in some parts of it. Exactly under what title or by what authority the plaintiffs claimed ownership to a portion of it, did not appear, but probably it was by virtue of the oldest and most original of all rights to real estate -- the right of discovery. However, the plaintiffs, whatever their right, and in the year 1857, a number of men engaged on the island in digging and piling up guano, with the intention of shipping it to the Northern ports. It had just been discovered that guano was a fertilizer, equal to, and for some soils, much superior to anything else known, and hence the demand for it was very great all over the civilized world. The men employed by the plaintiffs on the island were under the direction and control of a capitaz, or overseer, by the name of Meneles. The latter had exclusive control of and the power to ship guano in such vessels as were sent to the islands by the plaintiffs for the purpose. Accordingly, he did ship several cargoes in vessels chartered by the plaintiffs. In the latter part of the year 1857, a Capt. Neckel chartered the bark Trovatore, at Montevideo -- a port on the west coast of South America -- and in that vessel, with Carver, one of the defendants, as acting captain, they went to this island, took on board a large cargo of guano, which, it is alleged, was obtained for little or nothing, by means of the connivance of Meneles, the overseer, brought it to this country, and sold it at a high price. The overseer, it appears, came on in the Trovatore as far as Montevideo, where he died in 1860. Hence his testimony could not be obtained. It was further shown that the bark Trovatore tried to hide her name and character while roving around the island, by fastening a piece of canvas over her name on the stern, on which canvas was printed in large letters the name Winona. Also that the defendant Carver, while at the island of Leon, went by the name of Pillsbury. Furthermore, the plaintiffs showed that the overseer, Meneles, had no authority whatever to sell guano. In short, one of the principal grounds on which they relied to recover the amount of the cargo of guano, was that the defendant Carver, and those associated with him, were nothing more nor less than roving pirates, and that Meneles was an accomplice.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Action as to the Title of an Island Interesting Facts Relative to the Patagoueans.; SUPREME COURT--CIRCUIT--PART I.--MAY 12.

The committee have contributed in a very important manner to the welfare of the tens of thousands of men who have been at various times in our hospitals and at our military posts, their books having been accessible to over one hundred thousand soldiers during the past two years. Some of these libraries at permanent forts and posts, from long use, are nearly worn out, and need repairs. The committee also desire to furnish to each of the new squadrons about to sail for foreign stations a ""library"" of books adapted to the wants of sailors. To secure the necessary ""fund"" for the above purposes, the Committee offer to the public a ""grand patriotic, vocal and instrumental concert,"" at the Cooper Institute, on Wednesday evening, May 17. The entertainment will consist of the new music of the day, popularly rendered by the ""Union (Anderson's) Glee Club,"" assisted by eminent lady amateurs.

The Emperor started on his excursion from Mexico the 18th, and on arriving at Orizaba the 29th ult., received the news of the fall of Richmond and the rumored capitulation of LEE.

Carolina Campaign; Cor. with Kilpatrick,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/14/archives/the-carolina-campaign-kilpatricks-official-report-headquarters.html,Carolina Campaign; Cor. with Kilpatrick,"MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my command in the recent campaigns through the Carolinas, up to the occupation of Goldsboro: On the morning of the 28th of January, in accordance with instructions from the General-in-chief, I left my encampment on the Ogeechee, and after one of the most difficult marches, reached Sister's Ferry. January 30 we went into camp, and here remained till February 3, when the bridge over the Savannah having been completed, we crossed, passed the swamps beyond, and encamped on firm ground, about Robertsville, South Carolina. My command consisted of three brigades of cavalry, indifferently mounted and badly armed; one battery of horse artillery, six guns, Capt. BEBEE commanding, and a small brigade of dismounted men, under the command of Lieut.-Col. MAY, in all 5,068 men for duty. Notwithstanding the many disadvantages under which we labored, by moderate marches at first, and great care of the animals, the command improved from day to day, and on reaching Goldsboro, was without question, despite the long and difficult marches, numerous skirmishes, affairs and battles, in better condition than at the commencement of the campaign. From Robertsville my command moved to Lawtonville; thence to Allendale; after pushing well in toward Augusta, driving a brigade of rebel cavalry before us, I turned short to the right and struck the Salkehatchie just below Barnwell. The enemy, about 300 strong, occupied a well chosen position behind earthworks, upon the opposite side, commanding the bridge. The bridge was already on fire, but the Ninth Ohio Cavalry, Col. HAMILTON; Ninety-second Illinois Mounted Infantry, Lieut.-Col. VAN BUSKIRK, dismounted, gallantly dashed through the swamp, men wading in water up to their arm-pits, crossed the stream on trees felled by our pioneers, and under cover of a rapid fire of artillery, gallantly carried the works, driving the enemy in confusion toward the town of Barnwell. Only a portion of the bridge had been destroyed, and was quickly repaired, and we entered the town of Barnwell at 4 P.M., having marched twenty-one miles. The following morning we struck the railroad at Blackville, driving a brigade of WHEELER's cavalry from the town. My advance was engaged alone with the enemy at this point. It was a very spirited affair, in which Col. JORDAN, Capt. ESTES, my Assistant Adjutant-General, and Capt. NORTHROPE, greatly distinguished themselves. Here the command rested on the road, destroying the track, during the 7th and 8th, and on the evening of the 8th, moved up the road in the direction of Augusta to Williston Station. After posting pickets on the various roads leading from the town, and before going into camp, an attack was made upon Col. SPENCER's command, holding the direct road to Augusta. I directed this officer to move out at once with his brigade, feel of the enemy, and ascertain his strength. A spirited fight ensued, in which six regiments of Maj.-Gen. ALLEN's division of WHEELER's cavalry, the First, Third, Seventh, Ninth, Twelfth and Fifty-first Alabama, were totally routed. Col. SPENCER alone conducted the fight, displaying much skill and great gallantry. Several hundred stand of arms were abandoned by the enemy and left scattered along the road. One officer and many men were killed, and a large number wounded. Several prisoners were taken.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE CAROLINA CAMPAIGN.; Kilpatrick's Official Report.

Canada; Fortifications and British Government,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/14/archives/the-british-government-and-the-fortification-of-the-colonies-cation.html,Canada; Fortifications and British Government,"-- It is instructive to find that the British Government has begun to apply a pressure to those of the neighboring colonies opposed to federation, which promises either to change their views in favor of that imperial scheme, or to force them to seek an independent state of political existence. The provinces that refuse to join the proposed union are to be denied any help in the erection of fortifications. These recalcitrant dependencies, perhaps, might get along without the fortifications; but they would find it hard, we presume, to get along without the British gold voted to build them, and without the steady expenditure of the garrisons intended to occupy them. In British America over one hundred million dollars of English capital have been expended on railways during the last fifteen years, but that supply has stopped; so that it is only now that the colonists begin to feel the importance, not to say the necessity, of getting a yearly slice out of the imperial military estimates. Before this can be had, it seems, they must agree to unite among themselves politically, as has been proposed by the Quebec Conference. How the screw is being applied by the Central Government, we gather from the following, which appears in a late issue of a Halifax (N.S.) paper:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE FORTIFICATION OF THE COLONIES.; CATION OF THE COLONIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND THE FORTIFICATION OF THE COLONIES.; CATION OF THE COLONIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a33b9e26-ab89-51b5-9335-077ef5c8c6fb,421,nyt://article/a33b9e26-ab89-51b5-9335-077ef5c8c6fb

BENTON has arrived in St. Louis. The plaster cast of the model was, in the Fall of 1861, sent to Munich, in Bavaria, to be there cast in bronze at the Royal foundry, the most celebrated in the world. The statue is colossal in size, being ten feet high, one foot higher than the contract required, but when Miss HOSMER made her drawings for the design she perceived that it would require the additional size to do full justice to the subject. It is intended to be placed on a pedestal of equal height on a foundation about two feet above the surface of the ground, so that when erected the head will be twenty-one or twenty-two feet above the standpoint of the beholder, a necessary distance to reduce it to life-size. The figure is draped in the Roman cloak, or a kind of toga, which Col. BENTON was so fond of wearing. He is unrolling a map; the lower limbs draped partly in the antique and partly in modern dress, the drapery ""managed with great skill and producing graceful lines.""

Washington Chronicle on Publicity of Trial,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/14/archives/trial-of-the-assassins-action-of-the-government.html,Washington Chronicle on Publicity of Trial,"* * * With the manner of trying these conspirators Mr. STANTON has had no more to do than any other member of the Cabinet. The President consulted him and all his constitutional advisers before issuing the Proclamation. He took the advice of the Attorney-General that the conspirators, their aiders and abetters, were ""subject to the jurisdiction of, and legally triable before, a military commission."" And the President then directed the Assistant Adjutant-General to detail nine military officers to serve as the commission; the trial or trials to be conducted by the Judge-Advocate-General, who was to prefer the charges, &c., and that ""the said commission establish such order or rules of proceeding as may avoid unnecessary delay and conduce to the ends of justice."" This order was issued on the 1st of May, and read to the Military Commission on the 9th of the same month, and was signed ""ANDREW JOHNSON."" This to any friend of the general Administration should be sufficient to show that the President does not seek to escape the full responsibility of his share in the Proclamation and trial. And they intentionally insult him who attempt to create the impression that his deliberate and conscientious action was the decision of others and in opposition to his real feelings. Such is the effect, if not the object, of the course of the Ledger and World. If we desired to confer a new honor upon the Secretary of War, we should advise him to accept what is now offensively thrust upon him, in the hope that it may bring him into disrepute, viz.: the credit of having originated the manner of trying the conspirators. Under the rules of the distinguished officers composing the commission, no act of injustice has been complained of by any of the parties concerned in the trial. The accused have not only had permission to send for counsel, but the government has employed its own messengers to convey their wishes in this respect. Their counsel and their witnesses have been in regular attendance. They only step that has been taken by the court, not in accordance with ordinary trials, is that thus far it has sat with closed doors. How long it may be necessary to maintain this precaution cannot now be decided. As it was adopted to ascertain the truth, and the truth alone, it will not be abandoned if the complaints of the New-York press are swollen into a torrent of denunciation. Yesterday the evidence was of so much importance as convincingly to establish the propriety of this very alternative. The lives of some of the witnesses depended upon the regulation. And we feel free to say that none were more conscious of its necessity than the witnesses themselves. Most of them are honorable, intelligent, patriotic citizens. Who is it that puts their lives in danger? Who are encouraged to send anonymous letters to officers of the Commission? Who constrained the Government to place guards around the doors of the President, his Cabinet, the Commission itself, and the residence of your Judge-Advocate General? Answer us, ""gentlemen"" of the New-York press. Mr. GREELEY tells his readers that the Commission is illegal. Does he know better than the Attorney-General of the United States what is the law? He ""warns"" the ""gentlemen of the Cabinet,"" and adds that ""the people will compel them to speak, in tones they cannot refuse to hear."" Shame! shame! There is not a secret assassin in Washington that does not reecho this threat; there is not a disbanded rebel that has not used precisely this language against the same ""Cabinet"" a thousand times. The World takes another course. It deifies BOOTH to make STANTON a fiend. It sinks the horrid reality of the bloody butchery of April 14 in its picture of ""the secrets of STANTON's prison-house,"" which, if unfolded, it says ""might a tale unfold which would make the hair of humane men stand on end with horror."" Why the savages who murdered LINCOLN and brought the SEWARDS to the very verge of the grave, from which one of them may never be rescued, are gentle and pious in comparison with the Cabinet whom Mr. GREELEY ""warns,"" and the War Minister with his secret ""tortures"" and ""prison-houses.""",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trial of the Assassins Action of the Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Trial of the Assassins Action of the Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Washington Chronicle', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d08fa910-23b8-5aed-8c28-62e020ea72c5,818,nyt://article/d08fa910-23b8-5aed-8c28-62e020ea72c5

There are sixty vacant Sees within the Kingdom of Italy. And the Pope thinks that under certain circumstances these may be filled on the nomination of the King; the Pope, we presume, reserving to himself the right of confirmation. The King appears to be willing to meet his Holiness half way. But it may be doubted whether the Head of the Roman Church has gone half way to approach the sovereign of Italy -- a sovereign recognized years ago by all the great Powers except Austria -- by styling him ""King of Piedmont."" This, however, we take it, is more a technical question than anything else. And France may find a way of removing even this apparent obstacle to complete reconciliation.

The firing aroused DAVIS, who speedily arrayed himself in his wife's petticoats and fled to the woods.

"In this case I am sure your Lordships will feel entire sympathy with Her Majesty, who has instructed me already to express to the Government of the United States the shook which she felt at the intelligence of the great crime which has been committed. [Hear, hear.] Her Majesty has also been pleased to write a private letter to Mrs. LINCOLN, [cheers,] expressive of sympathy with that lady in her misfortune. [Cheers.] I think that your Lordships will agree with me, that in modern times there has hardly been a crime committed so abhorrent to the feeling of every civilized person as the one I am now alluding to. [Hear, hear.] After the first election of Mr. LINCOLN as President of the United States, he was reelected to the same high position by the large majority of the people remaining faithful to the Government of the United States, and he was in the discharge of the duties of his office, having borne his faculties meekly, at the moment when an assassin attacked him at the theatre. There are circumstances connected with this crime which, I think, aggravate its atrocity. President LINCOLN was a man who, though not conspicuous before his election, had since displayed a character of so much integrity, so much sincerity and straightforwardness, and at the same time of so much kindness, that, if anyone was able to alleviate the pain and animosity which prevailed during the period of civil war, I believe that ABRAHAM LINCOLN was that person. It was remarked of President LINCOLN that he always felt disinclined to adopt harsh measures, and I am told that the commanders of his armies often complained that when they had passed a sentence which they thought no more than just, the President was always disposed to temper its severity. Such a man this particular epoch requires. The conduct of the armies of the United States was intrusted to other hands, and on the commanders fell the responsibility of leading the armies in the field to victory. They had been successful against those they had to contend with, and the moment had come when, undoubtedly, the responsibilities of President LINCOLN were greatly increased by their success. But, though it was not for him to lead the armies, it would have been his to temper the pride of victory, to assuage the misfortunes which his adversaries had experienced, and especially to show, as he was well qualified to show, that high respect for valor on the other side which has been no conspicuously displayed. It was to be hoped that by such qualities, when the conflict of arms was over, the task of conciliation might have been begun, and President LINCOLN would have an authority which no one else could have had to temper that exasperation which always arises in the course of civil strife, [Hear, hear.] Upon another question the United States and the Confederates will have a most difficult task to perform. I allude to the question of slavery, which some have always, maintained to have been the cause of the civil war. At the beginning the House will remember that President LINCOLN declared that he had no right by the constitution to interfere with slavery. At a later period he made a communication to the Commander-in-Chief of the United States' forces, in which he proposed that in certain States the slaves should be entirely free; but at a later period he proposed, what he had a constitutional qualification to propose, that there should be an alteration in the constitution of the United States, by which compulsory labor should hereafter be forbidden. I remember that Lord MACAULAY once declared that it would have been a great blessing if the penal laws against the Catholics had been abolished from the time of Sir R. WALPOLE, though Sir R. WALPOLE would have been mad to propose a measure for that purpose. So the same may be said of slavery, though I believe that the United States were justified in delaying the time when that great alteration of the United States law should take place. But, whatever we may think on these subjects, we must all deeply deplore that the death of President LINCOLN has deprived the United States of a man, a leader on this subject, who by his temper was qualified to propose such a measure as might have made this great change acceptable to those before opposed to it, and might have preserved the peace of the great republic of America while undergoing that entire new organization which would be necessary under such circumstances. [Hear.] I think we must all feel both sympathy with the United States in this great affliction, and also a hope that he who is now, according to the American Constitution, intrusted with the power of the late President, may be able both on the one subject and on the other -- both in respect to mercy and leniency toward the conquered, and also with regard to the measures to be adopted for the new organization which the abolition of slavery will render requisite, to overcome all difficulties. I had some time ago, at the commencement of this contest, occasion to say that I did not believe that the great republic of America would perish in this war, and the noble Lord at the head of the government had lately occasion to disclaim on the part of the government of this country any feeling of envy at the greatness and prosperity of the United States. The course which Her Majesty's government have had to pursue, during this civil war has been one of great anxiety. Difficulties have occurred to us, and difficulties have also occurred to the Government of the United States, in maintaining the peaceful relations between the two countries; but those difficulties have always been treated with temper and moderation both on this side and the other side of the Atlantic. I trust that that temper and moderation may continue, and I can assure this House that, as we have always been guided by the wish that the American Government and the American people should settle for themselves the conflict of arms without any interference of ours, so likewise during the attempt that has to be made to restore peace and tranquillity to America, we shall equally refrain from any kind of interference or intervention, though we trust that the efforts to be made for restoring peace will be successful, and that the great republic of America will always flourish and enjoy the freedom it has hitherto enjoyed. [Hear, hear.] I have nothing to say with regard to the successor of Mr. LINCOLN. Time must show how far he is able to conduct the difficult matters which will come under his consideration with the requisite wisdom. All I can say is that, in the presence of the great crime which has just been committed, and of the great calamity which has fallen on the American nation, the Crown, the Parliament, and the people of this country do feel the deepest interest for the Government and people of the United States; for, owing to the nature of the relations between the two nations, the misfortunes of the United States affect us more than the misfortunes of any other country on the face of the globe. [Hear, hear.] The noble Earl concluded by moving an humble address to Her Majesty to express the sorrow and indignation of this House at the assassination of the President of the United States, and to pray Her Majesty to communicate these sentiments on the part of this House to the Government of the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/15/archives/the-assassination-of-president-lincoln-action-of-the-british.html,,"In this case I am sure your Lordships will feel entire sympathy with Her Majesty, who has instructed me already to express to the Government of the United States the shook which she felt at the intelligence of the great crime which has been committed.

WALPOLE would have been mad to propose a measure for that purpose. So the same may be said of slavery, though I believe that the United States were justified in delaying the time when that great alteration of the United States law should take place. But, whatever we may think on these subjects, we must all deeply deplore that the death of President LINCOLN has deprived the United States of a man, a leader on this subject, who by his temper was qualified to propose such a measure as might have made this great change acceptable to those before opposed to it, and might have preserved the peace of the great republic of America while undergoing that entire new organization which would be necessary under such circumstances. [Hear.] I think we must all feel both sympathy with the United States in this great affliction, and also a hope that he who is now, according to the American Constitution, intrusted with the power of the late President, may be able both on the one subject and on the other -- both in respect to mercy and leniency toward the conquered, and also with regard to the measures to be adopted for the new organization which the abolition of slavery will render requisite, to overcome all difficulties. I had some time ago, at the commencement of this contest, occasion to say that I did not believe that the great republic of America would perish in this war, and the noble Lord at the head of the government had lately occasion to disclaim on the part of the government of this country any feeling of envy at the greatness and prosperity of the United States. The course which Her Majesty's government have had to pursue, during this civil war has been one of great anxiety. Difficulties have occurred to us, and difficulties have also occurred to the Government of the United States, in maintaining the peaceful relations between the two countries; but those difficulties have always been treated with temper and moderation both on this side and the other side of the Atlantic. I trust that that temper and moderation may continue, and I can assure this House that, as we have always been guided by the wish that the American Government and the American people should settle for themselves the conflict of arms without any interference of ours, so likewise during the attempt that has to be made to restore peace and tranquillity to America, we shall equally refrain from any kind of interference or intervention, though we trust that the efforts to be made for restoring peace will be successful, and that the great republic of America will always flourish and enjoy the freedom it has hitherto enjoyed. [Hear, hear.] I have nothing to say with regard to the successor of Mr. LINCOLN. Time must show how far he is able to conduct the difficult matters which will come under his consideration with the requisite wisdom. All I can say is that, in the presence of the great crime which has just been committed, and of the great calamity which has fallen on the American nation, the Crown, the Parliament, and the people of this country do feel the deepest interest for the Government and people of the United States; for, owing to the nature of the relations between the two nations, the misfortunes of the United States affect us more than the misfortunes of any other country on the face of the globe. [Hear, hear.] The noble Earl concluded by moving an humble address to Her Majesty to express the sorrow and indignation of this House at the assassination of the President of the United States, and to pray Her Majesty to communicate these sentiments on the part of this House to the Government of the United States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN.; ACTION OF THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/16/archives/amusements.html,,"At this season of the year it is hardly expected that the theatres and other places of amusement will retain the popular favor which they have enjoyed in the dull winter months, when they were the only cheerful resort of the community. Many families are now moving into the country, and hundreds are departing for Europe. This accounts for some derangement in the ordinary attendance, but an up-town rival is probably the cause of the principal falling off. When the Central Park opens for the season the treatres may as well give up the contest and close. It is a question of nature against art. The latter is pretty sure to get the worst of it. Without a personal visit to our great holiday-ground it is impossible to imagine the dra[???] it makes upon the spare time of our citizens.

"Yellow Fever Plot, The",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/16/archives/the-yellow-fever-plot.html,"Yellow Fever Plot, The","-- The theory that the assassinations, the robberies and the incendiary plots to make wholesale havoc of life and property in the North, by secret agencies, are in no manner chargeable against the leaders of the rebellion, promises to be effectually demolished before half the evidence in the pending trials has been eliminated. To-day we have the full report of the preliminary examination into the yellow fever plot at Bermuda. That examination has resulted in the committal of a resident of the island, named SWAN, on the charge of having conspired with one Dr. BLACKBURN to take charge of certain trunks containing infected clothing, for the purpose of having them forwarded to New-York, Philadelphia, and other cities, with the object of there introducing yellow fever. BLACKBURN, whose hailing-points were Halifax, Quebec, and ""Clifton House, Niagara Falls, Canada side,"" made liberal promises to SWAN, provided the contract was fairly carried out. The funds were to be supplied freely from the Confederate exchequer, and, meanwhile, BLACKBURN himself was to retire to Halifax and watch the progress of events until the opening of Spring, when the season would probably be more favorable to the spread of the imported disease. BLACKBURN, of course, is not forthcoming, thus far, in the Bermuda trial. But if -- as is most probable -- he in to be found in the neighboring Provinces, it will need no extradition treaty for the Bermuda authorities to secure his person, if only to deal with him as an offender against their own laws. Whether they do this or not, the Justices' Court of the island has elicited sufficient evidence to prove that the yellow fever plot is part of the general scheme of Confederate warfare which was was to signalize the Spring campaign of 1865. This Bermuda trial may yet serve the purpose of elucidating many points in the examination now going on at Washington.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE YELLOW FEVER PLOT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE YELLOW FEVER PLOT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6c64a1a-6fd1-5ea7-a25e-f66ec63060b2,314,nyt://article/d6c64a1a-6fd1-5ea7-a25e-f66ec63060b2

It appears from the interference of the government police that such a demonstration in such a quarters has been hold to imply that the students are favorably impressed with republicanism, and that they desired on that particular occasion to make their impressions known. The resolutions of the Latin Quarter may have meant more than a friendly expression of sympathy. Doubtless they did mean more. But it is not likely that Mr. BIGELOW would have received them as he did, or that he would have protested as he did against a cordon of police being drawn around the embassy to prevent the students from presenting their address, if he had found in that address words conveying any insinuation against the Imperial Government. The interference of the government agents, besides being undignified, ungracious, if not insulting to the representatives of this country, and indicative of weakness, cannot have failed to give a degree of prominence which it would probably not have otherwise achieved to the obnoxious act of the students. The latter will now find a thousand readers for their resolutions, even in Europe, where they might have found a score without the aid of such an advertisement. The truth seems to be that it goes hard with the Imperialists everywhere to find that the American republic to-day is not reduced to a condition of anarchy.

It is a complete wiping out of four years of the civil history of the State, as far as rebels had to do with it in any way. It makes null and void every legislative act, every judicial act, every executive act, of whatever character. Of course, thousands of these acts had no bearing whatever upon the rebellion. They were laws and judicial decisions which related solely to the ordinary affairs of society, and which might have been made in any loyal State with the same propriety. Every will or title deed acknowledged before a public notary, commissioned by the Richmond Governor, is made worthless. Every judgment in a civil suit, every sentence in a criminal case, made by a magistrate or court appointed by the Richmond Legislature, or sworn in its name, is of no force. Every public and private bill added to the statute book is only so much waste paper. The loyal Legislature of Virginia, which met first in Wheeling, afterward in Alexandria, never undertook to legislate beyond the actual necessities of the loyal people, and passed very few general laws. The loyal Governor did not attempt to grant civil or judicial commissions within the rebel lines, for the very simple reason that no one, however loyal, would have dared to act under them. Thus, to more than a million of the people of Virginia, there is a complete abrogation of every act done during the last four years, under the supposed sanction of law.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Reconstruction of Virginia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Reconstruction of Virginia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11809475-3084-5976-89c1-d3ec8c0381f8,1072,nyt://article/11809475-3084-5976-89c1-d3ec8c0381f8

STEWART and NYE, spoke at a public meeting last night concerning the mineral resources of the young State of which they are the first representatives in the United States Senate. The lecture of Senator STEWART was very able, highly instructive and deeply interesting. He gave a glowing account of the incalculable resources in silver and other of the precious metals of the vast region lying between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains; and was fortunately able to show that these resources were not merely speculative, but that the number of mills and stamps in operation, and the quantity of silver ore taken out and shipped, justified his theories and conclusions. But three things are wanted for the development of the region and the production of untold quantities of the precious metals. Those are, labor, capital and the Pacific Railroad. Senator STEWART thought that the national debt would be found to be a mere bagatelle, and its payment the easiest thing in the world, if but a tithe of the national energies were directed to the development of our gold and silver-bearing Territories.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR NATIONAL WEALTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR NATIONAL WEALTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Nevada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6bcf9ee1-cfd2-516b-bae1-e79019f6a2e7,194,nyt://article/6bcf9ee1-cfd2-516b-bae1-e79019f6a2e7

Wheeler. -- The action was brought to recover of defendant the sum of about $2,500, alleged to be due to the plaintiff, under the following circumstances: In the month of February, 1853, the defendant was the alleged owner of 9-18 of the ship Petonia. A day or two before she sailed from this port, bound for Australia, with a cargo and about two hundred passengers, the Captain of the ship, Mr. Jenkins, -- since deceased, -- loaned to the defendant Wheeler the sum of $2,000, and as security for the payment of this money at a specified time, Wheeler executed a bottomry bond, &c., on his 9-18 of the ship. On the trial, the plaintiff further sought to show, that at the time the bond was given, defendant, as a further security for the payment of the $2,000 to Jenkins, agreed to effect an insurance of $2,500 on the shares of the ship mentioned, in some good and responsible marine company, and, inasmuch as the ship was to sail immediately, defendant, as claimed by plaintiff, agreed to have the bond, mortgage and policy of insurance made out, all put into one envelope, addressed to Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of the Captain, and then left with the brokers of the latter in Wall-street until the Captain's return. The vessel sailed with her cargo and two hundred passengers, bound for Australia, before the papers in question were perfected. There was an attempt on the part of the counsel for plaintiff to show that the ship was unseaworthy, badly manned and worse provisioned. At all events, it seems she was compelled to put into Bahia, on the east coast of South America, for supplies and repairs: that she was detained there several weeks, at great expense. At the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, she was again compelled to put in for repairs and supplies. After a long detention there, she again set sail, and in the Autumn of the year she was forced to put into Port Louis, a harbor on the Island of Mauritius, and, as the plaintiff claimed she never came out, the ship, and consequently the voyage, were broken up. The American Consul at Port Louis was under the necessity of sending the passengers on to Australia at a great expense to the government. Capt. Jenkins was obliged to remain on the island until the following May, when he took passage in a British merchant ship for England, and arrived in this country about the end of May, 1854. Upon his arrival, he could not find that any insurance had been effected on the shares of the ship in question, and accordingly commenced a suit against defendant for a breach of his contract. The plaintiff has since died, and the suit is continued by his widow. It was sought by plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Black, to make defendant liable as an insurer.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Liabilities of Marine Insurers.

"Corbett, Serg. Boston; Testimony on His Shooting Booth",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/18/archives/testimony-of-sergt-boston-corbett.html,"Corbett, Serg. Boston; Testimony on His Shooting Booth","Examined by Judge Hall -- Q. -- You may state what part you took in the pursuit, capture and killing of Booth, beginning the narrative at the point where you arrived at the house? A. -- When I arrived at the house my superior officer, Lieut. Doherty, told me that Booth was there, and directed me to deploy men to the right and left round the building and see that no one escaped. By this time inquiries had been made at the house, and it was ascertained that Booth was not in the house but in the barn. The greater part of the guard were withdrawn from the house and placed around the barn, and orders were given to allow no one to escape; we had been previously cautioned to see that our arms were in readiness for use; after being ordered to surrender, and told that the barn would be fired if they did not, we remained there some minutes; Booth inquired who we took him for; he said his leg was broken, and what did we want with him; he was told that it made no difference who we were, that we knew who they were, and that they must surrender themselves as prisoners. He wanted to know where they would be taken if they gave themselves up. No reply was given. The parley lasted much longer than the time first stated, probably, I should think fully half an hour, more or less. In the course of that time, many words passed, and Booth positively declared he would not surrender. At one time he said, ""Well, my boys, you may get a stretcher for me."" At another time he said, ""Well, Captain, make quick work -- shoot me through the heart,"" or words to that effect, so that I knew he was perfectly desperate, and would not surrender. After a while, I heard whispering there. Booth had previously declared there was no other person in there. The other person, who proved to be Herrold, seemed to be trying to persuade Booth to surrender. We could not hear the words. After a while, Booth sung out, ""Captain, there is a man in here who wants to surrender;"" words followed, but I could not hear what they were; Booth said, ""Oh, go out and save your life;"" he then called out: ""I declare before my Maker this man is innocent of any crime whatever,"" or words to that effect; further words followed, in which Herrold seemed to tell Booth that he would not surrender; he was told to take his arms and come out; Herrold declared he had no arms; Booth also declared that this other man was unarmed -- that the arms belonged to him. Immediately after this, Herrold, having been taken out with arms, Detective Lieut.-Col. Conger came over to the side where I was and directed the barn to be fired. I had been previously standing before a crack in the boards large enough to put in your hand; I knew that Booth could see us and could have picked us oil, and he in fact once made the remark: ""I could have picked three or four of your men off. Just draw your men off fifty yards and I will come out."" He used such words many times. When the fire was lighted, which was almost immediately after Herrold had been taken out of the barn, I could see him distinctly in about the middle of the barn. He started at first toward the door, and I had a full front dress view of him. I could have shot him much easier than at the time I did, but as long as he made no demonstration I did not shoot him. I kept my eye on him steadily. He turned toward the other side. He brought his piece up to an aim, and I supposed he was going to fight his way out. I thought the time had come, and I took a steady aim upon him and shot him. The ball entered his head a little back of the ear, and came out a little higher on the other side of the head. He lived, I think, until about seven o'clock that morning, perhaps two or three hours after he was shot. I did not hear him speak after he was shot, except to cry out when ho was shot. Others stated that he did utter words after that, but I did not hear any after I shot him.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Testimony of Sergt.

"Wise, Ex-Gov., and Fernando Wood, on John Brown's Execution; And Ex-Gov. Wise on John Brown's Execution; Ex-Gov. Wise on Executing",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/18/archives/a-pair-of-patriots.html,"Wise, Ex-Gov., and Fernando Wood, on John Brown's Execution; And Ex-Gov. Wise on John Brown's Execution; Ex-Gov. Wise on Executing","The correspondence recently published, between ex-Gov. WISE and FERNANDO WOOD on the subject of JOHN BROWN's execution, is highly honorable to both parties. One hardly knows which to admire most, WOOD's humanity or WISE's firmness. And then it is exceedingly interesting to know how the ""ultra friends of the South,"" of whom Mr. WOOD was one, according to his recent speeches, felt about JOHN BROWN and other people at that time. Mr. WOOD, it will be perceived, entirely agreed with Governor WISE in thinking that somebody ought to be hanged; but he differed with him as to who it ought to be. WOOD thought that it ought to be SEWARD, and announced that were he Governor of Virginia, and could catch him, he would hang him. The Secretary of State has long known that the slaveholders' hatred of him might some time or other find expression in acts of violence, but he little knew how near he stood to an untimely end in 1859. Only two little ""if's"" stood between him and the gallows. ""If"" FERNANDO WOOD had been Governor of ""Virginia, and ""if"" he had been able ""to catch him"" it would have been all up with him. It is impossible, even at this distance of time, to read of such a hair-breadth escape without a shudder; and it is certainly reassuring to know that if troublous times should ever come upon us again, we have among us a man of such nerve, and such lofty ambition as this letter proves Mr. WOOD to be. The cause of the South, too, we may be sure, will be well taken care of so long as it has such ""ultra friends"" amongst us as he has shown himself. WISE, however, is such a fine fellow, and shows in this letter such a clear appreciation of the duties of a chief magistrate in certain trying positions, to which out of respect for his own position just now, we will not more particularly allude, that we cannot bear to have him leave the country. The loss of such a man at this crisis, would be a serious one for us all. We do not know whether he has been paroled, or whether he is within reach, or of how many leading rebels President JOHNSON intends to make an example; but we sincerely trust that in selecting candidates for such a fate, his claims may not be overlooked. So ardent a lover of strict justice, of the full vigor of the law, as he proved himself in the case of BROWN, would surely rejoice even in being himself executed for rebellion. It could hardly fail to be a satisfaction to him to illustrate his own doctrines on the scaffold. There has been no worse traitor than himself in the whole rebel army. The crimes deliberately done by him, to use his own language, ""have been of the deepest and darkest kind that can be committed against our people."" We propose ""to allow him an excess of counsel and unusual freedom of speech,"" but we should like to have him ""legally and fairly tried and convicted,"" as he describes JOHN BROWN to have been. Hanging would follow as a matter of course, but to this, unless we are greatly mistaken in him, he is not the man to object it may be said, that if he was hanged, it would make a martyr of him at the South, but to this he, himself, furnishes us with a full and conclusive reply:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Pair of Patriots.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Pair of Patriots.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Brown, John', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8e00e1a7-9680-5411-9903-3e27a376d611,791,nyt://article/8e00e1a7-9680-5411-9903-3e27a376d611
"""Historicus"" on Democracy and the Rebellion",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/18/archives/the-letter-from-historicus-on-democracy-and-the-rebellion.html,"""Historicus"" on Democracy and the Rebellion","The assassination of Mr. LINCOLN called forth an able letter from ""Historicus"" to the London Times, which we copy to-day, and in which, as our readers may see, there was no lack of just appreciation and kindly expression. After a paragraph or two about Mr. LINCOLN's character, however, the writer turns to consider the fact of the collapse of the rebellion, and the effect which it will have in England. He sees, apparently, that it is likely to have a political effect there, and that it may tend to shake the firmness of the political forms with which the British aristocracy has buttressed itself; and he hastens to argue that any effect of that kind will be an illogical one. ""In my judgment,"" says he, ""the war in America had nothing whatever to do with democracy. It arose from an irreconcilable opposition of interests, and from an irrepressible social conflict which might have equally broken out in a monarchical or in an aristocratical State."" Possibly it might, but it would not follow that it would have nothing to do with democracy, even in that case. If it was a conflict which involved the success or the overthrow of democratic principles, it makes no difference what was the form of the government under which it arose. If we are right in our understanding, that the rebellion was in the interest of slavery, its overthrow is certainly for the interest of true democracy. If the principles which set it on foot and sustained it were anti-democratic, how could it have had ""nothing whatever to do with democracy?""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Letter from ""Historicus"" on Democracy and the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Letter from ""Historicus"" on Democracy and the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/99fce33f-5383-5253-a320-034146019f84,1015,nyt://article/99fce33f-5383-5253-a320-034146019f84

"THE PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT. -- The matter of the constitutionality of the law passed by the late Legislature, creating a Metropolitan Fire Department, was argued yesterday before the general term of the Supreme Court. Attorney-General COCHRAN, on behalf of the Old Fire Department, contended that the act limited the territorial authority of the Metropolitan Fire Commissioners to the boundaries of the City of New-York, and therefore, the appointment of these gentlemen by the Governor was in direct violation of article 10, section 2, of the State Constitution, which provides that city officers shall be elected by their constituents, or be appointed by some of the city authorities. This point was argued at length, and formed the main ground of objection on the part of the plaintiffs. Per contra, it was urged by Mr. WALDO HUTCHINGS, on behalf of the commissioners, that the act of the Legislature created a new civil division of the State for certain purposes, which might be done without violating article 10, section 2, of the State Constitution, and that their offices are new offices, having new powers, created since the adoption of the constitution, and not affected by that instrument. Mr. HUTCHINGS also contended, in answer to the charge of intrusion by the defendants into the offices of the officers of the old department, that the latter were not public officers in any sense, nor were they city or county officers, but simply officers of a corporation which was abolished by a statute in a constitutional manner.

"Trade Restrictions, Removal of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/20/archives/editorial-article-1-no-title.html,"Trade Restrictions, Removal of","REMOVAL OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS. -- We have already referred to the activity prevailing in business circles in consequence of the partial removal of restrictions upon trade with the States lately in rebellion. From a circular of the Secretary of the Treasury, published yesterday, it appears that commercial intercourse with the States east of the Mississippi is absolutely as untrammeled as ever it was before the war. The Custom-house authorities have entirely dispensed with the requirement which made it necessary for persona intending to ship goods to the recently opened ports to first prove their loyalty, and will in future pay little heed to the fact whether merchandize so shipped is contraband of war. Questions that may arise in relation to the loyalty of consignees are to be determined by the officers of the government at the places to which the goods are forwarded. The rules respecting shipments to Bermuda, Nassau, and other so-called ""neutral"" ports, which were necessary to prevent those places from being channels of supply from the North to the rebels, and which have been heretofore stringently enforced, will also be materially relaxed; and limited shipments can now be made to the ports formerly classed as ""contraband,"" excepting, perhaps, Matamoras and a few other places whence rebels west of the Mississippi might receive aid and comfort, without giving bonds or consular certificates as to how the goods are to be disposed of. Under these circumstances, the shipping interest and trade generally have received a further impetus.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/14c118f9-61bd-54fb-a347-d579a8269d16,248,nyt://article/14c118f9-61bd-54fb-a347-d579a8269d16

There is nothing unnatural in this. But one would suppose that even the readiest of DAVIS' apologists would hesitate to affirm that his formal indorsement of OLDHAM'S detailed plan for devastating the North, supplied no evidence of his approval of the ""detached service."" ""There is nothing,"" says one eager advocate, ""in that (the indorsement) to implicate DAVIS in the assassination plot."" Again, says the same zealous pleader, ""Even the indorsement is not an approval of the composition, but simply a request, as if in the ordinary routine of official business, that the Secretary of State should see Gen. HARRIS about it!"" That, of course, was all. DAVIS himself certainly didn't formally approve of the phosphoric preparation for smothering Northern women and children in their beds. The ""composition,"" whatever it was, had not been submitted to the rebel President. It had been put into the hands of a scientific agent of the Confederacy -- Prof. MCCULLOUGH -- and DAVIS himself is careful to note the fact that the secret of the preparation was known only to one person besides the Professor.

DAVIS, and what the government proposes to the with him. Rumor, and rumor alone, as yet, designates Fort Lafayette as the place of his confinement prior to trial. Gen. DIX, who, in his capacity of commander of this department, controls Fort Lafayette, as he does Fort Warren, at Boston Harbor, has received no official intimation of the coming of the distinguished rebel. All that is known even of the possibility of his coming, is that unusual activity is noticeable at the fort, and certain matters predicting the arrival of and preparation for somebody are in training. Fort Lafayette is the cleanest of all clean places, and the whitest washed of all whitewashed fortifications, and yet the scouring -- brush, the broom and the paint-pot were never in such brisk use as at this time. The rooms -- for it is a popular delusion that there are cells at the fort -- are in good order, safely barricaded and guarded. The smallest room is about thirteen feet wide and perhaps twenty-five feet long. In this were formerly lodged such men of note as the government wished to be kept from general intercourse. This room is very comfortable, light, airy, clean, and next to the guard-house. Neither BEALL nor KENNEDY were confined there, and it is not likely that JEFF. will be. The next room, No. 2, is somewhat larger, but equally comfortable and light. In this, after the State and a few prisoners of war were removed, BEALL, and subsequently KENNEDY, were kept. At that time fastenings of great security were put upon the door and windows, and it is now the most suitable place in which to keep the expected prisoner. The bounty-brokers who were confined in No. 3, (also a large and comfortable room,) were released some time since. Besides these, there are no rooms, properly speaking, on the ground floor. The large batteries in which stand the heavy guns, were partitioned off into pens large enough for the comfortable lodgment of thirty or forty men each. In these the bounty-jumpers were confined, and there too they probably spent the most miserable month of their swindling existence. As they were either thieves or soldiers, their detention was regarded as a matter in the hands of the War Department, and it had been determined to send them at once to the front as enlisted men, when the sudden break-up of the Southern armies rendered further addition to the army unnecessary, and they were dismissed.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JEFF.

That this will prove to be beyond all comparisons the grandest military spectacle, over witnessed in America, is quite evident. By as much as the war of 1861 surpassed in magnitude and intensity its predecessors of 1775, 1812, and 1846, by so much will this parade exceed in magnificence all former ones. And what, indeed, are the exploits of the past compared with the luster which has lately here been added to American arms? What, in the North, were Bunker Hill, or Bennington, or Stony Point, or Trenton, or Saratoga? What, in the South, were Cowpens, and Eutaw, King's Mountain and Yorktown? What in 1812 and 1815 were Chippewa, Lundy's Lane or New-Orleans? What, finally, in the Mexican war were Taylor's Palo Alto, and Resaca, Monterey and Buena Vista, or Scott's Cherubusco and Chepultepec? Formerly, an army of 50,000 men was an astonishing and apparently irresistible force. It is a handful now. The regular army, in camp and garrison, will certainly double that number, and probably treble it. The gallant American dead, now sleeping under the soil so stoutly contested through four years, are to be counted by hundreds of thousands. The living veterans, who have wounds to show or a story of death escaped to tell, are numbered by millions. It is the survivors of an unparalleled war, the flower of the grandest armies ever seen in America, who, 200,000 strong, will pass, on Tuesday and Wednesday, in farewell review.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Grand Military Review.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Grand Military Review.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4ec80cba-ae5c-50df-9765-66af3ec90735,1023,nyt://article/4ec80cba-ae5c-50df-9765-66af3ec90735

The Twelfth Ward (Twenty-third Precinct) police, on making cautious inquiry, soon ascertained that nearly every resident of the village had taken counterfeit fifty-cent and twenty-five cent fractional notes at Frederick SCHROEDER's grocery, Second-avenue, corner of Eighty-fifth-street, but that SCHROEDER had always readily and with seeming innocence redeemed this currency, and this disarmed suspicion. Having learned these facts, the police kept strict watch over SCHROEDER's grocery, and on Thursday night detected him in the sale of a large quantity of the spurious notes; but, hoping to learn who his confederates were, the officers kept their own counsel, and permitted him to go on with his sales until Friday afternoon, when, having gathered such information as they desired, they entered the grocery and apprehended SCHROEDER and his wife and their clerk, one LOUIS STOCK, and took possession of the place. In the money-fill they found spurious fractional notes of various denominations representing $90, and on SCHROEDER's other spurious currency was found.

JOHN J. GEER, author of the celebrated book ""A Yankee Prisoner Loose in Dixie,"" is now engaged in selling several photographs of those unfortunate men who have lost their feet by exposure in the Southern prisons of Georgia. The proceeds from the sale of these pictures are devoted to the benefit of these ""feetless men."" Nothing could give a more harrowing or realizing sense of the awful sufferings endured by our gallant volunteers in those diabolical prison pens of the Confederacy, than these photographs. Without any shelter against the inclemency of the weather, scarcely any clothing, very little food, and no fire, the prisoners were compelled to walk about to keep what little blood yet remained in their systems in circulation. Constant contact with the cold sand, caused the blood to stagnate, and the feet of 287 of these prisoners actually rotted off, and of this wretchedly stricken band only 45 survive. Capt. GEER has had these men confided to his care, and he now attends to their present welfare at David's Island, while at the same time he is making strenuous exertions to procure some permanent home of refuge for his interesting family.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; AGRICULTURE IN THE PARK.

Returning to Loyalty and the Plow; Reviving Loyalty in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/21/archives/reviving-loyalty-in-north-carolina-and-virginia.html,Returning to Loyalty and the Plow; Reviving Loyalty in,"-- The recent meetings at Raleigh in North Carolina, and Staunton, Virginia, convened with the object of looking the actual situation straight in the face, have an essentially healthy character. We class the two together, because, although the Staunton gathering (on the 8th) was composed of men who barely perceive the radical nature of the revolution which has overtaken the State as a member of the Union, those who participated in the meeting were evidently as desirous as the people of Raleigh to learn what their political status really is, and thereupon to accommodate themselves to the change with loyal submission. The resolutions passed were such as to command attention, if not entire assent, from those who take a thoughtful view of the question of the reestablishment of the civil power of the State. At Raleigh, on the 11th inst., a bolder tone evidently prevailed, and the temper of the resolutions indicate beyond a doubt that in the capital of North Carolina these is no misapprehension of the actual position of State affairs, and no desire to shirk the responsibility of finding some radical remedy, with as little delay as is consistent with a regard to great national interests involved. The meeting, by a perfectly unanimous vote, formally acknowledge ""the necessity and good policy of retaining a military force in the State, until a State Government is put in operation."" But they further resolve that an early convention of the people is desirable to take some steps for reestablishing the civil authority. And to make clear the loyalty of purpose in which this resolution originates, they declare their approval of ""the policy of the President, as indicated in his recent addresses, and will aid him, as far as possible, in carrying it out in North Carolina, that rebellion may be made odious, a just and loyal tone of public sentiment established, and the legitimate authority of the government recognized and respected, as the only means of preserving our liberties, securing the general prosperity of the people, and perpetuating the inestimable rights and privileges so dearly purchased by the blood of our fathers, and handed down as a priceless inheritance to their children.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REVIVING LOYALTY IN NORTH CAROLINA AND; VIRGINIA.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REVIVING LOYALTY IN NORTH CAROLINA AND; VIRGINIA.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c9a31110-b1e0-57ca-84a5-7d87b39a7602,362,nyt://article/c9a31110-b1e0-57ca-84a5-7d87b39a7602

Inside the bar stood three or four court officers, each holding an open Bible, and as the candidates were called, they steeped within the railing, placed each his right hand or left (there were eight left-handed candidates) upon the open volume, and there these right and left hands remained while the Clerk, Mr. D.B.

Freedmen; The Education of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/21/archives/the-education-of-freedmen.html,Freedmen; The Education of,"The uproar made by the planters in North Carolina over the refusal of the negroes to work, and their disposition to flock into the towns, will, we predict, not last very long. Negroes have to learn their duties as freedmen just as while men who to learn them The first motive which impels white laborers to submit to daily toil, is the desire to save themselves and their families from starvation; it is only after this has had its due influence that the desire of rising in the world begins to operate. Now, the negroes hitherto have never learnt to connect idleness with bodily suffering or inconvenience. As slaves, they got the same amount of the pleasures of life whether they worked well or ill, and never knew what it was to feel any responsibility whatever about their own maintenance. They will now learn that there is a necessary connection between bread and labor, that the one cannot be had without the other, and it is a lesson which it does not take very long to acquire. We venture to assert that it will find its way through the thickest skull before many weeks. Hunger and nakedness are as disagreeable, and their wives and children as dear to negroes as to other people. There will doubtless be various degrees of industry witnessed amongst them always. Men who have never known what it was to pocket the fruits of their own toil, are not likely to be seized with a sudden passion for labor for its own sake all at once; and we believe that even among while men cases of dislike for steady work are occasionally discovered. So that we have no doubt whatever that before many weeks the negroes all over the South will be found doing the work of cultivation as well as they know how, or as the planters can expect. If they do not do it, we trust there will be men enough from the North to go down and take their places, and make them feel the sharp but invigorating pressure of competition.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Education of Freedmen.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Education of Freedmen.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe818aea-789a-5816-a986-f106d9d4c2d6,857,nyt://article/fe818aea-789a-5816-a986-f106d9d4c2d6

"History of Julius Caesar, vol. 1, 8vo, NewYork, HARPER  BROTHERS, is the simple title-page prefixed to a work that, whether regarded in its subject, or the source from whence it emanates, is bound to make some noise in the world.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/22/archives/new-books.html,,"-- History of Julius Caesar, vol. 1, 8vo, NewYork, HARPER BROTHERS, is the simple title-page prefixed to a work that, whether regarded in its subject, or the source from whence it emanates, is bound to make some noise in the world. Many will, perhaps, be disappointed to find it what it is -- a grave, earnest, scholarly and vigorously written view of the turning-point in the history of the world -- the era when, according to the aspect illustrated in the work, the imperial talents and energies of one man gave shape and color to the whole succeeding destinies of the human race. To prove that such men, when they appear -- whether called Caesar, Charlemagne or Napoleon, are to be accepted as raised up by Providence to point out to lesser minds the way wherein they shall go, to accomplish in a few years the ordinary work of centuries, and to stamp the seal of their individuality on their epoch, is the main object of the book. In it the lessons of history will be applied to the instruction of the present and future times, by deducing from them the immutable laws that they exemplify. The whole work is impressed with a remarkable idiosyncrasy that unmistakably denotes it as the production of a single mind. With every disposition to treat it severely the English critics have discovered few or no drawbacks to its substantial accuracy, and the work will infallibly take lasting rank as one, and not the least, among the remarkable deeds of its author. Much of the present volume is introductory; the active career of CAESAR being hardly yet reached, so that the interest will increase with the progress of the book. The translation has been made, under the Imperial auspices, by Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT, one of the most accomplished scholars of the day, and member of the French ""Institut."" The volume is a splendid specimen of bookmaking, being got up in a superb style, superior indeed to the English copy, and reflects the greatest credit on Messrs. HARPER's establishment.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/851a34f8-a797-5b85-81b8-464fdf980194,1476,nyt://article/851a34f8-a797-5b85-81b8-464fdf980194

It was taught in their schools, in their families, and in every form of social and political teaching. Their schoolmasters were thus far more responsible for the ideas which lay at the bottom of the rebellion, than were the politicians and statesmen who took the lead in it.

"Orton, Hon. W. Appointed Chief Revenue Bureau",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/22/archives/hon-william-orton.html,"Orton, Hon. W. Appointed Chief Revenue Bureau","-- That principle so happily illustrated in the elevation of Hon. HUGH McCULLOCH to the Head of the Department, with which he had been identified for so many years as a most efficient and accomplished officer, finds another most commendable application in the promotion of Hon. WILLIAM ORTON, Internal Revenue Collector for the Sixth District in this city, to the Head of the Bureau at Washington, just now made vacant by the resignation of Judge LEWIS. The expediency and wisdom, not less than the justice of promotion in civil as well as military life, for ""meritorious-services,"" significant as it is of greater fitness and higher qualifications for advanced rank, are every day coming to be better understood, and their more general recognition and acknowledgment by the government and the people, cannot fail to result in great public advantage. In deference to this principle, the appointment of Mr. ORTON is everywhere received with special favor. By natural fitness, persevering study and large experience, it is not likely that any man can be found better furnished for the high position which has sought him, and which it is to be hoped he will feel constrained to accept. Collector of our of the most important districts of the whole country, helping to put in operation the original machinery of the internal revenue system, and, for most of the time since, the confidential agent, and in some sense, umpire and counselor of the deportment for the whole city, he has enjoyed remarkable facilities for making himself thoroughly familiar with the details and working of the law, through all its changes; of noting its defects as well as its excellencies; and preparing himself for the suggestion and elaboration of such reforms as could not fail to be felt in the general prosperity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HON.

FENTON has refused his signature to the bill authorizing an underground railroad in this city. We have always regarded such a road as the only measure which would afford substantial relief to our overcrowded streets, and facilitate transit from one part of the city to another. It is perfectly certain that there is not room on the surface of the city to accommodate the traffic which its business requires. Being situated upon a long and narrow island, its surface is restricted and its streets are narrow. A careful calculation shows that, even with its present population, enough railroads cannot be placed in its streets to accommodate all who wish to ride, without absolutely stopping its business traffic. This evil, of necessity, increases from year to year, and will absolutely compel, sooner or later, resort to such a road as that which the Governor has just refused to permit.

He was born at Huntsville, Ala., in 1814, educated at LaGrange College, studied law at Transylvania University, and was admitted to the bar in 1834. Subsequently he filled several important judicial and legislative positions in his State, and in 1842 raised a company of troops to go to Texas, and he subsequently became Lieutenant-Colonel in the volunteer and the regular army. In 1844 he served as Presidential elector on the Polk ticket. Afterward he was a sort of Military Governor over some portion of Mexico held by our army, and so remained until the close of the war. From 1848 to 1853 be was a Senator of the United States from Arkansas, and in 1856 was a Presidential elector, and assisted in casting the vote of Alabama for BUCHANAN. Mr. CLEMENS soon after disappeared from public life, and we have heard little of him in print. It is greatly to his honor, however, to add, that he never was in favor of the Davis rebellion, cut is understood to have steadily opposed the project throughout. Mr. CLEMENS has some reputation as an author, having published several works of fiction which have been favorably received; the first was Bernard Lile, in 1853; another was Mustang Gray, to 1857; and very recently he has sent to press (and we think issued) a novel founded upon scenes in the great rebellion.

It is said, in the first place, that their motives must always be taken into account in deciding upon the expediency of punishing offences committed by large bodies of men; that it is absurd to attempt to weigh the acts of whole communities in the same scale as the acts of individuals, or to suppose that a human tribunal is competent to deal out exact justice with regard to offences of which millions share the guilt, if guilt there be, and of which the conscience of a whole people approve; that many great revolutions, which the world now recognizes as justifiable in their origin and beneficent in their results, were hold in abhorrence by the best portion of the world at the time of their occurrence. This, it is admitted, proves nothing as to their real righteousness or unrighteousness, but it is maintained that it does prove that the opinions of cotemporaries, and especially of those who are themselves parties to the quarrel, can never furnish a standard of right and wrong sufficiently accurate to base a sentence of condemnation on it. An opinion is not necessarily right because large numbers hold and act on it; but the fact that large numbers do hold it does at least raise a doubt whether those who hold the opposite one have got the whole truth on their side.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trial of Jeff.

Annexation Feeling Revived,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/24/archives/annexation-of-the-british-provinces.html,Annexation Feeling Revived,"There are unmistakable signs in the neighboring Provinces of a revival of the annexation feeling of 1849. The reaction caused by the failure of the scheme for uniting all the Provinces, has had its influence in this direction. The proposal to spend the trifle (£50,000 sterling a year for four years) voted by the British Parliament, in forts at and around Quebec, while nothing has been voted for the West, has naturally provoked unaimable feelings in the peninsular districts of Upper Canada. The fear that no commensurate gain would accrue to the Western tax-payer -- who contributes three-fourths of the customs' dues -- for building a military railroad from Quebec to Halifax, has grown stronger every day as the prospect of a political union with the maritime Provinces has declined. And some of the local journals of the Upper Province are not backward in giving emphatic expression to sentiments strongly derogatory to the importance and value of continued British connexion. The industrial interests of the country, east and west, are in a more backward condition than they have been for many years. And there is a large and steady emigration both from Lower and Upper Canada to the United States. These are facts which we record with anything but pleasure. The people of this country were satisfied to see the colonists make an experiment in federation, either as a dependency of the mother country, or otherwise, as they might deem most profitable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANNEXATION OF THE BRITISH PROVINCES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANNEXATION OF THE BRITISH PROVINCES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/035636dc-e62a-549d-a2b5-920f9a110368,256,nyt://article/035636dc-e62a-549d-a2b5-920f9a110368

In the manufacturing, income tax, stamps and licenses; in fact in every branch of business, frauds are perpetrated, but the grand eldorado is found in distillation. The recent seizures of whisky in this city, Chicago, Cincinnati and Boston, have fully proved that the saving of the heavy tax of two dollars per gallon is too great an inducement to resist, even for those who have heretofore occupied positions in the community as high minded and honorable merchants. Thousands of dollars have been saved to the government through the vigilance of its officers, but with all their vigilance, it is estimated by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, that out of the one hundred millions of gallons annually manufactured, not more than twenty millions will pay the duty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FRAUDS ON THE GOVERNMENT.; Ingenious Devices to Avoid the Tax on Whisky Organization of a Detective Force by the Regular Trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FRAUDS ON THE GOVERNMENT.; Ingenious Devices to Avoid the Tax on Whisky Organization of a Detective Force by the Regular Trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b43bb17-ead2-5b5e-b648-bb43a2a73170,873,nyt://article/3b43bb17-ead2-5b5e-b648-bb43a2a73170

Every ""battle-field, from the first Bull Run to the surrender of LEE, was gloriously represented; the banners that went through fire to victory were there, and the noble men who survived the leaden storm were proudly marched under them. Now and then, as some gallant officer made a conspicuous part in the procession, the applause became vociferous, and wreaths of laurel and showers of flowers were lavished upon him.

His owner states that within a year or two he has fought three pitched battles with full grown bears and came off victorious in each. He fomerly belonged to a Capt. ALEXANDER, who repeatedly refused $700 in gold for him, and matched him on one occasion in a bear-fight for $12,000. The animal is said to possess an amiable temper when not provoked.

His pulse has been quickened by all its heroic associations, and by all its suggestions of the might and majesty of the republic. As a mere military spectacle, its like, in all probability, will never hereafter be seen on this continent. It is not easy to conceive any occasion that will ever again bring together two hundred thousand American soldiers. So soon as order and security are fully reestablished, our armies will again be reduced to a handfull. This rebellion has had such a terrible overthrow, that it seems certain that no other will ever be attempted. It is likely enough that, at some future time, we shall become engaged in war with some Power across the ocean; but such a war would be almost exclusively maritime, and no extensive enlistments of soldiers would be required. We may declare almost positively that this American Republic will never again see such another array of armed men. That in itself would make this parade an occasion of transcendent mark. And yet how tame is the mere circumstance of numbers in this case. Who gives a thought to the bare fact that two hundred thousand soldiers have been reviewed in the National Capital? The thought that fills the mind is not how many soldiers; but what soldiers. Who would not rather see the three hundred of Thermopylae than all the millions of Xerxes?

"Mlle. STELLA BONHEUR's concert, on Monday evening, was in every respect an agreeable entertainment. The programme was of judicious length; the artists were all present, (alas, that we should be compelled to refer to this as a creditable circumstance,) and their morceaux were rendered with taste and efficiency. Mr. EBEN, the flutist, who headed the programme, but did not commence it, played a couple of fantasias excellently; Mr. MILL, (piano,) and Mr. THOMAS, (violin,) gave us a duo concertante on themes from ""Oberon"" with great effect -- how, indeed, could they do otherwise? Mr. MILLS, in addition, played his admirable ""Faust"" arrangement -- playing it as he alone can play it. Signor MONGIARDINI, a pleasant concert singer, sang a couple of Verdian ditties with complete acceptance. Signor IPPOLITO also indulged in strains from the same maestro. We reserve for our last the pleasant duly of speaking of the lady. Mlle. BONHEUR has a charming voice, which a few years since would have been called a contrallo, but which at present it is the fashion to style a mezzo-soprano. In coloring it is still the former. Few singers possess a purer organ. It is large, flexible and sympathetic. The lady has vastly added to her control of it, and is, therefore, able to do some justice to her own conception of the music. We were both astonished and pleased at the notable progress in Mlle. BONHEUR's method. It is, we are informed, due to the skill of Signor ERRANI, a tenor of repute himself, and a teacher who knows the value of largeness and freedom of style. These he has imparted to his pupil. We shall be greatly mistaken if, under the gentleman's advice, Mlle. BONHEUR does not quickly attain a prominent position on the lyric stage.

He doubtless knew, unofficially, that the question was under discussion in the cabinet, pending which no positive information could be given. He must have known, too, that in the absence of Lord PALMERSTON, a formal statement of the case would hardly be made to the House of Commons. No one, therefore, was surprised that Mr. WHITE -- probably having been requested by the government to do so -- postponed his inquiry. This postponement, however, will not relieve the British Ministry from a strong pressure on their own side of the House, to hasten their decision, and prepare the way for an arbitration of the questions at issue between the two governments on various points of neutrality, the settlement of which are essential to a mutual good understanding.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BELLIGERENT RIGHTS IN THE BRITISH PARLIA; MENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BELLIGERENT RIGHTS IN THE BRITISH PARLIA; MENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/883e8418-be25-50db-8e49-41bcb9bf7c27,156,nyt://article/883e8418-be25-50db-8e49-41bcb9bf7c27

HOSMER, will make her first appearance here on Monday next. The present week will, therefore, be the last of the ""Gray Lady of Penarvon."" This drama has been somewhat abused by the press, even by that member of it, who, knowing what mental feebleness is himself, ought to have spared all comment on it in another -- we mean the ""celebrated dramatist"" of ""Cartouche"" -- but the fact remains that as an exceptional mystery, the ""Gray Lady,"" in spite of these heavy circumstances, is excellent. No one can tell until the last act which is the poisoner, and in consequence the interest is maintained, and increases ad infinitum. We are willing to confess that the sombre hues of the story are rather overwhelming. They are not to our taste, but this is no argument against their judicious use. Some of GUSTAVE DORE's best productions are in black and white -- with very little white. So also are the works of the distinguished dramatist already referred to, with no white at all. It is nonsense to introduce a Maypole in a graveyard, and Mr. TAYLOR has felt, without doubt, the impossibility of relieving the intensity of the ""Gray Lady"" without disturbing the piquant apprehension of the audience, and so destroying a denouement which all must confess is impressive.

But if this cannot be done, we shall be forced to the conclusion that the Juarist forces on the Rio Grande are much more numerous and furmidable than the Franco-Mexican accounts represent. On the 29th of April there was was a Republican army of 4,000 men under Gen. NEGRETO, encamped within two leagues of the city. Judging by the wholesale emigration to the Texan side of the river, which the announcement of this fact seems to have caused, and judging also from the extreme measures taken by Gen. MEJIA to improvise a defensive army, the situation must have become to some extent critical for the Imperialists.

The importance of the case, the professional position of the accused, and the standing of the several eminent counsel engaged, attracted a large number of public and distinguished men, WM. CULLEN BRYANT, the venerable JOSHUA LEAVITT, Judges WHITING, DEAN and BEBEE, Recorder HOFFMAN and JAMES T. BRADY sitting among them. A notable group sat around the lawyers' table at 11 o'clock. The long, white hair and genial countenance attracted the attention first to the District-Attorney, Mr. DICKINSON. At his side sat the subtle CALEB CUSHING, who, for more than half a century, has stood in the front rank of the best legal talent. His burly form is well preserved, and his hard head is well covered with hair. The thin, spare form of WM.M. EVARTS barely supports his forward bent head, although the clear blue eye and the pleasant smile indicatee good health and spirits. HENDERSON, the accused, sat just beyond. He is a man of medium height, with a small, round head, side whiskers, a prominent nose, thin lips and pleasant expression, seemingly self-possessed and unmoved. He refrained entirely from conversation, and recognized but few acquaintances. WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, the responsible editor of the Post, with well balanced head, entirely bald, and long whiskers of marvelous whiteness, looked a beau ideal of the successful poet; by his side was JOSHUA LEAVITT, the nestor of religious journalism in America; joining the legal group, with a huge pile of papers before him, was EDWARDS PIERREPONT, whose keen blade was flashed so unpleasantly before the eyes of Mayor OPDYKE a few months since; JAMES T. BRADY, browned and burnt by the hot sun of New-Orleans, was cordially greeted by his brethren of the bar, and sat not far from the jury-box.

This he declined to do, on the ground that he had received no instruct ions from Richmond. Subsequently, however, finding himself in a very tight place, he proposed to deliver his vessel to the Havana authorities, on condition that she should never be given up to the United States -- a proposal that was promptly and properly rejected. Capt. PAGE then concluded to make the bent of a bad case, and surrendered his vessel unconditionally to the authorities.

Within the past mouth, under the able supervision of the President of the Mutual Club, JOHN WILDEY, those improvements have been made, and Monday last was set apart as a grand opening day of the new grounds.

The ladies have evidently taken racing in hand, and evince a determination to support the legitimate pastimes of the turf, aa in France and England -- a resolution at which we rejoice, as the presence of the fairer portion of creation exercises a humanizing influence on all present, and the stigma once attached to the turf is by their bright patronage effaced. Henceforth at all our local race-courses we anticipate seeing a brilliant array of beauty and fashion, such as we had at Paterson, and again at Saratoga. The society have been favored with three beautiful days for the pleasures of the turf as far as weather has been concerned. All their arrangements, too, have been unexceptionable, the utmost attention having been given to the comfort and enjoyment of all present, and an earnest desire manifested to contribute to the gratification of every patron of the meeting. We cannot conclude our notice without bearing witness to the efficient services of Mr. JOHN M. FRANCIS, the superintendant of the course, by whom, by the way, it was laid out originally. The judges did their duty faithfully and impartially.

In a monarchy, honor is a motive stronger than presents. But in a despotism, wherein the ruler has neither honor nor virtue, such stimulants may be needful."" PLATO, in his ideal republic, made the acceptance of any reward by a public man for doing his duty punishable with death. The old Romans, in the pure and palmy days of their republic, were so careful about this that they enacted a law expressly limiting all such rewards to those of the most diminutive intrinsic value. Our own republican fathers were so jealous of this influence that they conceived the necessity of incorporating in the constitution itself a clause interdicting the reception of presents by any public official from any foreign quarter, and finally made it statute? aw, which still stands.

This is very silly, and scarcely worthy of notice. The government had no thought of sparing rebel sensitiveness, nor of casting a slight on the gallant soldiers who, on so many battle-fields, have displayed such signal courage and devotion. They were not excluded from the review any more than the white troops who were not present on that occasion. They were required to garrison various important stations in the South, and certainly no higher compliment could have been paid to their bravery, their good discipline, and their devotion to their country, than their selection for this service.

Sensation Reports on Harshness to Davis,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/27/archives/article-2-no-title.html,Sensation Reports on Harshness to Davis,"VICIOUS SENSATION REPORTS. -- The public may properly be warned against giving credit to the report of a Baltimore news-monger relative to the treatment of JEFF. DAVIS at Fortress Monroe. The story is permitted to circulate by telegraph, and we print it to show what is considered essential food for the prevailing vicious appetite for sensations. If the government have found it necessary to adopt extra precautions in the case of the prisoner, we are satisfied that no unnecessary harshness has marked the treatment he has received. And the story in the shape in which it appears is either an emanation from some rebel sympathizer, intended to create a feeling of commiseration for DAVIS, or it has been concocted to supply the lack of truthful intelligence on the subject of that individual's incarceration.

Stover, a prominent machinist and naval contractor, and his chief clerk, Mr. Brown; by them the government proposed to prove that during a long series of transactions between Mr. Stover and Mr. Henderson, on the part of the government, the latter had systematically withheld from the former from eight to ten per cent. of the amounts due him from the government for naval and other supplies. It was found, upon examination, that the business of Mr. Stover was conducted entirely by himself and his chief clerk, Mr. Brown, the one and the other alternating in receiving and depositing the moneys received from Mr. Henderson and others. The magnitude of the business was such, and the frequency of the transactions so confusing, that when the witnesses were placed upon the stand they were unable to identify or swear to any individual transaction, knowing about it and all only such details as appeared upon the books.

"The above is the medical or surgical name of a new system discovered by Doctor E.B.

A correspondent sends us the following account of the application of the above new remedy: -- ""I was seriously afflicted with a sore throat -- diphtheria and all its fatal consequences were ever before my mind, when I first heard of Dr. LIGHTHILL's new system -- Nephotherapy. A friend assured me that it was painless and most efficacious, and so I made up my mind I would try it. When first introduced into the doctor's study, I saw a formidable-looking combination of brass instruments, and an air-pump, which a gentleman of color was working assiduously. Somewhat frightened by this array -- I am a very nervous person -- I hesitatingly took the seat the doctor pointed out, and as he approached me with a lot of bright silver things in his hand, my heart came into my throat. These turned out, however, to be merely a series of little mirrors, by an ingenious use of which the doctor took an accurate survey of my throat. I was put into another chair, and was informed that I should undergo Nephotherapy. 'It is quite painless,' said the doctor; but I confess I did not believe him. At that moment, the gentleman of color pumped harder, and suddenly turned a screw of the brass machine. A mist or fog, (almost invisible, it was so fine,) issued from a tube directed toward my face. I breathed this mist a moment or two, and then, to my surprise, the doctor said, 'That will do.' And this was Nephotherapy. Two applications cured my throat. The fine mist settled upon its inflamed parts like a dew upon the grass, caused no irritation, and removed the disease. For the especial benefit of those who, like myself, are nervous, and for little children who may be afflicted with diseases of the ear, the eye, the throat, or the respiratory organs, I relate my experience of the new system.""

DE LESSEPS, to inspect the works of the Isthmus of Suez Canal, has just returned to Malta. The journey through the isthmus occupied about ten days, during which time the delegates had every opportunity of inspecting the works in progress, and of conferring with the engineers and other officers belonging to the company. The conclusion Mr. CHRISTIAN arrives at is that the completion of the ship canal is only a question of time and money, and that in a very few years the communication from sea to sea for vessels of large tonnage will be established, thus uniting the West with the East by an uninterrupted water route, and shortening the sea voyage from Europe to India for steamers by fully one-half. It still, of course, remains an open question, how far the canal will be useful to our sailing Indiamen, owing to the prevalent winds in the Red Sea. About 80 delegates, representatives of the various States and commercial communities of Europe, Asia and America, performed the journey through the isthmus, accompanied by M. DE LESSETS and the principal officers of the company, to whom, we are informed, the delegates are greatly indebted for the courtesy invariably shown them, and for the readiness with which all their inquiries were answered. It is to be regretted that England was not represented at this very interesting meeting, Mr. CHRISTIAN, as representative of Malta, being the only English commercial delegate present. The delegates performed the journey from the Nile to Ismaila by the freshwater canal, and from Ismaila to Port Said by the maritime (saltwater) canal. The boats were towed by camels, and horses, and for a distance also on the maritime canal by steamers. After inspecting the works in progress at Port Said the delegates returned again south, sailing back to Ismaila with a fresh northerly wind. The maritime canal is not at present navigable for boats beyond Ismaila; the remainder of the journey, therefore, to the Red Sea, had to be performed by the freshwater canal. This latter canal takes its source at the Nile, close to the town of Zagazig, and runs nearly due east through the once for the land of Goshen until it reaches Is[???]a; at about two miles from the latter town it branches off to the southward, leaving Lake Timsah and the Bitter Lakes on the east, and joins the Red Sea at Suez. Ismaila is a flourishing and picturesque little town of three thousand inhabitants, situated in the centre of the isthmus, seventy-five kilometres from Port Said, midway between the two seas at the north end of Lake Timsah, and owes its existence to the works of the canal. The width of the maritime canal varies at present, according to localities, from about sixteen to fifty-eight metres, except in the immediate vicinity of Port Said, where it attains eighty-four metres. Its average depth at present is not more than two to three feet. The depth of the freshwater canal is much the same at present as that of the maritime canal, but, of course, it is deeper during high Nile; its width varies from about sixteen to twenty-five metres. The company, we understand, have contracted with various French firms for the completion of the whole of the works from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea by the 1st of July, 1868, at which date the company expect that the canal will be opened to navigation, at a cost to the shareholders not exceeding the subscribed capital of eight millions sterling. On these points, however, Mr. CHRISTIAN had not sufficient data to enable him to form an accurate opinion. -- Malta Times, May 4.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ CANAL.

The flames were first observed in the fireroom of the chair factory; but they sped upward with such velocity through the inflammable stock and machinery with which the building was filled, that there was literally no time for the escape of the occupants of the upper stories; and had it not been the dinner hour, when nearly all of the workmen were absent, the loss of life must have been appalling. The occupants of the fifth story -- that story having been occupied by families -- were within the building, and they escaped only by pressing into service a rope which had been used in hoisting furniture outside on the front. Two of their number, however, in their eagerness to make their exit, flew to the windows, and, attempting to get thence to the pavement, fell, and were mortally injured. The name of one of these -- a French workman in the factory -- who undertook to descend from the fifth story by hanging on the outer wall, and retaining a hold on the window-sill until the firemen could raise a ladder to rescue him, has not been reported. The volumes of smoke from a fourth story window beneath suffocated him, and he fell while the firemen were preparing, under intense and almost overpowering heat, to take him from the vast, consuming furnace. FRANK STIVER, one of the workmen, who was employed on the third floor, leaped from a window, and was mortally injured. Both men were taken to Bellevue Hospital.

Subsequent investigations by the police of the Forty-eighth Precinct disclosed the following facts: At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, four men, supposed to be Italians, were seen by Mrs. RIZZI to pass by her house, on the corner of Thirty-sixth-street and Third-avenue, in the direction of the woods in which the body was found. In about an hour after, she saw three of the same men return to her corner, and then get into a Greenwood car, going in the direction of the ferry. She noticed them on account of their being, as she supposed, Italians and countrymen of hers. These men are supposed to have committed the murder. The murdered man is about five feet seven inches in height, of heavy build, had black hair, a heavy board and moustache.

MASON & CO.'s extensive chair manufactory, at Nos. 186, 188 and 190 Avenue C. was totally consumed, and several tenement dwellings and other buildings in the immediate neighborhood were very seriously damaged by fire and water, at about noon on Saturday. The flames were first observed in the fireroom of the chair factory; but they sped upward with such velocity through the inflammable stock and reachiery with which the building was filled, that there was literally no time for the escape of the occupants of the upper stories; and had it not been the dinner hour, when nearly all of the workmen were absent, the loss of life, must have been appalling. The occupants of the fifth story -- that story having been occupied by families -- were within the building, and they escaped only by pressing into service a rope which had been used in hoisting furniture outside on the front. Three of their number, however, in their eagerness to make their exit, flow to the windows, and, attempting to get thence to the pavement, fell, and were mortally injured. The name of one of these -- a French workman in the factory-- who undertook to descend from the fifth story by hanging on the outer wall, and retaining a hold on the window-sill until the firemen could raise a ladder to rescue him, has not been reported. The volumes of smoke from a fourth story window beneath suffocated him, and he fell while the fireman were preparing, under intense and almost overpowering heat, to take him from the vast, consuming furnace. FRANK STIVER, one of the workmen, who was employed on the third floor, leaped from a window, and was mortally injured. DENNIS GIBORD, of No. 206 Church-st., was also mortally injured. The three men were taken to Bellevue Hospital. Several occupants of the upper floors narrowly escaped death; but the three men above reported are all that are known to have been injured beyond hope of recovery.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""DISASTROUS CONFLAGRATION IN AVENUE C.; Mason & Co.'s Extensive Chair Factory Destroyed and Other Buildings Damaged.

The Governor of the Provinces had no power to take counsel direct from the British Minister at Washington. Official etiquette likewise forbade his corresponding direct with the Foreign Office in London. He was compelled to address himself for advice to his immediate chief in the Colonial Office, Mr. CARDWELL. The latter had then to bring Lord MONCK's appeal before the Cabinet. From the Cabinet, Lord RUSSELL caught the cue, which he transmitted to Mr. CARDWELL, who, in turn, sent it to Lord MONCK.

It is Mr. FORSYTH's o[???] to present him as a man to his fellow-men, in place of the old classical abstraction that we are apt to figure to ourselves when the heroes of antiquity are referred to. We cannot know too much of one who -- either as an orator, a moralist or a statesman -- stands, if not first of all in the very front rank; of one whose influence in his own age, by his deeds, is only exceeded Thy the immense power he exerted over posterity, by his literary works. The biographer of CICERO fortunately possesses in the rich store of his correspondence (a treasure of the ancient world, perfectly unique in character) the means of depicting the public and private life of the Roman Senator in all its strength, as well as in its most private hours of confiding affection and abandon. Mr. FORSYTH has made an excellent use of the materials that he tells us have been the object of his devoted study for many years, and his work has consequently all the spirit and vivacity of contemporary memoirs. Nor is the story of CICERO's life one of private interest merely; it is part and parcel of the grandest history ever recounted to an awe-struck world -- that of the fall of the Republic of Rome. The book is, in its minutest details, most emphatically a gentleman's book, and is sure to find its way to the library tables of all readers of taste and cultivation.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW ROCKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW ROCKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/823b416c-4e5b-595a-882b-1d905bfce5d5,1563,nyt://article/823b416c-4e5b-595a-882b-1d905bfce5d5
Texas Braggadocia,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/29/archives/rebel-braggadocia.html,Texas Braggadocia,"It was amusing to see, just when the rebels in Texas were, for the first time, seriously threatened with attack, how closely they imitated the language of their brethren on this side of the Mississippi, when placed in a similar position. Before the real pressure had begun to bear on the rebels in Virginia and Tennessee, they luxuriated in meetings, resolutions and declarations of unconquerable hate; they swore they would never surrender, while there was a man or musket left. There was a great sea of blood between them and the Yankees, which could not be bridged over. They would never lay down their arms while the breath of the vandals polluted the pure air of the sunny South, and so on. In reading the accounts of the proceedings at the war meetings lately held in Texas, we seem to be carried back once more to those early days of the war, in which every batch of papers that reached us from the rebel States were filled with this sort of stuff. And what was most comical about it all was that the plainer defeat began to stare them in the face, the more evident it became that they would have to submit very soon, the more loudly they swore that they would never submit under any circumstances. The language of the Virginia orators and journalists was never so fierce and determined as during the great meetings in the African Church, held shortly before the fall of Richmond, and when, as is now known, every man of intelligence in it knew that the Confederacy was on its last legs, and that the opening of the Spring campaign would finish it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Braggadocia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Braggadocia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Texas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8855c01b-7084-5a59-944b-61ad4d35c1ce,378,nyt://article/8855c01b-7084-5a59-944b-61ad4d35c1ce
"National Academy of Design, North Room",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/29/archives/national-academy-of-design-north-room.html,"National Academy of Design, North Room","The room of the north and eke of the cast contain several pictures of satisfactory merit. As a rule, too, they are better hung than in the coridor. Human vanity, for which FRANKLIN says we should be thankful, inasmuch as it is the source of much comfort in life, is the same all the world over. He who holds the power of seizing the best place, is generally content to occupy it. Can we blame the academicians for being a little blind to their own imperfections? Why, for instance, should Mr. T. ADDISON RICHARDS be blamed for placing No. 173, ""Early Spring,"" on the line? The picture is a very bad one, and for that reason requires a very good place. Granting this, does it not follow quoad hoc that a better work should be placed to greater disadvantage? What is the use of a prime position if the advantage to be derived therefrom is to be dominated by contiguous, even if exalted talent? No. 174, by J.B. BRISTOL, A., is worthy of its neighbor. We desire to say the same of Nos. 175 and 176, by Miss STROUGITHARM and Mr. WM. BRADFORD. The dull level of mediocrity is well preserved in these four works. Rising slightly superior to it, Mr. A.F. BELLOWS, N.A., in No. 181, gives us a war subject it is called the ""Departure of the Regiment."" The aged parents of a recruit are assembled in a field, and in the distance a regiment is seen crossing the village bridge. The subject is theatrical, and inaccurate. Regiments did not leave in such wise, although companies may have done so. Even where the latter was the case there was some excitement, and few parents, we opine, would have taken to the woods for the purpose of howling, as these appear to be doing. For the rest, Mr. BELLOWS seems to have studied Mr. A.T. RICHARDS with emulation and success. It were cruel to add another word. No. 183 is by EDWIN WHITE, N.A., a gentleman whose knowledge of color is too admirable to satisfy us with its loss in the trivial subjects which now occupy his brush.

The influence upon European politics of the events of the years 1860-1-2 was, as our readers know, very marked. The apparent ""breakdown"" of democracy in the United States, following as it did close upon the long series of disorders caused by the slavery agitation, satisfied all its enemies that its failure was settled and final, and led even its friends to doubt seriously whether their own expectations of it were not doomed to be seriously disappointed. The divisions at the North, the reverses in the field, furnished the reactionary journals in England, and all over the Continent, with abundant materials for ""exposures"" and denunciations of popular governments. In England the effects were soon visible in legislation. The movement for an extension of the franchise, which, down to 1860, seemed irresistible, and which every Ministry, whether Whig or Tory, had for fifteen years previously been forced into recognizing and adopting, was definitively abandoned. Even the Liberals confessed, with the most humiliating weakness, that the events in America had demonstrated its danger. Tory orators ranged over the country at will, preaching up the policy of exclusion; Tory books on government enjoyed a success which had been denied them for forty years, and even the Morning Herald began to find itself rising into the novel position of a great political authority.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Effect of Our Victory Abroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Effect of Our Victory Abroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c939407c-dcd7-5157-aeff-2c59499bb196,738,nyt://article/c939407c-dcd7-5157-aeff-2c59499bb196

Acquiescence in Surrender,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/30/archives/getting-light-on-the-subject.html,Acquiescence in Surrender,"-- A few days after the surrender of LEE, President LINCOLN intimated, by proclamation, that the rule of certain neutral Powers, by which United States vessels of war were put on a level with pirates, would be at once applied in reprisal by our government to the war vessels of these neutrals visiting United States ports. It takes usually some time to get an idea into an Englishman's head. But in this instance Lord RUSSELL seems to have got at the meaning of this proclamation with uncommonly quick perception. He can only have been studying it five or six weeks, when he issued the order, of which we have the intimation to-day by the European steamer. That order rescinds the offensive regulations to which our vessels were subjected in foreign ports. And it prepares the way for Lord RUSSELL to withdraw the patronage and protection of his government from the only remaining pirate afloat",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GETTING LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GETTING LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/031875ac-78e5-5390-b3ec-3fb43810cfd9,154,nyt://article/031875ac-78e5-5390-b3ec-3fb43810cfd9

Those ignorant European writers who assert that man in America has physically degenerated would have found their theories completely overthrown by this spectacle. Observers on the spot generally estimated that the Western army averaged somewhat more in height -- say about an inch -- than the Army of the Potomac; but the men of either army were much taller than the French or any other European troops.
