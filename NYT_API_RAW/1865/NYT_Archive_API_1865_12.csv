and his Book,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/01/archives/mr-buchanan-and-his-book.html,and his Book,"Mr. BUCHANAN appears in print as an autobiographer, or self-apologist for his own imbecile and disastrous administration. We are surprised at this. Good taste and the common sentiment of the world, at home and abroad, would have dictated profound silence. It would have been the best service he could possibly have rendered his own blighted fame. ""The world forgetting, by the world forgot,"" he might have passed the remnant of his days in such poor peace as a conscience not void of offence to the constitution and blood-stained flag of his country would allow. But this, it seems, was not to be. It was doubtless his purpose at one time -- and this may even have been indulged through all the years of civil strife and undetermined carnage which the violation of his oath of office had entailed upon the country -- to rest content with the self-satisfied thought and honor of having been the last President of the United States but this was changed by the final result of the war. And he finds himself, instead of the last of the line of Presidents, the only one, from WASHINGTON to JOHNSON, who has ever deliberately betrayed the constitution of his country into the hands of its enemies, over his broken oaths of office. Many of his predecessors, all of them indeed, except Mr. MONROE, had passed through scenes of bitter party strife; several of them through the heavy responsibilities of foreign war, and others through threatened civil commotion and State and local defiances of the Federal authority. But in all their trials of duty, above party and personal considerations, and through all consequences, foreign and domestic, they never forgot their oath of office!",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. Buchanan and His Book.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mr. Buchanan and His Book.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c279b63-376c-5acb-ac1e-d3f338bfd1fd,972,nyt://article/1c279b63-376c-5acb-ac1e-d3f338bfd1fd

Leslie's Illustrated Paper on the Public Debt and Credit,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/01/archives/government-securities-the-public-credit.html,Leslie's Illustrated Paper on the Public Debt and Credit,"Whoever assails the public credit is an enemy to his country. It is indifferent in what mode it is assailed, the criminality and the odium of the act are the same. The doctrine of repudiation, of which the arch-rebel, now corroding in Fortress Monroe, was the apostle and high priest; and which Mississippi has the undying disgrace of putting in practice, did more to damage the interests and retard the development and prosperity of the country than all other causes combined. It kept capital away, embarrassed enterprise with doubts and fears, and sowed distrust among men in all matters connected with finance. Many years were requisite to counteract its baleful influences, and start the country anew on its career of prosperity. In time, the very word ""repudiation"" became odious, and recalled to mind only a hideous moral disease, which once threatened the constitution and life of the public body. Few, probably, would desire to restore the financial and commercial distractions which prevailed when States openly violated their solemn contracts, laughed at their obligations, and appeared insensible of the disgrace of disregarding their plighted honor. Few, probably, would care to see the country in that humiliating position before the world which she occupied when the doctrines of JEFF. DAVIS were accepted by States, and acted on by individuals, and when foreign capitalists kept close watch on their purses when an American came near, as if he were a thief or a pickpocket. Fewer still would wish to encounter the hurricane of sneers, and jibes, and contemptuous, and indignant utterances which we all had to endure, in the silence of conscious guilt, when repudiation was rampant, and before rebellion began.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Government Securities The Public Credit.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Government Securities The Public Credit.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': ""From Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper"", 'person': [{'firstname': 'From', 'middlename': ""Leslie's"", 'lastname': 'Illustrated', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ae01f4e-9fa0-5f72-8d64-9ccef94411ab,1395,nyt://article/5ae01f4e-9fa0-5f72-8d64-9ccef94411ab

Had the seats and Representatives from the Southern States held firmly to their public duties, carrying out the oath, every man of them, on being admitted to his seat, had sworn to support the Constitution of the United States, the war, in all human probability, never would have occurred. It was because these men failed to assert their manhood in the critical day, and yielded themselves to the mad stampede at home, that all efforts to establish a reconciliation failed. A more wicked and shameless betrayal of public trust was never witnessed than that eruption of Southern leaders and Representatives from the gates of the National Capitol. It opened the way for all that terrible torrent of blood that flowed afterward. We wonder how it is that the remembrance of that fatal defection does not impose a little more modesty upon these new Southern claimants to the old seats.

The work, of all others the most important, was produced last evening at the Academy of Music, before an audience of overwhelming proportions, which manifested its pleasure by frequent bursts of applause, and during the entr'acts expressed its appreciation in unmistakeable terms. The first nights of METERBEER's operas have rarely been demonstrative. The music has never been of the sort that could be swallowed at a gulp. It requires many auditions before its beauties are perceived or become impressed on the memory. Most of our readers will recall the placid composure with which ""Robert le Diable"" and ""Les Huguenots"" were received when first brought out here. It was only after frequent performances that these grand works became popular. The ""African"" has fallen on better times. Its acceptance was immediate and positive. But for the speedy termination of Mr. MARETZEK's season, it would undoubtedly enjoy a long and profitable run. As it is, we must be content with it to-night, and three times next week only.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MUSICAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MUSICAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Opera', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1bad3777-09b9-59e3-941a-8da499696def,1838,nyt://article/1bad3777-09b9-59e3-941a-8da499696def

President Johnson on Restoration of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/02/archives/the-unsatiafactory-character-of-the-southern-elections.html,President Johnson on Restoration of,"President JOHNSON's dispatch to Gov. HOLDEN, declaring that the results of the recent elections in North Carolina, will seriously hinder the restoration of that State to its governmental relations, is deeply significant. Hitherto the Southern people seem to have assumed that, to get back to their old position, it was enough for their delegates, in convention assembled, to comply with what they were pleased to consider the requirements of the President -- to wit: A prohibition of Slavery by constitutional law; an abrogation of the secession ordinances, and a repudiation of all State debts contracted to maintain the war against the government. These points were urged by the President upon the various conventions, not as demands, but as friendly counsels. After a good deal of urging, they have been generally complied with, though not always in the most acceptable way. Several of the conventions -- those of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida -- contented themselves with merely repealing or abrogating their secession ordinances, instead of pronouncing them, as they should have done, absolutely null and void ab initio. Yet so long as secession was repudiated as a fact, there was no disposition on the part of the President to make difficulty about the particular form in which it was done. The action of all the conventions on the whole was tolerably satisfactory. The few Legislatures which have since met have not answered expectations. But one of them, that of South Carolina, has yet ratified the amendment of the National Constitution forever interdicting slavery. There seems to be a general reluctance on this point which indicates a lurking hope that the time may come when slavery can be reestablished, and an unwillingness to bar out the possibility of it. Yet it may be that the other Legislatures now in session may imitate the example of South Carolina after a little urging from Washington.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Unsatiafactory Character of the Southern Elections.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Unsatiafactory Character of the Southern Elections.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'North Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/280123bc-f707-557b-8e14-1573fdb8aa49,1067,nyt://article/280123bc-f707-557b-8e14-1573fdb8aa49

The fire, which had undoubtedly been smouldering in cotton-bales many hours, and perhaps two or three days, was first discovered at about 1 o'clock, and then it was observed that the iron window-shutters on the building were red hot. Of course, the Fire Department, which was on the spot with the Metropolitan's usual promptness, could do nothing toward staying the flames: nevertheless they made an effort, and were hard at work on the State-street front at 2 o'clock, when the beams supporting the floors gave way under the enormous load of cotton that they bore, and the walls of the warehouse suddenly fell, burying IRWIN and severely injuring several firemen and policemen. The firemen, who at the time supposed that several of their number had been buried under the ruins, went immediately to the work of removing the wreck, and shortly thereafter they dug IRWIN's body out and took it to the New-street Police-station. It had been terribly mutilated, having been severed, as it is presumed, and crushed by an iron window-shutter. IRWIN was a bar-tender at JOHNSTON's Hope House, in Chatham-street. Among the persons who were wounded were Sergeant Young and Patrolman Snider, Farley and Moran, of Capt. Warlow's Precinct, and Michael Whalen, of Metropolitan Engine No. 12 Michael O'Hearn, of Engine No. 9, and Edward Clark, of Engine No. 9. All but Sergeant Young were taken to the New-York Hospital; he went to the New-street Police-station, and was able to attend to his duties yesterday.

A. Kerosene Gaslight Co. Construction of Contracts,"Underhill vs. The North American Kerosene Gaslight Company. -- This case came up on appeal from a judgement entered in favor of the plaintiff for seventeen thousand four hundred and seventy-nine dollars, in October, 1863. It had been tried twice before a referce and twice on appeal argued before the Gerneral Term. The facts of the case are, that, on the 4th of January, 1859, the company desired estimates on some pipes for the manufacture of kerosene oil. called ""meerschaums,"" which they proposed to build of iron or brick. For that purpose a specification and some drawings were prepared for the proposals of mechanics. In those specifications the company desired 27 ""meerschaums"" to be constructed thereunder, of brick, deliverable at different times, prior to the first day of July, 1859. After specifying that eight (the remainder of the twenty-seven,) were to be delivered on the first day of July, the specifications contained the following clause: ""any number at our option,"" and then continued, ""in addition to the above we wish estimates for the same number of iron 'meerschaums' to be delivered as above."" It then proceeded with a description of the iron ones so desired. The plaintiff, as one of the mechanics to whom these plans and specifications were delivered for proposal, concluded to make an estimate for 26 or 27 of the ""meerschaums."" On the 10th of January, 1859, be wrote a proposal to the company to the effect that he would contract to construct 26 or 27 of the brick ""meerschaums"" for $1,650 each, or 26 or 27 of the iron ones for $1,850. They were to be constructed in accordance with the first plan and specification, dated Jan. 4, 1859, and to be delivered at such date, and in such numbers as the company might specify within the next sixty-five days. On the same day the Secretary and acting business man of the company assents to the proposition of the plaintiff, and wrote to him to that effect. The plaintiff constructed seven ""meerschaums,"" each of twenty-five tons capacity, and made one of one hundred tons as an experiment. The company failed subsequently, did not pay their notes, and went into insolvency. The plaintiff was left with a large amount of manufactured iron on hand, and had gone to great expense to carry out the contract. The cost of each ""meerschaum"" was $1,020, which allowed to the plaintiff a profit of $630 on each machine, amounting in all on the twenty left unmanufactured, of $16,600.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Construction of Contracts Important Opinion by the General Term.; SUPREME COURT GENERAL TERM NOV. 30., 1865.

The remark of Mr. WILLIAM M. TWEED, in the Board of Supervisors, that under the law it was the duty of the Boards of Inspectors to erase from their lists the names of all persons who registered but did not vote at the November election, appears to have sent many of the Inspectors to sea. Our reporters called at several registry offices, at a late hour on Saturday, and learned that the Inspectors had resolved not to expunge the names of electors who omitted to vote in November, as in the Inspectors' opinion, it was not the intention of the men who framed the Registry Law to deprive any bona fide elector of his vote. In other districts the Inspectors held it to be their duty to expunge these names and restore them to the lists only upon the personal application of the electors. As the Inspectors of Registry are the sole judges in this matter, and as no officer or power can prescribe a uniform rule for them, it now seems probable that in some districts all persons who registered in November may be permitted to vote, while in other districts the ballots of those electors who registered but did not vote in November may be rejected on Tuesday next. As the matter stands, we are, therefore, unable to report the total number of names on the registry lists, or make even an approximate estimate of the probable vote; and the table which we publish below, showing the number of persons who registered in the several wards on Friday and Saturday thus becomes nearly worthless:",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REGISTRY.; The Boards in Session on Friday and Saturday--The Registry Lists Complete.

Dr. RIGGS, of Constantinople, in regard to harmonizing the Oriental versions; from Rev. Dr. HAPPER, Canton, on Chinese versions; and from the British and Foreign Bible Society, as to making duplicate plates of the Arabic Bible.

One of the wildest of these belligerent rumors got currency in Wall-street and elsewhere in the city on Saturday last. It purported to come from Washington, and claimed unusual authenticity. And yet, under its influence, Gold advanced only a fraction of one per cent., while Governments were steady. Had it been credited that there was a breach in our amicable relations with the Government of France, and that the two Powers were actually on the eve of armed collision, we should unquestionably have had violent perturbations in the market, and the general industry and interests would have been greatly damaged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Foreign Policy The Argument of War or Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Foreign Policy The Argument of War or Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b2b5fcb-afb8-5b7c-83df-21c32a274538,1062,nyt://article/5b2b5fcb-afb8-5b7c-83df-21c32a274538

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/04/archives/the-female-emigration-scheme.html,,"We made a visit Saturday to the steamer Continental, which has been secured by Mr. A.S. MERCER, for the purpose of taking out a party of ladies to Washington Territory, and were much gratified with the many improvements which are being made in the steamer for the health and comfort of her fair passengers. The Continental is a large screw-propeller of 1,623 tons burden, is 244 feet long and 38 feet beam. She was built in Philadelphia, in 1862, to run between New-York and Charleston, but was purchased by the government soon after, and up to the present time has been employed in the transportation of troops to and from New-Orleans. Those competent to judge pronounce her to be one of the finest as well as fastest vessels of her class that ever sailed from this port. Her last trip to New-Orleans was made in five days and a half. The alterations are of the most extensive character, the present accommodations being found entirely inadequate for the large number of passengers which she will take to the Territory. A fine hurricane deck has just been completed, covering about two-thirds of the ship. Underneath this deck is a saloon about 72 feet long and 12 feet wide. This will be used as a general sitting-room, and will be furnished in handsome style. On each side of this saloon is a fine set of state-rooms. On going below we find ourselves in a large and commodious cabin. The stairway leading to this room has been moved back 24 feet, making a handsome saloon of about 75 feet long and 16 feet wide. It will be filled up in good style and used as the dining-room. On each side are large and pleasant state-rooms, which will be used by those ladies who have families. Running back from the stairway to the fore part of the ship is the young ladies' cabin. This is the largest cabin in the ship, being about 165 feet long and from 16 to 18 feet wide. On each side are state-rooms which will be made as pleasant and cozy as the most fastidious young lady could desire. This cabin will be the exclusive sanctum of the ladies, and no gentlemen will, under any circumstances, obtain admittance. A number of sewing machines will be fastened to the floor, which the ladies can use when they feel inclined to work. The sanitary arrangements are very fine. A large bathing-room will be attached to each cabin for the use of the passengers. An Inspecting Committee will be appointed, who will make it their business to visit all the state-rooms every morning, and report their condition to the doctor. A room will be fitted up expressly for the doctor, where he can always be found by the sick, and it is expected that he will be overwhelmed with business the first few days old. One of the rooms in the upper saloon will be fitted up as a library, and will be furnished with interesting and instructive reading matter. We learn that many of our book publishers have donated some of their most valuable works to this library.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Female Emigration Scheme.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Female Emigration Scheme.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/60ef3482-902b-5b2d-b96f-dfdd5eec6730,778,nyt://article/60ef3482-902b-5b2d-b96f-dfdd5eec6730

ROBERTS, the Union candidate, but one is at all formidable. That one is JOHN T. HOFFMAN, the nominee of Tammany. His elements of strength are, first, a good personal character, and, second, the strategy and corrupt appliances of the ""Bing"" behind him. His only weakness, and it will be a fatal one, is that the present degenerate Tammany Hall is his patron. If there is a sink of corruption on the face of the earth, a hole where rottenness reeks and principle suffocates, it is the place whence this nomination of JOHN T. HOFFMAN issued. Tammany exists in and by impurity only. It is the lowest place in all our political territory, and everything that is vile in nature, or vile in affinity, by a natural law gravitates toward it. It is fed by public demoralization running through official channels. Cut those all off, purge every every place of public trust in the city, regulate our municipal offices so that there shall be no official corruption, no divergence from official rectitude, and Tammany would incontinently dry up. Administrative virtue and its own thrift are absolutely incompatible. It has lived on corruption until at last it has become a stench in every honest man's nostrils. Nobody understands this fact better than itself. That very cause has driven it to the nomination of an honest man. JOHN T. HOFFMAN was made its candidate on the absolute certainty that no man in close contact with it could succeed. He was taken in the folorn hope that his respectability would in some sort serve as a screen of its vileness. Whether the ""Ring"" that rules Tammany expect to use him for their purposes, if perchance elected, it is hardly worth while to inquire. They have, before now, used men who had just as good intentions. But whatever their plans about him, it is enough to know that they have nominated this man of good intentions because they had no alternative -- that without it, in the present public detestation of them, they would not have had the least shadow of a chance. The nomination was a necessity to Tammany. But so much the worse for the nomination. On his own merits JOHN T. HOFFMAN, we dare say, would run well, but he cannot carry the dead weight of Tammany as it now is. There is a leprous taint in it that would destroy any man, of whatever personal worth, cursed with its nomination.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mayoralty A Union Triumph Almost Sure.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mayoralty A Union Triumph Almost Sure.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6787315b-6954-5aa4-bf55-7c61fb6d4cb8,1380,nyt://article/6787315b-6954-5aa4-bf55-7c61fb6d4cb8

The appreciation of this numerous jury served as another verdict in favor of MEYERBEER's work. By prudently ignoring the demonstrations of the audience, and resisting many urgent demands for encores, the performance was brought to an end shortly after 11 o'clock. The entr' acts were unusually brief in view of the amount of work that had to be done on the stage. And the work, it must be added, is done thoroughly. It is no exaggeration to say that the ""African"" is the best produced opera ever given in New-York. The scenery is so good that Mr. CALYO, the artist, enjoys the pleasure of a nightly recall before the curtain. In other particulars, such as the costumes, appointments, etc., the liberality of Mr. MARETZEK is so conspicuous that he too is brought forward for a round of hearty applause. The artists are used to this kind of treatment and enjoy an excess of favor, being brought before the curtain after each act.

The fire, which had undoubtedly been smouldering in cotton-bales many hours, and perhaps two or three days, was first discovered at about 1 o'clock, and then it was observed that the iron window-shutters on the building were red hot. Of course, the Fire Department, which was on the spot with the Metropolitan's usual promptness, could do nothing toward staying the flames; nevertheless they made an effort, and were hard at work on the State-street front at 2 o'clock, when the beams supporting the floors gave way under the enormous load of cotton that they bore, and the walls of the warehouse suddenly fell, burying IRWIN and severely injuring several firemen and policemen. The firemen, who at the time supposed that several of their number had been buried under the ruins, went immediately to the work of removing the wreck, and shortly thereafter they dug IRWIN's body out and took it to the New-street Police-station. It had been terribly mutilated, having been severed, as it is presumed, and crushed by an iron window-shutter. IRWIN was a bar-tender at JOHNSTON's Hope House, in Chatham-street. Among the persons who were wounded were Sergeant Young and Patrolman Snider, Farley and Moran, of Capt. Warlow's Precinct, and Michael Whalen, of Metropolitan Engine No. 12 Michael O'Hearn, of Engine No. 9, and Edward Clark, of Engine No. 9.

"It may be remembered that a murder was committed at the Lion Brewery Park, on the 20th of September, at a pic-nic given by the Manhattanville Church of the Annunciation, and that the parties concerned in the murder were not discovered at the time of the disturbance. The matter has lain in abeyance until yesterday, when two of the bar-keepers engaged at the brewery at the time of the murder were arrested on a charge of having caused the death of DANIEL CLAFFY. The facts in the case are simply these: During the festivities attendant upon the pic-nic, a disturbance occurred in the bar-room, and during the melee one DANIEL CLAFFY was stabbed several times, in the face, head and breast, and died in a few hours from the effect of the wounds thus received. During the investigation by Coroner GOVER, no testimony was obtained implicating any person. On the complaint of one of the brothers of deceased, a waiter named AUGUST GUNTHER was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the matter, but was discharged. Yesterday, JAMES CLAFFY made a complaint against CHARLES BEATH, alias Reed, a bar-keeper at the brewery, and GUNTHER, (the man already mentioned,) and they were arrested by Officer MCARTHUR, of the Court Squad. An examination was held yesterday, before Justice DODGE. JOHN GALLAGHER, residing in Eighty-sixth-street, a former member of the Central Park Police, and at the time of the assault a private watchman at the Lion Park, stated that soon after the murder he was impressed with the idea that REED had committed the deed, and that GUNTHER was an accomplice. On the 25th of November, he went to REED's residence and charged him with the crime. After some hesitation, REED admitted the fact, and declared that GUNTHER had incited him to commit the act.

In Part II, of the Common Pleas, a jury could not be found to try a cause. In some of the other branches not enough jurors answered to their names to make up the usual panels. This is accounted for in part by the fact that to-day is the Mayoralty election, and hence none of the civil courts -- city or State -- will be in session. The Strong case was continued yesterday, and it will doubtless last through this week and next; the motion made by the defendant's counsel for a dismissal of the complaint having been denied by the court.

BALDWIN, a strong Unionist before the war, but nevertheless a member of the rebel Congress, was chosen Speaker. The Governor's Message was read.

He recommends a tax upon the oyster business, and the sale of the State interest in railways, which might reduce the debt by $15,000,000. He thinks but little legislation is required concerning freedmen, and advocates their admission to the courts on the same basis as white persons.

"THE FOG -- A COLLISION. -- The dense fog which prevailed yesterday rendered navigation somewhat perilous.

About 12 1/2 o'clock in the afternoon the ferry-boat George Law, in crossing from the Brooklyn to the New-York side, came in collision with the steamer Rattler, which was proceeding up the East River, with a timber-barge in tow. The shock occasioned by the collision was severe, and the damage to the ferry-boat somewhat serious, as her entire after-cabin was stove in, but without injury to the hull of the vessel. The George Law ran into the Catherine Perry slip, where her passengers and the vehicle on board were safely landed. No lives were lost, nor was any one injured, though the few passengers on board the ferry-boat were greatly alarmed. The Rattler was apparently uninjured. The steamer Lafayette, from Havre, which was reported by telegraph as having passed Sandy Hook at [???] A.M. yesterday, had not reached the city previous to 8 P.M. She has probably anchored at the Southwest Spit. The steamer Albemarle, from Norfolk, is ashore on the rocks at Fort Lafayette. The Captain expects to get off soon. About 6 P.M. yesterday, the Staten Island ferry-boat Northfield, while coming up the bay in the fog, came in collision with a brig at anchor, carrying away the brig's bowsprit and the flagstaff of the steamer, which, in falling, struck JOSEPH KING, one of the deck-hands of the steamer, injuring him severely.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/05/archives/general-city-news-the-fog-a-collision-the-dense-fog-which-prevailed.html,,"THE FOG -- A COLLISION. -- The dense fog which prevailed yesterday rendered navigation somewhat perilous.

Letter to State Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/05/archives/domestic-items.html,Letter to State Convention,"The Washington Chronicle gives the following account of the rebel ram Stonewall: ""This vessel was purchased by the Spanish authorities at Havana for $16,000, and turned over to the United States for $68,000. She is one of the most remarkable and formidable-looking vessels of the kind we have yet seen, and would have rendered valuable assistance to the rebel cause if she had arrived here while the war was in progress. Constructed at Brest, off the coast of France, all the modern improvements for which the French are so justly celebrated have been introduced. Her engines alone are said to have cost $75,000. She has two turrets, One in the centre and the other in the forepart of the vessel, the latter of which contains an Armstrong gun capable of firing a three hundred and fifty pounder, and the former two Armstrong guns of smaller capacity, and none the less accurate and destructive. Since the ship came into our possession a ball was fired three and a half miles from one of these small guns. The sides of this immense ship are coated with iron over three inches in thickness. The ram is thirty-eight feet wide by thirty feet in length, tapering to a point extending some ten feet below the surface of the water, and formed of solid steel. No more destructive weapon can be well imagined. A few evenings ago, when near the mouth of the Potomac, between the hours of 12 and 4, she ran into a schooner loaded with three hundred tons of coal, piercing her sides, and causing her almost instantly to sink beneath the waves; the crew, however, were saved. The jar experienced by those on board the Stonewall was scarcely perceptible.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DOMESTIC ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DOMESTIC ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e16c34e-6b76-5e2c-8953-bd6911b279b5,4710,nyt://article/9e16c34e-6b76-5e2c-8953-bd6911b279b5

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/06/archives/the-treasury-report.html,,"Mr. MCCULLOCH has given to the country an able paper on the national finances. He writes and reasons like a sound, thoroughbred merchant, and comprehends the great width and future bearing of his subject with statesmanlike sagacity. It seems to be his cardinal rule of office, and he has been singularly fortunate in preserving its consistency against conflicting counsels from within and without, to do nothing rash or improvident, and to attempt nothing impracticable. He made few professions of economy, and gave utterance to no boast of ability to control or consolidate, or reduce at any very early day, the magnitude of our public debt, on coming into administration lost March. The war had not then ended, though looking to the end. And when the rebellion collapsed in April, his embarrassments were rather increased than diminished. He suddenly found himself called on to raise in a few months six hundred millions of dollars beyond the regularly authorized loans for the fiscal year then drawing to a close; in other words, to exhaust the entire authority for the new fiscal year before it had fairly set in. He gave himself quietly, but earnestly, to the work; and while the country was expecting a maximum debt of at least three thousand millions, he announces, without ostentation, first, a maximum in August of only $2,750,000,000, and soon after its gradual reduction month by month to $2,712,000,000. To be sure, he was favored, after his earlier trials on the disbanding and prompt payment of our immense volunteer armies, with large taxes, as well as large customs. But he gave his earnest attention to the collection of the former, and to the best and most profitable application of the latter. He now submits, with his usual candor, that he may yet want $112,000,000,000 in excess of his probable receipts to the close of the present fiscal year; but taking the experience of the past few months as an index, it is quite clear that he will suffer no such sum to be added to the present total of the debt. And it is almost equally certain that his surplus of $111,000,000,000 for the succeeding fiscal year, will fall within the results of customs and taxation for that year, now that we have every reasonable assurance that our foreign trade and political relations cannot be seriously compromised by either of the pending questions that were by some of our merchants and financial people supposed, before the Message of the President was delivered yesterday, to threaten the suspension of diplomatic intercourse, if not war itself.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Treasury Report.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Treasury Report.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d22379a-27e8-563c-9f65-049437ab5945,858,nyt://article/1d22379a-27e8-563c-9f65-049437ab5945

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/06/archives/our-naval-service.html,,"Although there is not a little of general interest in that portion of Secretary WELLES' report which details the closing operations of our naval vessels against the insurgents, that part of the Secretary's statement which relates to the reduction of the naval force to a peace footing, and the designation of the different squadrons for foreign service, will engage most public attention. Especial notice is drawn in the report to the reinforcement of the Pacific Squadron early in November by the Vanderbilt, the Tuscarora, the Powhatan, and the iron-clad Monadnock. The events now transpiring in Chilian ports make this expedition of more than common account. In active duty on the Pacific coast there will be eleven vessels of all classes. But several more will be laid up in the harbor of San Francisco, to abide any emergency that may arise. The European squadron has an appearance of weakness -- looking to the number of vessels which it embraces, and to the extent of its field of operations. There will be but seven vessels -- the Colorado, Kearsarge, Ticonderoga, Frolic, Ino, Guard, and (shortly) Canandalgua. This fleet will be expected to do duty along the coast of Europe, including both sides of the Mediterranean, Madeira, the Canaries, and along the African coast as far as St. Paul de Loando. The Shenandoah, it will be seen, is to be sent back Eastward again, being designated for service with the East India Squadron. The department dwells with justifiable pride on the number of vessels captured and sent to the courts for adjudication during the war. These captures -- including every variety of craft -- numbered in all 1,151. Of this number, 210 were steamers and 6 were rebel rams and iron-clads. Besides the captures, the number of so-called ""neutral"" or of hostile vessels destroyed by our fleet during the war was 355. The Secretary compares this with the captures in the war of 1812, which numbered but 291 -- with 301 vessels in our naval service at the close of the war. The resources of the department available for the year ending June 30, 1866, amount to $142,291,919, which will enable it to reduce the estimates for the next fiscal year to $23,982,457.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Naval Service.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Naval Service.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ecb40e2-9d42-5fe9-bbca-18adff73c78d,370,nyt://article/3ecb40e2-9d42-5fe9-bbca-18adff73c78d

The extraordinary efforts put forth by the Union and Democratic parties, combined with the operations of cliques and individuals induced results as significant as they are notable. It was expected by all parties that a heavy vote would be thrown in consequence as well of the personal reputations of the candidates, as of the exertions made in their behalf by the organizations that offered their names to the public. The Union party nominated MARSHALL O. ROBERTS a well-known, public-spirited merchant: the Democrats nominated JOHN T. HOFFMAN, a judicial officer of ability and integrity; the Citizens' Association nominated JOHN HECKER, who is principally known as the proprietor of extensive flouring mills in the Seventh Ward; and the present incumbent, C.

"Postmaster-General, Report",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/06/archives/the-postal-service.html,"Postmaster-General, Report","Not the least satisfactory feature in the Postmaster-General's report, is the announcement it contains that there is a surplus of revenue for the year of $861,430 -- the ratio of increase in revenue being 17 per cent., while that of expenditure was but 8 per cent. This healthy financial exhibit can hardly be maintained after the postal service is thoroughly reestablished in the Southern States, where the offices have never been self-sustaining. There were formerly 8,902 offices in the seceded States, and of these only 1,051 had been reopened on the 15th ultimo. In view of the reestablishment of this service, the estimates for the next fiscal year are put as high as $18,678,000, while the revenues of the department are estimated at $17,470,543, leaving a deficiency of $1,207,457. Foreign mail steamship lines running to and from British ports were paid during the year $405,479; and Mr. DENNISON naturally draws attention to the disagreeable fact, that no portion of the postal disbursements of the year have inured to the benefit of American steamship lines on this ocean route. The Postmaster-General does not, however, seem disposed to favor the application of subsidies to vessels on old-established routes. But he thinks the amount accruing from postages would be a liberal compensation to an American line to Europe. The money-order system has made no inconsiderable progress, 419 offices having been opened during the year; and moneys transmitted to the gross amount of $1,360,122, the loss to the department on this large amount of business being only a little over $7,000. We doubt whether the public generally will agree with Mr. DENNISON that the maximum of a single remittance might be increased with safety from $30 to $50. The Postmaster-General, it will be seen, gives a qualified support to the appeal of our merchants for a new Post-office.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Postal Service.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Postal Service.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f75210ad-8cd4-5750-9b03-c1446de2dd91,304,nyt://article/f75210ad-8cd4-5750-9b03-c1446de2dd91

There are some very important principles of law involved in the case. The difficulty arises out of the destruction by fire of JACKSON & WOODRUFF's bonded warehouses, at the foot of Joralemon-street, Brooklyn, on the 15th of July, 1864, where there was stored a large quantity of nitrate of soda. The value of this article owned by plaintiffs, and on store there at the time, was near $50,000. They were insured in several companies, and among others the plaintiffs had, as they claim, an insurance with the National Fire Insurance Company, the defendants, of $5,000 on this article of merchandise. The company have, in their answer, set up several distinct defences, prominent among which are that the policy did not cover the property destroyed, and that the plaintiffs are not, and were not, at the time of the commencement of the action, the real parties in interest. Distinguished counsel are engaged on either side.

Postal money-order system,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/07/archives/the-postal-moneyorder-system.html,Postal money-order system,"The Postmaster-General may fairly be congratulated on the progress and success of the money-order branch of his department. It has grown as fast as was safe or expedient. It has safely transmitted a vast amount of money -- nearly a million and a half dollars in small sums; and, including all the incidental expenses of creating a new branch, it has cost the country, over and above the receipts from fees, but the mere bagatelle of seven thousand dollars. This a safe and sure business. There are (or will be when restoration is completed) nearly thirty thousand post-offices within the States and Territories of the Union. Of this number, less than two per cent. are thus far intrusted with the issue of money-orders. Every thoughtful business man will desire that the progress of the system should be no more rapid in the future than it has been in the past. And every one familiar with the working of the system in other countries will be apt, we fear, to dispute the wisdom and expediency of the Postmaster-General's recommendation to increase the maximum of a single remittance from $30 to $50. It is of the utmost importance not to lose sight of the fact that the money-order system is not established for the purpose of facilitating and cheapening exchange in petty commercial transactions, but for the purpose of making the transmission of petty sums easy, safe and moderately cheap for those who are not in a position to keep bank accounts. The proposed fifty-dollar limit, we think, goes clearly beyond what may be called an accommodation for the non-commercial class. And without doubting for a moment the vigilance of the officers of the department, we think the Postmaster-General's proposal opens up new avenues for commercial ""accommodation"" -- or in other words for borrowing at short dates -- which would be found extremely hazardous after the system shall have grown to, what we may call, its legitimate proportions. The maximum, indeed, is now higher than we think it ought to be. It is higher than in any other country, where the system has been for years in operation. And it is to be hoped the Postmaster-General will carefully reconsider his recommendation, before the country is committed to the dangerous policy of making the Post-office a convenience for petty traders, instead of a wholesome aid to the vast class of the community that have no other available means of making remittances.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Postal Money-Order System.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Postal Money-Order System.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58c74fb2-7bad-5bdd-a91b-dd8546d998f6,408,nyt://article/58c74fb2-7bad-5bdd-a91b-dd8546d998f6

Thanksgiving,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/07/archives/thanksgiving.html,Thanksgiving,"The last Message of the late President, and the first Message of his successor, may be studied with profit to-day by those who regard the observances of Thanksgiving with the sobriety which those observances invite. The day is one which calls the nation together for a solemn expression of gratitude to Heaven. Muscular oratory, loud and offensive glorification, and oblations to the god of war, are all so alien to the exercises which thoughful men have to-day marked out for the morning service of the sanctuary, that we may hope for the suppression, in the houses of public worship at least, of everything that would jar against the spirit of sober thankfulness, of kindly forgiveness, of brotherly yearning toward those recently estranged from the National household, which is the prevailing feeling of every sincere patriot. We cannot, peradventure, expect that in every particular, or to the same degree, the sentiment of gratitude and thankfulness will to-day pervade all parts of the country where the President's Proclamation is read. But we can venture to hope that there is not a corner of the Union wherein the vast majority of our fellow-citizens, whether of the governed or the governing race, are not happier to-day than they were a year ago. Even within the brief space intervening since the Thanksgiving Proclamation was issued, the grandest national enactment of the country -- the Constitutional Decree forever abolishing slavery has become part of the fundamental law of the United States. If there were no other cause for profound and solemn ascriptions to the Supreme Ruler of nations -- this alone should stir all hearts in their devotions. It is not alone the final breaking of the chains for the oppressed; it is the end of all sectional strife. It is the consummation of the UNION, for all time. No such day of Thanksgiving has the nation been called to celebrate before. Many such it will celebrate hereafter, when the strife which has ceased shall also have been forgotten.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Thanksgiving.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Thanksgiving.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Thanksgiving', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7a3d24bf-f70a-55cd-aca1-fa5b0a699f1a,333,nyt://article/7a3d24bf-f70a-55cd-aca1-fa5b0a699f1a

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/08/archives/the-abolition-of-slavery-the-chief-cause-for-thanksgiving.html,,"The circumstances connected with our present Annual Thanksgiving are Greatly altered from those of the past four years. Then the dark cloud of civil war overhung our country. Jehovah was marching through the land in His anger, the pealm of thanksgiving mingle with the ""braying discord"" of arms and the ""confused noise"" of battle. The storm has passed, the last muttering thunders have died away, the bow appears in the clouds, the sunlight of peace is bright over all the recently-darkened land, the sword is being beaten into the plowshare and the spear into the pruning-hook, we hear no more ""the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war."" As Reformed Presley events, the sworn friends of civil and religious liberty, and the uncompromising foes of slavery in all its forms, we found cause of thanksgiving even in the terrible visitation of war. Not on its own account, not because we delighted in blood; God is our witness that we did not ""desire the woful day."" In common with others we felt its burdens; we, too, mourned our dead; the sorrows of the nation were our sorrows, but because of the results that we foresaw must flow from this calamity in itself so dark and terrible. We have reason to rejoice that our judgment has been justified by the events, that out of the mouth of this eater has come forth meat, and from this strong one honey. ""War is,"" in the language of ROBERT HALL, ""the garment of vengeance in which the Deity arrays himself when he comes forth to punish the inhabitants of the earth."" ""It is the day of the Lord cruel both with wrath and fierce anger."" All this has been realized in our great struggle, it has cost us many millions of money, hundreds of thousands of noble and precious lives, and left behind it that train of evils which are its inevitable accompaniments. We cannot be sufficiently thankful that the ordeal is passed, the temple of Janus closed, and that we can now apply ourselves to the cultivation of the arts of peace and to healing the wound which war has made. The great blessing that has flowed to us from the late conflict is the destruction of slavery; it was only desirable that the Union should be preserved and the government saved, that it might be the defender of liberty. The war has been worth all that it cost the nation; the sacrifice has been great, but the benefit greater. How great a cause of thankfulness we have in the destruction of this wickedness, those only can realize who have formed a true conception of the system, and of its far-reaching and destructive influence. The war has taught the nation a lesson which it was slow to learn, but taught it effectually. The system is among the things of the past; and, although its effects may remain for many years ""as the waves will continue to dash upon the shore long after the storm is down,"" the institution has died or the deadly wound that our martyr President gave it in the Emancipation Proclamation and will be, as we trust, by the present Congress, buried out of sight and have its grave sealed forever. We who have borne reproach from our youth for opposition to this iniquity cannot repress our joy at its fall. We take up the language of exultation: ""Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her. Let the old devotees of this Moloch cast dust upon their heads and cry Alas! alas!

Then, as the streets grew slippery, there was dainty footing for the crowds who passed along, responsive to the sacred summons of church bells. Unlike the Thanksgiving days of the past four years -- those in which our national joys were tempered by national sorrows -- yesterday was one which lent rejoicing to almost every home, even where the gloom of mourning had scarce passed away, and the seat stood vacant at the board.

Mr. Gardner, a gentleman well known and highly esteemed, of Fulton, Fulton County, N.Y., has been wasting literally away for the last few year, from Catarrhal Consumption, which produced complete deafness. He himself, as well as his wife, stated that for the last ten years, he had not been able to keep a morsel of food on his stomach, nor to enjoy a single complete night's rest. Perspiration continually stood on his body, as if he were in a vapor bath, being feverish, alternating with a slight chill, characterized by pain in the right side, extending to the point of the shoulder; also a sharp pain of the collar -- bone, pain on the right side, particularly causing an uneasy sensation when lying on it, as well as a difficulty in respirating, felt great thirst, his tongue was dry and covered with a white fur; great giddiness and swimming in his head -- in fact he complained of general weakness and disliked movement or exercise, great headache, flatulence, belching, with acid taste in the mouth and throat; he complained of a constant oppression of fullness, and at last his mind showed symptoms of being affected. He also labored under almost complete deafness, and existence became to him a torture. He felt himself wasting away with weakness. As a matter of course, he consulted many physicians of repute, both general practitioners and those practicing specialties, and still he continued to sink; and, as his wife says, after reading the case of consumption in our columns, she and their friends concluded that they could do no better than to apply to the same eminent physician, Dr. Von Eisenberg, one of our practitioners, whose heart is devoted to the cause of suffering humanity. As all hopes of Mr. Gardner's recovery had been given up, there being but little risk, and as a last resource, the husband, wife and friends came to New-York, and called at the Doctor's office, No. 816 Broadway. So much was his nervous system affected, that when he was placed in the examination chair, his countenance seemed to change. A convulsive spasm passed over it, and in a minute or so he seemed to recover, and exclaimed, ""Oh, Doctor, you hurt me very much!"" although all this time the Doctor had not approached him. After a careful diagnosis with Dr. Von Eisenberg's usual skill and experience, and after an attentive and patient examination of the history and existing symptoms, the Doctor gave it as his opinion that Mr. Gardner had been suffering from laryngeal phthisis, complicated with dry catarrh; that his deafness arose from the disordered condition of the throat, and in the sympathetic condition between the nerves of the throat and those of the auditory organ. By a minute auscultatory examination of the lungs and larynae, he said that pulmonary phthisis may be present, with the usual exciting causes of inflammation and its consequences. Extending to the digestive organ by sympathy and continuity from the pulmonary and digestive mucous surface furnishes many indications, giving rise to heart-burn and acrid eructations, which produce profuse sweating, cough, purulent expectorations. This complication commenced with a dyspeptic character, assuming a severe form, and has been attended by nausea, pain, tenderness, a sense of heat, or burning pain. In fact the Doctor said that in such complicated cases, the commonest catarrh generally appeare under a more febrile form, and when it unfortunately affects one of a consumptive tendency, it is the exciting cause of a galloping decay.

It urges their attention especially to agricultural pursuits, which we think is good advice under the circumstances. It tells us that there are young men now at work on Virginia farms who never before performed a day's labor, and that many of the young Virginians who for four years handled the sword are now handling the plow. If all of this class in Virginia, uniting with the older white males, and with such freedmen or foreign laborers as can be employed, go to work and exert themselves as industriously with the plow and hoe as they did with the sword and musket, they can make as much out of a small surface well cultivated as was heretofore made out of a large surface carelessly tilled; for, under their skillful and energetic labor, the lands will, in proportion, yield for more than they yielded under the slovenly cultivation of slaves.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Renovation of Old Virginia Working for a Living.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Renovation of Old Virginia Working for a Living.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49f0b3fa-1918-5a26-8ab6-68597dbbc2d3,292,nyt://article/49f0b3fa-1918-5a26-8ab6-68597dbbc2d3

His call has been backed by all the Governors. The Governor of the State of New-York and the Mayor of our great city not only point out to us that signal blessing Peace, but also require us to join in heartfelt thanks to the Lord for the mercies he has shown us in granting us health, abundance and all other blessings. Thus, all who are in authority call upon us, each comes before us, each proclaims his feelings on the occasion, and each requires us to bow in thankful submission to the great and beneficent disposer of events. We, my friends, like all our fellow-citizens, readily, cheerfully, and with a willing heart, obey the call. Let us remember that while the summons of those whom we appoint to govern our city and State is of itself sufficient to raise our hearts to our God it receives a a further and irresistible impulse from the pious exhortation of the President, the first of the kind which ever was issued. ""Yes, we thank God for all his mercies; we thank him for health; we thank him for abundance; we thank him for the plenteous return with which he has rewarded our honest exertions; and lastly and principally, we thank him for that peace which once more and forever places our dear country foremost in his merciful regard.

"This is the language of joy and gratitude in view of the great and marvelous deliverance which God had wrought on behalf of his chosen people, the Jews.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/08/archives/the-great-things-god-has-done-for-this-nation.html,,"This is the language of joy and gratitude in view of the great and marvelous deliverance which God had wrought on behalf of his chosen people, the Jews. They had been captives in a strange land, subject to insult and oppression, unable to sing their own pious and patriotic songs. When, therefore, the proclamation of freedom was made known to them, granting the privilege to return to their well-remembered altars, the news seemed too good to be true. It was like a vision, like a dream, when one awaketh; but when the reality became too manifest for doubt, they were overwhelmed with joy and said, ""The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."" Even the heathen were constrained to acknowledge the Divine hand in their deliverance and to say, ""The Lord hath done great things for them."" This was one of the great epochs in their history -- an occasion for universal thanksgiving and praise. Such signal deliverances are memorable in the annals of nations. When the Romans had vanquished Philip, King of Macedon, by proclamation, they restored liberty to all the Grecian cities, and the effect among the people was so electric that they could not refrain from the wildest demonstrations of joy. Need I say that a similar proclamation has been issued and similar sensations of joy have been felt by millions in our own land. The past will be regarded by all nations, and through all the ages, as the great sabbatic year -- the year of jubilee to this nation. It is the year of our nation's birth into a new and grander life. And if we ever had occasion to come up to our altars with votive offerings, with one great national doxology, it is on this day of our national thanksgiving. We are here at the call of our Chief Magistrate; we are here at the call of Providence, and by the ready acquiescence of our own hearts. We all feel, under the circumstances, that the call should be national, and the response and observance universal. Never in its entire history had the nation greater cause for gratitude than now, for the deliverance and wonders wrought. We may well adopt the language of the text, and say, ""The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."" The theme suggested by the text, as well as by the circumstances, is: The great things which God hath done for this nation. The theme is copious, and suggests volumes of thought. The three generic ideas which we propose to unfold and illustrate, are Creation, Providence and Redemption, as applied to our national life and history. These are the three grand methods God has chosen by which to manifest Himself; and if seen at all, He must be seen in his works of creation, providence and redemption. This is the wide, theological view; we propose one more limited -- to trace God in the origin, history, and especially in the recent redemption of our nation from the powers combined for its destruction. ""The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."" What, then, hath he done? We answer, in the first place, He created this nation. It is the offspring of His power, the child of His providence. He brought it into being, not by a word of His power, as he did the orbs of heaven, but He prepared this land, wide in extent, magnificent in its scenery, varied and salubrious in its climate, rich in its soils, mighty in its forests, lakes and rivers, affluent and in-exhaustible in its mineral resources; and when the appointed time had come, He sought and sifted Europe for the people adapted, in strength and stamina, in religion and views of government, to accomplish the lofty mission He had appointed them to perfrom. Here the speaker showed the hand of God in their landing upon Plymouth Rock, in their early colonial history, in the difficulties and perils they had to encounter, in the increase of their numbers and strength, in the wisdom that presided over their councils, in their growing attachment to liberty and independence, in their separation from the mother country, in their revolutionary struggle, and finally in the triumph of their arms. Review (said the speaker) this brief historic sketch, and tell me if God did not literally carve out and create this nation. The Puritans recognized Him as they bowed in humble praise and prayer beneath the open canopy of heaven; the Colonists, in all their privations and trials, never forgot that He was their ""refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble;"" the fathers of the Revolution followed his pillar of cloud and fire through all the wilderness to the promised land; the immortal WASHINGTON acknowledged that he was but an instrument in His hands, raised up to accomplish His will in the establishment of the nation. It is because we have been enabled so clearly to trace our national paternity to God, that we, through all the gloom and peril of the past, have had faith that our national life and unity would be preserved. We felt that He would not suffer this government, the product of His power and providence, to perish ere it had reached its culmination and accomplished the sublime ends of its existence. ""The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."" In the second place I remark, His providence has been peculiarly marked in the entire history of this nation. In this connection the reverend doctor briefly and scripturally established the fact of a special providence over individuals and nations, and then historically applied the doctrine to this nation, in the development of its resources, agricultural, mineral and commercial; in the establishment of schools, colleges and churches; in the revivals of religion which had blessed the land; in our growing strength and influence among the nations, in our numerous inventions facilitating the industries of life, augmenting the products of labor, strengthening and cementing our national bonds, thus making us, in many respects, the model nation of the world. ""Surely,"" said the speaker, ""the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."" In the third place I remark, He hath redeemed this nation. For more than three quarters of a century we have enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity -- a growth and prosperity unequaled by any other nation on the globe. ""The little one had become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation."" The twig, the exotic transplanted in this virgin and prolific soil, had taken deep root, lifted high its trunk, and the people of different climes have come to take shelter beneath its wide-spreading branches. It was the tree of constitutional liberty, bearing all manner of precious fruit, and whose leaves were for the healing of the nations. So great, indeed, had been our prosperity that distant nations heard with wonder the story of our political success, and saw, with envious regret, the republican experiment on this Western continent hastening to a most satisfactory realization. Then there had been some jarring, some sectional jealousies, some friction in the political machinery. Slavery, which was regarded as an evil at the first, and which the framers of the constitution had hoped would be temporary and local, had increased in extent, in profit, in power, and become at length a mighty element of discord, both in the Church and in the State. The people of the North, for the most part, held to the opinion of the fathers, that it was an excrescence upon the body politic, a social and moral evil, and sought its gradual, safe, and yet certain removal. On the other hand, the people of the South manifested a growing determination to reverse the sentiment, alike of the founders of the republic and of Christian ethics, and make slavery national instead of sectional; natural, instead of the creature of municipal and local law; the rule instead of the exception; normal, instead of the abnormal condition of society. An irrepressible conflict between the spirit and institutions of liberty on the one hand, and the spirit and institutions of slavery on the other, waged with increased violence and intensity, until, apparently baffled in the effort to nationalize the institution, the South determined to secede from the trammels of the Union and establish a government whose corner-stone should be slavery. Such was the animus and sole cause of the war. The North, though decided in their convictions of the wrongfulness of the system, were disposed to be fraternal, yielding at every point for the sake of peace. The South demanded stronger guarantees that slavery should not be disturbed in its then existing localities. Government granted them. She wanted the Fugitive Slave Law. It was granted. She desired the removal of the Missouri Compromise. It was done. From the year 1819 down to 1860, she had bean continually asking, and government had been as continually giving. She finally asked that all restrictions to the extension of slavery might be removed -- that it might be legalized everywhere; and the North, by her vote and voice, said: ""No; government must not become the great patron of a system whose moral enormities had shocked the sensibilities of the whole civilized world."" This was the sole offence -- the sole cause of war. Was there any other cause? Had not government been jealous of their rights? Had it not protected their persons and property? Had they not shared largely its honors and emoluments? Had they not lived, prospered, and grown rich under its patronage and protection? Had they any just ground of complaint, themselves being the judges? ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, in his speech at Atlanta before the war, publicly declared they had none. And yet the people of the South rebelled, took up arms to destroy a government which they had known only in its clemency, in its largest benefactions. And what, under the circumstances, with several of the States in armed rebellion, did the government do? Our noble President plead with them like a father to lay down their arms, become loyal, and they should all be pardoned, giving assurance at the same time that their slave property should be untouched, and oven protected. But when they would not listen to his paternal counsel, when he was constrained to meet force with force, and thus decide the great issue by the stern arbitrament of the sword, what then is the ultimatum of his design? Simply to subdue the rebellion and thus maintain the integrity of the Union. Nothing further. His own expressed purpose was to this effect, and leave their cherished institution as it was, unter the guarantees of the constitution. Had his purpose prevailed, had the first great campaign, under Gen. MCCLELLAN, been successful, had Richmond fallen in the early stages of the conflict, the insulted honor of the flag would have been vindicated, the government sustained and the Union preserved, but the old sore would have been unhealed, the elements of discord remained, and the causes of national decay left to work with increased potency. And it is just here that a third party appears in the great strife. God had determined to redeem this land from the terrible scourge which had threatened our national life, to do by means of bloody war what the South had determined never to do -- what the North had no constitutional right to do. He therefore presided over the two hostile armies, ordering our most humiliating defeat at Bull Run, suffering the enemy, in, the flush of victory, to be boastful and defiant, permitting our Generals and army to be inert and powerless, suffering the enemy through two years' discipline and mustering of forces, to gain such a vantage ground, that the President's proclamation became a stern, military necessity -- a right and a privilege which he, as the Commander-in-chief of our armies and the conservation of the nation's weal, was bound to exercise. He did his duty, exercised the right, and made his name illustrious and immortal! He was simply the instrument in the hand of the Divine Providence in executing his purpose to redeem our country from the curse and thraldom of oppression. Slavery is dead, and the old putrifying carcase is now undergoing the process of decent burial. It can never live again. The government will never recede and undo what it has done. Its tendencies are all in the opposite direction. It has made a treaty with England contemplating more vigorous action for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade. It has recognized the national character of Liberia and Hayti, and entered into diplomatic relations with those governments. The people, too, by their more recent ballots, show that they are in hearty sympathy with all that the government has done in the right direction. Even Jersey, that fallen star, has assumed her rightful place in the national constellation, and joined the music of the spheres in favor of freedom and of man. The States, one after another, have adopted the Constitutional Amendment, and slavery, by law, as well as by the will of the people, must soon be numbered among the things that were. Some of the old slave marts may stand in the midst of Southern cities, monuments of a past barbarism, to whose tales of trafic in human bones and muscles the children of another generation will listen with mingled emotions of horror and shame. The chains and fetters, instruments of past cruelty, shall be cast into the furnace and moulded into plow and pruning-hook, wherewith the ransomed man shall till the soil enriched by his own blood; gather the golden harvests, and train the clustering vines over his own cabin, his home, his castle; on whose threshold he shall have a man's right to stand and keep the destroyer from his door. The Lord hath done great things for us in thus redeeming our land from this terrible curse. But upon us rests the duty of caring for his emancipated poor, especially in their transition from slavery to freedom. We must, in a measure, feed and clothe them, and with all diligence guard them against the cupidity of prejudice, which would yet reduce them to a state of serfdom more appalling even than slavery itself. We must establish among them schools and churches, and fit them by appropriate culture for the duties and responsibilities of American citizens. We do not say that they should have free and immediate access to the ballot box. We do not say this of any class of men. We do not recognise the right of universal suffrage. We conceive that a great mistake has been made, especially in our own State, in committing this sacred trust into the hands of ignorant and unscrupulous foreigners, who have no interest in the conduct of our national affairs, who are totally unacquainted with our national polity, and whose votes are at the disposal of the highest bidder. We regard the elective franchise as a trust to be committed to the worthy, irrespective of color. God, by the fiery ordeal through which we have passed, has been teaching us to respect humanity, to regard man as man, irrespective of the color of his skin. And if any should be permitted to show themselves men at the polls it is those who have proved themselves to be men on the battle-field, who, when their country was in peril offered themselves to fight, and, if need be, to die for its rescue. Who shall say that these shall be deprived of the privilege of a vote, when through corrupt and unprincipled demagogues their country shall again be in peril? Upon the sober, the industrious, the intelligent, or to be more specific, upon property holders and upon such as can read and write, I would confer the privilege of the elective franchise --",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Things God Has Done for This Nation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Things God Has Done for This Nation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab254433-940b-5ae3-b151-cbe9b8c7968d,3358,nyt://article/ab254433-940b-5ae3-b151-cbe9b8c7968d

Dr. Thanksgiving Sermon; Thanksgiving Sermon; Tyng, Rev. S. H., Jr.; Thanksgiving Sermon; Thanksgiving Sermon; Thanksgiving Sermon; Thanksgiving Sermon; Thanksgiving Sermon","Taking his text from the 9th chapter of Genesis, 11-16 verse inclusive, Mr. BEECHER said: When after the driving storm the sun returns, not only does it pour its clear stream of golden light over all the drenched and wind-rocked land, but it sets up the banners of victory in the very elements of the storm, for piercing the rain-drops, as so many prisms, it compels them to throw wide over the black cloud the radiant bow, and thus hoists the colors of victory upon the rear of the retreating foe. What deluge is like war? What war is like a civil war? What civil war, for magnitude and fierceness, was ever like ours? And who ever had a right, if not we, to scan the clouds for God's token and promise of enduring peace? When Noah went forth he builded an altar and offered sacrifice. We, in these later ages, build no altar of stone, and bring neither birds nor flocks for sacrifice; but a whole people, assembled to-day, offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God for the great mercies which he has vouchsafed to us. Let us pass in review the great elements of good, which span the retreating clouds and proclaim God's covenant of peace. 1. The end of the war. -- The sudden and complete extinction of a national conflagration of unparalleled magnitude has in it something sublime. The roar of battles has ceased, armies have dissolved, squadrons that shook the continent are distributed through shops, upon farms, and in all the ways of commerce. The suddenness of the beginning of the war has no parallel except in the suddenness of its close. It opened with a sweep of fire wide and rushing like autumnal burnings on the prairie. It closed as when equinoctial storms pour down on the lurid conflagration, and in one night drown out every spark! And the end is complete and peremptory; no fretting and fiery edges of war remain; no spiteful guerrillas; no dens and lairs of skulking soldiery. The shock is over and peace is established, to the confusion of every foreign prophet who predicted a long and tedious issue. How grateful is peace! and to none more than to those who saw that war must be waged. War should be peremptory and peace peremptory. By two bitter years we learned that war could not be conducted on peace principles. In far less time we have learned that peace cannot be maintained on war principles. War is medicine, not food; it is surgery, not calisthenics; it is judgment, not mercy. In war, sternness is true kindness, and mercy is cruelty. That which speeds it fastest, and soonest brings its end, is kindest. Stroke upon stroke -- explosion upon explosion -- battle upon battle: let war travel fast, and have done -- thoroughly done -- and then let there be no more of it. Peace has come -- not to us alone, but to the world! It was the peculiarity of our war that it was felt in Europe and in all the world. Slight earthquakes may be local; but some so heave the earth that their waves roll clear across the ocean, and strike upon foreign shores. So did ours; and Europe to-day joins with America in giving thanks that war is ended and peace begun. Let us supplicate the Divine Father that our sufferings may be vicarious, and that peace may be a part of that bow of promise and covenant, and that war shall deluge the land no more. Second, More remarkable is the success of our wax than its magnitude. How seldom do nations gain the ends for which they went to war. It was from such considerations that our very friend, in other lands, judging fromthe fruitlessness of most European wars, dissuaded us from conflict. But we have gained the very ends for which we lifted our banner! It seemed to this people that God had intrusted them with treasures for the good of all mankind, which could neither be preserved nor distributed were we to become a shattered nation -- a mere heap of States. For a nation's life we went to war. We bring back that life in full power. Orpheus brought forth his spouse from the horrid regions of the dead to life and love. Not ours his charming lyre that put all guards asleep; but with fife and drum, and huge artillery, we marched through the fiery realm of war to redeem and bring back our lost companions, and we have brought them! Nor is it unworthy of remark that every war in which this people have embarked has gained the very end for which the war set out. The power of the French was broken and the Indians were subdued in our colonial history. We also gained that political independence for which our great revolutionary struggle was begun. And, in the war of 1812, our desired point was attained; the war was followed by a totally different policy on the part of Great Britain. Although little was conceded in doctrine, yet the customs of the sea were changed from that period. Just so now, this same Power, refusing in terms to concede anything to diplomacy -- will, inevitably, kindly change her practice, and bye-and-bye establish it as exemplary law. 3. We have occasion of thanksgiving, in view of the fruits of the war that is ended. Not only has this nation gained the specific ends for which it waged war, but other and not less important fruits have been ripened in the lurid summer of war. Most eminent, and in every respect most remarkable, is the purgation of the National Constitution. It is one of the marvels of history that in an age fervid with the spirit of liberty, such men as our fathers should have framed a constitution for the express purposes of equal rights and civil liberty and then have deliberately inclosed in it a permissive element of the grossest slavery. It was as if one had built a fortress and given the enemy the key; as if God had grafted the tree of life with a scion of death, who rankly grew and overtopped all the rest. And this story repeats the words of the Apostle: ""And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."" Neither did there seem the remotest probability that any change could be made in that instrument by constitutional provisions, up to a very late day. The power of evil was increasing. Nor do I conceal from myself how nearly we came to a gulf whose depths no line of past experience is long enough to measure. When I consider the elements at work and all the probabilities that, by threat of war, the South would make peace and union upon the basis of a reformed constitution, nationalizing slavery, and putting at a hopeless distance the day of universal emancipation, I confess myself to be impressed with God's immediate interposition in saving us from so great a peril. I can scarcely yet see how we escaped it. It was not by man's plan, certainly. In the sudden rage of the people, when the flag was fired on, the unexpected powerlessness of the Northern sympathizers with Southern treason; the growing moral tone of the loyal States; the unexpected patriotism of commerce; the wonderful resolution gathered from defeat, and the solemn and awful purpose to which at length the North came, to sacrifice everything on earth rather than yield to slavery, are proofs and memorials of Divine Providence in human affairs. As a consequence of this mighty upheaval and national indignation, old prejudices sunk; selfishness and superstition gave place, and men began to feel the claims of justice, and by their Magistrate proclaimed liberty to 4,000,000 slaves. But, as if moved by a Divine impulse to clear their skirts of this sin, they ordained a purgation of the constitution itself. The road to any Amendment is hard and circuitous. So difficult, that it had been held by abler men to amount to an impossibility. Yet, with a will that has moved with the majesty of natural laws, State after State has ratified the amendment, and Georgia makes the twenty-eighth, and the work is done. [Applause.] The organic law of America is liberty. Slavery, hereafter, is treason to the constitution. [Applause.] Four million men to-day, can say for the first time, ""It is our constitution. We have a shield and tower of strength."" Rejoice, O ye men who for years have been faithful, under all persecutions, before all contumely of men, and have borne aloft your banner, with ""liberty"" graven thereon -- rejoice, for your end is attained, your enemy is slain, and you stand before the world warriors for the right, and conquerors for all time. [Applause.] The regeneration of a race was your work, and to-day, sheltered from the storm of prejudice and passion, they stand beneath the crystal dome of the constitution, freemen for time and eternity. This will work political, commercial and social oneness throughout the Union. Strange that death should work out immortality, but such is God's providence. Before, we grew away from each other By decease, principles at the bottom, and it was well-nigh impossible for us to have a real Union. Marbles in a tumbler are not united because they touch each other. Now we are one. Once introduce this great law of love and we are mightier than all the agitations in Christendom. The same laws govern all the people; the social structure is becoming similar; variations of feature there may be as there are here, but you are al men. So we see that war has not only sought purugaltion of the constitution and liberty but unity. I behold resurrection and prosperity at the South such as the eye of prophecy never saw. Hers was the prosperity of dissipation, but is to be the prosperity of industry. In this new state of things political economy must be alike; all interests must be alike or reciprocal; the structures of society must become substantially alike; education and religion must, after a time, have common field, North and South; and this nation will be more firmly bound by great natural laws than by the decrees of the people or the power of the victorious sword. In that coming day I see the restored glory of the South. Now she mourns despoiled. She shall arise and shine -- Are all her fields desolate? do they lie fallow? Only shall they be so till the weeds which slavery sowed are gone, and then her wilderness shall bloom as the rose. Are her schools closed? Schools shall now shine along her bosom like diamonds on the bosom of beauty. Are her churches silent? Better so than that they should teach heresies; but as the spires of her churches point silently to Heaven, so shall the doctrines of Christian liberty train the hearts of the people toward the God of our fathers. Not unmindful of her woes, I see in them only bursts of future joy. Her tears shall wash away her sins; they are not without witnesses and God shall wipe them from her eyes. Her shattered wealth shall breed an untarnished gold. Her glorious days shall come. Northern makers of whips, your business is done. [Applause.] Northern forgers of shackles and chains. God has put out your fires, and you shall not be permitted even to make for her the implements of industry. Blow ye the fires that beat swords into sickles and ploughs; work ye, that print books and newspapers -- the day of jubilee has come, and he that cuts the cord is mightier than he that wove it. Such men as WASHINGTON, HANCOCK, FRANKLIN and HAMILTON came from an age contemptuous of the common people, and never learned to honor the common people. Grand as they were, they were not perfect, and there was ever in them a lingering fear and doubt of trusting the common people with all their rights. They preferred to govern people rather than let them govern themselves. Their children advanced a step in the recognition of slavery absolute, and we were fast drifting toward destruction. The doctrine of universal suffrage is the doctrine of to-day, and from this day on there will be no rest in any State until universal suffrage is the law. [Applause.] The tendency of universal manhood is toward it, and no decret is surer than this, that the day is not far distant when all the rights of man shall be granted to every man. I dont limit this to the mere color of skin and skin, there's a deeper prejudice than this -- of sex and sex -- and the day is coming when in politics as religion, our women will go with us to the polls, when the family will vote and universal suffrage will be the rule and law of the land. [Moderate applause.] The era of work and the workman has come at last. Many did not know the great work that was being done for them; throughout all the North work is stronger to-day than ever before, and to-day I hear them demand what -- 8 hours a day -- no, but leisure for work and study -- they want not so much to diminish their labor but to increase their intelligence. All monopolies and combinations which restrict the individual are to be swept down by the setling tide. Society has tended hitherto to enrich the great and strong; all things are now to be reconstructed and power must be given to the individual. Republics say the State is stronger when its members are stronger. We can now become teachers to the whole world without being propagandists or revolutionists. I am glad we are now a great, respected and feared land, on account of the truths which it exponates. The dignity of man is now recognized, because man is man -- the education, ability of all men is now established. Take as many monkies as you choose and teach them one hundred years and they are the same at the end as they were at the beginning; take the lowest race of men there is and teaching evolves results noticeable and valuable. We are yet to learn that the are is educateable; no matter who or what they are you can bring him to the surface of the water and find gold in his mouth? The power of freedom is no more doubted, and the peacefulness of this people is to be noted. That two millions of men should spring into arms was surprising, but that they should as easily return to work was wonderful. With England we have a controversy, and have nothing to fear if it comes to the test of skill and power, but we quietly resign our arms and say to her, we are determined to have our rights, and shall stand firmly to them. We are not afraid to fight, but we prefer to obtain our due without it. France, more mean than any other, sneaked into the back door of our necessities, that she might establish her rag with a vulture on it; but we are bound to have her settle this difficulty, and settle it right; [applause,] but we will not even go to war with her, but will plead with the Emperor on his imperial throne until he hears and grants us justice. Peace, peace, peace, must be the motto and the theory of our nation, a motto and a theory which indorsed by undeniable power will carry about the earth in safety, doing good to all mankind. Let men on thrones look out. England has got to reform, France has got to revolutionize, Europe has got to be changed and turn her face toward the right; let her be warned in time and of her own will go onward -- if she don't, Liberty will some day grasp her by the throat and insist upon her standing for the right. We have earned our money of Liberty and we are bound to deposit it where it will be safe. We have gained Liberty and will fortify it so that no power can assail, no force assault her. Compare the newspapers and their vituperative trash with that of the revolutionary days. Take the Herald and News and World and boil them down together, and they will not furnish the spice for a single paragraph in an ancient country paper. We don't desire to treat one at the expense of the other, to help the blacks at the expense of the whites, nor to coddle the whites at the expense of the blacks. Let each do his best, a fair field being given to each. Now is the time in which to be born -- baseness was never so base, meanness never so mean as now, and of all meanness the worst is fear and distrust, How wretched, how detestable is this habit of fear, of discontent, of grumbling, of apprehension. Fear, when God is our Father. It is to strike the Almighty with a clenched hand. Shall he be distrusted who sees the end? Shall we look into the future with finite vision and quake and fear? I have an etching at home of which I am now reminded. It is a picture of a dead boar, near whom are two great dogs -- in at the death. The boar lies in the stiffness of unmistakable death. He is dead in the eye, dead in the snout, dead in his limbs, dead all over. One of the mastiffs stands at a little distance distrustful and apprehensive -- his eye never leaves the carcase of his ancient enemy, and he trembles at every disturbance of his hair by the playful wind; the other dog is stretched upon the grass, his nose resting upon his paws and his eyes closed as if in sleep, but a careful observation shows that he keeps one eye just enough open to enable him to watch the dead body before him, in whose death he is as but a doubtful believer. Just so there are people who don't believe in the death of slavery. Dead! Why, it's dead in eye, in snout, in body and limb, in every hair and fibre of frame, and yet they watch, and fear, and grumble.

It came up on a motion to quash an indictment brought in against a man named DONLAN for an assault with intent to kill committed in the Navy-yard. The argument was that the act of Congress of 1825, which provides that ""if any offence shall be committed in any of the places aforesaid, the punishment of which offence is not specially provided for by any law of the United States, such offence shall, upon a conviction in any court of the United States having cognizance thereof, be liable to and receive the same punishment"" as is provided for the ofence by the laws of the State -- had not created any such acts offences, as were not offences before by United States law, but merely had provided for punishments where none such had been previously provided for.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Offences in the Navy-Yard.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Offences in the Navy-Yard.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c1f28be2-b4ea-5a18-908d-ad0fd109120a,420,nyt://article/c1f28be2-b4ea-5a18-908d-ad0fd109120a

The argument to thankfulness is twofold. It is a tribute which we owe to God; it is also a solace which we owe to ourselves. God would have us walk always in the light of His divine compassion.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/08/archives/the-necessity-and-the-comfort-of-acknowledging-gods-dealings-with.html,,"The argument to thankfulness is twofold. It is a tribute which we owe to God; it is also a solace which we owe to ourselves. God would have us walk always in the light of His divine compassion. The thought of His fostering care; the assurance that He is our Father; that He remembers us, considers us, has a plan for us, a path for us -- this is our great antidote for the corrosion of care; this is our strength under burdens. The shortest way out of the maze of confused and troubled thoughts is to follow the lights of Divine mercy which shine to guide us. We read the history of the Hebrews with even new surprise. It seems unaccountable that a people so environed by divine Providence, so dependent daily upon divine interpositions, so pervaded by the reality of Divine presence, could have been so insensible to that Divinity which controlled them. The plagues of Egypt should have settled it for a generation, that God is sovereign -- that His word and His will must prevail. Those signs were enough, as we should judge, to educate a nation up to the highest conceptions of God's sovereign providence; enough to banish cowardice and discontent and rebellion from the hearts of a saved and thankful people; enough to make them conscious of their national dignity as the chosen people of God; enough to make them bear privation with patience, and meet-their enemies with manly courage. But not so. The Hebrews did not understand God's plans. They remembered not the multitude of His mercies. They became sottish and blind. They were unequal to their destiny, and so that whole generation perished in the wilderness. It is a serious question with us as a nation whether this sad story of Israel shall find its translation and antitype in our history. God has certainly made his right hand conspicuous in our national experience. He has been almost visible as he rode upon the storm-cloud. He has forced the whole world to stop and look at us. He has made our name, our sufferings, our deliverances, to be familiar to every people. Our politics have been debted in every language. Millions have been holding their breath in the urgency of the crisis. And our deliverances have been as signal as our exposure. It seems to-day like a pleasant dream that the sound of war has ceased; that woful tidings are not thrilling over our telegraph wires; that no more concentrations of armies are being made; that our guns have been permitted to cool at last; that the terrible distresses of war have passed away; that slavery, the cause of our political troubles, has become a matter of history, and that our task is now to bind up, to conciliate, to forgive and to forget. God has done great things for us whereof we are glad, and it remains to be seen whether we shall understand His wonders, and live or behave like that generation of Hebrews and perish. We are still on trial. Our troubles are not all over. Our risks are still pending. We stand before a spiritual tribunal' more critical than the material one which we have passed. If we are groveling and selfish, and luxurious, and devoted to material progress, while we forget our duty to the suffering, we shall still find God dealing with us in stern rebukes. If we are patient, and forgiving, and cross-bearing, for the sake of those who are ready to perish, then our prosperity will be assured, and God, even our own God, shall bless us.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Necessity and the Comfort of Acknowledging God's Dealings with theNation.; SERMON BY REV.

Our text occurs in such a passage of comfort. It represents the Jewish nation, once discarded as an adulterous wife, now, as made one with the Gentiles, reunited in perpetual wedlock to God. This mingling of Jew and Gentile as one in the return is to be especially noted, as many suppose that those prophecies relate only to Jews, and that, as Jews, they are to be brought back to their own land, in spite of the apostle's express declaration that Jesus hath made both Jew and Gentile one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between them. These words of the apostle ought to show us that the prophecies of glory for Israel refer to the spiritual Israel, Jew, and Gentile united in Christ. Various confirmations of this view are found in this chapter of Hosea, and in quotations made from it by the apostle; but we must omit their consideration, while we proceed to examine the main teachings of our text.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'National Blessing the Measure of National Faithfulness to God.; SERMON BY REV.

After a fervent prayer had been offered by the pastor, Rev. U.C. BREWER, Rev. D.P.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/08/archives/the-christians-relation-to-government-sermon-by-rev-dp-henderson-at.html,,"The services yesterday at the Church of the Disciples were very appropriate to the occasion. The audience was not very large, but intelligent, attention and appreciation. After a fervent prayer had been offered by the pastor, Rev. U.C. BREWER, Rev. D.P. HENDERSON, of Louisville, Ky., read from the ninth verse of the twelfth chapter of Romans to the seventh verse of the thirteenth chapter, and then remarked that what was there written was a lesson that could be more calmly surveyed more than a year ago, and yet it was of no more importance then than now. They could now more calmly and quietly study and dispassionately examine and appreciate the truth, so as to profit by it, than they could a year ago. The instruction there contained was wanted, and it was the duty of every Christian to study and ascertain what were the relations which he sustained to the human government under which he lived. Not only was it his duly, but it was his interest, his wisdom, his happiness to know his duty to those who were in authority, and who guarded and administered the government; and the Apostle Paul, in writing to Timothy, taught the prayer that was to be offered in their behalf, which was, that supplication be made for all men, and for all that were in authority, for it was a good and acceptable thing in the sight of God. Having ascertained our duty and the law of God concerning us, in reference to those in authority and our own participation in the interests of the government, we then would exert an influence and a power in the propagation of truth and purity which we never could without. By so doing we would escape the odium that is attached to so many at present. He had not the slightest sympathy in his heart for carrying the politics of any country into the pulpit, and he believed it to be beneath the dignity of a Christian for men to so far condescend below the elevation on which they were placed by their profession. It was a disgrace to the pulpit, and it multiplied infidelity all over the land; for a people so excitable and under the influence of prejudice as we were, would soon become estranged and violent in their feelings, and thus their Christian fellowship would soon be destroyed. Now what was his duty as a citizen to the government under which he lived? He went to the Scriptures for an answer; and when from them he heard it, he could keep in the line of his duty. The cause required the Christian to stand up for the truth and to breast the storm of prejudice, come from where it might. As Christians, in the maintenance of our holy religion, and in intercourse with each other and with our enemies, we must be consistent with the teachings of the Scriptures; we must recompense no man evil for good; prove ourselves honest in the sight of all, and if it be possible live pleasantly with all men. God had made provision for the maintenance of one's own life, that of his family, his property, and of his self-respect. He had also provided a power to avenge his people -- a sword to punish the wicked -- and he pointed them to that power to maintain the rights and privileges guaranteed to his children. Vengeance was His, and He would repay and make an agency for the punishment of evil doers; therefore, if the neighbor be hungry, feed him, or thirsty, give him drink, for by so doing coals of fire would be heaped upon his head. Let every soul be subject to the power of God, for there was no power but that of God -- no power but that ordained of God; and the time had never been when He had not recognized the existence and authority of human government. Whosoever, therefore, resisted the power resisted the ordinance of God, and those that resisted should receive themselves damnation. The ruler was the minister of God and the avenger to execute wrath to them that do evil; wherefore we must be subject not only for wrath but for conscience sake. We did not fully understand the Scriptures, and this was the reason why we blended politics with the Word of God. The Scriptures had been ignored altogether -- wholly and absolutely cast aside -- by men who pretended to be Christians and to follow the Lord Jesus Christ. If these passages were not true, then no scripture was true; and it not universal, then nothing was universal, and we might as well close the book forever and give ourselves over to the hardness of our heart. He was not speaking where there were nothing but idolaters and barbarians, but of our own government where every blessing had been meted out to its people; where every man was a king and sovereign; where he was lord of his own castle, planted his own wine, and out of his own figs, and where he was permitted to breathe the air, and with that air, the liberty to engage in the race among his fellow men for distinction and honor. We were not only to pray for those in authority, but to obey them, and that was the reason for his cheerfully meeting the audience that day, which the President of the United States had set apart as a day of thanksgiving; and he joined his fellow men under the proclamation, and that with pleasure, as it came from his master. The Apostle Paul recognized the reign of Nero, the wickedest wretch that ever lived as a government, and the people of this country had learned for the next hundred years that it was better to submit for the Lord's sake than to undertake to destroy what the people bad set up. He had no simple sentimentalism in his heart as that a man sitting on the bench should not pronounce the sentence of death upon only one guilty of crime, and God had said to Moses, and this saying would never be repealed while the world lasts, that ""whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed."" If the Sheriff could hang one man he could hang one million. His authority came from the government, the law. Where would this city have been when the mighty mob swept over it, had it not been for the strong arm of force, and the law which commanded it. It was the duty of every citizen to put down disorder, and it was the duty of Christians to do it, but not with vengeance. He was opposed to war. He had no war in his heart. He loved peace; but what went before peace? Purity was first, and peace come afterward. He looked upon rebellion against a government as a sin. His privilege was to submit or leave the country, and if he could not leave he must submit, be the consequences what they might. It was sectarianism that taught rebellion against the government of God. Children who heard such preaching rather smiled upon the creed and practised the customs until they thought their fathers only were right. What did these teachers preach? You might go and hear one sometimes, but how much gospel did he preach? Not a particle. It was some political philosophy that you would hear; but there was nothing of Jesus, no gospel, nothing to draw the heart of the sinner to God. He pitied them from his soul who based the noble profession of Jesus upon the petit sectual politician, and thus carry it into the house of God. It was natural for one to leave the land of his birth. Paul loved his native country. He loved the people of the South as he loved no other people, and as he expected to love no other. He was born with them, his blood was scattered all over the South, and he had warned them against what they were doing when before they attempted it, and told them what destruction they would bring upon their heads. He loved his native State and he hoped never to disgrace it, and yet he wept over its course. Would to God that she had freed herself from the terrible yoke of slavery. He rejoiced in the freedom of the South. The slaves were practically made made free in his own State. What it would please God to do with them he did not know. The people must, in their wisdom, determine how far lights must be given them; but with that question he had nothing to do. He had been severely criticised since he had been here, but the spirit prompting it was a wrong one. You could not be too mild, meek, condescending. If there was a difference of opinions on any subject and information was wanted the way was to sit down and talk it over like gentlemen.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/08/archives/the-nations-gratitude-and-the-nations-duty-sermon-by-rev-dr-murray.html,,"When we last assembled in this house for religious worship in response to the call of the Chief Magistrate, it was to humble ourselves under God's afflicting hand, and with pious rites to commemorate the illustrious civic virtues and the admirable services of a magistrate smitten by the hand of an assassin. The causes that chiefly moved to thankfulness now existed then; for then, after four years of sternest and most awful conflict, the land rested from war. The last battle had been fought; the sword had been gladly returned to its scabbard, from which it had so indignantly and so furiously leapt to save the life of the State. But, under the then existing circumstances, all festivities over the newly-won peace would have been sadly out of place, for there was felt only a deep, secret, mystic sorrow as the remains of the late President were borne to their last resting-place. It was fit that such festivities should be reserved to some future hour; and that hour had now come. The months that had intervened, beautiful with the blooms of Summer and rich with the fruits of Autumn, had cost over the hour of mournig their mellowing influences. The harvests had been gathered; the pestilence that hung lowering and threatening in our horizon had been, by the approach of winter, averted, to give time for such preparation as would, doubtless, divest it of many of its terrors. The object of the present discourse would be, -- firstly, to present some of the grounds of thankfulness now existing; and secondly, some of the obligations which a thankful spirit should lead and fit us to discharge. It was, perhaps, among the saddest features of our sinful state here that we were, as individuals, sometimes compelled to choose between evils; and it had been necessary for this people to choose between the appalling alternatives of civil war and national destruction. The nation made its election in the light of religion, and then bowed itself to incur the evils which the choice entailed. Thenceforth the evils of war, on a scale commensurate with the gigantic energy with which the war was prosecuted, were experienced by some portion of the nation. Political economists had estimated that the amount annually expended upon the military establishments of the world would, if divided, keep in school all the children on the globe, estimating that there should be four millions of schools, fifty children to each, and that each could be supported at an annual expense of $850. The expenses incurred during a single week of the war we had been waging excelled the entire amount received by the American Board of Commissioners for foreign missions during the first half century of its existence. Besides, we must take into account the conversion of producers, cultivators of the soil, into mere consumers, and the destruction that follows the path of war, as impossible of estimation as the number of sands on seashores, or stars in firmaments. But this material waste was the least and lowest thing to be estimated; for how significant compared with the suffering and agony on a hundred battle fields, the grief of bereaved families, the silent mourning of widowed and orphaned ones that should cease not till life itself should end. Amid these considerations, we should not forget those instrumentalities which had been so potent in alleviating the suffering of the battle field. We should not forget the sanitary Commission, nor the Christian Commission, that had done so much to prevent and counteract that demoralization which war naturally produces. Henceforth similar organizations would be as much a part of the equipment of the army of every Christian State as that of arms or of subsistence. Still, notwithstanding all the good effects of such organizations, we could not shut our eyes to the fact that war was demoralizing. He called upon all before him to give thanks to God that the land rested from the evils of war. Our thanksgiving should take on a deeper tone still when it was considered that the land rested from civil war; and our civil war had been prosecuted on a scale hitherto unknown to history. The civilized world stood for awhile against when they saw such a conflict precipitated upon this nation. It was a fearful sight to look on, and those all over the world who were true to us, could not conceal their feelings of sorrow that such a conflict must needs be upon the records of history and stand there forever. We could never forget the humiliations which this civil war brought with it. It gave the nations of the world an opportunity to ridicule the idea of a republic's being more peaceful or more secure than other form of government; gave them an opportunity to scout the idea of popular institutions, which must be maintained at such a price. We should thank God for all that calm and heroic magnanimity of the leader of the people, which stayed the hand which would have retaliated unnecessarily, which kept down the vindictive passions of the people. He kept the national record clear, and clean from all stain of bloody retaliation. But we could not forget, after all, that there were scenes which must go into history; that the history of Fort Pillow and Libby Prison, and Andersonville, were to be written with a pen of iron; that such history would repeat the story of civil war -- passions raised to the highest pitch of malignant fury. We could not forget that all the desolation of the war was in our own borders; all the territory laid waste by war was a part of the soil of our republic. But now, thank God, our backs were turned upon all the passions and desolations of war, and our eyes toward a national future of true glory and wise beneficence and common weal, in which the trophies of freedom, intelligence, virtue and industry should descend upon the altar of national advancement. The land was now resting from war, as the husbandman rests after having reaped the harvest -- as the mariner rests after long battling with fierce elemental foes, and having brought the vessel safely into port. But how different might the result have been. The nation's rest might have been like that of the husbandman when the corn is smitten with frost and mildew, or like that of the mariner when he escapes, his ship, just coming into port, having been dashed in pieces on the rocks and all the fruits of his voyage lost. The nation was now in possession of every end for which it bowed its head to the awful stroke of civil war. The question of all questions had been settled by God in our favor, and He who rules the destinies of all had saved our nation to be a blessing to mankind -- because the interest of his Son's kingdom upon the earth was somehow bound up in its perpetuity. The freedom of four millions of human beings was in it; the reconstruction of the whole society on new and better foundations, industrial, social and religious, was in it; schoolhouses, churches, libraries, inventions and homes were in it -- all that made life pleasant and profitable. We had been providentially saved from national dismemberment and death, and we should display our gratitude to God for our deliverance by the alacrity with which we hastened to discharge all the manifold obligations which our new position imposed. Indeed, it was only in the deep spirit of thankfulness that such duties as now devolved upon the nation could be truly perceived and performed. All our internal resources were factors of power in the late struggle, and it was by the blessing of God that these were increased and multiplied; and no American would hereafter be able to sail over the placid waters of Hampton Roads, or stand with uncovered head in the National Cemetery at Gettysburgh, and not feel that those States were planted by His hand and preserved for His glory. The people of these States would prove grievously false to their trusts if they failed to recognize the truth, that the life of this nation had been preserved for the Kingdom of God. God designed that this nation should move on in its path of progress, in the spirit of universal justice, truth and piety. If we failed to recognize the good providence of God in this great deliverance, and to be truly thankful therefor, then ""Wrap thy mantle about thy face, O prophet! and go up into Horeb; for it is is surely a time for coming judgment,"" when we should be scourged, perhaps with pestilence, into some fit recognition of God in our national life. But what were the duties we had to perform? This question could best be answered by considering the claims that were upon us -- the wants of those about us. In how many places were we told the entire land had yielded no crops, and the empty barns suggest fearful forebodings of the coming winter? How many instances of not merely poverty, but present suffering and prospective starvation were brought to our notice? Never before were such beneficiaries laid at our doors for succor. Heretofore, succor had been sent for the relief of the famishing in Ireland, but the people of that country were not our countrymen. True, they had never lifted their hand against the life of the nation; but they had no common traditions of the past with us and no common destiny to work out in the future. The people of the South were bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh, and never was more sacred charity brought to our doors than now in behalf of them. Let us nobly take it up and faithfully respond to it. The best way in which we could show our thankfulness for victory was to be magnanimous toward the conquered, restraining all disposition to exult over them and assisting them to the utmost of our ability. Neither should we forget that, in the providence of God, there had been led out of the house of bondage, during the struggle, four millions of black men, women and children. What was to be their future -- growth or decay? Were they to sink into the engulfing waters of that sea of civil commotion out upon which they were drifting, or were they, by our kindly, Christian love, to reach the shore of industry, intelligence and piety? Greater, more momentous questions than these never came before the tribunal of Christian philanthropy for adjustment: and they could be answered in no way that would not affect the future being of this Republic. The freedman to-day was a responsibility of the Christian State and of the Christian Church. One thing was clear, that the State would delight to do its full duty, to him just so far as the Church first did here. It was for the Church to take the lead in this matter -- to strive to fit these freedmen for any position which might hereafter, in the judgment of statesmanship, be accorded them. To this work -- his intellectual and moral education, every denomination in the land should devote itself. To the considerations of this work the General Assembly had been among the first to give its attention. Intellectual and moral instruction withheld, and the question was quickly answered. The result would be that which we this day saw in the condition of the Indian in this country. These supplied, and freedom guaranteed, and his destiny is a problem which he himself must work out. For ourselves, we should consider this question of Christian philanthropy in a spirit of devout thankfulness to God for his merciful deliverance. We should be condescending, as we remembered our dependence.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Nation\'s Gratitude and the Nation\'s Duty.; SERMON BY REV. DR. MURRAY AT THE OLD BRICK CHURCH.

Buzby, deceased. -- This action was brought to recover the sum of $35,000 damages, alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff by reason of false representations made to him under the following circumstances: In November, 1863, theplaintiff held 10,000 shares of the stock of the New-York and Nova Scotia Gold Mining Company. Previous to that date, gold had been discovered in the neighborhood of Tangier, Nova Scotia; a tract of land had been purchased, a company organized in New-York, considerable machinery sent on there from this city, and a number of men had been employed in mining for gold. The plaintiff, having a large amount of money invented, was employed by the company as an officer thereof, and resided at Tangier, Nova Scotia. In November, 1863, Mr. B.C. Buzby, since deceased, went on to Nova Scotia, saw the plaintiff, and represented to him that the affairs of the company were in a very low state; that the stock had scarcely any value, and that the quotations of it in Wall-street were merely nominal. Plaintiff now claims that these representations were false, and were calculated to and did deceive him as to his rights; that Buzby offered him fifty cents a share for his entire interest, and that for that amount he cold it in Nova Scotia -- he supposing that Buzby was stating to him the facts.

"Rebel Loan, the List of Bondholders",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/09/archives/more-light-on-the-confederate-cotton-bondholders-list.html,"Rebel Loan, the List of Bondholders","We have a curious document in our columns to-day, in the shape of a transcript from the official records of the rebel financial department, of the names of all the bondholders on the books at the date of the payment of interest in November, 1864. The whole of the subscribers on the list were not apparently bona fide holders of stock. At all events many of them do not appear to have come in for any shore of the interest divided at the date named. Their names were doubtless used to bolster up the loan; but whether with their knowledge or consent we cannot say. Certainly such a staunch friend of the United States as Mr. W.E. BAKTER, M.P., never gave his consent to have his name used in such a list; and there are many other members of the House of Commons in the catalogue that no one would for a moment suspect of being voluntarily or knowingly subscribers to the loan. One leading man of the London Times, Mr. JAMES SPENCE, appears to have drawn the interest on two hundred shares or bonds about a year ago. And it will be difficult to convince the public that SPENCE's colleagues -- whether pecuniarily interested in the loan or not -- were ignorant of the use being made of their names. The persons who drew interest in November, 1864, are chiefly of the blockade-running mercantile class, or younger sons of the Tory nobility and gentry. Some titled persons of mature years are among those who claimed dividends. But aside from the interested speculators, the subscribers are a sorry set. Mr. GEO. P. BIDDER, the eminent engineer, is an exception. One would have expected better things from his judgment. Altogether this list is a curious piece of history. Like everything else in the late Confederacy, it won't bear probing. Had it seen the light a year ago, even the average class of Englishmen must have found out what a stupendous swindle DAVIS' government was from the beginning.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""More Light on the Confederate Cotton Bondholders' List."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""More Light on the Confederate Cotton Bondholders' List."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4436034b-6d6a-54d8-9c52-1a7804a254c6,336,nyt://article/4436034b-6d6a-54d8-9c52-1a7804a254c6

Prospect of Peace between,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/09/archives/spain-and-chiliprospects-of-a-pacific-settlement.html,Prospect of Peace between,"By the European news this marning, it will be seen that the Government of Spain has taken a step which greatly redounds to its credit. In the course of a serious misunderstanding with Peru, in which the stronger power made an appeal to force by the seizure of the Chincha Islands, the Government of Chili gave such practical expression to its sympathy with the sister republic as to offend the dignity of Her Catholic Majesty's representatives. Admiral PAREJA was not less prompt, and not, perhaps, more discreet in avenging what he considered an insult to his flag than he was in the case of the alleged outrages committed upon the Spanish colony in Peru. The Queen's vessels were denied provisioning and supplies of coal. Perhaps this was natural. Probably it was both politic, and, from a Chilian point of view, simply just to a sister republican State. The Spanish Government, however, saw the matter in a different point of view; and the representative of Spanish power in the Pacific, interpreting the measure of the offense according to his own interpretation of international comity, proceeded -- apparently without consultation with his government -- to the extreme measure which has called forth such indignant protests from Western Europe. Admiral PAREJA was indiscreet enough at first to proclaim a blockade of the whole coast of Chili, with a fleet of six vessels. On sober second thought, he concluded it would be a sufficiently heavy task to blockade six ports -- allowing a vessel to each port. In his zeal the Admiral took no consideration of the propriety of giving any sufficient notice even of this partial blockade to neutral Powers. And naturally enough, the representatives of the great maritime States of both hemispheres hastened to remonstrate against proceedings of so summary a character. En gland and France have made themselves especially conspicuous in this protest, and it will be remembered our government was strongly urged by some of the leading journals of Europe to make common cause with both these Powers against Spain.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain and Chili-Prospects of a Pacific Settlement.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain and Chili-Prospects of a Pacific Settlement.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a5d1c1b-d0b3-5380-b08d-859a0a9e03e8,777,nyt://article/5a5d1c1b-d0b3-5380-b08d-859a0a9e03e8

KEENAN is described as a man of temperate and steady habits. He had a serious impediment in his speech, so much so that he did not go much into society. On Monday he went out, taking $20, in search of a physician who had advertised a certain cure for stammering. Not finding this person, KEENAN returned home considerably disheartened.

This cone is to be lighted at its apex, when there immediately begins issuing from it a thick serpent like coil, which continues twisting and increasing in length to an almost incredible extent. The quantity of matter thus produced is truly marvelous, especially as the coil which so exudes is solid, and may be handled, although, of course, it is extremely light and somewhat fragile, Having a little of the white powder with which the cones are filled placed at my disposal by a friend, I submitted it to analysis, and found it to consist of sulphocyanide of mercury.

Two policemen resigned rather than attempt any defence; one surrendered his badge and baton after a trial, which seemed to the Board to convict him of intoxication, and another who stood trial for an arrest while under the influence of alcoholic drinks may as well tender his resignation, and thus spare the Commissioners a painful duty in the premises. An interesting case was tried, involving the rights of lessees of the city's piers. Mr. M.O. ROBERTS' opposition California steamship line has a gate across Pier No. 29, North River, and at this gate a number of persons recently assaulted Mr. WILLIAM J. DONALD, a stevedore who had undertaken to go aboard the steamship Wilmington, then, by permission of the Harbor-masters, moored at that pier. Officer RICHARD HAWKEY, of Capt. BRACKETT's force, not knowing anything of the merits of the case, apprehended both the assaulted and the assailants, and hence the complaint. The Commissioners sustained the officer, and said that they had serious doubts whether anybody is authorized to erect gates on the piers. The Harbor-master can, at pleasure, moor any vessel at any pier, whether that pier has been leased or otherwise, and a vessel being at a pier, it follows, the Commissioners hold, that her employes have the right of way to her decks.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f985b4af-2a30-5265-8059-e509695b24b8,1021,nyt://article/f985b4af-2a30-5265-8059-e509695b24b8

""This,"" writes our Paris correspondent, ""is in direct contradition to the ideas which the French Government and the partisans of the Mexican expedition have always urged; that is to say, they have always put forward the idea that so long as the French flag remained in Mexico, the Americans would be afraid to interfere for fear of war with France, and that if the flag were removed, MAXIMILIAN would be attacked at once. The difference,"" he continues, ""is a most important one, and if it could be made to enter into the plans of the American Government to publicly announce their policy in this respect, so that the French people could be sure of the fact, the pressure of public opinion would soon bring about the evacuation of Mexico and the trial of the Empire on its own merits.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Proposed Withdrawal of the French Troops From Mexico.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Proposed Withdrawal of the French Troops From Mexico.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f98aeac0-bf6e-5194-b013-11725a558601,861,nyt://article/f98aeac0-bf6e-5194-b013-11725a558601
Naples and its Sanitary Condition,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/09/archives/cause-and-result.html,Naples and its Sanitary Condition,"-- The most terrific ravages of the cholera during the last few months have been among the lower classes of the population at Naples. The quarters of the city that have been most afflicted are the Porto, the Mercato, the Vicaria and the Pendino -- just the localities that one might expect to be attacked; for there are concentrated the filth and ignorance of Naples, and there physical and moral causes are both at work to increase the evil. ""It is impossible,"" writes a correspondent, ""to give a faithful description of some places to be found in these quarters; houses without conveniences; streets narrow, confined, and befouled by the dirty habits of a people who, if they have in past times been taught Mariolatry by legions of priests, have never been taught the first duties of decency."" It almost seems as if this were written as a description of certain localities in New-York; and from what has happened in Naples, we can forecast what surely will happen here, unless intelligent measures of a sanitary nature be seasonably provided for and enforced.

The Winter in upon us, and we ought at once to send on a large supply of clothing, to save from suffering, perhaps from death, hundreds upon hundreds of those for whose welfare the Church has now pledged herself to care, and who have very strong claims upon our sympathy. Measures are being as rapidly matured as possible for opening schools, wherein the freedmen, young and old, may be properly and thoroughly instructed in useful knowledge, religious and secular, by competent teachers of approved principles and character. We beg the clergy to bring this subject without delay to the notice of their people, and to form auxiliary committees for the collection of funds, and associations of ladies to help forward this work of Christian benevolence, by providing clothing and bedding. We beg every layman who may read this appeal to send us a donation at once through his rector, or directly, to the Treasurer.

GULLEN, employed in the office of his father, an ice-dealer, at No. 56 South Fifth-street, E. D., made a desperate attempt at self-destruction by shooting himself with a Derringer pistol. Mr. GULLEN is about 23 years of age, of good address and kind disposition, and his rash act has caused sincere sorrow among a large circle of relatives and friends. The causes which impelled him to the deed are variously and vaguely stated by those who know. All the particulars that can be accurately made known at present may be thus stated -- GULLEN slept at the house of his uncle, Mr. LEWIS SIMONS, No. 277 Grand-street, on Friday night, and while there seemed very much depressed in spirits. In answer to a question from his uncle, he said he had a great deal of trouble on his mind. On Saturday morning he went to his business as usual, but acted strangely throughout the forenoon. About 11 o'clock he called upon an intimate friend of his named DOUGLAS, and taking a Masonic emblem from his bosom gave it as a keepsake to his friend, saying that he was going to leave Williamsburgh forever. Mr. DOUGLAS seeing him dispirited, tried to rally him, and proposed a ride. This proposition he seemed to assent to, and Mr. DOUGLAS went to a stable to hitch up a team, but before he got it ready word was brought to him that GULLEN had shot himself. It seems that after his interview with his friend, GULLEN went to his father's office, where he met his uncle, Mr. SIMONS, and remarking to him, ""Remember what I told you,"" entered the stable attached to the office. His friends, suspecting something wrong, followed him. But a few moments only elapsed from the time of his leaving the office, when a report of a pistol was heard, and those entering the stable found the rash young man weltering in his blood. Dr. NORTH was sent for, and on his arrival examined the wound. When GULLEN saw the dactor approach, he said: ""I tried to hit my heart, but am afraid that I missed it."" On examination it appeared that the ball went through the left lung, just above the heart, going between the ribs, without fracturing them, and coming out on the left side of the back. Dr. NORTH thought it advisable to have the sufferer sent to the City Hospital, where he lies in a critical condition, though conscious at a late hour last night. Before being sent to the hospital, he expressed his regrets that he had not succeeded in his design, and alter he was taken there he raised blood freely, and at every expectoration exclaimed, ""That's encouraging!"" couraging!"" -- meaning that he wished for death.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 3 -- No Title; BROOKLYN NEWS DESPERATE ATTEMPT OF A YOUNG MAN TO COMMIT SUICIDE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 3 -- No Title; BROOKLYN NEWS DESPERATE ATTEMPT OF A YOUNG MAN TO COMMIT SUICIDE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1cdeea49-fec1-5ca9-b594-9906483620e9,587,nyt://article/1cdeea49-fec1-5ca9-b594-9906483620e9

KUCHER, aged 16 years, and residing at No.13 Sheriffstreet, was accidentally shot at Pier No. 4 North River, by PETER MORRISY, a private watchman. The wound inflicted was a severe and dangerous one, the ball entering the breast and breaking two ribs. It appears that the boy KUCHER was sitting on some cotton bales while other boys were busy stealing cotton, and MORRISY fired the shot to frighten the boys away. In doing so he inflicted the wound on KUCHER. The boy, on being shot, ran away, as did MORRISY, who heard that KUCHER was mortally wounded. Roundsman P.T. SEYMOUR, of the Twenty-seventh Precinct, heard of the occurrence, and traced the boy to his house. Meanwhile Officer JOHN HANIFER, of the Twenty-sixth (City Hall) Precinct, made diligent search after the watchman, whom he succeeded yesterday in finding. Capt. BRACKETT had the prisoner conveyed before the boy, who identified him as the man who had shot him. On being arraigned before Justice DOWLING, MORRISY admitted the act of shooting, but stated that it was purely accidental. He was committed to await the result of the boy's injuries.

L.; European Social Reforms; Sanitary Arrangements in English Cities","It is exceedingly important to demonstrate to the people at this time that sanitary arrangements are a science -- that they produce exact effects on the average of life and of mortality. It is well known now that the great majority of the customary diseases which afflict cities and towns are preventable. Scarlatina, measles, diphtheria, small-pox, typhoid, and to a certain degree cholera, are classed as ""preventable diseases."" Good sanitary provisions will keep them off -- or at least to a very great extent. So true is this, that in an English city, if the ""Medical Officer of Health"" hears of an unusual death-rate in a given quarter, he does not sit down and accept it as a ""mysterious dispensation."" He knows it is connected with causes, just as exactly as the wet in his cellar is connected with the drainage of the neighboring ground. He sends is inspector to investigate. This officer (a competent physician) discovers that the additional deaths beyond the known average are from ""preventable diseases;"" diphtheria here and scarlatina there, and so on. He tracks the cases; he finds how the sick lived, and what was the condition of the houses and neighborhood; he noses about through the sickly districts. He discovers under the diphtheria an unventilated sewer, sending its foul gases through the waterpipes into the house; with the typhoid he finds too many people in a room or too much filth; along with the scarlatina he picks out an open cess-pool; with intermittent fever or consumption he developes bad drainage; beneath cholera he uncovers a pig-stye or a heap of garbage.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/10/archives/american-geographical-and-statistical-society-lecture-by-hon.html,,"On Friday evening Hon. F.A. CONKLING delivered, at Clinton Hall, the first of a series of lec tures on the ""Currency, Resources and Indebtedness of the United States,"" before the members of the above-named society and a number of financiers of this and other cities. The introductory portion of his lecture was devoted to the origin of national debts in this and other countries, and to the various plans suggested or put in action to effect the liquidation of those debts. He combated freely the plausibilities of some financiers who argued that a national debt was the centre where all the surplus capital of the nation took refuge; that it furnished a most convenient if not an indispensable fund for investments and for securities; that it formed a bond of union among all classes of the community; that it afforded stability to political institutions, and that the paying off such a debt would produce no good result. These statements, said the lecturer, possess just enough of plausibility to give them currency with ignorant and unreflecting persons, and to render them convenient instruments in the hands of the fundmonger, or of a crafty minister. But so long as it shall be conceded that that it is a disadvantage for an individual to owe money which, he cannot pay, and which, by impairing his credit, destroys his capacity to obtain further pecuniary aid, so long as it shall be admitted to he an evil for an individual to have his wants left unsatisfied and his opportunities for improvement curtailed by the inexorable necessity to meet the accruing interest of his debts, so long will nations, which are but aggregations of individuals, find a debt to be a curse and not a blessing.

This old family mansion was in Lower Dublin Township, Twenty-third Ward, and many historical reminiscences cluster around it, recalling memories of bygone days. It is stated in the early history of Philadelphia, that WILLIAM PENN instructed his commissioners to examine the shores of the Delaware, and to fix upon a site for the building of a 'great city.' After several weeks spent in the examination, they selected three places, one of which was the bold shore a short distance above the 'Bake-House.' Here they resolved to build the city of Brotherly Love, the country being admirably suited to the purpose; but after much time spent in making soundings along the shore, they discovered a large number of rocks, most of which are beneath the surface of the river, and finally concluded to abandon the site for the one upon which Philadelphia now stands. The rocks were denominated the 'Hen and Chickens,' on account of one of them being much larger than the rest. The place has often been called 'Old Philadelphia,' but that name lives only in the traditionary accounts that have been handed down to us. About the time of the arrival of PENN, several Welsh families settled along the Delaware, not far from the mouth of the Pennypack Creek, and one of the number, named THOMAS, purchased a large tract extending up the stream to the site of 'Old Philadelphia.' This settlement was called South Wales. THOMAS started a bakery on his tract for the purpose of supplying his friends in the settlement. From this circumstance it was called 'The Bake-house,' a name by which it has ever since been known.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Destruction of an Historical Relic.; THE ""OLD BAKE-HOUSE"" ON THE DELAWARE BURNED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Destruction of an Historical Relic.; THE ""OLD BAKE-HOUSE"" ON THE DELAWARE BURNED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/53192bcc-e41c-5711-a0d4-897233ed3869,593,nyt://article/53192bcc-e41c-5711-a0d4-897233ed3869

In the nature of things, Europeans should be able to take a more impartial and comprehensive view of our national position and peculiarities than we ourselves. The reasons why this has hitherto not been the case are not creditable to the insight, the industry nor the sympathies of foreign scholars. English writers have been blinded by their prejudices; while those Continental historians who were competent to the task have failed to perceive its great political and moral importance, and those who rightly esteemed the republic, and would fain have done it justice, were too active in the reformatory movements of their own times and countries to pause for the contemplation of distant lands, or to paint with patient hand a picture of the past. The keen but kindly criticisms of DE TOCQUEVILLE bear witness to what the right man might have achieved as a historian of the United States. But the fortunate coincidence of capacity, will and opportunity did not take place. Perhaps, too, the right time had not yet come. The outbreak and suppression of a gigantic rebellion throw a light upon our interior life, and furnish a climax to our national career for which the chronicler could have found no substitute.

Though no actual collision has taken place between the islanders and the minoins of the law, yet the police and the bailiffs of county courts are forbidden access to the island. A company has for some time worked the national quarries on the island, and as many as 200 men are, or have been employed on the works. The good wages they received, and the free and easy life the men enjoyed, and the recent immunity from the unwelcome visits of police officers and county-court bailiffs, have made it a refuge for the ""fag ends of society"" and ""black-legs."" The refusal on the part of the proprietor to be rated for the county police has been followed by an injunction to prevent any of that fraternity landing on the island. This has now been extended to the officers of the county court. For a time this was evaded by getting the captain of the Ranger (who carries the mail to the island weekly) to serve the summonses. That person is now forbidden to land with any such undesirable messages in his possession. So the islanders are declared in a state of revolt, having set law at defiance, as in days of yore, when it was a pirates' home. Sergeant PETERSDORFF, judge of the county court, having seen the summonses repeatedly returned ""unserved, intends to bring the case in some form or other under the notice of the Court of Queen's Bench, and for the present the Lundyites will enjoy immunity from unpleasant visitations from over-anxious and pressing tradesmen, but it should make the latter cautious. -- Western Morning News.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; LUNDY ISLAND IN A STATE OF REVOLT.

More fallacies, we believe, are in circulation here, on such matters, than in any other country. This has been particularly the case in regard to our national debt and our redundant currency.

Delegation Appointed to Remain at Washington During Session,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/11/archives/black-men-intend-to-help-themselves-a-colored-delegation-in.html,Delegation Appointed to Remain at Washington During Session,"At a convention of the colored men of NewEngland, held recently in Boston, it was resolved that the interests of their race required them to keep a delegation in Washington during the present session of Congress, to note the proceedings of the National Legislature and labor with those Senators and members of the House of Representatives who may be willing to give the black man his rights as a freeman. And in purfsuance of this resolution the convention chose Capt. GEORGE T. DOWNING, of Rhode Island, its delegate, and voted to give him $10,000 at once to cover the necessary expenses of his mission. The colored men of Ohio, also, recently took like action, and chose Mr. JOHN M. LANGSTON to press their claims at the Federal Capital, and the colored men of Louisiana, aided by white men's votes, have duly elected a member of the House of Representatives, whom they hope to see admitted to a seat on the coor of the House, and to him also a purse, of $10,000 has been given. It is now proposed that New-York shall send a delegate in the person of FREDERICK DOUGLASS, and that a fund of $10,000 be raised here to defray his expenses, and the leaders in this movement -- among whom are Rev.

Persons afoot have the most perilous task conceivable in trying to cross from the Park to Nassau-street; and we cannot remember ever having seen a policeman doing his duty at this point, in the way of preventing reckless driving. Heavy fines, where passengers suffer as in the case of the Fifth-street accident, ought to be the order. Right round sums in the shape of damages ought to be given in every such case, not alone in the interest of the immediate sufferers, but in the cause of public safety as well.

"The claque at the Parisian theatres has always been a source of annoyance alike to authors and to actors. Some of its iniquities have been exposed in the Tribunal of Commerce, where two actions have been brought in which M. GOUDCHON, leader of the applause at the Porte St. Martin, and M. MARC FOURNIER, director of the same theatre, were alternately plaintiff and defendant. In April, 18[???]6, M. GOUDCHON became leader of the claque, at the Porte St. Martin Theatre, and at the same time made on advance to M. FOURNIER of 40,000f., now reduced to 35,500f. by the payment of 7,500f. This contract was renewed for three years and a half in December of the same year, when M. FOURNIER agreed to the M. GOUDCHON daily, for the sum of 10,000f. a year, a number of tickets representing 54f., at the usual prices, and also made a verbal engagement to allow him eighty tickets daily for the admission of the claque. In May last, however, M. FOURNIER ceased to give the eighty tickets, on the ground that no such stipulation was contained in the contract and that the giving of them was an immoral act which the law would not sanction. As GOUDCHON persisted in claiming them, M. FOURNIER declined to retain his services, dismissed him without paying him the 32,500f., and engaged another leader of the claque. M. GOUDCHON in consequence brought the present action, demanding to be restored to his functions, or else that the 32,500f. should be at once repaid to him, without waiting for the terms stipulated in the contract, for the breach of which he also demanded 20,000f. damages. M. FOURNIER responded by a cross action to enforce payment for tickets delivered to GOUDCHON, and of 10,000f. as damages for the inconvenience caused him by the latter's conduct. Counsel were heard on both sides, and in the end the tribunal decided that the treaty being immoral it must be annulled. At the same time it condemned GOUDCHON to pay the sum claimed for the tickets, while his demand for the return of his 35,000f. was complied with, and on order made for the payment of the amount.

Promenaders were generously left the choice of two evils, either to cross to the other side of Broadway, through the muddy street, and back again above the ruin, or try their luck upon the upturned edges of two slimy planks thrown carelessly lengthways along the edge of the street. During the few moments we stood, at least a hundred ladies had to cross the street through the wilderness of stages and quarreling teamsters, and the sea of mud, destroying their dresses and endangering their lives in the journey, and not a few were the well-merited maledictions of the less patient sex, who either adopted this mode of progress or the other alternative -- a trifle less enduring, but no less dirty or dangerous.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obstruction of the Thoroughfare A Public Nuisance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obstruction of the Thoroughfare A Public Nuisance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1f862cc3-bf34-5878-8731-cc7d99759999,350,nyt://article/1f862cc3-bf34-5878-8731-cc7d99759999

"Russell, Earl; Efforts to Liberalize his Government",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/12/archives/lord-russells-efforts-to-liberalize-his-government.html,"Russell, Earl; Efforts to Liberalize his Government","The new English Premier has taken some hesitating steps in the way of making the personnel of his administration more acceptable to the Liberal party. He has not ventured to displace any traditional Whig or Peelite, holding a Cabinet seat. All the great offices of State remain as they were, with the exception of Lord RUSSELL's occupancy of the Premiership and Lord CLARENDON's accession to the Foreign Office. But some of the minor offices had become vacant. And two of them, the Vice-Presidency of the Board of Trade, and the Under-Secretaryship for the Colonies -- neither of which include a Cabinel seal -- have been filled by really able and liberal men. To the former Mr. GOSCHEN, a London merchant, and one of the members for the city, succeeds; to the latter, our staunch and true friend, Mr. W.E. FORSTER, the radical member for the radical town of Bradford, has been appointed. Both appointments will be entirely acceptable to the friends of progress in the United Kingdom. The only regret will be that the offices are not of a kind which will allow much scope for the administrative and debating talents of either of the gentlemen promoted. They will be, in a measure, overshadowed in the House of Commons by the chiefs of their respective bureaus. Mr. MILNER GIBSON will naturally take precedence of Mr. GOSCHEN as the head of the Board of Trade; and Mr. CARDWELL, in like manner, will do the bigger share of the parliamentary talk for the Colonies. Still, it is no inconsiderable concession to popular feeling to get even these appointments out of a Whig Minister, whose exclusive views on the subject of party preferment have become part of his political nature. These accessions indicate something like a ministerial purpose on the question of parliamentary reform. Mr. FORSTER was not likely to have accepted even the subordinate position assigned to him, unless he had assurance that a liberal and progressive policy had been marked out by the Russell Cabinet.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LORD RUSSELL'S EFFORTS TO LIBERALIZE HIS; GOVERNMENT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""LORD RUSSELL'S EFFORTS TO LIBERALIZE HIS; GOVERNMENT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b66c759-b16c-55a5-8af0-064ab0cbdca6,334,nyt://article/2b66c759-b16c-55a5-8af0-064ab0cbdca6

France, he tells us, stands in the position of Europe -- a ""position against the usurpation of the United States."" And she must do so in order first to protect the Latin race and prevent the absorption by the great American Republic of all the corn, sugar, cotton, silver and gold produced in the Western Hemisphere. Having thus shown, as he declares, that he alone in France understood and appreciated the Emperor's Mexican policy, the poet proceeds to give us a picture of ourselves as a community and as individuals, -- a picture more striking than flattering.

New-Orleans Crescent on the Spirit of the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/12/archives/the-spirit-of-the-south.html,New-Orleans Crescent on the Spirit of the South,"The New-Orleans Crescent discourses upon the fate of the South, and states as the tenor of the latest private advices received in that city from Washington and the North generally, that ""the South is rapidly sinking into disrepute, and that even its warmest friends are beginning to regard it with coldness and dislike. The Crescent asks why this is, and then goes on to give an account of what the South has done and suffered, what it now assents to and endures, and what it expects and desires. Its deeds and sufferings, as stated by our New-Orleans cotemporary, consist in having ""shed her best blood"" in the late war of rebellion; her present endurances consist in ""bowing to the inexorable logic of events;"" in welcoming the capitalists, as well as the needy adventurers and immigrants, from Northern and Eastern soil;"" in ""extending the right hand of fellowship to those members of the invading armies who have decided to cast their fortunes with us;"" in ""countenancing Freedmen's Bureaus until that institution became so corrupt as to strike even its myrmidons with terror at the baleful spirit raised;"" in ""adapting their views to please the Administration;"" in ""upholding every act of the President's administration"" -- in a ""hearty support of the Federal Government"" -- in ""assenting cheerfully to the abolition of slavery,"" and in various and sundry other things of a more or less commendable character or otherwise. After the extraordinarily varied catalogue of what the Southern States have done to ""reintegrate"" themselves, we are told that they are ""willing to make any further concessions not involving their honor."" And what does the South -- or rather, what does the Crescent ask, after making all these concessions? They ""merely ask that the right of suffrage and the privileges of equality in the social circle be withheld from the negro!"" Now, in any event, the Crescent is sure of receiving one of the things it asks -- that is to say, in other words, it is impossible for the government to give to the negro the ""privilege of equality in the social circles"" of the South; and it is quite certain that the government will not make the attempt to give him any such privilege. Whatever other matters the government may interfere with, that is one that is sure to be left to the action of the Southern people. So that in reality the Crescent might have simplified still further its demands by reducing them to one, to wit: that the ""government withhold the right of suffrage from the negro.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Spirit of the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Spirit of the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5f4c829-efc3-52f5-9b41-d2e945759fdf,958,nyt://article/a5f4c829-efc3-52f5-9b41-d2e945759fdf

Mr. Gardner, a gentleman well known and highly esteemed, of Fulton, Fulton County, N.Y., has been wasting literally away for the last few years, from Catarrhal Consumption, which produced complete deafness. He himself, as well as his wife, stated that for the last ten years, he had not been able to keep a morsel of food on his stomach, nor to enjoy a single complete night's rest. Perspiration continually stood on his body, as if he were in a vapor bath, being feverish, alternating with a slight chill, characterized by pain in the right side, extending to the point of the shoulder; also a sharp pain of the collar-bone, pain on the right side, particularly causing an uneasy sensation when lying on it, as well as a difficulty in respirating, felt great thirst, his tongue was dry and covered with a white fur; great giddiness and swimming in his head -- in fact he complained of general weakness and disliked movement or exercise, great headache, flatulence, belching, with acid taste in the mouth and throat; he complained of a constant oppression of fullness, and at last his mind showed symptoms of being affected. He also labored under almost complete deafness, and existence became to him a torture. He felt himself wasting away with weakness. As a matter of course, he consulted many physicians of repute, both general practitioners and those practicing specialties, and still he continued to sink; and, as his wife says, after reading the case of consumption in our columns, she and their friends concluded that they could do no better than to apply to the same eminent physician, Dr. Von Eisenberg, one of our practitioners, whose heart is devoted to the cause of suffering humanity. As all hopes of Mr. Gardner's recovery had been given up, there being but little risk, and as a last resource, the husband, wife and friends came to New-York, and called at the Doctor's office, No. 816 Broadway. So much was his nervous system affected, that when he was placed in the examination chair, his countenance seemed to change. A convulsive spasm passed over it, and in a minute or so he seemed to recover, and exclaimed, ""Oh, Doctor, you hurt me very much!"" although all this time the Doctor had not appreached him. After a careful diagnosis with Dr. Von Eisenberg's usual skill and experience, and after an attentive and patient examination of the history and existing symptoms, the Doctor gave it as his opinion that Mr. Gardner had been suffering from laryngeal phthisis, complicated with dry catarrh; that his deafness arose from the disordered condition of the throat, and in the sympathetic condition between the nerves of the throat and those of the auditory organ. By a minute auscultatory examination of the lungs and laryrnae, he said that pulmonary phthisis may be present, with the usual exciting causes of inflammation and its consequences. Extending to the digestive organ by sympathy and continuity from the pulmonary and digestive mucous surface furnishes many indications, giving rise to heart-burn and acrid eructations, which produce profuse sweating, cough, purulent expectorations. This complication commenced with a dyspeptic character, assuming a severe form, and has been attended by nausea, pain, tenderness, a sense of heat, or burning pain. In fact the Doctor said that in such complicated cases, the commonest catarrh generally appears under a more febrile form, and when it unfortunately affects one of a consumptive tendency, it is the exciting cause of a galloping decay. A failure of health and strength has been gradually coming on with a loss of appetite.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC.; THE TRUTH SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

"London Times, >amp;c., on Escape of Stephens",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/12/archives/from-our-foreign-files-the-fenians-particulars-of-the-escape-of.html,"London Times, >amp;c., on Escape of Stephens","Our Dublin correspondent, in his letter of last night, says: ""Richmomd Bridewell, from which the Fenian chief, JAMES STEPHENS, has escaped, (as my telegram of yesterday stated,) is stuated upon the Circular road, an avenue that almost surrounds the City of Dublin. It is the gaol in which DANIEL O'CONNELL and the Repeal prisoners lay after they had been convicted sedition in 1844, and it was subsequently tenanted by JOHN MITCHEL and other worthies ot the same stamp. It is not the best protected of the Dublin prisons, and it is remarked that if STEPHENS had been placed in Kilmainham he could not have got off. It is probable, however, that the golden key would have proved as effective elsewhere; for the Fenian Head Centre did not set himself free by any violent wrenching asunder of bars, or by extraordinary skill or artifice, but, to all appearance, by securing accomplices in the prison. The cell in which he was placed had been separated from that occupied by KICKHAM, one of his confederates, by another cell, in which a prisoner was placed who was expected to be an additional watch, having been promised a remission of his sentence for the service. This man heard steps on the stairs, and the turning of a key in a lock, but gave no alarm, believing it to be the watch. STEPHENS left the cell about 1 o'clock A.M., and the intelligence that he was missing was conveyed to the Governor at 4 o'clock A.M., by the warder whose duty it was to go round every hour. This warder's name is BYRNE, and he was formerly a member of the ""Pope's brigade."" It was then found that STEPHENS had been let out of his cell by a duplicate key, perfectly new, and that no less than six other doors or gates had been opened between corridors and in other situations, to permit him to escape. The tables taken out of the refectory and placed against the outer yard wall of the prison are heavy, and could hardly have been carried by even two persons over the distance. Mounting on these, STEPHENS was within a short space of the summit of the wall, and the tables had been placed at a spot where, when he reached the top, he was near a large tree, by means of which he must have descended. Between this locality and the open country there are no houses, and it is likely that the friends of the prisoner had made preparations to receive him and carry him off with speed to the place they thought safest. He certainly got full five hours start of the police, who have been occupied all day making search in various places, but have found as yet no clue whatever. A reward for the apprehension of STEPHENS of £1,000 will, I understand, be offered by the Executive to-night, and also one of £300 for the apprehension of the person or persons who aided his escape, or such information as will fasten the guilt upon them. All sorts of rumors of an absurd character are of course afloat; one has got many to credit it, that a strange steamer has been lying off shore in the bay, awaiting STEPHENS, which, it need hardly be said, is quite impossible. According to another rumor, STEPHENS was met and caried off when he crossed the prison wall, by a hundred or more armed Fenian Brothers. This is equally incredible. Neither is it true that several of the warders of the prison have disappeared. It is possible that an information may be sworn to-night against one individual. It may perhaps be worth recalling to mind that one of the Fenian speakers in America boasted lately that persons had been employed to commit petty crimes in Ireland in order that, when imprisoned, they might become acquainted with the interior arrangement of the principal gaols. The escape has been so extraordinary that there are demands for an inquiry into the whole matter.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM OUR FOREIGN FILES.; THE FENIANS.

"We do not presume that any of our Justices of the Supreme Court, Superior Court or Common Pleas would deliberately pick a pocket or steal a horse; yet we hear continual complaints concerning the dishonesty of one or two of them. They steal the time of the practitioners and suitors in their courts. They are paid by the city or county to devote their whole time to unfortunate litigants who seek judicial interpretations of their differences. They are permitted to designate the number of hours per day that they are willing to give to the duties of their office. They sit only five days out of the week, and only four hours out of each day. This is all well enough, but when the Justice announces that he will open court at 11 in the morning, relying upon which the members of the bar gather in the courtroom to be heard, and when the same Judge habitually saunters in somewhere between 11:30 and 1, it becomes an imposture and a fraud. The time of the lawyer is valuable to him; he may have business engagements elsewhere which depend upon the punctuality of the court. If he is obliged to wait while the Judge digests his breakfast, picks his teeth, and reads the morning papers, he loses, perhaps, an hour of the most valuable portion of the day.

These men have, from selfish motives, done great damage to the people of the country, and to the interests of the country. They have, during the last six months, succeeded in keeping wheat, the staff of life, far above its natural and legitimate price, and have thus made life harder and poverty severer to hundreds of thousands of people who could ill bear such an infliction. By holding back for higher prices, they also, prevented the outflow of grain to Europe, where there was a demand for it at a price at which it could well be afforded; and in this way they helped to keep the balance of trade against this country, and thus raised the price of all other articles. The operations and combinations of the Chicago speculators were on a very large scale, and they were enabled from time to time to turn the current of prices to suit their purposes.

Railroads; Thieves on Cars,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/13/archives/robberies-on-the-city-railroad-cars.html,Railroads; Thieves on Cars,"-- The practice of crowding the platforms of the city railroad cars has become a common one among the bolder class of thieves. At certain hours of the day and evening the cars are parked full of living freight, and as the struggling passenger gets on or off, the thieves on the platform, by well concerted action, have the amplest opportunity for picking pockets. The practice has become altogether too common. We have had several cases reported of late. The conductor has seldom sufficient nerve to do anything to protect the decent passengers, even if he could be always present at the particular juncture when the thieves make their opportunity for plunder. We do think that after dark, at least, and for several hours during the rush of travel in the evening, the companies could afford to have detectives employed to look to the protection of innocent wayfarers. Some of the conductors boast that they can take on -- counting the way and through passengers -- as many as eighty human beings on one trip. This, on a car which by law should carry only twenty-two adults. There is no opportunity better suited to the thieving community than that of an overcrowded city car. It is a perpetual field for the exercise of their calling. It has all the advantages, with few of the perils of a swell-mob raid at a horse-race, a prize-fight, or a Democratic ratification meeting. Then, it affords not an occasional, but a daily and hourly opportunity for the professional thief. We do not know that the dividends of the railway companies would enable them to provide the protection we suggest. They must be poor, we should suppose, to permit a through passenger load of eighty to be jammed into a miserable two-horse car. Nor is it, possibly, the duty of the police to look into these platform robberies. Probably it is every man and woman's duty to be his, or her, own protector. The only trouble about this is that some are unable to protect themselves, and that every thief who escapes detection becomes a recruiting agent for his corps of street robbers. We would mildly suggest, at the hands of the companies, or the police, or both, some consideration of the subject.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ROBBERIES ON THE CITY RAILROAD CARS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ROBBERIES ON THE CITY RAILROAD CARS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c21ddc4-ce9a-5c5b-9e34-81d6a63c3df8,378,nyt://article/9c21ddc4-ce9a-5c5b-9e34-81d6a63c3df8

Photographs of interiors usually have one of two faults -- they are either too indefinite and obscure in general, or. some part is brought out strong and clear, while the rest of the picture is entirely lost. Mr. GUTEKUNST has published a view of the interior of the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, in which both extremes are very skillfully avoided. His portraits are equally admirable. Nothing better than his large portraits of American Generals has been done, either in Europe or America, and his carles de visite are exquisitely fine, and are finished with great delicacy.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Photographic Notes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Photographic Notes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b417c8ca-4d5e-5338-9781-77cda0ab6e52,285,nyt://article/b417c8ca-4d5e-5338-9781-77cda0ab6e52

But in the hands of the printer, the abbreviation ""Coll"" became transmuted into ""Col'd,"" otherwise ""African,"" or ""freedman.""

Here in New-York we should be disposed to doubt whether anybody would care very much whether a collector was white or ""col'd,"" so long as he was honest and active. Therefore we should hesitate in deciding whether the plaintiff was actually a sufferer in public opinion to the tune of $5,000. Supposing, however, that some gentleman or some Freedmen's Association of the ""col'd"" race should bring an action against the publishers of the Directory for having done them wrong by giving the present plaintiff undue prestige in their description of his origin -- what then?

Dickens; Our Mutual Friend--Second Notice,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/14/archives/literary-charles-dickens-last-novel-our-mutual-friend-by-charles.html,Dickens; Our Mutual Friend--Second Notice,"Fresh from the consecutive perusal of this somewhat complicated, but remarkably vivid and characteristic tale, and on the edge of Christmas, whose cheery kindliness and holy trust its author has embodied and embalmed wherever the English language is spoken -- we are not disposed for a rigid performance of the critic's task, but rather inclined to express the grateful surprise with which we recognize in our and the public's Mutual Friend, such striking evidences of unimpaired vigor, ingenuity, buoyant humor and genial sentiment. In deference to the strict canons of artistic law in fiction, we cannot, indeed, but confess the improbabilities as a story, the extravagance as a satire, and the grotesqueness in style, of certain elements in the plot and details of the execution; they are too obvious for indication; but when the story is read, not in fragments as it appeared, but continuously as a whole, these perversities become sensibly diminished, and the tree, graphic, original features of the work in a great measure harmonize what is apparently incongruous. As a verbal artist DICKENS herein exhibits often all his own peculiar grace and picturesqueness; the interior and the landscape are not seldom of Flemish accuracy; many of the scenes are richly dramatic, and some of the characters veritable additions to his own unrivaled gallery. Jenny Wren is a consistent and fresh, creation, admirably suggestive of the compensatory influence, so often seen in real life, of wit and temperament in atoning for physical defect. Wegg and Venus are curious instances of the effect of coarse conceit and ""a little learning;"" and the former a remarkable embodiment of vulgar selfishness worked out with skill; R.W. is well drawn -- another of the author's inimitable incarnations of triumphant good nature; his wife is, indeed, an exaggeration, but, as such, gives dramatic significance to the domestic dialogue. At a superficial estimate, the colloquies of Wrayburn and his friend, may seem quite unnatural; but whoever has known young university-men in England, with a competence and no ambition, and heard their lazy confabulation among themselves, will find a basis at least for this kind of talk, in real life. Lammle is too intensely vulgar an adventurer, and the virtues of Lizzie Hexam seem miraculous, considering her birth and breeding. Very broad and coarse is the caricature of ""society;"" but whoever has gone home from a London conventional dinner-party given by an egotistic materialist, and thought of its social barrenness and its wearisome and utter artificiality as regards both intercourse and routine, has perchance put his hand to his aching head like Twemlow, and wondered in his soul at the fatuity of the exhibition. The Veneering episode is a caricature; but how otherwise can the truth involved therein be impressed on the obtuse English mind? Such rough and rude pictures of a certain class of men and a certain phase of life are, doubtless, repulsive to the Tory mind; but, objectionable as they are in an artistic view, we doubt if more refined and strictly accurate delineations would make the perversities of social life, now and there, palpable and patent. As usual, the children of the story are genuine; poor little Johnny and the ""inextinguishable baby"" are worthy of the wonderful nursery CHARLES DICKENS has peopled. Had he, at the outset, made Boffin -- besides having a good soul -- a natural actor, his transformation would be more plausible; as it is, so far as the story goes, it is a bold stroke of narrative art, and has all the zest of surprise. But, after all, and above all, the spirit of the tale, its entire impression, its human significance, are alive with the author's peculiar genius. To open the eyes of a spirited and, a heart, affectionate girl, to the moral deformity of avarice, by a near and dear example, is a thought and a purpose which cannot be too highly praised; and it is carried out most effectively however improbably. Indeed, the old problem which, in so many forms, this prolific writer has genially solved -- the antagonism between Self and Soul, and the moral and human necessity of the latter's triumph -- is here freshly and forcibly often delectably, and with infinite relish and humor, made manifest.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LITERARY.; CHARLES DICKEN'S LAST NOVEL.

If the ""patient endurance"" with which we bear in every street and on every crossing the infliction of mud and ashes and garbage of every color and consistence is evidence of our possession of the divine attribute, then by all means let us be deified and dirty. But we do think, as thought the brave Bostonians when they threw British tea and tax into Boston Bay, that there is a limit beyond which patience ceases to be a virtue, and we think on the matter of dirty streets and public nuisances generally the public has been placed without that limit long ago. Still the streets grow dirtier. Thoroughfares grow more and more impeded by individual license. Ash-boxes encumber sidewalks in the most prominent down-town streets for days and days together. The debris after repairs of buildings lies for weeks upon the footpath, choking up the gutter; garbage lies in heaps rotting in the alternate rain and sunshine; sidewalks are encumbered by barrels and boxes in almost every street; carts are backed up on the foot-path, till passengers have either to climb over a plank, down which a box is about to slide or a barrel to roll, at the risk of having a leg broken, or to wade out in the street and mud, with a vague hope of not being run over by another cursing carter; posters are stuck with impunity on our public buildings, on the railings of our park, on the very coping of the sidewalks, till the whole downtown city looks like some rickety old machine endeavoring to dispose of itself by a copious advertisement.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR CITY NUISANCES.; Dirty Streets, Obstructed Side walks and Disfigured Buildings.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR CITY NUISANCES.; Dirty Streets, Obstructed Side walks and Disfigured Buildings.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/446a65f0-a852-576d-b3ee-8c581656702d,708,nyt://article/446a65f0-a852-576d-b3ee-8c581656702d

It is intended to be a general acknowledgment of the many addresses of condolence which were forwarded from Great Britain to President JOHNSON on the occasion of the assassination of Mr. LINCOLN. The document shows a cordial and hearty appreciation of the good feeling which dictated the addresses. In the Court of Queen's Bench, on the 1st, Capt. COR[???]TZ, charged with enlisting men for service on board the Shenandoah, &c., was acquitted by the jury. Mr. BRIGHT had been making a great political speech at Blackburn. He was very severe upon the Tory party, and looked hopefully to Earl RUSSELL for a measure of Parliamentary Reform. He bitterly denounced Gov. EYRE of Jamaica. STEPHENS, the Fenian Head Centre, was still at large. One of his fellow conspirators has been convicted and sentenced to twenty years penal servitude. The text of the circular of the Spanish Minister for foreign affairs on the Chilian question is published. It is a lengthy document and tends to justify the position of Spain. The operations against Chilian ports are not to be suspended, as heretofore announced, and the war is to continue.

We need scarcely remind our readers that the occasion is one of painful and peculiar interest. Mr. WALLACE was an American citizen. The best years of a fruitful life were passed in our midst, and to the last ho was loyal and true to the home of his adoption. Of a frank and genial nature it was his good fortune to win and retain many friendships. Few professional men have been regretted more universally. The sincerity of a mournful multitude will, we are sure, be manifested tonight, when the last offices of friendship are to be paid to the memory of the departed. In no better way can it be done than in thus contributing to the welfare of those loved ones who are yet weeping for a husband and a father. A long illness -- so long that its duration must be counted in years -- deprived Mr. WALLACE of the ripening harvest of his fame. He died in poor circumstances, yet holding commissions for operas which, had his life been spared, would have brought him competence. Two of his best known works, ""Lurline"" and the ""Amber Witch,"" were eagerly sought for in Germany and France, but, in the expectation of improved health, and desiring to superintend their production in those countries, Mr. WALLACE withheld his permission for their performance, and so deprived himself of an important source of income.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73103902-f17d-5521-8411-02b2efa0d1f1,953,nyt://article/73103902-f17d-5521-8411-02b2efa0d1f1

ROBERTS, ""has great faith in bullets,"" and Col. ROBERTS is of the ""veteran soldier's"" way of thinking. The new President, however, is not an ambitious man. He is prepared to resign his office at any moment in favor of a distinguished patriot expected to arrive from Ireland by express.

They have not, however, lost hope; for they believe that a mediator, in the person of JAMES STEPHENS, is near American shores, and that on his arrival all differences may be healed, by the summary decapitation of the rival American Presidents of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and the prompt surrender of the management to STEPHENS, the Head-Centre of the organization. This is the course which the Senate will recommend as the best that can be pursued, and it is believed that not one of the nine hundred local circles will interpose an objection. Members of the Brotherhood are anxiously awaiting the arrival of STEPHENS, and the entire body within the department of Manhattan are prepared at a moment's notice to give him a public welcome.

Queen Victoria's Promised Reappearance in Public,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/14/archives/the-british-queen-and-her-subjects.html,Queen Victoria's Promised Reappearance in Public,"-A uninteresting feature of the British news this morning is the announcement that Her Majesty, Queen VICTORIA, will formally emerge from her seclusion on the occasion of the opening of the new Parliament next month. Of course there are loud and hearty congratulations among the journalists. The London shopkeeping interest will be beside itself with joy. To that interest has been due much of the incessant clamor which the more loud-7mouthed section of the British press has kept up for the reappearance of the Sovereign in persons on great State occasions. No other interest suffered half as much from the decay into which court ceremonials and festivities have fallen of late years. No great political or official duty proper, appertaining to her position, was neglected by the Queen. She gave even more of her time and attention to the dispatches and appointments submitted by her Ministers for her approval than during the lifetime of her husband. She received the ministers of Foreign States, and occasionally, besides her own ministers, the representative and distinguished men of the nation -- both in Church and State. She has seen to it that her children have grown up to be a credit, instead of a disgrace, to her people, as the Princes of a former generation were. And she has, on more than one occasion, kept down a belligerent party that would have involved England in war with other States. But while doing all this she has wofully disappointed the cockney retailers of gewgaws, and hence the ill-concealed growlings of the shopkeepers. The opening week of Parliament will be a great time for the West End tradesman.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BRITISH QUEEN AND HER SUBJECTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BRITISH QUEEN AND HER SUBJECTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aaaa18fa-c69b-5f5c-8bee-430022348d8d,273,nyt://article/aaaa18fa-c69b-5f5c-8bee-430022348d8d

"Securities, Increased Demand for",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/14/archives/increased-activity-in-government-securi-ties.html,"Securities, Increased Demand for","An unusually active demand prevailed in the street yesterday for all classes of government securities, partly for home investment, but also, to a large extent, on foreign account. The advices by the City of Boston and Java indicated a steady appreciation of United States stocks in the London market, on a rapidly reviving business. The foreign mails brought hither, it is understood, liberal orders, chiefly for the favorite Five-Twenties of 1862, and the Six per cent. gold-bearing bonds of 1881, in each of which there was a marked improvement toward the close of business hours yesterday; the final quotations having been for the first issue of Five-Twenties, 104 as against 102 3/4 on Tuesday; and for the Sixes of 1881, 108, as against 107 5/8 the preceding evening. Seven-Thirties, of all three series, were also decidedly more sought after and were firmer, closing as follows: First series, 97 3/4@98; second series at 97 [???]@ 97 8/5; third series, 97 1/4@97 1/2. Ten-Forties left off buoyantly at 91 1/2@91 3/4. Supplies of all the national bonds and notes were moderate. Confidence in the public funds has been vastly strengthened in the home market by the eminently conservative message of President JOHNSON, and the admirable financial exhibit of Secretary MCCULLOCH; which, moreover, cannot fail to promote the national credit abroad, and lead to further heavy investments of foreign capital in our securities.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INCREASED ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT SECURI; TIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INCREASED ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT SECURI; TIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c592d0dd-10ae-5f53-89bc-e0ab92d9de89,230,nyt://article/c592d0dd-10ae-5f53-89bc-e0ab92d9de89

It has sometimes been our happiness to agree with him. When he undertook to put down his foot on the stupendous job of printing a special illustrated history of the part taken by certain members of the Common Council in the obsequies of the late President, it was our felicity to congratulate his Honor upon an honest and manly act. In a minor matter of outlay -- but one of the same sort of rapacious plundering -- Mr. GUNTHER has again put his veto upon a resolution of the Board of Supervisors, authorizing the payment of a sum of fifteen hundred dollars for printing and distributing a certain number of copies of the ""new Election Law."" It appears that the distributing was done by the police without any charge, and that the printing was worth -- at most -- about $250. Most citizens who have to work for a living will doubtless agree with the Mayor that a charge at the rate of six times the current prices is altogether too high a percentage even on accounts against the city in these times. A certain amount of profit might be winked at -- say two or three hundred per cent. But it is possible, as we see, to carry this sort of business to a point where endurance ceases to be a virtue.

Standing Armies in Europe and America,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/15/archives/standing-armies-soldiers-in-europe-and-america.html,Standing Armies in Europe and America,"The European journals do not cease to express their astonishment at the reduction of our armies, which has been in progress for the last half year, and which has not yet ceased. It is a spectacle so novel to them and so unexpected -- it is a thing the like of which is so impossible of accomplishment by any one of them, that they discuss it with a greater interest than they gave to the creation and growth of our army or its achievements during the war. The great armies of the six chief Powers of Europe, (including Italy,) and the proportionally large armies of the minor Powers, are permanent parts of their being, and fundamental elements of their existence. Not one of them could be dissolved as ours has been, without a dissolution of the State. In such of these countries there are mighty musses of revolutionists -- not, perhaps, democratic, or of any style of politics -- but degraded, wretched, blind, uneasy masses, masses upon instinct of the existing order of things -- dark and grim masses such as were vomited up from the subterranean regions of Paris during the first French Revolution and of which CARLYLE given such vivid and terrible descriptions. These vast masses of savagery are permanent parts of every European nation. Centuries pass away, and they change not. Science advances, education extends, reforms are inaugurated, government and institutions are modified or abolished, but the mudsills of European society remain mudsills forever.

Exposition; Debate at New-York Polytechnic Institute,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/15/archives/the-french-exposition-debate-on-the-subject-at-the-polytechnic.html,Exposition; Debate at New-York Polytechnic Institute,"At the regular meeting last evening of the Polytechnic Institute, hold at the Copper Institute, the interesting topic of the proposed French Exposition in 1867 came up for discussion. Prof. J.A. JOY, of Columbia College, opened the debate, by calling the attention of those present to the great importance and necessity that the United States should be properly represented at the exposition. He said it would be necessary to send specimens of our native ores, both known and unknown, in order to show to the world through the exposition our boundless wealth in minerals. We ought to send ores because we had many that were already known to be valuable, and many whose true value was still unknown to us. In giving a brief outline of the aim and scope of the proposed movement to have the United States adequately represented at this most important exhibition. Prof. JOY said that it was intended to have a Commissioner for each State, who would forward contributions to the United States Commissioner at New-York. The duty of the government agent would be to see that none but the very best specimens were selected. With such specimens should be forwarded statements of the territory, price of land, &c. In the mechanical arts steps ought to be taken at once to secure a proper representation of our leading inventions, especially in the article of tools. The French nation have learned the benefit gained from profuse exhibition of the products and specifies of the country. One of the benefits to be derived by the United States from a proper representation would be the increase of emigration, while another would be the extension of our export trade. The preparations for the expedition were on the most gigantic scale, and the French Government propose to spend several millions for the proper carrying out of the enterprise.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FRENCH EXPOSITION.; Debate on the Subject at the Polytechnic Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FRENCH EXPOSITION.; Debate on the Subject at the Polytechnic Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36fab58e-77d2-5770-9e13-5d18d23337bf,664,nyt://article/36fab58e-77d2-5770-9e13-5d18d23337bf

On the platform were Rev. Fathers MOONEY, HASSAN, MCGEE, CONWAY, MCSWEENEY, O'REILLY, MERRICK, MAHER, FARRELL, O'HARE, and other prelates. Mr. O'GORMAN entered the ball accompanied by very reverend Father STAR[???]S, Vicar-General, and the distinguished gentlemen were received with rounds of hearty applause. Thanking his audience for the reception. Mr. O'GORMAN drew a gorgeous picture of Winter in the palatial homes in Madison-square, and presented in fearful contrast the noisome hovels of the Five Points and along the river sides. These latter the sanitary commissions might cleanse of visible impurities; but there was one contagion which no commission could subdue, namely, the contagion of c[???]e. The lecturer believed that a more extensive system of out-door relief was needed in New-York, and that it would be easier and safer to help the poor in their own homes than in asylums, where their individuality and self-respect were lost evermore and he incidentally condemned the justice of educating children in this city and sending them to the West when they reached the age of action and usefulness, since its sole result was to impoverish the city of its best intellect. It was Winter in the city; it was Winter, dreary, bitter Winter in the institution in whose behalf the vast audience had gathered. There were in the Home of the Good Shepherd four hundred and fifty girls who sadly needed aid, and the self-sacrificing women who had gathered these girls together, the speaker trusted, would not be permitted in vain to appeal to the generous inhabitants of New-York. The lecture, which was brief and happy, was embellished by charming extracts from Christmas poetry, and the eloquent lecturer was frequently applauded with emphasis.

Policeman, Trial of John Ward","John Ward, having been indicted for the murder of Policeman Thomas Walker on the morning of the 16th of August last, was brought to trial on Thursday. Mr. Charles S. Spencer appeared to defend the accused, and District-Attorney A. Oakey Hall opened the case for the people in person. The District-Attorney detailed the circumstances under which the murder was committed, showing that a number of the Sixteenth Ward banditti had committed an assault upon an inebriated female in a cooper's shop in West Seventeenth-street, and that the shrieks of their victim called Policeman Walker to the spot; that the officer strove to aid the female, and that as he was about to enter the door of the cooper's shop a fellow dashed out and was seized, when a shot from within the building struck Policeman Walker to the sidewalk, mortally wounded. Immediately after this shot, said the District-Attorney, another man -- the only male person that was inside the shop -- leaped from the door and fled, but was soon captured by Policeman O'Rourke; and this person was the prisoner at the bar. Mr. Hall said that to facilitate the trial he had caused photographs to be made of the scene of the murder, taken from various standpoints, and no objection being made, the pictures were admitted. The testimony of Officer Arthur O'Rourke, Policeman Walker's side partner on the morning of the murder, fastens the crime upon the accused if it can be shown that there was not a third ruffian in the cooper shop when the fatal shot was fired. The counsel for the defence, who will open on Monday, will probably dwell upon this question of the number of persons who were or might have been in the building at the time of the murder.

Promissory Note Case,"Edgar St. John vs. Timothy Daly. -- This was an action brought on three promissory notes, each dated Sept. 20, 1860, and payable at long dates for $300 each. The whole claim being $1,133. The defence set up was fraudulent representations made by the plaintiff to the defendant on the sale of a livery-stable and its contents in Seventy-first-street, in this city, for which these notes were given. The affirmative of the issue was given to the defendant's counsel, D. McMahon, Esq., who opened and closed the argument. From his opening and the evidence introduced on the part of the defendant it appeared that the plaintiff in September, 1860, owned a livery-stable in Seventy-first-street, in this city, near the Central Park. He proposed to sell it to the defendant. The price of the stock and contents of the stable was to be fixed according to a price fixed by arbitration. This was done, and they were fixed at $2,800; the lease and buildings were called $300. The good will, the plaintiff insisted, was worth $1,100, and, as a basis for that value, he said the average business carried on there was $25 per day gross receipts, of which one-half were profits. The defendant then asked him why he sold out such a profitable business. His answer was, that he had a contract with a man in Canada for the sale of horses, in which he was to get $1,200 a year and the privilege of doing his own business. This he considered more profitable, than carrying on the livery business. On the faith of these representations the defendant, bought out the stock in trade for $2,800, the lease for $300, and the good will for $1,100. In payment of which he gave plaintiff a lot in Eightieth-street, valued at $1,500, and nine promissory notes, $300 each. The defendant paid six of these notes, and the suit was brought on the seventh, eighth and ninth of those notes, on the first of which some payments had been made, so that the whole amount due was as before stated.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fraud as a Defence to Promissory Notes--The Question Discussed.; COURT OF COMMON PLEAS DEC. 15.

S[???]E[???]KS' precinct. Mr. DORHMANN leased his store to the Police Commissioners, to be used as one of the polling-places in the Thirteenth Precinct, and on the night of the Charter election a gang of ruffians, who are alleged to have been led by JOHN BURKE and PATRICK BRENNAN, burst the doors, shut off the gas, and destroyed the glass ballot-boxes and certain articles Mr. DORHMANN's stock and furniture. Mr. DORHMANN imagining it to be the duty of the Metropolitan Police to repair his shop. was advised to enter an affidavit against the policeman who was on duty at the polls, and show, if he could, that the loss which he had suffered was properly chargeable to the police. Hence the charge against Patrolman CALLERY, on of the eldest and best officers of the force. It appears that Messrs. ELY and MCKNIGHT were supposed to be running close for a seat in the Board of Alderman, and that somebody employed JOHN BURKE and his gang to storm the polls and destroy Mr. Ely's ballots; that BURKE, at the head of his political banditti. entered the polling-place and charged that the canvassers had defrauded Mr. MCKNIGHT of his just vote; that the banditti, having been thrust out, broke down the door, and, swearing that Mr. ELY should not have vote, but that it should be given to their favorite. they, appointed a committee to count the ballots, and on being told that the could not have access to the votes, they shut off the gas, the ballot-boxes, and were guilty of other outrages; but, happily, they were too late at the polls -- for the vote for Alderman had been officially counted and recorded, and the upshot of their exploit was merely to drive the canvassers to the Delen[???]ey-street Police-station to count the residue of the votes, and to render themselves liable to incarceration in State Prison for participation in a riot. It was shown that the outlaws observed the precaution to seized the officer's baton before they made the attack, thus leaving him single-handed and unarmed. but that on the Wednesday following the election. Burke and BRENNAN were arrested and put under $2,000 bail each to appear for trail at the Court of Special Sessions. BURKE fled and forfeited bail. BRENNAN. however, stood trial, and was required by Justices KELLY and DOWLING to pay $50 fine, President ACTION, in dismissing the complaint against Officer CALLERY, remarked that it is not encouraging to policemen to see rioters released from restraint by the payment of a paltry fine, in lieu of imprisonment which they richly deserve; and Commissioner MCMURRAY, coinciding, added that it is precisely what we may expect, so long as our Judiciary is elective.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE METROPOLITAN POLICE MACHINE.; The Thirteenth Precinct Election RiotCapt.

He was told that the price of the ticket was $250, which sum he paid and took a ticket. Soon afterward the open board of brokers passed a resolution prohibiting certain persons, and hence the up-town or Evening Board became almost deserted. The testimony in the case showed that for eight or ten nights after the passage of the resolution the rooms of the up-town board were lighted as usual, that the doors were open. None of the members of this board entered the rooms, though it seems they occasionally entered the hall. The plaintiff felt aggrieved at this state of things, and when he met the defendant, a few days afterward, he demanded a return of his $250.

"The Memphis Argus of Dec. 2 describes some interesting dwarf human skeletons recently found in Tennessee: ""Gen. MILROY, who has been spending much time in Smith County, in attending to some mining and oil operations, informs the Nashville Press & Times that while at Watertown a few days since, he saw some remarkable graves, which had been disclosed by the washing of a small creek in its passage through a low bottom. The graves were from eighteen inches to two feet in length, most of them of the smallest size, and were formed by an excavation about fifteen inches beneath the surface, in which were placed four undressed slabs of rock, one in the bottom of the pit, one on each side and one on top. Human skeletons, some with nearly an entire skull, and many with well-defined bones, were found in them. The teeth were very diminutive, but evidently those of an adult. Earthen crocks were found also with skeletons. Gen. MILROY could find out nothing respecting these lilliputian graves in conversation with the oldest inhabitants of the vicinity, except that there was a large number of similar graves, perhaps thousands, near Statesville, in the same county, and also a like burial ground the mouth of Stone's River, near this city. They were examined about thirty years ago, and exerted a good deal or comment. Those diminutive human skeletons seem to have belonged to an extinct pigmy race.

The ordinary way in which the thing was done was this: the journalist received a long letter from Lord PALMERSTON, commencing ex. gr., something like this: ""My dear _____, The course which the Austrian Ministry has adopted in regard to the Hungarian nobles and their political rights is one which, however it may accord with the policy of the House of Hapsburg, it may not be possible for her Majesty's Government to overlook,"" &c., &c., and ending, ""Yours very truly, PALMERSTON.""

"ROBERT H.

We receive almost daily some new appeal, with urgent request to give it voice in the TIMES. Most of them come from names quite unknown to us, and all bear the same burden -- the pressing necessity of aid for the freedmen and poor whites of the South. Except where we have reason to believe the authors sincere, we are compelled to give these appeals to the chip-basket. There is one great organization -- the Freedmen's Bureau, under the control of Gen. HOWARD -- and another, the Freedman's Aid Association. It would be well for every zealous friend of the main object to work through these channels only; for if we are to have every itinerant exhorter and pedagogue appealing to us for special aid in his special district, with little or no assurance for the proper use of the money, the result will be a general distrust of the whole business, and a serious reduction of the resources of the responsible bodies above referred to.

"PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY. The second concert of the present season took place on Saturday evening, at the Academy of Music, and the attendance, was are glad to say, exhibited a marked improvement on that of the first concert.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/18/archives/amusements.html,,"PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY. -- The second concert of the present season took place on Saturday evening, at the Academy of Music, and the attendance, was are glad to say, exhibited a marked improvement on that of the first concert. This was attributrble, we believe, to the eclectic character of the programme. There was a little of everything, and everything, happily, was of the best. BEETHOVEN's Eighth Symphony, with its popular scherzando and minuetto, has never been played better. Indeed, the excellence of the orchestra throughout the entire concert was surprising. Even MENDELLSOHN's music to the ""Midsummer Night's Dream,"" with its delicate flutterings of fancy and filmy texture of harmony, was rendered clearly. We are sure that the revival of this music has added considerably to the subscription list of the society. Its performance was certainly all that could be desired. Mr. BERGMANN is one of the few conductors who know the difference between what is quaint and that which is merely grotesque -- a difference which was not apprehended by the writer of the silly stuff which was published on the back of the programme, descriptive of this music. The scribbler of this delectable bosh likens the overture to ""the trunk of a majestic tree, from which twigs and branches spread in every direction!"" He says also, with admirable German frankness, ""that it cannot be denied that just such music as occurs in the drama was wanting to make the idea complete"" -- meaning SHAKESPEARE's idea.

Manufactures in the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/18/archives/manufactures-in-the-south.html,Manufactures in the South,"The South never manufactured its own principal staple. Georgia did something, both before the war and during it, in the way of manufacturing coarse cotton cloths; but the quantity of cotton used in this, as compared with the product of the State, was very small. South Carolina never did anything, we may almost say. Large amounts of money have been raised, and tremendous efforts made, during the last twenty years, to establish factories at or near Charleston and Columbia. The buildings were erected, and operatives even were imported from New-England; but at neither of these places could the experiment be made anything approaching a success; and SHERMAN's army swept away the last vestige of the ""Saluda Cotton Factory"" in its march across South Carolina. In the great planting States of the Gulf, there never was any manufacturing worthy of mention. A well known story in the South is that of the planter near the Savannah River, who hauled his cotton by team from his plantation to the river, down which it was sent to Savannah on a boat, from which in time it was sent by steamship to New-York, whence it was transported by railroad to some town in the interior of New-England, where it was manufactured into cloth, after which it was returned by railroad to New-York, shipped back again to Savannah, carried up the river, and then hauled by team to the plantation from whence it originally came, where it was finally used as shirting for the negroes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Manufactures in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Manufactures in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/70292618-7580-51b2-b63d-8f6bc23fe194,689,nyt://article/70292618-7580-51b2-b63d-8f6bc23fe194

Holiday Books,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/18/archives/the-holiday-season-christmas-its-literacy-aspect-in-newyork.html,Holiday Books,"It needs but a walk through our Metropolitad bookstores at this season of the year -- the holy-tide of Advent, among Episcopalians, precursor of the great social and occlesiastical festival of Christmas -- to prove the onduring vitality of old associations when they are connected and intertwined with the exercise of the kindly charities of life, the promotion of good feeling toward each and all, the oblivion of former strifes and quarrels, and the recognition of the great truths announced in the ""voice from heaven"" that proclaimed ""Peace on earth, good will toward men."" No longer the mark of a sectional religion opposed or defended with polemic zeal, Christmas Day has made good its claims to be the great holiday of the Anglo-Saxon race -- acknowledged a day when Prelatist and Puritan alike give themselves up to the benevolent influences that hover around it, and consecrate, as a great Sabbath of humanity, the anniversary whose sacred remembrances can most nearly be brought home to every heart, by following out, as best we may, the example of Him who ""went about doing good."" Among the articles dedicated by immemorial usage to the purpose of expressing affection, awakening interest, and evincing gratitude as Christmas presents, BOOKS have always hold a prominent place. The barbaric glitter of gems and gold may exercise a superior fascination for uncultivated minds, but a book is a thing apart -- fashioned for diviner uses -- the medium for a more sympathetic communion between the giver and the receiver; in a word, not a dead creature but a thing of life, that often conveys, more expressively than his faltering accents could, the cherished purpose of the donor, ""what most he wishes yet fears to say."" In the vast supplies of illustrated and embellished literature tricked out in holiday garb that our bookstores now exhibit in glittering array, every taste may be gratified, and every shade of feeling expressed by those who would nicely graduate their gifts. A hasty glance at some of the leading specialties of the most prominent establishments is all that our space will allow. Besides the books mentioned below, in connection with the houses from which they emanate as publishers, it must be borne in mind that there is an immense substratum of choicely-assorted books, common to each store, and that the purchaser can hardly go astray who, with the means in hand, seeks to gratify his own taste while giving pleasure to others.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HOLIDAY SEASON.; CHRISTMAS.

Unreasonable Complainings,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/18/archives/unreasonable-complainings.html,Unreasonable Complainings,"-- Mr. HECKER's Special organist complains that that gentleman, after spending $35,000 on the Mozart and Citizens' machines, only received about oneninth of the votes cast in the late charter election. This complaint is altogether unreasonable. Mr. HECKER used the very weakest sort of instruments that his own, or any other party could supply. He paid them, no doubt, liberally, as his organist admits, but they only served to damn him. The simple announcement of Mr. ROBERTS' name through the columns of The TIMES brought to that gentleman's support more than three times the number of votes that Mr. HECKER found it possible or convenient to purchase. Nothing can show more clearly the utter futility of candidates for public honors wasting their means in buying up purchasable journals as agencies for influencing public opinion. The people seem to know by instinct when an aspirant is engaged in the enterprise of ""raising"" popular sentiment at so much per vertical yard. There is an intuitive sense which guides the honest voter in all such cases. And Mr. HECKER must have come out of the late contest a wiser, if not a happier man. He will know, hereafter, if he is not entirely stolid, that the ""happy family"" arrangement, with its posters and its organ-grinding, is properly the showman's business, and that an expenditure of thirty-five thousand dollars, or ten times that amount, in laying siege to public opinion, gives a profitable return only when minors and the large non-voting class are to be operated on.

the New Legend of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/18/archives/the-new-legend-on-our-coins.html,the New Legend of,"-- In compliance with an act of Congress the Director of the Mint has caused the legend ""In God we Trust"" to be engraved in the dies of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle, dollar, half and quarter dollars, and has had specimens in copper of all these made for the inspection of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Director has made these words subjective to the old mottoes, ""E Pluribus Unum,"" ""United States of America,"" &c., which, by right of priority, he thinks, must naturally overshadow our trust in a Supreme Being; while for the smaller coins he rejects the Trust in God altogether, because there is no room for it. This marked slight of the nickels does not speak well for the Mint's reverence; for when, Mr. Director, do you suppose the masses of the people will see your ""In God we Trust"" if you confine it to gold and large silver. This new legend may be well enough; but is it quite in place, on the commonest and basest of all human manufactures -- the filthy lucre that serves the meanest of our needs? In view of our recent struggle for national life, does it not sound somewhat like a death-bed repentance? Does it not remind one of the significant words of the MASTER, whose estimate of this common medium was expressed in the words: ""Whose image and superscription is this?"" Without questioning the good motives that led to the enactment of this new form of national worship, we respectfully submit that such tract-printing by the government is always improper, and, just now especially, ill-timed. It reminds one unpleasantly of the ""Dei gratia' of the divine-right schools of Europe.

The initial experiments were identically those which the DAVENPORTS made here last Summer, and which they have repeated in the capitals of Europe. Messrs. GILBERT, of No. 293 West Nineteenth-street, and BATTIN, of Newark, N.J., were the committee whom the audience appointed to represent them on the stage, and Mrs. FAY, wife of the ""medium"" aided the committee in their duties. The ""spiritual manifestations"" occupied an hour and a quarter, and were, in every particular, as marvelous as any spook might desire. The expose was commenced at 9:20, and at the beginning Mr. FAY counseled the spectators if in anybody's darkend parlor, they should undertake to repeat his trick, to keep a sharp lookout for matches, as some person might strike a light. He then tied himself by a peculiar twist of the hand, and sat before the house apparently securely fastened at 9:22. Then, dexterously untwisting the rope, he freed his hands and performed on drum, trumpet and fiddle. Next the flour test was exposed. Mr. FAY was tied and flour was placed in his hands. He quietly again untwisted the peculiar knot, tossed the flour from the right hand, drew a white handkerchief from his pantaloons pocket, wiped the hand, and exhibited it clean at the window; then, tossing the rope aside altogether, he took one-half of the flour from the left hand, and, of course, had flour in both hands. After exposing others of the DAVENPORTS' deceptions, Mr. FAY informed his hearers that he entered the jugglery business under the DAVENPORTS with the design of probing mechanical and electrical ""spiritual"" manifestations to the bottom, and that, having done this, he now proposed to unravel the mysteries before the public.

The facts are these: Some months since, as Collector of Internal Revenue in the Second District, Col. WOOD seized this whisky, since which it has remained in storage. Pending the settlement of the difficulty between the parties and the government, it was agreed that the whisky should be sold and the money put into bank. At the auction Col.

Brainerd's History of Formation,"Mr. CEPHAS BRAINERD read a paper before the Young Men's Christian Association last evening on ""The Work of the Army Committee of the Association which led to the formation of the United States Christian Commission."" Mr. BRAINERD stated that the idea of forming an army committee first suggested itself in May, 1861, when a meeting was held at the house of Rev. Dr. TYNG, Jr., and Messrs. NASH, BALLARD, TYNG and VERNON were appointed as such committee. To these were subsequently added Col. VINCENT COLYER and others. The idea was to visit the soldiers passing through the city, talk with them on religious matters, distribute tracts and religious books among them, and provide the regiments with chaplains, if possible. Further, it was determined to visit all camps within a radius of thirty miles of the city, and hold religious services there, and for this purpose the cooperation of able clergymen was obtained. After the terrible battle of Bull Run Col. COLYER and Mr. BALLARD went on to Washington and did much good in visiting the hospitals, supplying reading matter for the sick soldiers, writing letters for them, and answering the inquiries of their friends. Gen. SCOTT gave Col. COLYER a pass entitling him to go through the lines of the Union army wherever he pleased. Col. COLYER soon saw that the wants of the soldiers were far greater than the committee could possibly attend to; and he therefore came on North, and stopping in Philadelphia, urged the necessity of calling a general convention for the formation of a society capable of ministering to the wants of the army. After much labor, a convention was called, and finally the United States Christian Commission was formed, of whose works Mr. BRAINERD said he need hardly speak, as they were known to all. It had been the intention of the association to cooperate with the commission, but certain circumstances led to the adoption of a different plan and the connection was severed.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Formation of the United States Christian Commission.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Formation of the United States Christian Commission.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0b1b75cd-b6d3-5ba8-902e-bb60a4730af3,348,nyt://article/0b1b75cd-b6d3-5ba8-902e-bb60a4730af3

"An adjourned meeting of colored men and women was held, last evening, in the vestry of Shiloh Church. The Rev. GEORGE W.

This resolution was, by request of Prof. C.L. REASON, withdrawn.

He had come to New-York to educate himself and accumulated a small property, so that no rebel should ever be able to make political capital by pointing to him as a melancholy example of the wrong which the Republican had done black men by taking them from under the paternal care of their late guardians.

At the meeting on the 11th inst., a resolution was introduced and tabled, proposing that the Finance Committee be empowered to use for the support of Mr. DOUGLASS, as a delegate in Washington, a fund which the colored men and women of New-York contributed last Spring, for the erection of a monument to the memory of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. This resolution was, by request of Prof. C.L. REASON, withdrawn. A witty ex-slave from Richmond, who had been guilty of grand larceny in stealing a quite respectable education while he was in Washington with his master, addressed the audienced, and was uproariously applauded. He had come to New-York to educate himself and accumulated a small property, so that no rebel should ever be able to make political capital by pointing to him as a melancholy example of the wrong which the Republican had done black men by taking them from under the paternal care of their late guardians. Mr. VAN VLIET, also from Richmond, addressed the assembly counseling them to push forward this measure the most dignified and important that the colored men of America had ever conceived.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Meeting of Colored Men.; MR.

Latest Phase of Commission on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/19/archives/the-latest-phase-of-the-jamaica-question.html,Latest Phase of Commission on,"-- By the European news to-day it appears that Lord RUSSELL's Government have been compelled to take up the case of the Jamaica rioters, and to call an inquest into the conduct of the Colonial authorities. When the Canadian rebellion was crushed in 1838, the Liberal party in England was strong enough to get a High Commissioner appointed to inquire into the grievances of the insurgents. Lord DURHAM undertook that task, and the issue was the overthrow, after a few years, of the local oligarchy. In the matter of the Jamaica troubles, it is said Mr. CARDWELL contemplates the appointment of three Commissioners -- one of whom is to be Sir EDMUND HEAD, late Governor of Canada. The issue will doubtless be to change the entire system of government in the island. Lord RUSSELL is so largely dependent on the nonconformist vote both in and out of the House of Commons, that it is easy to understand how he has been made to feel the pressure of the prevailing opinion in religious circles as to the needlessness of the retributive acts sanctioned by Gov. EYRE.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATEST PHASE OF THE JAMAICA QUESTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LATEST PHASE OF THE JAMAICA QUESTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Jamaica', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2e08f56d-227c-5a73-a6f1-db75c330894a,185,nyt://article/2e08f56d-227c-5a73-a6f1-db75c330894a
Unworthy Evasion of Freedmen Question by Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/19/archives/north-carolina-unworthy-evasion.html,Unworthy Evasion of Freedmen Question by Legislature,"The Legislature of North Carolina has adjourned until February. Our dispatch says that no law was passed, nor even proposed, ""for the government or protection of the freedmen."" This is to be regretted. No amount of willful blindness can obscure the fact that this very question was, of all others, the one that the North Carolina Legislature should have met and disposed of in a broad and liberal spirit. It was unworthy of them as men, and particularly so as politicians, to dodge this vital issue. The State is full of freedmen; their condition is anomalous and painful, both to themselves and the whites; they are accused of criminal excesses, and their late masters are as loudly accused of persecution; the densely populated negro districts have given a vote almost solid against the candidates supposed to be favorable to the governmental policy of reconstruction, and so preponderant has been that vote that it is now a question if the Administration will not summarily set it aside and continue indefinitely the existing military rule. In this action of the Legislature we see nothing but evil. They failed to settle, and even failed to recognize, the great question of the day, one, too, bearing so directly upon reconstruction that every evasion of it must be set down us a design to embarrass the President and Congress, and postpone, so far as the voting power of North Carolina can do, the wished-for moment of readmission. Before the election we had hoped better results in the old North State. Standing in a semineutral position between hot-headed South Carolina and pride-driven Virginia, she seemed to be a sort of neutral ground, where there was at least hope that the seeds of Union might fructify; but we fear that the waves of poison from the North and the South have rolled over her barren plains and infected her with all the virus of her neighbors. Certainly the statesmen (if such still exist) of North Carolina cannot expect by lofty disdain to brush from their soil a quarter of million of freedmen, nor can they hope by this ostentatious ignoring of the very question the General Government deems most important, to gain consideration in quarters where consideration must ultimately be gained, in order to bring about that reunion for which all good and loyal men are so ardently hoping and striving.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'North Carolina Unworthy Evasion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'North Carolina Unworthy Evasion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'North Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30ceaf68-fdf8-5656-b594-93539a9276dd,394,nyt://article/30ceaf68-fdf8-5656-b594-93539a9276dd

in Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/19/archives/needless-alarm.html,in Paris,"-- The appearance of Gen. SCHOFIELD in Paris seems to have supplied the Paris journalists with a fruitful subject for speculative discussion. It appears to be taken for granted by a class of political declaimers, on both sides of the Atlantic, that the Mexican question is to be settled, if not by an actual appeal to arms, at least by a species of extra-official military diplomacy. What Gen. GRANT says at the mess-room table; what he is presumed to have said when dining with Gov. MONCK at Quebec, or Gov. PERRY at Charleston, is construed by the soothsayers into a grave declaration of governmental policy. So, too, when a distinguished military officer gets temporary leave of absence, and seeks to recruit his health at the Antilles, or in the salons of Paris, he becomes straightway transfigured into a belted diplomatist, carrying fierce remonstrances on the Monroe doctrine in one hand and a keen-edged Damascus blade in the other -- to-night entrancing a fair audience with his brave and gallant bearing, to-morrow conveying dismay to the heart and knee-joints of Imperial Cabinets by mysterious menaces.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEEDLESS ALARM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEEDLESS ALARM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84590b8b-ae91-5f1b-9270-e91ebd5a2d26,311,nyt://article/84590b8b-ae91-5f1b-9270-e91ebd5a2d26

London Times on Friendship for the United States; Public Opinion Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/19/archives/america-and-europe-the-progress-of-opinion-abroad.html,London Times on Friendship for the United States; Public Opinion Abroad,"The London Times of the 5th, which came to hand yesterday, has an article upon the United States which may be called somewhat sensational in character, if it be not so in form. It takes occasion of a long-deferred dispatch of Secretary SEWARD, written on the 1st of this month, making a general acknowledgment of letters and addresses of condolence upon the assassination of President LINCOLN, to deliver itself of its long-suppressed admiration of the course of things in this country and of the country itself. After indulgingin this at considerable length; alter giving vent to a mingled adulation and vaingloriousness, in proudly claiming a resemblance in character between the people of America and those of England, the Times closes its discourse with a few words upon the prevalent feeling of Great Britain toward the United States. It is here that the point of the article and of the whole matter comes in. It would be quite idle, we are told, to deny that there are points upon which England is jealous, or sore, or without the perfect sympathy that obtains between two similar social systems; for with long arrears of quarrels upon one trifle or another, and a new one every year, Englishmen have found it difficult to appreciate the Americans as they really wish to do; but we can afford to make this confession when we state what we believe to be the truth as to the great extent of our good wishes for America."" To what, we ask anxiously, do these good wishes refer, and how far do they go, and what sort of relationship have they to good deeds? We have not to pause for a reply. The Times ""takes us,"" in what is regarded abroad as the dearest and greatest object of American ambition -- the desire for territorial extension and the enlargement of our national power. It was to limit this that Louis NAPOLEON, according to his own confession, sent his army to Mexico; and it was continually asserted in England during the war, that our lust in this direction, squinting toward Canada, was a principal cause of the prevailing animosity to the cause of the North. But now, says the great English organ, ""We have not the least objection to the United States increasing to any extent, and annexing any amount of territory or number of States, so long as it is all done honestly above board, and by fair appeals to the sympathy and good sense of the people. If the population, either of our own provinces or of Mexico, freely and spontaneously declared that they thought this their best chance of peace and prosperity, the British people would only feel the most passing regret at the loss of a name, and the proportionate aggrandizement of the United States.""

The writ, last week, was dismissed, on the ground that it had not been served on the proper person. Gen. Hooker was ill at the time, and the officer made the service on Brevet Brig.-Gen. Van Buren. The court held that the service was not a compliance with the statutes of this State; that if Gen. Hooker could not have been served personally, it was then incumbent on the official to serve the writ on the jailer, keeper of the prison, or the officer having charge of Fort Lafayette. The first proceedings having been discharged, the prisoner's counsel, Mr. Larocque, obtained a new writ, which was made returnable yesterday, at 12 o'clock.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Case of Martin, an Alleged Spy and Incendiary The Writ of Habeas Corpus Served on Gen.

"BROOKLYN ART ASSOCIATION. -- The first reception given by the Brooklyn Art Association, during the season of 1865-6, will be held at the Brooklyn Academy this evening, under the management of REGIS GIGNOUX, President, and Messrs. E.S. MILLS, G.L. FORD and JOHN WILLIAMSON. The exhibition promises to be better than that of any previous reception, as most of our best artists have promised to be represented there. We are glad to know that GIGNOUX, who, as has been well said, is among artists what THOMPSON was among poets, has just finished his picture of ""Spring,"" of which in its earlier stages we have before written.

He claims that while he was on a trip to the oil regions, and when between the stations on the company's road known as Susquehanna and Great Bend, owing to some defect in the rails, and the great speed at which the train was running, the rear car was thrown down an embankment; that by reason thereof he was thrown on a hot stove, and half a dozen persons thrown on him; that he was very badly burned, bruised, and so much injured that he will never be a well man. The defendants say the injuries are not so serious as plaintiff asserts, and that they are not permanent. They also insist that no care, skill or foresight could have guarded against the accident in question. The trial has been in progress two days, and was not concluded when the court adjourned yesterday afternoon.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e99b2bf2-46c9-5ece-9095-a67aa3bc65e1,862,nyt://article/e99b2bf2-46c9-5ece-9095-a67aa3bc65e1

At retail, in the shops of all the petty dealers, the poor housekeeper pays as much this week as he did twelve months ago. This would not be, had we a market system worth the name; or if industrious citizens of limited means would combine -- say in families of four or five, living in the same neighborhood -- to make their purchases of the principal articles of every day consumption in common. This would especially apply to meat, flour, sugar, and butter -- the heavy items of the weekly bill. A carcass of good mutton, which would well divide among four at this season, might be bought at just about one-half what it is retailed at per pound in the petty butchers' shops. In butter a great saving might likewise be made. Surely there are thousands of cases where this combination might easily and safely be made -- in the Winter season especially.

On the afternoon of the 6th inst., Mr. REUBEN R. ROLLINS, auctioneer, was selling his wares on the sidewalk at No. 438 Canal-street, and his bidders and the spectators blockaded the sidewalk. Mr. STOVER, passing, experiencing difficulty in getting on, requested Policeman MCDERMOTT to disperse the multitude; but instead of complying the officer bade Mr. STOVER go on, at the same time pushing him. The officer, defending, said that he understood that the Board of Aldermen had authorized the holding of auctions in the public thoroughfares, and he believed that he had no right to drive away the auctioneer's customers. Mr. ROLLINS, also, thought his right clear to encumber the sidewalk, as the Common Council had given him permission to sell his goods at auction in the open air. The Commissioners informed the gentleman that the Common Council may authorize an auction-sale in the street, but that they cannot grant permission to any person to encumber the sidewalks. Mr. SILAS C. SMITH, proprietor of the Frankfort Hotel, appeared against Sergt. LEMUEL S. SLATER, of the Fourth Ward, complaining that on the night of July 20 the sergeant arrested the persons who had charge of the hotel, and left the house with between $5,000 and $6,000 in the safe, without adequate protection. A lodger's wallet having been missed, the Fourth Ward Police arrested several persons, and assigned a porter and a clerk to take care of the house.

The indictment charged him with keeping a liquor-store contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided, and which forbids a Justice of the Peace from engaging in such business. He is also charged with having re-tried parties who had previously been tried by another justice of the same town, and for the same offence -- that of assault and battery -- and, further, that in the first proceeding defendant appeared before Justice HEITCAMP as counsel for one of the parties. His client having been found guilty, it is alleged that he brought the parties before his own court, and convicted the man who had gained the case in the other court. A number of witnesses were examined, among them some lawyers, who testified that they had drank something different from soda water in the Justice's place while engaged in trying cases before him. The case was summed up yesterday afternoon and given to the jury, who, after several hours' deliberation, brought in a verdict of guilty.

The subsequent examination of the Professor's effects revealed some remarkable transactions in which he had been engaged, and proves him to have been a common thief. The pupils attending the institute are chiefly young Spanish gentlemen from the Island of Cuba. On the 11th of July last two of these young gentlemen were engaged in some sports on the lawn, and it being a warm day, they deposited their vests and watches under a tree, and after finishing their sports, returned for the articles, when they were nowhere to be found. For some time previous various articles had disappeared in a mysterious manner, and suspicion fell upon the servant girl and the gardener. The services of Capt. DAVIS, of the Hoboken Police, were obtained, and the lodge at the entrance to the grounds occupied by the gardener was thoroughly searched, but none of the missing property was found. Madame VILLAVREDE was so confident that the gardener and servant girl were the guilty parties that she caused their discharge, but still property continued to disappear in a mysterious manner, as before, but still suspicion was never directed toward the Professor, who was looked upon a devout Christian and was highly esteemed. After his decease, in looking over his effects a number of pawn tickets were found for clothing, watches, jewelry and other articles. A diary was also found, in which the Professor kept a minute daily record of all his transactions, and in which he had noted down all the, thefts as committed by himself and the disposition he had made of the property. Under the date of July 6, was entered: ""Half-past nine P.M.; drank a bottle of wine; stole it."" After the search for the watches and vest, was the following entry: ""They have sent a policeman to search for the watches; he will find them, oh! yes -- perhaps."" There was also recorded the fact that he was put in the Tombs over night, was discharged the next morning, and went home with the headache and feeling very bad, and on two other occasions became intoxicated in New-York, and slept in the station-house. Yesterday Capt. Davis proceeded to New-York, and recovered a fine suit of black broadcloth, a valuable silver watch, and a gold ring at Simpson's pawn-shop, in Chatham-street, where deceased had pawned them, and which belonged to parties residing at VILLAVREDE's Institute. The Captain also expects to recover considerable other property of which he has traces at other places.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sudden Death of Minister--He Proves to be a Common Thief.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sudden Death of Minister--He Proves to be a Common Thief.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e5d31bd-de9d-5c5f-83f3-b1f5da285752,455,nyt://article/0e5d31bd-de9d-5c5f-83f3-b1f5da285752

It is peculiar, inasmuch as the whole of the line is constructed in or under the metropolis, many portions of it passing under densely populated districts and busy thoroughfares. The number of passengers it conveys is perfectly enormous. In the last half year the persons carried on the Metropolitan were 7,462,823, that is two and a half times the population of London. The mere increase in the number of passengers conveyed in the last as compared with the preceding half year, was equal to the united populations of a score of the next largest cities and towns in England, including Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle, &c. * * * * The Metropolitan receipts per mile per week are as high as £703. The nearest approach to this is by some of the lines which have metropolitan and suburban traffic, but all these fall far short of it. The Blackwall line reaches about £394 per mile per week, and the North London £373, whereas the great companies having London termini and other large companies in other parts of the country have traffics which only yield receipts ranging from £60 to £160 per mile per week. In Whit Week last the Metropolitan carried 370,843 passengers, and in one day alone, the Monday of that week, it carried 83,440, and as a result of the perfect system of signaling adopted on that line, without loss of life or casualty to a single passenger.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Relief of Broadway and the People of New-York--An Underground Railroad a Necessity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Relief of Broadway and the People of New-York--An Underground Railroad a Necessity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4fb600d6-219b-515e-8d14-d9f2d48588ac,927,nyt://article/4fb600d6-219b-515e-8d14-d9f2d48588ac

During the war Cluff went down to Louisiana, and, with the permission of the government agents, he rented and worked a plantation near Baton Rouge, which was formerly owned by a Mr. Cox. On the 25th of February, 1864, near the place last named, Cluff met a young son of the owner of the plantation in the highway, driving a team. Cluff said to the boy that his father owed him, and for the debt he should take the team from him. The lad resisted for a while, but Cluff was too powerful for him and finally compelled him to retreat. As soon as Cluff's back was turned, however, the boy ran after him, and as he did so, he drew a pistol and shot Cluff dead on the spot.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Important to Life Insurance Companies and Those Insured.; SUPREME' COURT--CIRCUIT--PART III--DEC. 21.

"Fire Department Parade, The",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/22/archives/the-firemens-parade.html,"Fire Department Parade, The","Every unprejudiced observer of the splendid exhibition of our new Fire Department, on Wednesday, who, perchance, had cherished a lingering doubt of its superiority over the late organization, must have been satisfied of the wisdom of the change. Compact, powerful and disciplined, the Metropolitan Department stands out in bold contrast to the straggling, inefficient, corrupt and expensive system which it has superseded. Unlike old-time parades of the firemen, this one was devoid of meretricious display and political clap-trap. Instead were substituted the economic forces of steam machinery and strong horses. The comparatively few men who are necessary to put these forces in operation -- chosen, as they have been, from the most experienced of the late organization -- have already proved that they know their business and will attend to its performance. Their neat and serviceable uniforms, their military bearing and air of quiet earnestness, convey to the mind a far stronger impression of efficiency than all the mere numbers of the old force, with their reckless dash and alarming confusion. Taking all things into consideration, the Metropolitan Fire Commissioners are to be commended, for the zeal and wisdom which has thus far marked the administration of their department, and the public is to be congratulated that the safety of life and preservation of property in case of fire are incomparably less hazarded than of yore.

GRANT, in suggesting that the Freedman's Bureau should act through military agents at the South, contributes far more toward a practical solution of the question of protecting the emancipated race than has been done by all the philanthropic theorists from Maine to Texas. If justice is to be done between the employer and employed, in their new relations, the umpire must be one in whom both parties have confidence. If the ablest and honestest civilians that could be named among the governing class at the South were to be designated for the post of arbitrators between the freedmen and their late employers, the neuro laborer would naturally and reasonably object that he could hardly have fair play in the adjustment. If, on the other hand, an itinerant propagator of the dogmas of negro equality were made the judge between the parties, the employer of labor (only the other day the master of the laborer) would naturally -- if not also reasonably -- feel that his interests would barely find an equitable consideration. On either side the complainings would superabound. Nor is the case we put at all hypothetical. Gen. GRANT says:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

Finding the gentleman awake and up, he withdrew, and on the following morning again went to the apartments occupied by Mr. BROOME, with no better success.

Yesterday and last evening they were literally packed, and hence charmingly amusing to everybody that had nothing to do but lounge at their portals. Their alleys were blockaded by long lines of housewives preparing for the dual Christmas dinners of to-day and to-morrow, not an individual of whom would buy so much as the wing of a turkey until she had squeezed through the panting crowd and cheapened everything and selected precisely the luxuries that hit her fancy, and of course not one of these housewives found a farthing's discrepancy in the vender's prices, or a particle of difference in the flesh and fruit that the marketmen exposed for sale. The merchants were uncommonly amiable; and well they might be; for they delight in large margins of profit, and these they realized to their heart's content last evening. In Washington Market one dealer, entering into the spirit of the Christmas season, and fully enjoying the per cents that he was accumulating, thrust a turkey's wing into his hat, after the manner of the misses' who wear feathers in their jockeys, and after the business of the day had been closed he danced a hornpipe on the floor of his empty stall with $100 clear profit in his pocket.

NEWMAN, residing at No. 40 York-street, Jersey City, recounts the particulars of an outrage which he alleges to have been perpetrated on him on Friday night, by members of the Fenian Brotherhood, at Washington Hall, corner of Newark and Jersey avenues, which seem almost incredible. NEWMAN's story is, that desiring to find some friends residing in the upper part of the city, and not being acquainted in the locality, he asked a man standing on the corner of Jersey-avenue and South Eighth-street, near the entrance to the Hall, to direct him to the place he wished to find. The stranger, instead of giving the information, asked NEWMAN who he wanted to see, what his business was with them, together with other questions, and then suddenly seizing him by the collar, said that he was a detective; that there had been a number of burglaries recently committed in that locality; that he had his photograph in his pocket, and then dragged him into the hall. NEWMAN supposing the man to be a detective who had mistaken him for some one he was in search of, offered no resistance, and allowed himself to be taken up to the top floor where the pretended officer knocked at a door which was unlocked, and he was then thrust into the room; when the man said: ""Gentlemen, I introduce to you a British spy,"" by which the captured man came to the conclusion that he was in a Fenian Circle. A court was at once organized, and the man told to state his case, when he said that he had seen his prisoner often in New-York, and knew him to be what he had stated. Mr. NEWMAN told them that he was a machinist, employed at the Delamater Iron-works, in New-York; that he had no knowledge of their organization, nor did he wish to have. In the meantime exclamations of ""Smash him,"" ""Kick him down stairs,"" ""He's a regular Johnny Bull,"" &c., were freely uttered by those who surrounded him. The President or Centre, however, decided to let him go, whereupon the man who took him into the hall seized him by the throat, saving be should not get away from him. The others in the room then crowded around, some taking sides with their brother Fenian and some with the prisoner, when a struggle ensued, during which NEWMAN got clear, and one of the members opening the door, he rushed out and made his escape. The above is an ex-parte statement of the transaction, but when an account of the affair is given by the persons alleged to have committed the outrage, the facts may possibly appear quite different.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21ceae9f-a82c-5618-9945-17efe4a57d46,1158,nyt://article/21ceae9f-a82c-5618-9945-17efe4a57d46

By building a branch road, of eight miles, from the Housatonic Railroad at Kent, Conn., to the Harlem Railroad at Dover Plains, N. Y., a continuous line from New-York to Montreal will be secured, with the exception of a short distance between Hoosick, N.Y., and the Western Vermont Railroad. The proposed route is as follows: From New-York to Dover Plains on the Harlem road, thence to Kent by the new branch, from Kent to Pittsfield on the Housatonic Road, from Pittsfield to Adams on the North Adams Railroad, from Adams to Hoosick on the Troy and Greenfield Road, then intersect with the Western Vermont Road, and then on to Rutland, Burlington and Montreal. The cost of the branch from Kent to Dover Plains is estimated at $400,000, and the money is promised immediately for both the links which are needed to complete the line. While these are being built, the care will be run over the Western Railroad from Pittsfield to Chatham, and thence on the Harlem Road to New-York.

"The fact that application has been made to Parliament for the charter of eighteen new lines of subterranean railways in the City of London sufficiently attests the practicability and utility of this method of transportation in large cities. Nearly all the great roads which have their termini in the suburbs of London, are preparing to extend their lines, underground, to the city itself. The safety and speed with which these roads can transport passengers and freight has been demonstrated beyond cavil. The relief it affords to a crowded population is undeniable, and it is just such relief as New-York needs. It doubles the capacity of overburdened avenues of travel. It saves valuable time to all classes of citizens. It will stimulate this metropolis to a healthful and symmetrical growth; and for the people themselves will prove the best sanitary measure that ingenuity can devise. With all these advantages, patent to the dullest thinker, it seems strange that a responsible company should have been delayed a year by vain efforts to obtain the Governor's signature to their charter. The present is a most propitious time to build the road. A subterranean survey of the entire city has just been completed by the Croton Aqueduct Department, and the knowledge thus obtained will be invaluable in the construction of the tunnel. The same department is about to commence a new system of sewerage, and their plans could be made to harmonize with the necessities of the new line, if the company felt warranted in completing their arrangement at once.

Dore was known chiefly as an artist of wonderful and wild extravagance, of weird imagination, gifted with a peculiar sense of the grotesque and the humorous, but wanting in true sublimity and serious dignity. The versatility of his genius was unquestioned. His sketches, thrown off with wonderful facility, number several thousand. The illustrated edition of BALZAC's ""Contes Drolatiques,"" published ten or twelve years ago, contains no less than 425 woodcuts from his designs; the ""Don Quixote,"" about 400; his ""Baron Munchausen,"" about 140. For a large folio edition of DANTE's ""Inferno"" he designed seventy-six full-page illustrations of the most varied character, both in spirit and style. But. in all these works, he was most successful with those subjects which require grotesque or humorous treatment. He is perfectly at home in horrors, and some of his monstrosities, in the ""Inferno,"" have a very uncomfortable appearance of reality, which almost compels us to believe in their existence. The hell of his pictures is infinitely more horrible and revolting than the hell of DANTE's poem. As an English critic has well said, there are designs in the ""Inferno"" at which ""ORCAGNA might have demurred, and from which people whose taste is not over-squeamish in matters of art must recoil with disgust.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gustave Dore's Illustrations to the Bible."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Gustave Dore's Illustrations to the Bible."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01f68c5d-ce4a-59f0-8d94-25620f5760af,1635,nyt://article/01f68c5d-ce4a-59f0-8d94-25620f5760af

The Latest From,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/25/archives/the-latest-from-mexico.html,The Latest From,"-- We have a report from Mexico to-day, by way of New-Orleans, which is at once oracular and amusing. Marshal BAZAINE, the mentor of MAXIMILIAN at the Imperial court, has announced in a dispatch to Gen. MEJIA, commanding at Matamoras, that the northern portion of Mexico, which refers, of course, to the provinces on our own frontier -- is under the joint protection of the Emperor of Mexico and the Emperor of the French. If this was news to Gen. MEJIA, it certainly is not news to us here. Let the Emperor of the French withdraw his protection from the northern or any other provinces of the invaded republic, and the reign of the other Emperor in those provinces would come to a very speedy close. Marshal BAZAINE may mean, however, to hint that at all hazards the French Emperor will sustain his protege against domestic opposition or friendly outside remonstrance. If this is the intent of Marshal BAZAINE's brave words, they are neither discreet nor well chosen. If MAXIMILIAN's throne has to be permanently supported by French bayonets, then Mexico is to all intents and purposes a dependency of France, and the fiction of a separate sovereignty which MAXIMILIAN's presence represents becomes apparent to the world. The conquest -- if conquest it shall be called -- is due to French arms, and such glory and profit as it may bring belong to the French Emperor. Mexico, as a dependency of France, we can conceive to be a possibility, for the time, at least Mexico as a self-sustaining empire is simply a delusive and fictitious creation of state-craft. The French Emperor cannot be permitted to escape from the logic of his policy of armed intervention. If his troops succeed in crushing out the Republican army, he establishes a French colony at our doors.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATEST FROM MEXICO.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LATEST FROM MEXICO.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/100a460a-0e20-5c78-b5f1-9ccd719a856e,303,nyt://article/100a460a-0e20-5c78-b5f1-9ccd719a856e

The causes remained here from that time, issue being joined in them here.

Luss, who Attempts Suicide","A most extraordinery affair occurred in Clinton-street, between West Baltie and Harrison streets, shortly before 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, which will prebaby result in the death of an estimable young lady and the permanent mutilation of her murderous assailant. The circumstances reveal the old story of disappointed affection, jealousy and revenge and have attached to them somewhat of a romantic aspect. The names of the parties are WM.H. RUSS and Miss FRANCES DAYTON. The former was employed as book-keeper in the office of the National Mexican Loan Company, No. 57 Broadway, New-York, where the young lady and her brother, HARPER DAYTON, were also employed. It appears that about 4 1/2 o'clock Saturday afternoon the three left the office together for Brooklyn, and crossed the South Ferry. Mr. DATYON, however, left them on the New-York side. On arriving on this side of the river the two walked leisurely up Atlantic-street, toward the house of Mr. P.W. KENYON, No. 193 Clinton-street, where the young lady boarded. When near the house RUSS drew his revolver, a seven-chambered Smith & Wesson, and placing the muzzle at Miss DAYTON's head, fired. The shot took effect and she fell upon the sidewalk. He then fired another shot and walked about the distance of ten paces when he returned, and, standing over her body, fired the third time. Parties bearing the report came up, and discovering the lady to be injured, one gentleman pursued RUSS, who at first walked away very leisurely, but as soon as he found he had been discovered, ran quite briskly till he reached Atlantic-street, where he was lost eight of by his pursuer, who supposed that he had crossed that thoroughfare It appeared from subsequent investigation that RUSS turned down Pacific-street toward the river, and on reaching the dock jumped overboard, with the intention of drowning himself. Owing to the low tide he could not accomplish his purpose, and extricating himself from the mud made his way to shore. Had he selected any other part of the shore tine he would have found the water deep enough. On regaining the land, according to his own statement to the police, he shot himself twice, with the intention of ending his existence at once. In this he also failed, and returned up Pacific to Atlantic-street, all muddy and wet and his clothing stiffly frozen. He was here seen by Officer POWERS of the Forty-third Police Precinct, who took him into custody. On reaching the station-house RUSS was so benumbed that he could scarcely articulate an intelligible word. With the cheering effects of a warm fire he was soon sufficiently revived to answer such questions as were put to him by the officers. Meantime, Dr. CLARK was called in and examined the injured man. He found two bullet wounds, about one and a half inches apart, over and somewhat back of the right eye, both balls taking their course to the base of the skull, where they lodged, without injuring the brain. The eye had been forced from the socket, and the sight is destroyed. Some time thereafter, RUSS was conveyed to the Brooklyn City Hospital. Capt. RHODES, of the Forty-third Precinct, subsequently paid a visit to Miss DAYTON's residence, where he found her under the care of Dr. WILLETTS, who had at that time succeeded in extracting a portion of one of the balls from her skull. In his interview with the young lady, she acknowledged to Capt. RHODES that RUSS had shot [???]e[???], but she did not want him arrested, as she believed that he was in a deranged state of mind at the time. She also informed the Captain where his place of business was, at No. 57 Broadway,) and that he had rooms in the same building and lodged there. In relation to her own condition, it was found that three balls had entered the brain -- two on the right side, near the crown, and one near the back of the head, on a line with the other two. The brains were oozing from the latter wound. Her injuries are believed to be of a fatal character. After leaving the house, Capt. RHODES proceeded to No. 57 Broadway, and after some difficulty succeeded in arousing the porter, who admitted him. It was here ascertained that RUSS was employed by Messrs. J.N. TIFT & JOHN W. CORLIES, as book-keeper, (as heretofore, stated,) and that he was the occupant of four rooms on the fourth story (rear) of the same building, which he had fitted up with a view to housekeeping. He had a housekeeper in his employ, who had prepared tea, which was still standing on the table, waiting his arrival. His bed had been unoccupiad.

Magazines for January,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/25/archives/literary-the-january-magazines.html,Magazines for January,"-- The Atlantic Monthly, (Boston: TICKNOR & FIELDS,) commences the Sew Year with its 99th Number, and a list of contributors such as few periodicals in the world can produce. HAWTHORNE, BRYANT, LONGFELLOW, BAYARD TAYLOR, DONALD G. MITCHELL, and Mrs. H.B. STOWS, are names sure of a general welcome, not to mention minor celebrities and the English novelist CHARLES READE, whose serial story, ""Griffith Gaunt, or Jealousy,"" is continued from the December number. The posthumous remains which enable the magazine to rank HAWTHORNE among the list of its authors are of great literary value and curiosity for the light they throw upon his mental characteristics and habits of composition. A prefatory note mentions that several volumes of closely written memoranda were found in his study after his decease. From them the ""Passages"" in the magazine are extracted. The present specimens were jotted down, evidently for no eye but the writer's, more than thirty years ago, when HAWTHORNE was quite unknown to fame. They show his great future works in embryo, prove how conscientiously he aimed at excellence in his vocation, studying alike nature and man, yearning' to penetrate the secrets of both, and already displaying the finished and graceful style that the practice of succeeding years scarcely improved. W.C. BRYANT's ""Castles in the Air"" from an unpublished poem, is in blank verse. The subject is treated allegorically, and is rather wanting in living interest. The versification is marked by the poet's usual felicities. ""The Bells of Lynn,"" by LONGFELLOW, is an attempt to embody in verse ""the music of their haunting chime,"" as heard at Nohant, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a striking story from the rarely worked mines of Russian history, by BAYARD TAYLOR. CHARLES READE's novel displays his usual excellencies and affectations. The serious work of the number falls mainly on the ladies. ""The Kingdom Coming,"" by Gail Hamilton in a very sermonizing strain, and Mrs. STOWE, under the pretence of a ""Family Talk in the Chimney Corner,"" actually proceeds to inflict on the readers of the magazine a treatise on ""Reconstruction."" The other articles are all worthy of note, and help to make up a number above the average in merit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY.; The January Magazines.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY.; The January Magazines.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9794545c-c8a2-5acc-856f-87db46edb60a,1577,nyt://article/9794545c-c8a2-5acc-856f-87db46edb60a

It has been asserted that the recent provisional system exercised a repressive influence upon them; and that their action upon various matters was based on the military necessities imposed. Now they have larger scope, and are all but entirely unimpeded in their legislation and discussions. The martial law, which is nominally in force, is of as little effect there as it was in the Northern States during the last twelve-month of war.

Canadians Emigrating to the U. S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/25/archives/canadians-becoming-americans.html,Canadians Emigrating to the U. S.,"-- It is not merely the European emigrants who have arrived at Canadian ports during the year, that have moved almost en masse to the United States as settlers, but the old time residents of both Canadas, of both the French and English stocks, have been migrating thitherward, or rather westward, in huge numbers. Some of the districts are almost depopulated, and many of the cities are largely depleted.

Since Congress met, the President has withdrawn the Provisional Governors from Alabama, Georgia, and North and South Carolina, and handed over the internal government of those States to the officers elected by their respective inhabitants. Each one of them is now at liberty to make its own laws. In each the execution of those laws is in the hands of a Governor chosen by its own people, and through subordinate functionaries of their own appointment. Every officer in each of the States thus restored takes an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States; the laws of Congress are again the supreme law of the land in every one of them, and, in all substantial respects, the control over their own domestic affairs is precisely what it was before the rebellion. The only exception is, that the national authority is still exercised by the Freedmen's Bureau in protecting the civil and personal rights of the enfranchised slaves, and this will undoubtedly be sustained, as it certainly ought to be, until full and satisfactory provision has been made by the States themselves for securing that important and indispensable object.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Restoration Problem Congress and the President.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Restoration Problem Congress and the President.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f7802ec6-b3e8-5f82-a15d-bcdb528b6f62,1107,nyt://article/f7802ec6-b3e8-5f82-a15d-bcdb528b6f62

L.; European Social Reforms; Miss Carpenter and her Schools","All who know anything of English labors in behalf of the poor and the criminal among the young, have always associated Miss CARPENTER's name with them, as one of the oldest and most devoted workers in the cause, and one uniformly supporting the most advanced, humane and sensible principles connected with juvenile reform. Her father was well known in America as a distinguished Unitarian clergyman of Bristol, and of her brothers, one is an eminent man of science at the present time. I went to Bristol to see her work, and found her absolutely living among and giving up her life to unfortunate and outcast children. Even her artistic taste and talent, with her many, scholastic acquirements, are sacrificed to this great duty. There are quite a number of charitable enterprises in Bristol founded by her, and some still under her supervision and guidance. The ""Bed Lodge Reformatory"" is an admirable reform school for girls. It is established in an old monastery or nunnery; a very quaint, interesting old building, and not unsuited to its present use. The school-room is the grand old dining-hall of the monks, some 15 feet high, with carved oak panelings, and they say marble work from Venice, and an immense old fire-place where great ""Jule logs,"" no doubt, once blazed. Then there are broad stairways and odd windows looking out over the outside halls and stairs, where the prioress or father in charge could see who the intruders were that wished to enter. Adjoining one room is a secret chamber very well hidden, and only accidentally discovered, where, in all probability, the monks concealed refugees during the civil wars. Below the ground floor is a secret crypt for private masses. In the old nuns' or monks' chambers are now clean-looking beds for the modern children of the street. The superb old dining-hall was filled with them -- a cheerful yet well-disciplined crowd of young girls sewing for the freedmen in America! The house had a double interest to me, from the fact of its having been the residence of Dr. PRITCHARD, the Ethnologist.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; Miss Carpenter and Her Schools.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; Miss Carpenter and Her Schools.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/519ef59b-063a-5c29-9f2c-29dd30148ea7,1621,nyt://article/519ef59b-063a-5c29-9f2c-29dd30148ea7

In every State and in every city and hamlet of this broad republic were patriots who last December faced the foe and confronted death -- some maimed for life, others bearing honorable scars, and all of them rich in experiences and full of reminiscences of the bygone days of danger and death. Among the hills of New England wore told the tales of the Red River and the furthest South; upon the prairies of the West were recounted the wonders of the campaign which began on the Ohio River and ended on the Atlantic Coast; in the homes of New York and the Middle States, the ever-memorable struggles of the Army of the Potomac were once again recalled. Stories of fierce skirmishes and raids, as well as of great battles, stories of scouting expeditions by night or day, as well as of long marches by day and night; stories of captivity and suffering, as well as of taking captives; of defeat as well as of triumph; of the early days of civil conflict, as well as of the grand days when the patriotic hosts of the Union stood with their banners proudly victorious upon every field. And as the ""old folks,"" and the women and the children and the neighbors listened to the recitals of what had been achieved and suffered by the veterans in the field, there were Christmas praises given to Heaven -- in which the scarred heroes were not the last to join -- that at this holiday season the war-flags are furled and the whole land enjoys peace.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Christmas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d31fe6dc-734f-5cd1-9035-735471a54f4d,708,nyt://article/d31fe6dc-734f-5cd1-9035-735471a54f4d

The Political Crisis in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/27/archives/the-political-crisis-in-canada.html,The Political Crisis in,"The politics of the provincial community, across the lakes are not an inviting subject of study. Ministries are formed every year--sometimes oftener--upon no defined principle of party action. A certain number of Cabinet officers are assigned to the Gallo-Canadian and Anglo-Canadian sections of the colony respectively. Coalitions are formed between radicals and Tories for some object which, at first, may have some ostensible value. Before that object is reached, however, a split takes place; the radical element finds itself snubbed and overborne; and there is a crisis incontinently. This sort of thing has been going on, at short intervals, since the present Provincial Union was formed by Lord SYDENHAM. Of late years the ""crisis"" has recurred as frequently as a revolution in a South American Republic. At present the leading Liberal representative of the province, Mr. BROWN, has withdrawn from the coalition formed to establish an intercolonial Union --on the ground, it is said, that his colleagues proposed some terrible scheme to frighten us Americans into a renewal of the Reciprocity Treaty. The retiring member possibly thought that we should be the sufferers in any conflict with Provincial statesmanship; or, it may be he foresaw that retaliatory measures of commercial legislation would hurt no one but the Provincials themselves. At any rate, Mr. BROWN is out of the Cabinet; and that event seals the fate of the Confederation scheme, probably for one generation to come, if not longer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN CANADA.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN CANADA.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1f8b7449-3b2d-5b3d-88bc-e0f3c6bfa72b,419,nyt://article/1f8b7449-3b2d-5b3d-88bc-e0f3c6bfa72b

"BROOKLYN COMMON COUNCIL. -- The board met last evening. Alderman WHITNEY in the chair. The Civil Engineer of the Nassau Water Department reported the following as the cost of a 48-inch and also of a 36-inch main from Ridgewood Reservoir to the city, for the purpose of furnising an additional supply of water. The total cost of a 48-inch main is $955,130; the total cost for a 36-inch main is $607,750. A 48-inch main, it is added, will deliver one and seven-ninths (or very nearly twice) the quantity of water that a 36-inch main will deliver. The Committee on Water and Drainage, upon the same subject, reported in favor of appropriating $1,000,000 for constructing a 48-inch main from Ridgewood Reservoir to the city. Alderman HATHAWAY moved an amendment that the sum of $300,000 be appropriated as expenditures for the first year of the work, which was carried, and as amended the report of the Committee, with resolution attached, was adopted. The Fire Department Committee of the Western District, to whom was referred the matter of confirming the return of the Fire Department election for Assistant Engineers, reported in favor of confirming said return. A minority of the Committee reported adversely to the confirmation of the returns, and asked a further examination.

London Pneumatic Dispatch,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/27/archives/the-london-pneumatic-dispatch-something-wanted-in-newyork.html,London Pneumatic Dispatch,"The immensity of London has led to innumerable expedients for facilitating the passage to and fro of people and goods-- many of which expedients, it is evident, we will before many years have to resort to in New-York. The underground railroad has long been a fundamental institution there, and we have from time to time heard of the pneumatic dispatch system, or the system of transmitting letters or goods for a greater or less distance, through tubes, by means of atmospheric pressure. The plan had already been successfully tried on a limited scale, but a few weeks since a great extension of it was accomplished, and the main portion of the tube was opened which is soon to connect the General Post-office with the terminus of the London and Northwestern Railway -- a distance of nearly three miles. From the accounts given of this, the first practical application of the process on anything like a large scale, it would seem evident that the pneumatic dispatch will eventually open up a new system of communication through the great British Metropolis, and unless the system be yet superseded by something better, it will ultimately be introduced into all the great cities of the civilized world.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The London Pneumatic Dispatch-- Something Wanted in New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The London Pneumatic Dispatch-- Something Wanted in New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3bf45d7d-0660-5ae1-9598-9cd8237dbb51,615,nyt://article/3bf45d7d-0660-5ae1-9598-9cd8237dbb51

Stay Laws passed by Southern States,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/27/archives/stay-laws-of-the-south.html,Stay Laws passed by Southern States,"The Legislatures of the States of Mississippi and Virginia have been foolish enough to pass stay laws preventing the collection of debts due by their citizens. It would seem to be an unwise movement for a people seeking and needing credit, from the North and Europe, to proclaim to the world that while they are willing to contract new obligations they decline or are unable to pay old ones. These Southern States need the productions of their neighbors. They have little ready money, but are rich in prospective crops of cotton and tobacco. On the strength of these future profits our merchants are supplying their wants liberally and on favorable terms, but who can expect them to trust men now, who hasten to repudiation, and who take away from credit its props and safeguards? They cannot claim these laws as protective measures against the grasping hard-heartedness of Northern creditors; for great allowance has been made by the North for their impoverished condition, and unusual leniency shown to them from all quarters. They cannot claim to enact them as precautions against payments at the inflated prices which pertained during the latter days of the defunct Confederacy; for a much simpler law already passed in some of their sister States would remedy that evil.

He was discharged from the establishment on the ground, as alleged, that he was a member of the Musical Protective Union. He offered his services repeatedly after being discharged, but was refused. His salary, as per agreement, was $40 per week. He brought suit for the recovery of two week's salary, amounting to $80. The first witness examined was Mr. CHARLES J.

Two burglaries were committed by thieves who entered halls of tenement-houses that are always open, and that gave them access to the rear windows of adjoining buildings. The Police Commissioners ask: is it reasonable to expect us, with only 2,500 men, to penetrate all these areas and discover burglars by climbing fences in rear yards or traversing roofs?

Several of the missionaries recited accounts of their visits among the poor, the neglected and the afflicted, unfolding many a dark chapter of sin, suffering and misfortune. Sick and disabled soldiers and their families, and soldiers' widows and orphans were found among those needing the missionary's care and attention. Labors among the emigrants at Castle Garden, and also among the Jews were reported favorably. Rev. Dr. PRENTISS, the pastor of the church, said we have had some veryfresh and impressive exhibitions of the power of the Gospel. And while the amount of wickedness and misery is fearful, we are reminded that God's providence is busy, and that God's spirit is working, and that hundreds of laborers all over our city are bringing up thousands of facts like these, to the praise of God's grace. We are glad to see the city missionary interest increasing. And not only in the city, but in the country as well, Christians feel that they must labor for the good of those around them. A friend of ours, of wealth and talent, and high social position, gave himself to his country's cause and joined our hosts of gallant soldiers; and when the struggle was over returned home with honorable scars, and then devoted his time, energy and means to the welfare of the poor in the neighborhood of his elegant home. And the other day a beautiful little chapel, built at his own expense, was dedicated to Jesus Christ. When will our business men give the time and thought, and care, that are needful to the vigorous prosecution of benevolent works with that system, economy and practical regard to details, which so particularly characterizes the mercantile operations of this great metropolis? Among the statistics furnished we find the following: 7,657 missionary visits, 403 meetings, 696 persons persuaded to attend church and mission, 130 Bibles and Testaments given, 279 children brought into Sabbath-school, 88 temperance pledges, and 65,460 tracts distributed.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d5d18a4-f07b-580b-8c70-1c6a1890015f,886,nyt://article/4d5d18a4-f07b-580b-8c70-1c6a1890015f

EYRE, of Jamaica, has been suspended from office and a commission has been sent out to inquire into his conduct toward the negro population on that island. A Fenian leader has been sentenced to penal servitude for life. The death of King LEOPOLD of Belgium was the chief topic of discussion in English and Continental papers. A French paper contains a hint at the possible division of the little kingdom between England, France and Prussia; but it seems to be the general opinion that LEOPOLD II. will not be disturbed.

Take that at Alexandria, Va., for instance, regarding which the telegraph has had a great deal to say.

Raynor vs. Wm. M. Raynor. -- This was a motion made by the plaintiff through her counsel, Messrs. James and Dunphy, to enforce an order directing alimony under the following circumstances: The parties to the suit were married in the year 1856, and lived together several years as husband and wife. In or about the year 1862 Mrs. Raynor commenced a suit for divorce against her husband on the ground of adultery. The action, after going through the usual forms, resulted in a decree of absolute divorce as against the husband, and the order of the court was made to that effect. In this order the defendant, among other things, was directed to pay as alimony the sum of $8 per week toward the support of the plaintiff. About a year after the decree of divorce was granted -- namely, in August, 1863 -- the parties came together again, and, from affidavits used on the motion, it seems they cohabited as husband and wife from the time lost named up to August, 1865.

The President then introduced HENRY C. CAREY, Esq., of Philadelphia, who proceeded to deliver the lecture of the evening, on the ""Resources of the United States,"" being the fourth of the series on the Currency, Resources and Indebtedness of the United States. The lecture, which was listened to with earnest attention throughout by an unusually large audience, was a learned dissertation on the various resources of the country, and suggested the policy of protection as that only by which labor could be economised and the resources of the country thoroughly developed. Concluding with the statement of the great fact that commercial power had always gone hand in hand with that diversification of pursuits which has everywhere resulted from measures tending to the promotion of internal commerce. Athens, with her miners and manufacturers, governed the Grecian world, Carthage largely manufacturing, controlled the commerce of half the known world. Holland was mistress of the commercial world in those days when the people of the Rhine cities could boast ""that they bought of the stupid Englishmen skins at sixpence and paid for them in tails at a shilling."" England, wiser grown, now does the same by us, and she it is that now controls the commercial world outside of Europe, leaving to industrial France the management of Europe itself. Such is the lesson taught by history and we must now profit by it or abandon for ever the hope of occupying the proud position to which our natural resources so well entitle us. To it we never can attain so long as we shall continue to sell, as we long have sold, whole skins for sixpence, accepting pay in tails at a shilling each. That is not the road toward civilization, power and influence. That it is the one which leads to barbarism, weakness and dependence, is proved by the experience of all communities that have traveled on it; and by none more thoroughly than our own. Should proof of this now be needed, let me ask you to study the present condition of the South, and see how readily the great cotton king has been dethroned by the united efforts of the hammer, the spindle and the loom. That, done turn your eyes to the West, and study the recent prostration of almost the whole people of the great Mississippi Valley before a few insignificant capitalists, who were thus to be propitiated into giving to their obedient slaves an additional road to the British markets. Those who desire to command the respect of others must learn to respect themselves; and that our people can never do until they shall have learned that the road toward wealth and strength has, in all nations and in all ages, been found to lie in the direction of bringing the plow, the loom, the anvil and the ships to work in harmony with each other. Let them, gentlemen, once learn thoroughly that great lesson, and then, but not till then, shall we be enabled to control and direct the commerce of the world.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Geographical and Statistical Society Lecture on the Resources of the United States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Geographical and Statistical Society Lecture on the Resources of the United States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/39742789-9d30-5f75-aa1d-3e2f1510fef8,649,nyt://article/39742789-9d30-5f75-aa1d-3e2f1510fef8

A gentleman informed him that the prisoner took the cane with him when he left. The first time complainant saw Thompson he had him taken in charge. Complainant asked very earnestly to have the case withdrawn, the prisoner having promised to compensate him.

The Petersburgh Index says that by daylight of Christmas, ""egg-nog was very abundant, and before breakfast-time enough had been drunk to put everybody in a good humor, and give them a good appetite. Later in the day the fun waxed faster and more furious -- drunken men filled the streets, and broken heads began to show themselves, and fighting commenced. So numberless,"" adds the Index, ""were the rows, that we decline attempting an account of them singly."" We had thought, from what we were told beforehand, that it was the ""darks"" who were to carry on in this fashion in the Southern cities upon Christmas Day. But the realized fact seems to have been quite otherwise. It was the boys who used to be clad in gray who broke each other's heads, got up numberless rows, got funnier and funnier, faster and more furious, as the day passed away, until, if we may judge from the accounts in the Index, there was hardly such a thing as an uncracked cranium to be found in the whole City of Petersburgh.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/29/archives/police-courts-jewelry-market-before-justice-dodge-remarkable-watch.html,,"Mr. ROSWELL D. KING, who keeps a jewelry store at No. 22 Fourth-avenue, made complaint against WILLIAM M.D. CONKLING and ALBERT MORGAN, the first only eighteen years of age and the other nineteen, for stealing from him four double-case gold watches valued at $570, on the 5th inst. Detective BAKER, of the Fifteenth Precinct, arrested CONKLING on the 21st inst. and MORGAN on Christmas Day. This case is an interesting one from the very ingenious, though not ingenuous, manner of committing the robbery. It appears that young CONKLING came to Mr. KING's store and told him that his adopted father, Mr. FREEMAN J. FRITHIAN, who was living at No. 1 Irving-[???]pace, wanted to purchase a watch from the [???]eveler, and that he had seat him (CONKLING) to tell Mr. KING that he wished him to bring several watches for his father to make a selection from. Not doubting the genuineness of the statement, Mr. KING took from his stock four double-case gold watches and carried them to Mr. FRITHIAN's residence. On reaching the door he was met by young CONKLING, who said that Mr. FRITHIAN and the folks were up stairs, and that he would take the watches up, and at the same time requested the complainant to wait a few minutes. The boy was given the watches, and the jeweler sat down and waited for some time. CONKLING not coming down stairs, Mr. KING went out and came back in a few minutes and rang the bell. A girl came to the door, and in answer to inquiry said that no such person as Mr. FRITHIAN resided there. On further inquiry Mr. KING learned that a gentleman in the house knew where Mr. FRITHIAN lived, when it was found that the gentleman resided at the Union-place Hotel. Considerably alarmed at the phase the affair had assumed, Mr. KING wended his anxious steps toward the hotel, and found Mr. FRITHIAN at home. Mr. FRITHIAN informed the jeweller that he had not sent for any watches, and did not wish to buy any; that he had not authorized CONKLING to go for any such articles, and had neither seen CONKLING nor any watches. On being arrested young CONKLING acknowledged to the officer that he had taken the watches, and that MORGAN was with him at the time. He further stated that he had pawned three of the watches, and disposed off two of the tickets to one PATRICK J. KERVAN, and the other to a man whose name he did not know. The fourth watch he had handed over to MORGAN, who had given it to his step-father, named CLINO, who had in turn sold it to some one in Maiden-lane. The prisoners were committed for examination. CONKLING is a native of New-York, and says he has been a clerk in a banking-house down town. MORGAN is also a native of New-York, used to attend a bar, and lives at No. 104 Bleecker-street. Both prisoners were also committed on an additional charge of having stolen four coats and several other articles of clothing on the 1st instant, valued at $125, from JOSEPH M. MARVIN, of No. 508 Broadway.

But we publish to-day an order from an officer of the bureau in Virginia which seems to involve the very essence of all that is most galling and offensive in sumptuary legislation. On a mere rumor that certain citizens of Virginia contemplated turning out of doors the sick and helpless negroes, recently their slaves, this officer issues an order threatening with the vengeance of the Executive all those who act as the rumor referred to indicates. We had supposed that the utmost extent to which it was necessary for a bureau officer to go, was to protect the negro from actual wrong, and not to threaten those presumed to be his persecutors, in this indiscriminate and general way. What punishment, moreover, is to fall upon a Virginia family which has barely means of subsistence for its own members? Are these members bound to bend before this sumptuary edict, whether their means allow it or not? The ill-advised friends of the negro may depend on it that such philanthropic measures will produce a reaction sooner or later here in the North.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PROTECTION FOR INFIRM FREEDMEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PROTECTION FOR INFIRM FREEDMEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'NEGROES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b43b29dc-6435-503d-9c6e-c1640e1aa779,206,nyt://article/b43b29dc-6435-503d-9c6e-c1640e1aa779

The party consisted of some twenty-five ladies and a few gentlemen, whose hearts and hands are ready to every good work. The steamer belonging to the Police Department of this city was kindly placed at their disposal, as was also the steamer C.W. Thomas, through the kindness of Gen. VAN VLIET. At the time appointed they were both in readiness at the foot of Twenty-sixth-street. Sundry well-filled baskets, boxes and parcels of cooked poultry, pies and other delicacies to match were piled upon the deck of the little steamer and plainly foreshadowed the good time coming. These upon the landing of the boats were soon transferred to one of the ample mess-rooms of the hospital, and in an incredibly short time the activity of the ladies had everything in readiness, and all the men, consisting of about two hundred and fifty able to leave their cots, seated themselves in long lines at the tables. It was a great pleasure to observe how the cold ham, hot coffee, roast turkey and chicken, celery, eauce and pies of all varieties disappeared from before the soldiers, who had only a few months before fallen wounded and bleeding upon the field of battle. When they had eaten all they desired there was enough left for the supply of another day. A telegram from His Excellency Gov. FENTON was read, expressive of his regrets at not being able to be present, and promising, if practicable, to visit the hospital at a future day. Short addresses by several gentlemen present, in which allusions were made to the valuable services these faithful men had rendered in the cause of their country, were well received and earnestly applauded. The speeches were followed with instrumental and vocal music, which gave a pleasant variety to the festivities. At intervals the most earnest cheers were given for the President of the United States, Gen. GRANT, Gov. FENTON, the ladies and others. The party returned to the city, reaching the place of starting at about 7 o'clock P.M., joyful at having made so many happy for a single day. Having concluded their labors at the hospital, the ladies will now turn their attention to the widows and children of deceased soldiers in the city, and any help afforded them will be gratefully received.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Dinner to the Wounded and Sick Soldiers at David's Island Hospital."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Dinner to the Wounded and Sick Soldiers at David's Island Hospital."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c9db2502-0384-50b6-82b8-63cc9610acab,411,nyt://article/c9db2502-0384-50b6-82b8-63cc9610acab

The ocean was scoured by Anglo-rebel privateers, which had almost driven American merchantmen from the great marine highways. The certain rupture of the republic invited bets of ten to one against us in the London and Liverpool and Paris Exchange. Rebel emissaries were admitted at various European courts on a footing practically, if not officially, on terms of greater intimacy than the duly accredited representatives of the United States.

"A correspondent of the Irishman writes: ""In connection with the story now afloat that the Head Centre effected his escape in an open fishing-boat, it is currently reported that this political observed of all observers (though it would appear 'for the edification of the detectives,' as he himself said, not at present to be observed by them) said to the captain, who was apprehensive in the storm, and knew not the name of his celebrated passenger -- 'fear not, for thou carriest STEPHENS and all his fortunes,' which was no sooner uttered, than the astounded fisherman, who was of course of the Fenny tribe, felt himself, in like manner as his historic predecessor of old emboldened with renewed energy, set to his task and accomplished it successfully.

His Message on Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/30/archives/the-presidents-message-in-europe.html,His Message on Europe,"The treatment of Foreign Affairs by President JOHNSON, in his annual message, has been received with as general favor abroad as was accorded in this country to his treatment of domestic affairs. Its dignified, moderate and statesmanlike character is recognized, and its pacific tone is pointed out and warmly praised. It is evident there was an expectation that the message would have assumed somewhat of a belligerent style in its discussion of our English and French relations; but neither with regard to claims against England, nor Mexican intervention, can a threatening phrase be found. President JOHNSON, as one of the journals remarks, has been denounced in Europe as a violent, sanguinary, restless demagogue, only eager for a cause of quarrel with other nations; but though no better cause is likely to present itself than has been within his reach, he exhibits no eagerness to plunge into war. The Star philosophically sets forth a principle which we have from time to time attempted of late to enforce, when it says that the President ""has apparently arrived at the conclusion that the refusal of National demands does not necessarily require an immediate appeal to arms; that nations may differ, even about important questions, without hurling their armies to mutual destruction, and striving to crimson the sea with blood.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The President's Message in Europe."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The President's Message in Europe."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c98adcab-4244-5af4-be85-64902cf9d3a2,641,nyt://article/c98adcab-4244-5af4-be85-64902cf9d3a2

We take this occasion to say that, while we still think the reasons assigned by the Governor wholly insufficient to warrant his veto, we have never for a moment intended to impeach the integrity of his action or to question the entire sincerity of his opinions. And we concur in the position that having once returned the bill to the Secretary of State with his disapproval, it was wholly beyond his control. We trust the matter will be presented early this session in such a form as to command the prompt approval of both the legislative and executive departments of the government, for the work is of the utmost importance to the city.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BILL OF LAST WINTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BILL OF LAST WINTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9fa285c-d63e-5069-9f1f-135f54e95b02,148,nyt://article/d9fa285c-d63e-5069-9f1f-135f54e95b02

We found there (as also in the other city papers) that the Constitution had arrived at this port on Wednesday, in company, or at least on the same day, with the Leo and the San Salvador, all of them having left Savannah on the Saturday previous. Turning to our advertisements we found that ""the Constitution, which was advertised to sail on Saturday, Dec. 30, has been unavoidably withdrawn, and the Nightingale will take her place."" As ""unavoidably withdrawn"" could not reasonably mean ""lost at sea,"" we concluded that she might be wanting repairs, and was of course, in port, where the ship-news men had placed her.

The buoys at the end of it are washed away, ""but this,"" writes Mr. SEWARD, ""is of no consequence, as they were intended only for a temporary purpose, the spot for grapnelling having been laid down by solar observations, so that a good navigator can at any time sail to within half a mile of the broken cable.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Cable Several Hundred Miles Already Completed.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Cable Several Hundred Miles Already Completed.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0da1e322-0810-594a-9a34-bd3ea53a0c36,160,nyt://article/0da1e322-0810-594a-9a34-bd3ea53a0c36

Prince Albert; Fourth Anniversary of His Death and the Queen's Visit to His Tomb,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/31/archives/fourth-anniversary-of-prince-alberts-death.html,Prince Albert; Fourth Anniversary of His Death and the Queen's Visit to His Tomb,"Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the Prince Consort's death, and the occasion was observed at Windsor with more than usual solemnity by Her Majesty the Queen and the various members of the royal family. In the morning Her Majesty and the rest of the members of the royal family who were at the Castle repaired to the Mausoleum of the late Prince Consort, in the grounds of Frogmore-lodge. The interior of this magnificent place of sculpture had been previously prepared for the Queen's reception, a number of chairs, &c., having been sent from the Castle for the purpose, while the steps leading to the entrance of the porch were covered with a crimson carpet. A very solemn service, at which the Hon. and Very Rev. the Dean of Windsor officiated, was performed in the chamber beneath the dome, wherein has the temporary stone sarcophagus containing the mortal remains of the late Prince Consort. Her Majesty was deeply affected at the solemn ceremony, and having, with the other members of the royal family, strewn the sarcophagus with chaplets of immortelles, laurestinas and chrysanthemums, retired from the tomb shortly after 11 o'clock. By Her Majesty's gracious command the domestics of the royal household and the Castle tradespeople and their families were permitted to visit the Mausoleum between the hours of 12 and 4. Admission could only be obtained by ticket, the entrance to Frogmore being guarded by the Palace police. The visitors were, however, extremely numerous, and there was a constant stream of people passing between the Long Walk and the grounds during the time fixed for the admission. Yesterday the centeal chamber, containing the temporary sarcophagus, was partially carpeted, and choice exotics and flowering plants, such as white azalias, chrysanthemums, &c., were placed round the interior of the Mausoleum in profusion and with excellent effect. Since the last anniversary great progress has been made with the internal decorations, but the greater part of this was concealed from the gaze of the visitors, portions of the boarding being still up. One of the recesses or chapels abutting upon the central chamber, was, however, shown. The arched ceiling of this recess is decorated with an exquisitely painted picture of Christ bearing the Cross, while two of the side panels are ornamented with sculptured bas-reliefs of white marble, the subjects being the ""Expulsion of Adam and Eve"" and ""Moses Lifting up the Serpent in the Wilderness."" From the ceiling depends a finely worked brass chandalier, with several lamps attached to it. The other recesses are, it is said, also in a forward state. The ceiling of the dome (which is lighted by windows) is of a blue color, powdered with gold stars, the centre being occupied by a rich ornament. The marble floor beneath the centre of the dome has yet to be finished, and till this is completed the granite sarcophagus cannot be used for the reception of the Prince's remains.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Fourth Anniversary of Prince Albert's Death."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Fourth Anniversary of Prince Albert's Death."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'Form the London Times, Dec. 15', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Dec', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e0222f6-fc03-5079-8628-8ccc8aa1c3e3,489,nyt://article/5e0222f6-fc03-5079-8628-8ccc8aa1c3e3

"ago the London playgoers were deligted with a French actress who played Juliet at the Princess' Theatre -- a Mademoiselle STELLA-COLAS. This lady has just been the heroine of a romantic history in St. Petersburgh. It appears that a young physician of St. Petersburgh -- a M. KATALINSKY -- fell violently in love with the charming actress, and as her character was irreproachable, offered her marriage. He was not rejected at once, but time for consideration was asked, and after the expiration of that time a further delay, and so on until four years had gone by -- Mdlle. STELLA finding always some protext for delay. All these hindrances only increased the love of this young doctor, who at last wrote to have a final answer to his suit. This came in the shape of a peremptory refusal whereupon M. KATALINSKY wrote a farewell letter to Mlle. STELLA, telling her that when she received it he would be dead. Terrified at this, she sent in all haste the editor of a French journal which is published in St. Petersburgh to remonstrate with her despairing lover. He was too late, however. After a few minutes' conversation, M. KATALINSKY fell dead in to the arms of his visitor. The people of St. Petersburgh burgh have shown a rather strong feeling against Mlle. STELLA, and it is said that she will probably return to France very shortly. It is not absolutely certain, according to the correspondent of the Independance, whether the doctor died of a broken heart or from poison. Whichever it was, love was certainly the proximate cause of this death. -- London Star, Dec. 9.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/31/archives/a-tragedy-off-the-stage.html,,"ago the London playgoers were deligted with a French actress who played Juliet at the Princess' Theatre -- a Mademoiselle STELLA-COLAS.

KATALINSKY -- fell violently in love with the charming actress, and as her character was irreproachable, offered her marriage. He was not rejected at once, but time for consideration was asked, and after the expiration of that time a further delay, and so on until four years had gone by -- Mdlle. STELLA finding always some protext for delay. All these hindrances only increased the love of this young doctor, who at last wrote to have a final answer to his suit. This came in the shape of a peremptory refusal whereupon M. KATALINSKY wrote a farewell letter to Mlle. STELLA, telling her that when she received it he would be dead. Terrified at this, she sent in all haste the editor of a French journal which is published in St. Petersburgh to remonstrate with her despairing lover. He was too late, however. After a few minutes' conversation, M. KATALINSKY fell dead in to the arms of his visitor. The people of St. Petersburgh burgh have shown a rather strong feeling against Mlle. STELLA, and it is said that she will probably return to France very shortly. It is not absolutely certain, according to the correspondent of the Independance, whether the doctor died of a broken heart or from poison. Whichever it was, love was certainly the proximate cause of this death. -- London Star, Dec. 9.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A TRAGEDY OFF THE STAGE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A TRAGEDY OFF THE STAGE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6bab614c-cb45-5eb7-8ff4-594355959b93,274,nyt://article/6bab614c-cb45-5eb7-8ff4-594355959b93

"-- Nearly all the nettles are possessed of a very strong and silky inner bark. The common nettle (U. dwica) has been used almost from time immemorial as a fibrous plant, and not only do the inhabitants of Siberia make from it the cordage for their nets, but in Piedmont the fibre is converted into a kind of linen cloth. We possess thread lace of excellent quality, which had no more aristocratic origin than the common stinging-nettle. The Puya (Bahmeria puya) of Darjeeling, and the China-grass (Bahmeria nivia) of Assam, China, &c., are nettles which yield fibres unsurpassed for strength, are easily bleached, and may be converted into the finest linen in the same manner as flax. The Neilgherry nettle is also useful in a similar manner. Indeed scarcely a nettle has yet been found growing to a sufficient size which does not yield an excellent fibre for spinning or rope-making. Returning again to our common species, we learn that the roots have not only been used in domestic medicine, but that when boiled with alum a coloring matter is developed, which has been employed to dye yarn yellow. The young shoots, when boiled, are by no means to be despised as greons. In Manchester, and some other parts of Lancashire and the North, ""nettle beer"" is as well known and appreciated as ""ginger-pop."" Fowls are said to be fond of picking up the seeds and eating them, and if the whole plant is cut down and given to cows as food, it is declared to increase the quantity and improve the quality of their milk; and if strongly salted, the same much abused plant may be used as a substitute for rennet in making cheese. So that were we to try our best, we could hardly meet with a more useful plant than the nettle, not a fragment of which need be wasted, but all may be applied to some economic purpose. Not only is this true of one species, but also of the majority, although they offer no attractions of sweet odors, bright colors, or hand, some flowers, they are, in spite of their stings, good servants to man who abuses them. -- Hardwicke's Science Gossip.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/31/archives/the-uses-of-nettles.html,,"-- Nearly all the nettles are possessed of a very strong and silky inner bark.

GIFFORD, son of Mr. ELLIS GIFFORD, aged about 16 years, broke through the thin ice, and but for the heroic exertions of his comrades would have been drowned. The other lads immediately took off their coats and comforters, and tying them together formed a line which they threw to young GIFFORD. The latter grasped it, but finding it slipping through his wet buckskin gloves, caught it between his teeth, and was being drawn out when one of the coats parted, and the lad sank, as his comrades thought, to rise no more. He rose, however, soon after, when they threw the end of the line to which the comforters were tied, toward him, which he caught, telling them to pull quick as he could not hold out much longer. They did so, and succeeded in drawing him out almost exhausted, having been in the water some fifteen minutes.

The evening previous to his death the Duchess of BRABANT contrived to attach a medal of the Virgin around the neck of her father-in-law while he slept; he did not remove it, but steadily refused to see a priest. As soon as the King had breathed his last, the Duke of BRABANT sent for the Groom of the Chambers in Waiting, and strictly enjoined him to forbid the royal servants to address him by any title but that of Royal Highness. The Duchess likewise impressed the same commands on her household. The idea was probably suggested by the fact that Dr. WIMMER, who was in attendance at the bedside of the King, announced His Majesty having breathed his last to his son, thus: ""Le Roi[???]est mort, Sire,"" an amount of flunkeyism worthy of the best days of the Grand Monarque, so appropriately denominated ""Le Roi Soliel.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Anecdotes of the Late King of the Belgians.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Anecdotes of the Late King of the Belgians.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Belgium', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cdc42ecf-8c38-5f79-813e-633db3a4bcbd,450,nyt://article/cdc42ecf-8c38-5f79-813e-633db3a4bcbd

I desire the freedmen of St. Mary to prove to their employers that they are capable of making an honest living, and are determined to do so. We must all work or starve. No one will support us in idleness. I now advise the freedmen of the Parish of St. Mary, all of them, to make agreements at once for the coming year. They must not wait to see what others are going to do. Each one must look out for himself and family.

His first appearance in national politics was as Representative from a Maryland district in the Thirty-fourth Congress. He was reelected the two following terms, serving through all on the Committee of Ways and Means. On the breaking out of the rebellion, Mr. DAVIS, though a man of strong Southern feeling, remained faithful to the government, and exerted his great influence and personal popularity to keep his native State from joining in the secession movement. For this course he was exposed to much abuse and misrepresentation from old associates and friends; but he was happy in living to witness, in the triumph of right and the reestablishment of the Union, the complete vindication of his course.

All the detention prisons in New-York and Brooklyn have been repeatedty visited during the month, with a watchful eye to their improvement in ventilation, cleanliness, order and classification. Missionaries and tract visitors have been supplied to a considerable, extent with religious newspapers, tracts, testaments, prayer-books, temperance publications, and other good reading matter. The Judges of the Criminal Courts are reported as listening respectfully to the agent's applications, the instances being rare in which a deaf ear is turned to his suggestions and recommendations, a remark applying especially to the United States courts. Sixteen discharged convicts were provided with situations during the month, and thirteen with more or less clothing. The general agent also presented a tabular statement of the work done in the detention and discharged convict departments during the year 1865, from which it appears that 6,400 persons in our detention prisons, poor and friendless, have been visited and counseled; 1,081 complaints, in which extenuating circumstances were apparent, have been carefully examined; 303 of the above complaints were abandoned at the instance of the agent, the persons complained of being either innocent or young, or first offenders; 324 persons have been discharged from custody on similar grounds; 1,305 discharged convicts have been aided pecuniarily; 171 of the same class have been provided with permanent situations, where they are earning an honest living; and 178 have been supplied with clothing.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prison Association of New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prison Association of New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd5c892d-8be5-52f6-bbcc-47fb2df63610,512,nyt://article/fd5c892d-8be5-52f6-bbcc-47fb2df63610
