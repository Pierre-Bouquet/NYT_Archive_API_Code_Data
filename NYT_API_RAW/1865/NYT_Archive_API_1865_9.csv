"The police returns, yesterday, reported a compliant which had been preferred by Mr. MOSES ADLER, of No. 173 Stanton-street, for robbery in the first degree. Mr. ADLER makes affidavit that between 9 and 10 o'clock yesterday morning, while he was passing through Ridge-street, near Broome, a young ruffian sprang upon him, and, grasping his throat with one hand, attempted with the other to steal his wallet from his pantaloons pocket. Mr. ADLER struggled with the robber, and, releasing himself from his clutch, fled into a butcher's shop across the street; but the fellow, not to be foiled, pursued him and made a second attempt, and might have succeeded, but for the interference of the butcher. The bandit now fled, and was in turn pursued by Mr. ADLER and the buthcer until they reached a street corner near which Policeman MURRAY was patrolling, and the alarm being given him, he headed off the fugitive, and with a number of well directed blows with his baton, brought him to terms. At court the prisoner described himself as WILLIAM FISHER, peddler, 22 years of age. The magistrate, having listened to the testimony, declined to accept bail, and committed him for trial. Mr. ADLER's wallet contained $2,000 in treasury notes. The foregoing is the police account.

In the running of these wheels it will be seen that they cling to the track with tenfold the usual tenacity, the outer flange coming into immediate action on an abrupt curve, and the force of the strain, as well as friction, being equally distributed between rails, wheels and ends of axles. The whole superstructure is vastly strengthened thereby, this improvement insuring safety to life, limb and property, and immunity from accident arising from ordinary causes, such as running off the track. It is not pretended that this wheel will prevent collisions, the reckless infringement of the rules of railroads, or the criminal displacement of rails, or ties, or obstructions heaped upon the track by the malicious and evil disposed. These cannot be classed under the head of ordinary causes of accidents. Nearly two-thirds of the accidents resulting in loss of life and property (it is a well known fact) have been caused by the throwing of cars from the track when running at a full rate of speed.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Double Flange Railroad Car Wheels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Double Flange Railroad Car Wheels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2af2583a-b0f2-56f1-8d78-eeec32e6879d,389,nyt://article/2af2583a-b0f2-56f1-8d78-eeec32e6879d

The engine-driver is placed forward of the boiler, directly over the spot where the smoke-chimney of the engines now in use are placed. The fireman still will retain his station behind the boiler. The boiler being of an entirely different form from these in use at the present time, will enable the locomotive water-tank and coal-box to be in one continuous frame, so that there will be no tender. The cylinder will be 20 inches in diameter, with 26-inch stroke of piston. The valve-motion and cut-off will be on a new plan. Great things are expected of this new arrangement, and certainly in these days of railroad accidents, it seems right and proper that the engine-driver should be so placed as to receive, the first fruits of his negligence.

It seems to have been a slight trouble to the republican inhabitants of that country for the last fifty odd years, that their Presidents have usually undertaken to sit for a longer term than they were elected. Several of them, to avoid the trouble of a reelection, have continued to hold on to office till they died. One of them took to the Imperial purple, and reigned in the most approved Imperial style as long as his sable subjects would allow him. The present President, FABRE JEFFRARD, although constitutionally elected, has, it is said, the same lofty ambition as his predecessor, SOULOUQUE, and has taken the same steps to deprive the citizens of Hayti of their rights. He is charged with having made a concordat with Rome, for the express purpose of having an Archbishop appointed to crown him. He has absorbed all the gold and silver in his special coffers, and given the citizens worthless promissory notes in exchange. He summarily tries and hangs those who oppose his pretensions, without recourse to any civil process. And he maintains a rigid system of hostility to the foreign resident population. Foreigners are placed under the most serious disabilities. They cannot even intermarry with the natives; and many equally desirable privileges are denied them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Revolution Among the Haytians.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Revolution Among the Haytians.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/92beb7a6-acf6-5dfd-beaa-86ebb11a4076,494,nyt://article/92beb7a6-acf6-5dfd-beaa-86ebb11a4076

(New-York: HARPER Brothers) gives us the conclusion of ""A Trip to Bodies' Bluff and the Dead Sea of the West,"" a paper both cleverly written and illustrated. ""Miss Pink's First Season,"" a sketch of fashionable life, evidently of English origin, but awkwardly altered in the attempt to fit it to New-York localities, &c. ""Sketches of Social Life in China,"" with many queer-looking illustrations from the artists of the celestial empire. ""Milfort,"" an account of the singular career of a French adventurer among the Creek Indians, who afterward became a general in the Imperial service, by J.T. HEADLEY. ""Recollections of an Old Fogy,"" abridged in an unnecessary rude and illnatured tone, from the reminiscences of Capt. GRONOW; the usual variety of short stories and poetry and further installments of ""Armadale,"" and ""Our Mutual Friend."" Mystery continues to thicken around the fortunes of the dramatis personae of the former story, somewhat indeed to the exclusion of anything like healthy, open daylight feeling of reality in the plot and its actors. They are too much like lay figures or puppets put into startling positions at the call of their showman, WILKIE COLLINS. DICKENS is preparing to wind up the tangled thread of his narration, and in the present number disposes of two of his characters by an almost impromptu marriage, and prepares the way for getting rid of two more by hints of a coming murder that looms grimly in the distance.

"Patrick Rafferty, a laborer, aged 30, was charged with stealing $29, the property of William Burke.

We have not even the honor of his acquaintance. No unworthy motive can, therefore, be attributed to us when we call attention to the disgraceful state of affairs which some of our most trustworthy policemen feel impelled to charge as existing in his court. We know that our Police Justices have a thankless task to perform at best, and all good citizens should sustain them as long as they have the shadow of right on their side. But when one of these police courts has been, and continues to be prostituted at the will of a junta of ward politicians, and given over absolutely into the hands of a gang of thieves, it clearly appears to us that the fact should be made known to the public.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Mockery of Law The Manner of Conducting Business in the Essex Police Court.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Mockery of Law The Manner of Conducting Business in the Essex Police Court.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6288cc7-ca17-57dc-a373-4795eda33aeb,932,nyt://article/e6288cc7-ca17-57dc-a373-4795eda33aeb

The first game played at Hoboken was won by the Actives, by a score of 27 to 12, but yesterday the Enterprise boys did better. Both clubs had out good nine, although the Actives were minus the services of WALKER, their pitcher, and ROGERS, right fielder, STOCKMAN taking WALKER'S position, while CRAWFORD played short, and HATFIELD, (a new accession from the Gothams,) played rightfield. The Enterprise were short of their regular catcher, DICK going behind in his place. The game opened favorably for the Actives, but the Brooklyn boys soon obtained the lead, and held it up to the end of the fifth inning, when the score stood 14 to 13. In the next four innings the Actives added fifteen to their score, while they allowed their opponents to make only four. The playing on both sides was very good, ""Redman,"" of the Actives, making a pretty one-hand catch, putting out two players; KELLEY, though still suffering from the severe sprain he received in Philadelphia, marked his play with a nicely taken fly-tip from the bat, which was decidedly ""red hot."" HATFIELD fielded and batted well, as he always does, and made two home runs, while ""Arthur,"" ROONEY and CRAWFORD played their respective positions in good style. Of the play on the Enterprise side, COOK, JEWELL and MURDOCH did very well in the field, the two latter each making a home run. Owing to the absenee of their regular catcher, the Enterprise were weak in their base playing, the Actives running them all with impunity. Mr. SUTTON, of the Atlantic Club, acted as umpire, and discharged his duties in an exceedingly impartial manner.

"DIFFICULTY BETWEEN WHITE AND COLORED SOLDIERS NEAR BURKESVILLE JUNCTION. -- Monday afternoon, an affray, which might have resulted more seriously under other circumstances, occurred at the Junction of the Danville and Southside Railroad.

At the Junction the troops disembarked to take the Southside train. One of the negro guards preambulating the platform, is said to have remarked, ""I wish I could get a sight of one of dem Louisiana rebels,"" or words to that effect.

Chinese Emigration to U. S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/03/archives/the-growth-of-the-united-states-through-emigrationthe-chinese.html,Chinese Emigration to U. S.,"It is very often said that the great thing needed for the development of our country is a full supply of labor. With abundant labor, the vast and uncultivated surfaces of the great West might be made to produce unparalleled crops of all the cereals used as food by man. With abundant labor, our vast mining Territories, whose mineral wealth, with our present population, will not even be explored for centuries, might quickly be made to disgorge their golden crops. With abundant labor, the vast spaces of the South, which, under present circumstances, will not be reduced to cultivation for ages, would produce untold crops of cotton, and rice, and sugar, and tobacco, not to speak of tea and silk and other articles, to the growth of which it is so admirably adapted. Take for example, the State of Texas -- had it an abundance of labor, instead of its present limited crop of cotton, it is estimated that it could easily produce five millions of bales per annum, or a quantity greater than was ever grown in the entire South in any one year. Take the State of Nevada -- had it an abundance of labor, instead of the thirty millions worth of silver and gold, which it will give us this year, it could be made to produce three hundred millions, or more than a tenth of the entire debt of the nation. Take the fertile State of Louisiana -- how much greater would be its production of the elements of national wealth, had it instead of its small number of inhabitants, a population of three millions which it could easily sustain. Had we ten times our present population, we should soon have a hundred times our present wealth and power.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Growth of the United States through Emigration--The Chinese.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Growth of the United States through Emigration--The Chinese.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8f3734c-ac0e-5b01-bd95-250ea93a514e,1105,nyt://article/c8f3734c-ac0e-5b01-bd95-250ea93a514e

S.; Eight Years in Congress",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/04/archives/new-books-memoir-of-the-life-of-william-shakespeare-with-an-essay.html,"White's, R. G., Manner of the Life of Shakespeare; Lambert's, F. L. Systematic Human Physiology; Raymond's, Hon. H. J., Life of Abraham Lincoln; Cox, Hon. S. S.; Eight Years in Congress","As a student and editor Of SHAKESPEARE, Mr. GRANT WHITE has acquired fame and reputation in the two countries where the ""Great Bard"" rules supreme over the realms of literature. His edition of SHAKESPEARE's works has met with general approbation, and -- when the first volume (necessary for its completion) has appeared -- his impression may be regarded as the most elegant and sympathetic contribution to Shakesperean criticism that this nation has produced. The work before us is not, as many may imagine, the long missing volume I of the ""Works;"" that will contain SHAKESPEARE's poems and a condensation of some of the biographical and historical matter, here presented in a graceful and classical shape, as a separate and independent introduction to the study of SHAKESPEARE. Viewed in this light, we think it is destined to meet with great success. It is not a controversial book -- a point certainly in its favor. Every fact and supposition current respecting SHAKESPEARE, has long been a battle-ground for succeeding editors, each bent upon discrediting their rivals' hypothesis, and eager to trumpet forth any trifling addition to the shreds and fragments that constitute our meagre stock of information respecting the dramatist. Divested of doubtful and spurious additions, the ascertained facts of his career are few and isolated, so that Mr. GRANT WHITE has need of all his ingenuity to weave them into a continuous narrative. With some obvious inconsistency, he is severe on the ""laborious men who have wasted sunlight and candles and worn good eyes in poring over sentences as murky as the parchments on which they were written, and as dry as the dust which covered them,"" in pursuit of knowledge respecting SHAKESPEARE's personal history. Yet to these very diggers and delvers into antiquity, and the facts they produce from ""parish registers, old account-books, inventories, last wills and testaments, leases, deeds, bonds, declarations,"" &c., he is indebted for the documentary materials of his biography; for all, indeed, that depends upon anything more certain than the vague and shifting breath of popular tradition. To explain the double life that SHAKESPEARE must have led, is of course beyond the power of any commentator, with our present materials only at command, and probably will never be rightly understood. How the man, as known to his fellows -- companionable, genial and jocular, indeed, but at the same time, sharp, thrifty, business-like and hard in money matters; who left the intellectual world of the metropolis without a pang as soon as a reasonable fortune was secured by steady pursuit of the main chance, to bury himself among the petty interests and narrow bovine instincts of a Boetian neighborhood -- how this man could be one and the same with he whose ""shaping spirit of imagination"" broods like an intellectual presence at once over the minds of the highest and lowest of those who speak his language, winning their glad suffrages to his immeasurable mental superiority, as they feel the larger life he lends to an ennobled nation -- is indeed a mystery passing our present skill in psychology to explain. One key to a knowledge of his inner life exists, however, in the ""Sonnets;"" revelations that seem wrung from the depths of his inmost nature, but comparatively useless to our purpose for want of the clue that should guide us in applying them toward the illustration of their writer's career. In Mr. GRANT WHITE's memoir every available source of information has been carefully examined. In his natural desire to people the empty canvass of his sketch he lends a more favorable ear to many of the petty local traditions -- all inspired apparently by a desire to bring down SHAKESPEARE to the dead level of his country neighbors -- than we should be disposed to do. The notices of SHAKESPEARE by his contemporaries are given at greater length than we have elsewhere seen them; no collateral stores, indeed, have been neglected, and the memoir consequently assumes a completeness to which it is to be feared that few additions may be expected. The careful study given to the subject by the author leads him to the positive conclusion that ""even to SHAKESPEARE, with his surpassing genius, his worldly wisdom, his prudence and his thrift, all culminating in a success which made him the mark of envy at the end, as he had been at the beginning of his career, life was unsatisfying. He returned to Stratford a disappointed man."" The grounds for this conclusion must be sought in the biography. Other new views will be found in it, and ingenious applications of circumstances never before brought to bear in their full significance on the poet's life. The second portion of the work, entitled (it seems to us rather awkwardly) an Essay Toward the Expression of Shakespeare's Genius, is written from a good old English standpoint, and will be refreshing to those who have toiled through the German commentators, in the wild hope of condensing some substantial information from the fog-banks of verbiage that they raise around any subject they may discuss. The favorite catchwords ""organic life,"" ""objective,"" ""subjective,"" &c., are never once made use of, we believe, nor can it be said that they are greatly missed. The author, indeed, avows ""his abiding faith, which no criticism that I have yet seen has shaken, that most of those who read SHAKESPEARE worthily and lovingly, understand what he meant, as thoroughly as COLERIDGE did, or as GERVINUS does, with all their metaphysics and philosophy."" To afford the means of judging SHAKESPEARE's merits as an writer and as a dramatist, and to explain intelligently the characteristics that distinguish him from others of the like pursuits, is the object of the essay. It is achieved, in a manner to please the great majority of readers. An Account of the Rise and Progress of the English Drama to the Time of Shakespeare, is a fitting introduction to the study of his writings, showing the normal condition of things around him; how far his works took form and color from his contemporaries, and how far they themselves advanced toward perfection a rude and unsharpened species of composition then in a lusty and struggling infancy. The account is naturally founded on, and in some measure coincides with, Mr. COLLIER's History of the Early Drama in England, but is the fruit of independent research, and the shape into which it is thrown renders it more inviting to the general reader than any previous statement of the facts has been, altogether, Mr. GRANT WHITE's volume is creditable to the taste, tact and intelligence of the writer, as much as its elegant outward form evinces the enlightened cooperation of his publisher. A few misprints and trifling errors may be detected by microscopic scrutiny, but it would be invidious to particularize them, in a volume that does honor to all concerned in it.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; MEMOIR OF THE LIFE OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

The robbery was committed at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at a public restaurant, and the waiter, that is, the culprit, was an entire stranger in the city, having but lately come here from Constantinople. Shortly after the commission of the deed, information of it was conveyed to Police Headquarters, and Chief JOHN YOUNG, with the sagacity and promptitude which have given him such a great reputation, at once detailed three of his best detective officers (Messrs. FARLEY, VAUGHAN and TIEMAN) to work up the case. The culprit had fled immediately upon committing the robbery, and there was hardly a clue of any kind by which he could be traced up. Nevertheless, so admirably did the detectives do their work, that in four hours from the commission of the crime, and after a search extending over miles of the city, both the thief and the $4,000 he had stolen were in the hands of the officers of justice.

It will be time enough to set about this part of the business of reconstruction when Mississippi has resumed her place in the Union. At present there is enough to occupy Gov. SHARKEY in the reestablishment of the civil machinery of the State. The military requirements of the hour will be fully met by Gen. SLOCUM's army. And by postponing the equipment of a local militia until Mississippi has her representatives in Congress, as formerly, all conflict of authority will be avoided. They can be no real friends of the State who present the temporary disability which this arrangement implies, as a political grievance. Mississippi has only the disbanded Confederate soldiers of the State, from whom she can fill up the militia ranks.

"Registry Law, The Annual Democratic Shriek Upon",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/05/archives/the-annual-shriek.html,"Registry Law, The Annual Democratic Shriek Upon","Democratic papers in this State are opening in the usual annual form upon the Registry Law. That law has already prevented a great deal of illegal voting, and by just about the same extent the Democratic majorities in their strongholds have fallen off. Last session the law was amended, mainly with a view to prevent obstruction at the polls, so as to require voters to be absolutely registered before the day of election. In reality this provision shuts off a crowd of latter-day saints who were too busy to get registered, or had some other convenient excuse, but who regularly came to the polls to swear in their votes. A great many of them were not entitled to vote, but in the hurry and bustle of the poll they took the oath which they dared not venture before the cooler scrutiny of a Board of Registry. The Democratic wrath at the choking off of these useful citizens is most furious. With characteristic effrontery they denounce the law as ""unconstitutional,"" and quote the qualifications for voters as being all the constitution says upon the subject. They know well enough, as they quote the first two sections, that the fourth section of the same article says : ""Laws shall be made for ascertaining, by proper proofs, the citizens who shall be entitled to the right of suffrage hereby established."" We do not look for honesty in arguments against a Registry law; but when they quote from the constitution, they might at least remember that others also can read that document, and that there are a great many good citizens who distinctly remember that the words we have quoted were put in the constitution expressly to give the power which these brazen fellows say does not exist.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Annual Shriek.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Annual Shriek.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b508738a-07ee-500e-b929-ee3c37d39f34,294,nyt://article/b508738a-07ee-500e-b929-ee3c37d39f34

On Sunday evening, about 8 o'clock, as these soldiers were passing Richmond Terrace, New-Brighton, they fired two shots at a young man named JOHN HOLT, a carpenter by trade, and a mother's only son. One ball was sent through his temple and lodged in his brain, the other took effect in his shoulder. He was alive on Monday morning at 5 o'clock, but the doctor could render him no possible assistance. A second doctor was called to aid the Buffering young man if possible. Immediately after the man was shot, several of the neighbors saw the soldiers move slowly off from the murdered man seemingly quite unconcerned. They entered the woods and concealed them selves there. Hundreds of men in the neighborhood are scouring the woods, and the ferries are guarded on all sides. So excited are those in pursuit of the two murderers, that report says they will be shot down at sight.

Leschot's Annular Drill,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/06/archives/the-annular-drill.html,Leschot's Annular Drill,"We were present yesterday at a series of experiments with the newly invented annular drill, for blasting and mining purposes. To say that the tests applied were successful, is to say all that is necessary; but our readers may not know exactly what the annular drill is, so we will explain. The term ""annular (or circular) describes the manner of cutting the rock by diamonds, firmly set in the edge of a tubular crown or cylinder with a rotary and direct forward movement, cutting a circular groove, destroying but little of the rock, and leaving a core which is easily removed. When applied to the stone and set in motion, a stream of water is turned on and the thing is complete. With very moderate power this drill will bore three inches per minute, and can be made to bore two inches every minute of the day's work. Diamonds are the hardest of all known substances, and have been used for cutting other stones, like the onyx, sapphire, &c., from the earliest dates. More recently they have been found to be the most efficient and successful cutting instrument for dressing Burr millstones, but it has remained for modern engineering science to develop their highest practical value. In 1860 M. RODOLPH LESCHOT, a civil engineer of Geneva, Switzerland, resident in Paris, undertook a series of experiments for the purpose of discovering some method of perforating rock with more rapidity than can be accomplished in the usual method by percussion. After repeated trial he found the diamond the only substance with which he could arm his cutting tool so as to enable him to attack the hardest rocks, like granite and porphyry, with success. Patents having been granted the inventor in the United States the Annular Drill Company of New-York, became the proprietors, and have had a steam machine in operation for more than three months past. Granite, gneiss, North River blue stone, sandstone and marble have been pierced with remarkable success.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Annular Drill.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Annular Drill.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10cbae67-b52f-528f-a3c0-40fdee8eb817,330,nyt://article/10cbae67-b52f-528f-a3c0-40fdee8eb817

Accordingly, the engines were again started, and sufficient speed was attained to give the boat steerage-way.

The cattle disease is spreading over England, though the measures taken for its suppression seem to have lessened it in some localities. There is naturally serious alarm in Ireland, which has become to a great extent a grazing country, and from which cattle to the amount of £8,000,000 are annually imported into England, large numbers of which are sent there to be fattened. To keep out the disease it is proposed to stop this importation. The friends of the Atlantic cable keep up stout heart, and are resolved to lay another wire next year.

Of course, they must do the latter, for it is inexorably forced by the triumph of the government. But the admission of the fact that secession is a failure is in itself no recognition that its principle is an error. President JOHNSON, in his reconstruction plan, requires but two conditions -- an abandonment of slavery, and an oath to support the Constitution of the United States. He makes no account of the fact that it has been claimed that this constitution itself does not exclude the right of peaceable secession. He exacts no pledge that any particular construction of the constitution shall be accepted; and in no way does he insist upon any abjuration of the false constitutional doctrines upon which the rebellion rested its justification before the world. He leaves that for the Southern States to do of their own accord, if they so please. The work of reconstruction which occupies him is a business of facts, not theories; and it was wisdom in him to confine himself to a practical restoration of the South, irrespective of any speculative ideas which the South might still hold in reserve.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Repudiation of the Right of Secession-- The Mississippi Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Repudiation of the Right of Secession-- The Mississippi Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mississippi', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SECESSION', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c409a3cb-ed4d-53b4-839f-4b5b24891156,1270,nyt://article/c409a3cb-ed4d-53b4-839f-4b5b24891156

"Parkes, Joseph, of London",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/06/archives/death-of-mr-joseph-parkes.html,"Parkes, Joseph, of London","Few figures were better known in Pall Mall, and about the Houses of Parliament, than that of Mr. JOSEPH PARKES. He belonged to the Liberal side in politics, and in the midst of his party held a position of considerable influence. Few men in a secondary position were more trusted than he, few had a larger circle of friends, few were more completely in the current and full tide of political life. He had in his day been an ardent political soldier; he had entered with all his heart into the battle for reform, and from that time forward he held in the great Whig army a place, if not of command, yet of trust and influence. Perhaps no man was better acquainted than he with the secret history of politics during the last 30 or 40 years. Latterly, he was an important link of connection between the steady-going Whigs and the swifter-going Radicals. He was on the most intimate terms with every section of the Liberal party. He was not only an earnest politician, he was an excellent lawyer: and he had literary tastes, faculty and ambition. Any one who, without knowing him, saw him two or three times in the Reform Club, or slouching along Pall-mall, slightly bent with years, would soon discover what manner of man he was. He seemed to know every second person he met, and not only to know him but to be on confidential terms with him, and to have something particular to say to him. He always seemed to have somebody by the buttonhole, and to be engaged in secret conclave. There was a question to be put, or a question to be answered, and who so ready as Mr. PARKES? If anybody on his side of politics wanted information whether of the past or of the present, Mr. PARKES was the man to apply to. If he could not at once give it he could get it. So people clung about him, and he was a most useful man in his party -- useful not only because he was so well informed and had such a wide circle of friends, but also because his judgment was of the soundest, and he was ever active and loyal in offices of friendship. What was particularly pleasant about him was that to the craft of a good politician he united the blunt sincerity of a frank, honest, kindly man. JOSEPH PARKES was born at Warwick on the 22d of January, 1796. He went to a school at Worcester, and afterwards to the Glasgow University; but in his general reading Dr. PARR, who took a great interest in him, directed his studies and recommended a course to which he rigidly adhered. His reading in this course was of the widest range, and comprehended many works that lie quite out of the beaten path. He chose his path in life as a solicitor, and saving gone through a course of training of the highest kind, started in Birmingham first by himself, and afterward in partnership with Mr. SOLOMON BRAY, the first Town-clerk of the Corporation of Birmingham. At the time of the Birmingham Political Union, Mr. PARKES was adviser to Mr. ATWOOD, the leader of that movement. He did not quite approve its tendency, but at a later period in the tumult of the Reform agitation he and some forty or fifty others who had hitherto held aloof joined it, and thenceforward he took a prominent part in its proceedings. He thus became acquainted with Mr. EDWARD ELLICE, a most active member of Lord GREY's Ministry; he became a political agent of the party, and he had a great deal to do with its election business. This necessitated his removal to London in 1832, where he practiced as solicitor and parliamentary agent till about the year 1850, when he was appointed Taxing Master to the Court of Exchequer, an office which he held till his death. These are the leading facts of his life. He died at his house in Wimpole-street yesterday afternoon, and will be much missed and widely regretted.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Mr. Joseph Parkes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Mr. Joseph Parkes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times of Aug. 14', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db7af1d4-9a86-5fec-8221-b4c9443b44aa,1362,nyt://article/db7af1d4-9a86-5fec-8221-b4c9443b44aa

We see in great number the names of the ancient and proud Virginia families, who have inherited the soil of the Old Dominion ever since its first settlement by Englishmen. We see the names of the great lords of South Carolina, many of whom have never figured prominently either in politics or war, but who, nevertheless, had the influence as well as the wealth of lords. From other of the old States, as Georgia and North Carolina, we also see the names of the chief families; and from the newer States, bordering on the Gulf and on the Mississippi, the masters of the soil are found to turn up; and as they appear, many reminiscences of their history are recalled by those who have known of them in other days.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE OLD FAMILIES OF THE SOUTH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE OLD FAMILIES OF THE SOUTH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0aa42c90-f894-52e7-b8d8-08db71eab983,319,nyt://article/0aa42c90-f894-52e7-b8d8-08db71eab983

It shows how very uncertain a game base ball is. On Saturday the Camdens play their return match with the Athletics, and the contest bids fair to be a close one.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/07/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- The season opened at this establishment last night under the most brilliant auspices, Mr. CLARKE'S reception was a perfect ovation, and so significant in its enthusiasm as to prevent him for a considerable time from proceeding with the business of the stage. When we were permitted, from the fervor of his reception, to calmly judge the merits of his performance, we have simply to say, what we have had so often occasion to state, that as Major De Boots he evoked, from the rising to the falling of the curtain, incessant bursts of laughter; and that he seemed, catching inspiration from the triumph of his reception, to have imparted to his personation oven more vim and force than usual. It was a matter of general regret that that charming young actress, Miss ROSE EYTINGE, was prevented by sudden indisposition from appearing in the role of Mrs. Swansdown. Miss ALICE GREY, a stranger to our boards, who in consequence undertook the part at a few moments' notice, filled it very creditably.

Shortly afterward defendant left town, and did not return till the 25th April following. In the meantime the stock had fallen to 108. On the 16th of April, and during the absence of the defendant, plaintiffs sent a written notice to defendant, addressed to him at his place of business in this city. In this notice defendant was called on for a further margin, and he was furthermore informed, that if he failed to furnish the funds required, plaintiffs would sell out his stock. Not hearing from him within a reasonable time, the plaintiffs sold out his stock at the Brokers' Board. When defendant returned, he at once repudiated the sale, and demanded the stock, which the plaintiffs refused to deliver.

It is difficult to know what this paper or the few discontented spirits in the New-York Clearing House would be at, if not malicious mischief. As however they profess higher motives, there can be no objection to reminding the public that, on the merits of their proposition, they have been once voted down in all the Clearing Houses of the three cities. In New-York, with the aid of some six or eight of the old local banks, which are suffered to remain in the Clearing House after voting against accepting the National System, and by excluding about the same number of original National Banks, they were able to muster a respectable minority. But the proposition was nevertheless promptly tabled here; -- almost unanimously tabled in Philadelphia, and quite unanimously silenced in Boston. We may add by the way that three of the local Presidents in New-York, the open and declared enemies of the National System, now and from the start, were on the Committee to prepare this proposition for legislating outside the Act of Congress and through their own Clearing House, in place of appealing to Congress to remedy the defects of what they call the redemption features of the act.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Currency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Currency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/daaa1727-3ecb-5121-98ff-55e9060daca8,588,nyt://article/daaa1727-3ecb-5121-98ff-55e9060daca8

He was a native of Norwich, Vt., born in 1803, and was, therefore, about sixty-two years of age. He graduated at West Point in 1822, and had previously graduated at Capt. PARTRIDGE's Military School at Norwich. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Third Infantry, when first appointed into the army; was Adjutant from 1831 to 1836; was appointed Captain of Eighth Infantry July 7, 1838; was breveted a Major for good conduct in the Florida War, March 15, 1842; Lieutenant-Colonel for gallantry at Contreras and Cherubusco, Aug. 20, and Colonel for Molino del Rey, Sept. 8, 1847, where he was wounded; became Major of the Fourth Infantry Jan 1, 1848; Lieutenant-Colonel Feb. 3, 1855, and Colonel of the Ninth Infantry March 3, 1855. He performed important services in the Indian wars in Oregon and Washington Territories in 1856 and 1858. He was made Brigadier-General of Volunteers Sept. 28, 1861; was at one time Commander of the District of Oregon, and afterward Commanding-General of the Department of the Pacific. On the arrival of Gen. MCDOWELL at San Francisco, in June, 1864, he was placed in command of the District of California, with his headquarters at Sacramento.

Our informant, who was himself considerably cut and bruised, states that the 6 o'clock Philadelphia passenger train reached Hightstown about 8 o'clock, and had not long left the station when the whistle of a train approaching round the curve was heard. The engineer of the passenger train signaled to brake up, and reversed the engine, and then, after waiting long enough to see the danger into which he had brought his passengers, jumped off, accompanied by the firemen. Their example was followed by the engineer and firemen of the freight train. Fortunately both trains were proceeding at a low rate of speed or the consequences would have been fearful. As it was, nearly every passenger in the Philadelphia train was thrown from his seat, men, women and children being piled in heaps on the floors of the cars. Intense excitement prevailed, many of the ladies and children being almost wild with terror, and those who were being smothered by the persons lying above them shrieking to their friends for help.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER RAILROAD SMASH.; Collision Between Freight and Passenger Trains on the Camden and Amboy Road.

This is apparent on many considerations. How far the war, which has had its full course, has diminished the gross population -- what ages have suffered most from its ravages -- how far the natural increase of population has been affected by it -- in what sections of country the decimation of the white population has been most severely felt -- and what sections have increased in population as places of refuge from the scourge -- are all matters of practical account, to be learned or partially learned by an early census-taking. Reliable data by which to measure the practical working of emancipation would also be obtained. No general emigration from the North has yet taken place, nor any general stampede from the South. But some important shiftings of population must soon follow. If in 1870 some county of Virginia should be found depopulated of blacks, it would be important to know whether this was the effect wholly or partly of the war, or did not begin until peace was restored. Many of the emancipated settlers will then be found in the Sea Islands in South Carolina.

The Democrats readily enough accept this principle, so far as it bears upon the black man; but down in Maryland, at least, they take it in a very different spirit when it applies to the white. The new constitution of Maryland prescribes a stringent oath of loyalty to be taken by every voter, and also authorizes the Legislature to provide for the disfranchisement of all disloyal persons. This exercise of the sovereign power of the State over the electoral qualifications, has given the Copperheads of the State intense dissatisfaction. They asseverate that it is not only intrinsically despotic, but that it is a violation of that clause of the Constitution of the United States, which insures to each State a republican form of government. At length Mr. THOMAS ANDERSON, one of the disfranchised, has resolved to seek his remedy.

ALBERTO BILESTRINI, has undertaken, on his own risk and responsibility, to connect together the three continents of Europe, Africa and America -- including the greater portion of the islands of the North Atlantic -- by telegraph. The last European mail brought us some particulars of the route selected, M. BILESTEINI is to start from Paris, of course; thence to Lisbon and Cape St. Vincent, overland From Cape St. Vincent a submarine line is to be laid to the Canary Islands; from the latter another submarine stretch is to take in Cape Verd -- with stations at St. Louis (Senegal) and Goree, on the African mainland. From Cape Verd, the line is to stretch out in as direct a course as may be to Cape St. Roque, the eastmost point of Brazil. From St. Roque a landline along the coast is to connect with Cayenne; then a succession of submarine and overland wires through the Antilles is to complete the chain of communication at New-Orleans. It is impossible to judge with perfect accuracy of the length of this proposed route; but we take it to be little short of half the girth of the world -- if New-York is to be included is the circuit. Looking to the latitudes alone, it will be seen that Monteur BILESTEINI travels southward over fifty-three degrees before he reaches this continent at all, and coming back to New-York from Cape St. Roque he strides over forty-four degrees more. Make allowance for the longitudes covered by his line, and he will be found to have traveled considerably over ten thousand miles.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'From New-York to Paris by Telegraph.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'From New-York to Paris by Telegraph.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1dd0eabd-a05d-50a0-8a40-1c46ee866d89,453,nyt://article/1dd0eabd-a05d-50a0-8a40-1c46ee866d89

The woman, who represented herself to be the widow of a soldier who had fallen in battle, hired apartments, a fortnight ago, on the fourth floor of the tenement house No. 335 East Eighth-street, and having moved in her scanty furniture, was scarcely seen again by her neighbors; but at 1 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, Mrs. MARY ANN MURPHY, one of the neighbors, observed that Mrs. BETTS' door had been locked on the inside, and the key left in the lock. It then occurred to Mrs. MURPHY that Mrs. BETTS had not been seen by any one since Wednesday morning last; therefore, suspecting something wrong, she notified Mr. WILLIAM E. BRINKERHOFF, the agent for the house, and he burst the door, and found Mrs. BETTS dead in her bed, with her dead child, a girl of eight months, lying by her side. Mrs. BETTS was about 25 years of age.

The city had been kept in constant excitement on account of the revolutionary movements going on in the interior, but which appear to result in nothing. The present government may be overthrown, but there is little likelihood of any outbreak in the city. The contending parties have about three hundred men each under arms; but both appear afraid to fight. A good deal of excitement has been occasioned by the government here appropriating a couple of American vessels for transportation purposes. The vessels were sold by the United States Consul, who furnished them with the documents requisite, as the purchasers thought to navigate on this coast and under which they have been sailing for nearly two years. It now appears they had no right to these documents, and their owners can claim no protection either from the Consul or Admiral. From Central America the only important item is that BARRIOS, the Ex-President of Salvador, was being tried by a council of war, and would, in all probability, be shot, notwithstanding, when Nicaragua delivered him up, it was on an express understanding by treaty, that his life would be spared. From Chili there is nothing of interest. Business is dull and arrivals few. The revolution in Peru still progresses, and the rebel fleet had entered Callao, where they were awaiting a reply from President PEZEZ to their ultimatum, before attacking the town.

On the other hand, with currency contraction, there follow the opposite effects, namely: the prospect of lower prices, an unwillingness to give orders, whether to manufacturers or merchants, except to supply immediate and pressing wants. Speculators who had been operating for a rise on borrowed capital are forced to realize when their notes fall due, and markets at once begin to fall.

A Story About,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/10/archives/a-story-about-dr-kane.html,A Story About,"-- We find the following in the Rochester (N.Y.) Union: ""A book will probably appear within a short time, giving the facts in the history of Dr. KANE, the Arctic navigator, which have hitherto been shrouded in mystery. It is true that he was for years engaged to Miss MARGARETTA FOX, one of the young ladies who first presented the phenomena of 'spirit-rapping.' Dr. KANE fell in love with the young girl while she was sitting as a public medium in Philadelphia, in 1852, when she was 15 years of age. With her mother's consent, he removed her from all association with the spiritualists, and placed her in a private school near Philadelphia, to remain during his absence in the Arctic regions. On his return, in 1855, they were to have been married; but the opposition of Dr. KANE's family was such that Miss FOX released him from his engagement. He loved her, however, too well to live without her; and in April, 1856, the engagement was renewed, with the understanding that it should be kept secret till the publication of Dr. KANE's great work should realise an independence for him. In October, 1856, his physicians having ordered Dr. KANE to England, he was secretly married to Miss FOX, and made his will, leaving five thousand dollars to her in private trust to his brother. His last letter was addressed to her. This legacy was not paid, and some injurious reports having been raised, Mrs. KANE's legal advisers urged a suit for dower as the widow, and the publication of a memoir. One was prepared, embodying one hundred and thirty-four of Dr. KANE's letters, and Mr. CARLETON had it in press, when the publication and suit were both stopped by a compromise with the brothers and executor of Dr. KANE; they agreeing to pay the lady the interest of the money left her, and a sum down to repay her expenses, provided she would discontinue the suit in the Orphan Court, Philadelphia, and would seal up the letters, with the MS. memoir, and place them in the hands of a trustee, who would surrender them to the KANE family at her death. A bond was signed by the KANES in 1862, for the observance of the terms they agreed to; Mrs. KANE being permitted to reclaim her letters, &c., in the event of their failure to pay the quarterly installment of interest. This agreement was violated by their refusal to pay -- first, the sum promised for her expenses, then the quarterly installments, and in June last Mrs. KANE reclaimed her letters of the trustee. She is now at liberty to publish the volume which is to establish her fair fame, and to show the world a singular example of faithful love, enduring through unkindness and calumny. The death of Mrs. FOX, Mrs. KANE's mother, has retarded the publication, but it will doubtless appear in good time.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A STORY ABOUT DR.

ROBERTS, of Tennessee, and said FOLSOM has been arrested and taken to Tennessee, by requisition from the Governor of that State, on a criminal charge. The many improbable stories in circulation concerning these matters induce us to give publicity to the following versions: Dr. ROBERTS alleges that about January, 1864, on the streets of Pulaski, Tenn., he dropped from his pocket-book $6,500 in greenbacks, to wit: six one thousand dollar bills and one five hundred dollar bill. That war was then being waged in Tennessee, making communication with the North very difficult.

That he handed the same for safekeeping to Mr. FOLSOM. That on hearing of the $1,000 reward he desired to return the money to ROBERTS, but was dissauded from so doing by FOLSOM, who persuaded him to go North, representing that as a negro he would there enjoy greater social and political privileges, and proposing that they should there share said money equally, and urging the advantages to the negro of the half of $6,500 over said sum of reward. That he was thus enticed by FOLSOM to accompany him to New-Hampshire, and that when they got there FOLSOM faced on the negro, denied all about the money, and refused to give him any part thereof. Whereupon the negro tells. And this, Dr. ROBERTS avers, is the first clue to his missing money. The Doctor further alleges that he has since learned of additional evidence, corroborating the negro's statement fully, and making a clear case against FOLSOM.

Wool Manufacturers' Convention on War with England,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/11/archives/wool-war-and-wind.html,Wool Manufacturers' Convention on War with England,"The wool manufacturers of the United States would seem to be an extremely belligerent body of men. They held a convention in Philadelphia the other day, and at its close were entertained by a ""magnificent banquet,"" at which a large number of more or less ""distinguished orators"" gave free scope to their eloquence. Some of the speakers had a little to say about wool, but more of them had much to say about war -- not the last war, nor any war which has yet been waged, but about a possible war of the future, which we had supposed all good men wished to avoid and no wise man desired to talk about. In short, it would seem that from some unaccountable cause or other, the wool-manufacturers are not averse to fighting England at short notice, while some of them would as lief take a tilt with ""all creation."" We do not precisely understand why they, or at least those who spoke at their banquet, should break out at this moment; but from every part of the banquetting-board there were eruptions of warlike wrath. It is a remarkable fact, however, that there was only one distinguished General of the Union army present; and that that officer (Major-General BURNSIDE) raised, amid the din, his voice for peace -- for general, universal, permanent, honorable peace. Perhaps it was the first speaker of the occasion who struck the belligerent key-note in a reference to the ""baleful domination of that insolent power which, during the last four years, has preyed upon our commerce, outraged our feelings, and given aid and comfort to our enemies."" The ""father of the feast,"" who uttered this, was followed by Mr. HAYES, of Boston, the Secretary of the National Wool-Manufacturers' Association, who made the threat direct, and made it loud. He cried out: ""We have overcome our home enemies by our matchless system of small arms; and, if it should become necessary to teach the Nemean lion across the water the might of our republican institutions, I have little doubt that it can be done by the same means."" [Great applause.] Senator WILSON, of Massachusetts, pronounced himself opposed to talking of war with France or England; but Mr. CAMERON, formerly Secretary of War, who followed him, quickly declared: ""I don't believe with Mr. WILSON precisely. I believe in peace or war -- in anything that is good for my country -- and I will go to war with England much more readily than I ever did with rebels, who were my own countrymen."" [Enthusiastic applause.] Judge KELLY ""did not want war;"" ""but,"" exclaimed he, in a burst of bunkum, ""let the lion of England shield herself under the wide wings of the eagle of Austria, and dally with the lily of France, and bring to assist them the flags of the world, and we will turn loose the fleet that is gathered in the back creek of League Island, and we will lick them all. [Three cheers for League Island.] Yes, gentlemen, let me say in parenthesis that League Island is now the naval station for the iron-clads of the nation, and that, without a dissenting vote, because, in looking over our vast coast, the Secretary of the Navy could find no other deep fresh water shelter for those floating bulwarks of the nation."" [Applause.] The same chaste speaker also defiantly proclaimed: ""I flout the Stars and Stripes against the banners of the world.""

It is the most resolute and promising of the many attempts that have been make to establish a strong and influential weekly in this city, and it bids fair, according to present indications, to hold and to fill a position here quite equivalent to that held by the Examiner, Spectator and other weekly journals in England. It is large, each number containing thirty-two large quarto pages, and is made up with care and attention to details. The original writing, which constitutes by far the largest portion of its contents, is able, scholarly and indicative of thought. It abounds in opinions, with some of which we do not agree, and which are always urged with peremptory confidence and sometimes with rather ill-temper; but they are always pressed by argument and not by mere assertion. The paper evinces thought and careful consideration in every department. Its interest would doubtless be very considerably enhanced, at least for a very large class of readers, if the writers of its articles were designated; but this is an open question, and the Nation is not without very authoritative precedents for the course it has adopted. Complaints are sometimes made of its being a little heavy; but this, as a general rule, is the fault of readers quite as much as of what they read.

"By the Hibernia at Father Point, we have news from Londonderry to Sept. 1 -- five days later than by the Scotta. The directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company have ordered a new cable to be forthwith commenced. JUDAH P. BENJAMIN, the late Confederate Secretary of State, had reached England in the West India mail steamer. The steamer came near being burned just after leaving St. Thomas. The Times is urging the Queen to quit her retirement and assume the duties of her station. Junketing with the French fleet at Portsmouth was going on nicely.

"On Thursday, a complaint was entered against Policeman ROBERT W.

Purchase Money of Slave,"last week, an interesting case was tried. The executors of D.R. VANCE sued JAMES M. JOHNSON on a note given for the purchase of a slave at the time when slavery existed, the said note falling due before the abolition of the institution in Tennessee. The defendant pleaded a failure of consideration. But it was decided, says the Shelbyville Union, that as the executors could have made a title to the slave at the time the note was due, the defendant is not released from his liability to pay the debt, he not offering to pay it before slavery was abolished. The note was papable in good paper currency of the country, and money itself.

The jury, upon visiting the spot, found a handkerchief, supposed to have belonged to deceased, lying on the ground near the steps, and from thence they discovered traces where the body had been dragged and thrown under the briars, where it was entirely concealed from view, and was only discovered in consequence of the intolerable stench that arose from the decaying remains, and which led to an investigation of the cause. Upon removing the body, the head and legs separated from the trunk, and the body was so badly decomposed that it was impossible to ascertain in what manner death was caused. A wallet was found in the stocking of deceased, which contained a paper dated at the Philadelphia Navy-yard, August 8, giving him leave of absence for ten days, and requiring him to report, at the expiration of that time, on board the Princeton, at the same place; but the name of the deceased is obliterated.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/11/archives/the-wirz-trial.html,,"-- The evidence in the Wirz trial taken on Saturday went directly to inculpate the rebel officials of the War Department at Richmond. An ex-Confederate Military Inspector, Col. CHANDLER, was on the stand; a copy of a report he made on the condition of the Andersonville prison was laid before the court; and his sworn testimony, given therewith, presents the most conclusive proofs that the starving of our prisoners was a deliberate scheme, which had the assent of the highest Confederate authorities. While the late WINDER and WIRZ were the active and eager agents in the infliction of the unparalleled tortures which our men endured, it is clear beyond all doubt, from Col. CHANDLER's testimony, that the superiors of WINDER and WIRZ gave their fullest sanction to the hellish devices practiced at Andersonville. On the 5th of August, 1864, CHANDLER reported to Richmond, respecting the prison-pen, that it was ""a place the horrors of which it is difficult to describe, and which is a disgrace to civilization."" So horror-struck was this Confederate officer with what he saw within the stockade, that he went so far as to plead, in his report, with the Richmond War Department for the removal of WINDER and for the appointment of someone who ""does not advocate in cold blood the propriety of leaving them (the prisoners) in their present condition until their number has been sufficiently reduced by death to make the present arrangements suffice for their accommodation."" Not only was this report of CHANDLER's laid before the rebel Secretary of War and his Assistant but CHANDLER went himself personally to the rebel War-office to urge that it should be taken up and acted on. What was the result of this double appeal? WINDER, the hell-hound of Anderson-ville, was promoted to the post of ""Commissary-General of Prisoners"" for the whole Confederacy!",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WIRZ TRIAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WIRZ TRIAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed54b8a3-4d8e-505e-8695-31314299b848,420,nyt://article/ed54b8a3-4d8e-505e-8695-31314299b848

But the scheme is to be tried again at a meeting of the Associated Banks -- including the old local banks who refuse to have anything to do with the National system, except to embarrass its steady working by their votes in the Clearing House -- to be held on Wednesday, 13th inst. Several of the opponents of the scheme have courteously yielded their consent to this meeting, but without abating one jot of their unwillingness to prescribe National Country Bank Notes, or meaning to tolerate the assorting process if attempted. It is taken for granted, though the fact may not turn out so, that the conference will be so far public as to authorize a report of the vote by ayes and noes on the subject, that the seven or eight hundred interior National Banks that keep their accounts in New-York, may understand who really are the promoters of this scheme, and how many of them are rightly entitled to direct the management of a system with which they are in open and declared hostility. Eight of the original National City Banks are not in the association, and will not be consulted at all, although the scheme, if really designed to be general and practical, more nearly concerns them and the two hundred or more Country Nationals that keep their accounts with them, than the same number of local banks that are still suffered to act upon national questions at the Clearing House.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The City and Country Banks.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The City and Country Banks.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BANKS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f2a4ea47-a116-5116-88f6-076c324d441e,675,nyt://article/f2a4ea47-a116-5116-88f6-076c324d441e

The demand for books grows livelier, moreover, among the community now that the war is over. As an example of the firmness of the transactions of this sale, it may be mentioned that sales continue at least as spirited as they were on the first day, notwithstanding that during the intermediate five days the price of book-paper has risen four or five cents a pound.

Without treading on the higher ground of the Philharmonic Society, or the symphonic soirees of THEODORE THOMOS, he provides a neutral programme of great merit -- one, in fact, which must appeal more directly to the public taste than either of those furnished by the institutions just named.

He means well, does this P.G., &c., we doubt not; but his zeal is froward. Masons, as masons, have nothing to do with political pacification; and it would have been well if some high lights in the order had remembered this -- for instance, ALBERT PIKE, of Arkansas, whose burly and commanding presence we last saw in the star-gemmed chamber of the Lodge of Perfection in Broadway, clad in the cabalistic costume of the highest known degree of the Scottish rites. The Apostle's command, to be subject to the higher powers and pay deference to political rulers without seeking to direct them, was not more binding upon those whom he addressed, than are the similar commands of all Masonic law and tradition -- that, as an order, the members of the fraternity are required to yield peacefully to the established rule, and by no official act to meddle with government. Had they done so in the South, where nearly all the elite of the ruling classes are prominent masons, they might have much retarded, if not prevented the great rebellion; had they respected the still-preserved masonic insignia of WASHINGTON and LAFAYETTE, they would have looked in vain for a PIKE and a BRAGG, and a hundred others, to raise their hands against ""the powers that be.""

Reply to Deputation of Southerners on his Intentions; Reply to Richm'd Deputation on Visit,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/13/archives/president-johnson-and-the-south.html,Reply to Deputation of Southerners on his Intentions; Reply to Richm'd Deputation on Visit,"President JOHNSON'S reply to the deputation of Southerners, which we published in full yesterday morning, gives a very clear indication of the spirit and temper which he brings to the task of reconstruction. It is a spirit of kindness, of magnanimity, of paramount devotion to the public good. Personally, inspite of the jeers and hatred with which the South greeted his adhesion to the Union cause, with a full recollection of the obloquy and Buffering he has endured at the hands of the Southern people, he has no revenges to gratify, no resentments to indulge. He longs only to restore the old relations of amity between the different States and sections of the country, and to secure the highest welfare of the people everywhere. He charges upon the South all the responsibility of the rebellion, -- telling them that they made the issue, -- but recognizing the frankness, sincerity and good faith with which they accept their defeat, and inviting, cordially and hopefully, their aid in whatever the new condition of affairs may require. He disclaims all wish to deal harshly with the Southern people, and cautions them against being alarmed or disturbed by the hostile speeches that may be made.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'President Johnson and the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'President Johnson and the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8d3fd1fe-7ae4-5b9b-83c0-1d21bad28c68,878,nyt://article/8d3fd1fe-7ae4-5b9b-83c0-1d21bad28c68

"LAURA MILLS, the wife of FRANKLIN MILLS, employed as engineer in the Eagle Building, near the foot of Fulton-street, came to her death in a mysterious manner, about 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning. The deceased and husband occupied the upper part of the building. They were refugees from the South, and had been living in the building for three or four months only. It appears that on Monday night Mr. MILLS returned from some place of amusement, and, according to his own statement, found his wife ill. Having taken some laudanum to relieve her pains, she fell against a trunk, and injured herself. Mr. MILLS then went for Dr. J.D. JOHNSON, who soon after arrived, and on examination found the woman in a dying condition, but exhibiting no symptoms of having taken poison. She was suffering great pain in the side, and the doctor administered hartshorn for the purpose of reviving her, which had the desired effect. She was then questioned as to the cause of her injuries, and stated distinctly that her husband had struck her with a bottle, which she pointed out on the mantel-piece. The physician believing that, under the circumstances, further assistance was required, sent for Dr. FARLEY, who arrived some time thereafter. The latter asked the same questions, and the woman being informed of her condition, made the same answers. The physicians then requested MILLS to go for Father KEEGAN, but instead of going himself woke up a man at a neighboring hotel and induced him to go. The woman died soon after. MILLS' statement is to the effect that his wife was afflicted with heart disease, and in order to relieve her she sometimes took opium and laudanum; that she had been very affectionate, and that they had lived happily together. A small laudanum bottle, which was empty, was found. In accordance with the views of Coroner BARRETT, it could not contain enough to kill any one who was addicted to the use of opium. The deceased was a native of Matanzas, Cuba, 38 years of age. They had lived in the South during the war, and escaped to the national lines some time last Winter. MILLS then came on to New-York for employment. He is an excellent engineer, and sober and attentive to his business. He was taken into custody by Capt. JACOBS, of the Forty-second Precinct Police, and locked up, to await the result of the Coroner's investigation. A postmortem examination will be made this morning at 8 o'clock, and the inquest will be commenced about one hour thereafter, when all the facts in the case will be developed.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/13/archives/death-under-suspicious-circumstances.html,,"LAURA MILLS, the wife of FRANKLIN MILLS, employed as engineer in the Eagle Building, near the foot of Fulton-street, came to her death in a mysterious manner, about 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning.

Responses from other tribes of a similar character were made. On Saturday, the council was taken up in reading the stipulations to be imposed by the government upon all treaties in the Southwest. The stipulations propose a grand consolidation of all Indian tribes into one nation, the territory of which shall be the present Indian Territory, and such other as the government may decide upon. The tribes now living in Kansas are to be removed South, and the Southwestern tribes are expected to compel the Indians of the plains to observe the treaties. The Indians say they understand they were called to meet the late rebel tribes, and renew friendly relations with them, and not to make new treaties, which they say they are unwilling and unauthorized to do. On Monday replies were made to the propositions presented them on Saturday. All spoke favorably of the policy of the government, and appear anxious to renew friendly relations with it.

Thus peace is virtually restored, but whether or not it will realize its anticipated benefits to our commercial and industrial classes depends in a great degree on the final settlement of the relations between labor and capital, in connection with the culture of our chief Southern staples.

For the time it is of great consequence to the white, not less than the black population of the South, that there should be military jurisdiction over disputed cases between the emancipated slaves and their late masters. But the authority of these special courts, if Gen. MEADE correctly estimates the sentiment of the resident population, will not require the support of any large force. And there seems to be on all hands an accumulation of evidence showing the existence of a disposition on the part of employers and employed to make the best of their new relationship. Herein, therefore, lies the main argument and justification for the Executive method of reconstruction. The return of the late insurgents to duty has to be met, as the President proposes to meet it, by extending confidence to them. How much is implied in the word confidence the honest citizens of the South now begin to discover, as they set about finding their way back into the Union.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PROGRESS OF RECONSTRUCTION AT THE; SOUTH.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PROGRESS OF RECONSTRUCTION AT THE; SOUTH.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f99ca33-875f-59d6-9f41-316e0724f03b,221,nyt://article/0f99ca33-875f-59d6-9f41-316e0724f03b

They are scattered at various points throughout the Southern States, many at railway stations to which the government has furnished transportation, many in hospitals, and many literally in the streets of Southern towns.

The why and the wherefore of this racing contrariety it is not for us to deal with in detail; all that liberal management can do in preparing an affluent programme has been done by the powers that be in Hoboken -- their purses have been liberally opened, and all their arrangements have been correspondingly so; and yet, from some cause beyond the ken or ordinary sporting foresight, the Secaucus meeting has not been as fully or as well attended as it should have been -- not as fully, because New-York has not done its duty in the premises; not so well as we should have anticipated, because those who graced the grand stands at the Paterson Spring meeting, and again at Saratoga, were absent. We missed the display of ladies, who give brightness and bloom to a race course, and in place thereof we had gentlemen with whips suggestive of buggies. Nevertheless and notwithstanding, as the lawyers say, the second day of the meeting was a great improvement on the first.

Shall it be Distrusted,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/14/archives/shall-the-south-be-distrusted.html,Shall it be Distrusted,"President JOHNSON, in his late speech to the great Southern delegation, expressed his belief that ""the South would be true to her ancient instincts of frankness and manly honor,"" and that ""when its faith was pledged, every pledge and promise will be fully carried out."" This was no idle blandishment on his part. It was an utterance of an earnest conviction, upon which he has shaped and is still shaping his practical policy of reconstruction. This trust manifested itself at the very outset, in a marked degree, in the Amnesty Proclamation, relieving the great mass of the Southern people from the penalties of treason on taking the oath of fidelity to the constitution and to the laws and proclamation which had been made with reference to the emancipation of slaves -- and then in the Reconstruction Proclamations, which allowed them to elect conventions, and to vote, on their own election laws, for all officers necessary to accomplish a reorganization of their State Governments, and for representatives in Congress. The same spirit has governed President JOHNSON in all of his subsequent dealings with the South. A memorable exhibition of it has just been seen in his abrogation of the order of Gen. SLOCUM, which set aside Gov. SHARKEY's proclamation calling on the people of Mississippi to organize military forces in each county for the suppression and prevention of all public disturbance. In the dispatch sustaining Gov. SHARKEY in this matter, he used these words: ""The people must be trusted with their government; and, if trusted, my opinion is that they will act in good faith.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Shall the South be Distrusted?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Shall the South be Distrusted?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4ba8276-3683-5821-beed-8a43864327c4,1120,nyt://article/d4ba8276-3683-5821-beed-8a43864327c4

The ardent attentions of the sun are not to be wholly escaped, but they may be accepted more cheerfully in the solitudes of our still deserted avenues, rather than in the dusty and choking lanes of the country. It is a singular fact, that notwithstanding the almost unbearable heat, every place of amusement now open to the public is literally crowded. We doubt not that the same good fortune will be enjoyed by Mr. MARETZEK. When the drama succeeds, the opera can generally manage to take care of itself. It may be added, too, that while the promise of the theatrical future does not hold forth any particular novelty, either in the way of actors or pieces, the musical world will, undoubtedly, be stirred to its centre by the production of MEYERBEER's ""Africaine,"" and by the debuts of several now singers.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d852b12-b3f4-5541-ad34-c55eafdc8502,1261,nyt://article/5d852b12-b3f4-5541-ad34-c55eafdc8502

"Allen, Phillip; Attempted at Brooklyn",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/15/archives/attempted-suicide-in-brooklyn-a-madman-cuts-his-thoat-with-a-razor.html,"Allen, Phillip; Attempted at Brooklyn","Yesterday morning, near 2 o'clock, Mr. PHILIPALLEN, a young man about 32 years of age, attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throat with a razor, at his residence, No. 163 Gold-street, Brooklyn. It appears that Mr. ALLEN has been laboring under temporary derangement of mind for several days past, and on Wednesday evening went home in such a state of excitement as to cause the most serious apprehensions on the part of the inmates of the house. Upon the family retiring for the night, one of the members, a youth, resolved to watch ALLEN's movements, and to that intent lay down upon his bed with his clothes on, when he soon fell asleep. He was awakened in an hour or so by a noise in his room, when the first object that met his view was the figure of a man standing by his bedside with his hands to his throat, apparently trying to button his shirt-collar. This was the suspected madman. He remained in this position a few moments, when some idea seemed to strike him, and he left the room. The youth was not tardy in following, and he proceeded down stairs and awakened his mother. Shortly afterward ALLEN came down and passed out into the street, where he remained some time, and then returned to his room. Soon after a noise was heard in the room, occasioned by the fall of a lamp, and in a few moments more heavy breathing was heard to proceed from the apartment, and it was believed that ALLEN was in a dying condition. The door was tried, but found to be locked, and no other response could be gained to the repeated knocks for admission save the loud respirations of the sufferer. Mr. HALL, a friend of ALLEN's, living near by, was then called in, and he proceeded to break in the door, when he found the unfortunate man standing in the middle of the room, with a deep gash in his throat, and the bright blade of a razor glittering in his right hand. Previous to the arrival of Mr. HALL, however, and after he had cut his throat, ALLEN came out of his room, walked down stairs through the hall, down to the basement, then up again to his room, locking the door behind him. Mr. HALL spoke to him, but obtained no answer, save some energetic gesticulations, which were taken for threats of violence. Not caring to deal single-handed with a man in this state of mind, Mr. HALL closed the door and proceeded to call the police and summon medical assistance. In a few minutes three or four metropolitans arrived, proceeded to Mr. ALLEN's room, disarmed him and brought him down into the hall naked and bleeding, as painful and frightful a spectacle as any one might wish to look upon. After considerable delay in groping about the unlighted streets of Brooklyn, a carriage was obtained, and the injured man conveyed to the Brooklyn Hospital, where he now lies suffering greatly from his wound, but with some hope of recovery. No reason is given for this rash attempt upon his life, by Mr. ALLEN. He bears a most excellent character, is well connected, and in the employ of his brother, a wealthy ship chandler, doing business in South-street, New-York.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Attempted Suicide in Brooklyn.; A MADMAN CUTS HIS THOAT WITH A RAZOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Attempted Suicide in Brooklyn.; A MADMAN CUTS HIS THOAT WITH A RAZOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/616d25e3-60c2-5e21-8e15-106f862898ac,553,nyt://article/616d25e3-60c2-5e21-8e15-106f862898ac

The St. George eleven included GIBBES this time, and though not their strongest team, was good enough to test the merits of the Boston Club pretty well. The Bostonians were reinforced by two good players, and presented an excellent eleven for the contest. The ground was in fine condition, and everything was favorable for the sport. The Bostonians won the toss, and sent in EATON and HAMMOND to the bat, against the bowling of GIBBES and HARRY WRIGHT. For some time the wickets were creditably defended, HAMMOND especially showing in good form. SULLIVAN, too, did well while in, but the balance of the eleven found WRIGHT's bowling altogether too effective for run-getting, and in a little over an hour the eleven had been disposed of for 34 runs, of which 7 were extras, SULLIVAN and HAMMOND's scores of 9 each being the only average scores of the innings. WRIGHT's bowling score shows the excellence of his delivery on this occasion; 61 balls, 5 runs, 13 maidens and 6 wickets is an analysis seldom reached in this country. GIBBES was not so successful, 22 runs for 3 wickets being his score.

Y.; Jones, Alderman, Singular Conduct in a Pickpocket Case","On Monday afternoon a lady of the highest respectability entered a Madison-avenue stage, near the corner of Eleventh-street, and after paying her fare retained her portemounaie in her hand. At Bleecker-street a man got into the stage, seated himself next to the lady, and after paying his own fare attempted to seize the portemonnaie in the lady's hand, declaring that it was his and that the lady had taken it from his pocket. A gentleman sitting opposite the lady interfered and informed the man that he could not have the pocket-book unless he was able to obtain it by force, as he should protect the lady and her property. The fellow then said he would have both parties arrested, and stopping the stage, he got out, procured the services of a policeman, and had the lady and gentlemen arrested as pickpockets. They were taken to police headquarters and thence to the Tombs Police Court, where Alderman JONES was sitting in the absence of Justice HOGAN. The man here renewed his charge against the parties arrested, giving his name as THOS. WELSH, of New-Brighton, S.I. Alderman JONES said the lady must prove her respectability. This she informed him could be easily done by sending to the office of her husband, in Wall-street. One of the court messengers was accordingly sent thither, and in the mean time the lady and her friend were invited to take seats in the examination-room. In about twenty minutes afterward Aldermen JONES entered the room and informed them that the charge was withdrawn, and that they were at liberty to depart. Shortly afterward the lady's friends arrived, only to find the scoundrel who had preferred the charge beyond their reach.

Unreasonable Opposition to,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/15/archives/mistakes-that-need-to-be-corrected.html,Unreasonable Opposition to,"Just now, when so much is being said about sanitary matters, crowded tenements, cleanliness and education of the masses, it will, doubtless, surprise many of our readers to be informed that there exists, among what is considered an intelligent and respectable class of our foreign population, a spirit of opposition to educational measures of reform. The schools for the very poorest class have been located where the population is most dense, and where, owing to the crowded condition of the ward schools, and the want of care exercised over them by their parents, groups of boys and girls were to be seen idling their time away in the alley-ways, streets and lowest places in the neighborhood. Industrial schools were first established, and different agencies have readily cooperated in this work, but the largest number have been created by and through the Children's Aid Society of this city. That any instrumentality calculated to do so much good, alleviate so much distress, and prevent the growth of so many evils, should meet with opposition, particularly from those who consider themselves the protectors and teachers of the class for whom they were especially devised, is most surprising. Those who have given any time and attention to this subject, know that the design of these schools is not to interfere in any way with the religious training of the children who attend them, nor in any way to prejudice or influence their minds for or against any one system of religion. They combine within themselves all the elements of a reformatory education which are by many felt to be so necessary at the present time. The teachers engaged in them are ladies of refinement and education, and while all the rudiments of a good common-school education are taught, no less attention is given to cleanliness of person and dress. Habits of industry are also taught in the best practical way, by causing the scholars to make up the garments which are afterward given them as a reward for steady attendance and attention to their studies. A feeling of self-respect and decent pride is developed, which of itself is the surest safeguard to virtue. No child can, for any length of time, be a regular attendant upon such a school without entertaining feelings of disgust for the miserable underground cellars and foul tenements from whence they come.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mistakes that Need to be Corrected.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mistakes that Need to be Corrected.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': ""Children's Aid Society"", 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90c702bb-c754-5ab0-8773-da1b78299617,633,nyt://article/90c702bb-c754-5ab0-8773-da1b78299617

As a general thing, their conduct is manly, frank and sensible, -- calculated to win the confidence and respect of every generous and just community. Nine in every ten of them have been utterly ruined by the rebellion. Most of them cast their fortunes into the struggle for a cause which they believed to be right, but which they see and acknowledge to have been fatally and finally defeated. They have lost position, influence, property, children, friends -- everything which makes life desirable. Under such circumstances, weak men sink down into abject despair, or drag out the rest of their lives in the sale obscurity of foreign lands. The defeated Southerners meet their calamity in a more manly style.

Strange Conduct in Police Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/15/archives/justice-blind.html,Strange Conduct in Police Case,"Our Police Justices have never been distinguished for clearness of judgment, or for a particularly fearless discharge of their duties; but in the following case which came up lately at the Tombs Police Court, the acting magistrate appears to have been utterly befogged, permitting a scoundrel to escape, while his innocent victim was made to suffer what to a refined and delicate woman was worse than any punishment that could be devised. It appears that on Monday afternoon a fellow got into a Madison-avenue stage and made a bold attempt to rob a lady passenger by seizing the pocketbook which she held in her hand, and declaring that it was his property. His attempt at robbery was frustrated by a gentleman in the stage, and the fellow then, doubtless actuated by a feeling of revenge, sprang out of the stage, called a policeman, and gave both the parties into custody on a charge of picking his pocket. The three were taken before Alderman JONES, at the Tombs Police Court, and there the prosecutor renewed his charge. Alderman JONES said this was one of numerous similar cases, and that it would be necessary for the lady to bring witnesses as to her character. The lady said that this could be easily done, and requested that a messenger might be dispatched for her husband. During the absence of the messenger the lady and her friend, who had been requested to take a seat in a private room, were informed that the charge had been withdrawn. The lady's husband arrived shortly afterward, but of course only to find the scoundrel who had attempted to rob his wife beyond his reach. Now, it certainly appears that in acting as he did Alderman JONES showed a strange want of sense, or something worse. Of course he could not know that the lady was a person of respectability merely by her appearance, and he was undoubtedly right in holding her to answer the charge. But he was entirely wrong in permitting the prosecutor to withdraw the charge and leave the court without giving the lady an opportunity of vindicating her character. No reason was assigned by Aldermen JONES for the charge being withdrawn. If the prosecutor withdrew it, under the excuse that he had made a mistake, it was then the duty of Alderman JONES to bring him into the lady's presence and compel him to apologise to her for what had occurred. How could the astute magistrate suppose that if the pocket-book rightfully belonged to the prosecutor that he would withdraw his claims to it? For what possible reason could ho allow the case to be terminated in this manner? The ownership of the pocket-book might have been determined, it would seem, in a very few moments by calling on the claimant to describe its contents. Of course he could not have done so, and that would have been proof positive that it was not his property. No attempt, however, is made by Alderman JONES to sift the case; a scoundrel is allowed to escape with impunity, while a respectable lady is dragged through the street, arraigned as a pickpocket, and then informed that it is all a mistake.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JUSTICE BLIND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'JUSTICE BLIND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cacc1196-6671-5193-9a30-29fe92b9fb39,534,nyt://article/cacc1196-6671-5193-9a30-29fe92b9fb39

It would appear, however, from subsequent movements of the Commissioners, that these ""open sessions"" are so only in name. The hour of opening the tri-weekly meetings is 3 P.M.; but delays are frequent, and the board hold protracted consultations in their private room, and as soon as seated in session the business appearing before them is seemingly cut and dried, being disposed of in a marvelously rapid manner, without any discussion or debate, thus perpetuating all the evils the proposed open meetings were to avoid.

the Contempt Earned by,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/16/archives/retribution.html,the Contempt Earned by,"-- The most degrading work of the rebellion was that which was assigned to the agents who represented the Confederacy abroad. The special duty of these missionaries was to malign their country, to declare its government at once a despotism and a failure, to profess faith in and admiration for monarchical institutions, and generally to abase themselves in the dust as Americans, in the vain and hopeless task of procuring foreign intervention. There were comparatively few citizens of the United States, either South or North, at all adapted by natural instinct or by training, to perform such functions. There must have been something revolting to high-minded Americans -- call them Confederates or not -- in the very thought of cringing and crawling, and begging and praying for aid which, if it could have been purchased at all, was only procurable at the cost of traditional character, honor, self-respect and independence. SLIDELL and SANDERS, TUCKER and MASON, may have been no more active enemies of the government than those who had the courage to take up arms and fight against it at home. But in the prosecution of their special tasks, they have earned an infamous renown which will attach to no other class of the late insurgents. To-day they are, in part, earning the reward of their labors, in the contempt and scorn of those to whose evil disposition toward the United States they were so prone in pandering.

Revolution Achieved at Home and Abroad by the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/16/archives/our-revolution-at-home-and-in-europe.html,Revolution Achieved at Home and Abroad by the War,"The influence of the late war upon this nation will be as enduring as the existence of the nation itself. Like the Revolution of 1776, it signalized an era in our history -- an era in which old things passed away and all things became new. The uprooting of slavery was even a greater event than the uprooting of the old royal authority; the emancipation of the country from its influence had a deeper effect than the emancipation of our forefathers from colonial vassalage. Slavery was not merely a baleful political power -- it was a malignant social and moral force, and in fact was or attempted to be dominant in every sphere of national activity -- in church and State, in society and commerce, in school and college, in diplomacy and in the administration of justice, in the North and the South. It would not merely regulate laws and customs relating to itself; but it desired to regulate all laws and customs. It would not only legislate for Carolina and Alabama, but for Kansas and California. In throwing off its trammels, the North is freed as well as the South, the Church as well as the State, education as well as business. The national organism is freer in every muscle and every movement; we think and breathe freer, see clearer, and are stronger. Were the extirpation of the foul ulcer of slavery the only thing the war had effected, it would still have done that which must forever influence the destiny of America. But the formative power of the war itself upon the national character, the formative power of the great and noble ideas underlying the war, the demonstration of the adaptability of free republican institutions to all the exigencies of national life which has been furnished by the war, are of no less importance.

This is a truth which must never be lost sight of, or slurred over, in extolling even our bravest and best.

Our manufacturing establishments have not been able to keep pace with the requirements of the trade. The New-England mills have run far behind the demands of their patrons. Very many of them have contracted to supply goods, the production of which cannot be completed before the early months of the coming year. Several of them are refusing to take any further orders, for the present. The supplies of the leading articles in market have been nearly exhausted. Yet the demand continues vigorous, and gives no evidence of an early falling off.

Thus the burden of taxation increases from year to year, no one appearing to know why or wherefore. The city is not better governed than it was years ago; the increase of population during the past five years is, according to the census, inconsiderable; our streets are just as dirty, and just as badly lighted as ever, and yet our taxes are increasing in such ratio that our citizens begin to think the time is not far distant when they will have to abandon their property to the tax collector.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR TAXES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR TAXES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01934f28-5cdb-5c31-b54b-de69704f2c5e,159,nyt://article/01934f28-5cdb-5c31-b54b-de69704f2c5e

JOHNSON swam a few rods from the vessel, to pick up a small piece of wood, and while returning a huge shark, judged to have been fourteen or fifteen feet long, darted toward him, and seized him about the middle, and instantly disappeared with him, dragging him down, as he says, about thirty feet deep. He struggled and fought with the ravenous monster, fearfully lacerating his right arm in the effort. He finally succeeded in grasping the shark by the head, and by gouging one of his eyes, at the same time dealing him powerful blows about the head, he succeeded in wresting himself free, he then swam to the schooner pursued by the monster, but being a man of remarkable physical strength and pluck, he finally succeeded in driving him off, and got on board of the schooner, pulling himself up by the fore-topsail clue-line which hung overboard, but not until the terrible teeth had left their mark in many a gastly wound on his abdomen, groins, thigh and leg, so that he was one mass of gore. The mate and one of the crew took him in the yawl boat and rowed to the shore, landing at Bokum, whence he was conveyed in a wagon to the resilience of Dr. SKINNER, who, with Doctors BRYANT and KENDALL, sewed up and dressed his wounds, the operation lasting nearly an hour, during which time he was kept under the influence of chloroform. There were some thirty-four distinct wounds on his person. The abdomen and groin of the right side was tearfully mangled, the flesh being torn off and left hanging by the skin only, nothing but the thin lining membrane of the abdomen preventing the entrails from gushing out, the femoral vessels were laid bare, and the nerves completely reposed. On the left side of the abdomen was another wound similar in character but less extensive, the right thigh was very badly torn and gashed. Nothing but his indomitable courage and physical vigor enabled him to escape alive. The case attracts attention because of the fact that the shark must have been of the species known as ""man-eater,"" which are common in low latitudes, but are rarely seen in shoal water. The common shovel-nose shark of our waters seldom, if ever, attack mankind. JOHNSON is still living, and although in a very precarious situation, there is yet some hope of his ultimate recovery.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fight with a Shark.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fight with a Shark.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11f00751-ee5c-5672-be63-37f627fa34b1,477,nyt://article/11f00751-ee5c-5672-be63-37f627fa34b1

Again, on the entrance of the priests of the church, who were habited in surplices with richly embroidered stoles, he is reported to have said, quietly but sternly: ""The clergy of my diocese must appear in the ceremonial of to-day in the simple dress of clergymen of England."" No attention being paid to this, Dr. TAIT repeated, ""I must ask you to take off those ribands, gentlemen;"" which request was then speedily complied with. On the stone reredos behind the communion table there was a rough sketch, in charcoal, of the crucifixion, with two figures of the saints. This also was highly objectionable, and the Bishop desired that it should be obliterated. As the operation could not be well performed at that time, the incumbent, (Rev. Mr. LYFORD,) signed a memorandum to the effect that it should certainly be erased, on which the Bishop proceeded with the ceremony of dedication.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Clerical Bickerings A Lay Sermon for the Clergy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Clerical Bickerings A Lay Sermon for the Clergy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2af72c64-193f-51a1-81ac-6a009b5ff503,763,nyt://article/2af72c64-193f-51a1-81ac-6a009b5ff503

"MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS IN A CHURCH -- INVESTIGATION BY THE POLICE. -- Considerable excitement has arisen in Jersey City in consequence of groans, yells and unearthly sounds said to emanate from a church in the upper part of Jersey City for some nights past. The first known of these mysterious sounds was some ten days since, when the pastor had occasion to return to the church after evening services to procure some manuscript which he had forgotten, and had occasion to make use of. The edifice had been closed for the night, and was in total darkness. On entering he lit a match to guide him along the aisle, and when approaching the altar at the rear, his attention was attracted by a low moaning sound, which gradually increased and at the same time drew nearer to him. To this he at first paid but little heed, presuming it to be the antics of mischievous boys; but presently the sounds changed to seemingly unearthly yells, shrieks and groans, from innumerable invisible beings clustering around in close proximity to his person, until finally his feelings were so wrought upon that he felt impelled to leave the building with all possible haste. The above are substantially the facts of the case as stated by the pastor of the church to Chief of Police MCMANNUS, after reports were beginning to be circulated in the neighborhood that the church was haunted, and requesting that the matter might be kept as quiet as possible, believing that in a few days at furthest he would be able to unravel the mystery, and satisfactorily explain the cause of the sounds. Since that time the church edifice has been thoroughly examined, inside and out, but without unraveling the mystery, and meantime these dismal and unearthly yells and cries are heard almost every night. A couple of nights since, Chief of Police MCMANNUS, accompanied by Aid DOYLE and Detective E.L. MCWILLIAMS, determined to pay a visit to the reported haunted church. They accordingly procured the keys and entered the edifice shortly after midnight. Taking their position in the centre of the church, in total darkness, they had remained there but a short time when they heard a low moaning sound, apparently proceeding from the vicinity of the pulpit, which gradually grew louder and came nearer until it finally culminated around their heads into howls, yells, groans, &c., and then gradually died away as it came. After a few moments of perfect silence, Chief MCMANNUS drew from his pocket a revolver, loaded with blank cartridge, and fired one charge, when almost instantly the edifice seemed filled with thousands of infuriated demons, making the most hideous noises and apparently bent on tearing them to pieces. The officers describe having experienced a very peculiar sensation in the head, and finally the noises became so hideous and unearthly that they made a hasty retreat, apparently pursued by the infuriated demons to the door, which they closed and locked. The officers then crossed the street to the opposite walk, and remained there until daylight, but heard no further sounds, and made no discoveries which would tend to explain the mystery. The people residing in the immediate neighborhood claim to have been disturbed at all hours of the night by these demoniac sounds, and a number of them have determined to leave the neighborhood.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/17/archives/newjersey.html,,"MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS IN A CHURCH -- INVESTIGATION BY THE POLICE. -- Considerable excitement has arisen in Jersey City in consequence of groans, yells and unearthly sounds said to emanate from a church in the upper part of Jersey City for some nights past.

Valuation of Life and Limb Suggested,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/17/archives/railroad-disasters.html,Valuation of Life and Limb Suggested,"The public loudly demand that a stop be put to the slaughters by rail which daily darken our pages, and bring merited disgrace upon the country. One of the wisest of ancient legislators declared that that country was best governed in which a wrong done to the meanest citizen was considered and treated as an injury to the community of which he was a unit. People cannot and will not afford to purchase even the facilities of rapid transit by rail, at the frightful cost of half a score killed, and considerably more than that number wounded, per day. By comparison with other countries, the tale is found to be infinitely too large, and wholly unjustifiable. In the elaborate report of the violent deaths which have taken place through negligence or accident on steamboats and railroads, which was published in this paper last week, it was computed that the number of people killed on railroads in this State alone amounted to 285 during the past year, against twenty for the same period of time in Great Britain. This statement proves conclusively that guilt lies somewhere in the general conduct of our railroads; and there is no hope left of securing even a comparative degree of safety for the traveling public, but by fearlessly exposing and punishing it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Railroad Disasters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Railroad Disasters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d389cafa-045e-50e8-acaa-b581b13a45b3,513,nyt://article/d389cafa-045e-50e8-acaa-b581b13a45b3

Books Forthcoming,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/18/archives/literary-gossip.html,Books Forthcoming,"The inactivity of Summer is now fairly over, and the Fall season finds the publisher and book-trade generally fully engaged in the energetic prosecution of business. Both in its own special results to contributors and purchasers, and as a barometer to the state of the market, the New-York Trade Sale, just concluded, was unusually important. The wide section of the country unrepresented at such gatherings for the last three or four years, is again in the field, in the persons of its traders, and an unaccustomed liveliness and spirit was clearly shown in consequence. The great extent of the demand for books, however, is a cause that there are fewer novelties produced than in times of comparative depression. It is impossible for publishers to manufacture their books, already known to the public, fast enough to supply the demand, and there is consequently loss inducement to bring out new ones. School books and educational literature of a staple character take the lead in this general rush. Many whole States are absolutely bare of this kind of stock, and must be supplied at once, in addition to the steadily growing home demand. The sales of many well established school books may now be counted by millions, and with a constantly increasing future demand still in prospect. So occupied are publishers with supplying their own issues, that the new and extraordinary call for war books has necessarily fallen into other hands. This has given the canvassing, or agency business, a vast development, and the quantities of large and expensive books disposed of in this manner is something surprising, and can hardly be specified without danger of exaggeration. The rewards of literary labor are beginning to increase in the same proportion, and altogether it may be said the commerce of literature shares, fully in the general prosperity of the country.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12e6d54b-215c-5403-acdf-9c25ff332277,1177,nyt://article/12e6d54b-215c-5403-acdf-9c25ff332277
Rebel Loan; Holders and their Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/18/archives/foreign-news.html,Rebel Loan; Holders and their Meeting,"By the City of Boston we have four days later news from Europe. Financial affairs in the United States seem to occupy the most prominent place in the news. The holders of Confederate bonds had held a solemn meeting, at which it was gravely argued by the chief speaker, that inasmuch as the Federal States had conquered the Confederate States, the dominant power was in duty bound to pay the rebel debt, and the speaker explained that a certain English Vice-Chancellor had so decided. But the argument does not seem to have had the intended effect; on the contrary, the rebel loan declined one per cent. the next day. A more successful operation is likely to result (to those in the secret) from the invention of a story, said to come from New-York, that it had been officially stated that the United States would be compelled in every short time to negotiate a new loan. This ""news"" will be news indeed at Washington. The American cotton trade at Liverpool is rapidly reviving. A half-dozen of Fenian leaders, near Dundalk, have been committed for trial without benefit of bail, Sir WM. HAMILTON, Astronomer Royal at Dublin, is dead. Mr. JOHN BRIGHT's home organ says there is no truth in the rumors that he is about to visit America. The English wheat crop is reported to be in bad order. The cattle plague continues; among other remarkable facts, the entire destruction of the fine herd of cows belonging to Miss BURDETT COUTTS. The cholera excitement is nearly over, the season being so far advanced that its spread northward is daily growing more improbable. NAPOLEON and EUGENE are going to visit the King and Queen of Spain at San Sebastian. JOSEPH BONAPARTE, Prince of Musignano, is dead. EULENBURG, the murderer of Prince ALFRED's cook, has been allowed to join his regiment. The King of Prussia was to have an interview with the Queen VICTORIA on the 6th, at Darmstadt Large numbers of fugitive Dano-Schleswigians have arrived at Copenhagen.

The prospects are encouraging for an unusually interesting anniversary, which will be held in New-York, Wednesday and Thursday, Oct. 25 and 26.

The letters received are full of incidents, showing the condition and wants of the freedmen, their aptitude for learning, and their earnest desire for copies of the revised New Testament The openings for Scripture circulation are numerous; the opportunities for benefiting the souls of millions are very great.

"LAYING A CORNER-STONE. -- The ceremony of laying the corner-stone of the new St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, took place yesterday afternoon, corner of Grand and Van Vorst streets, Jersey City, in the presence of a vast assembly. The crowd evidently could not be the people of one congregation, for it seemed they had congregated from the neighboring churches. The procession started from St. Peter's Church, and was led by a cross bearer, on either side of whom was an acolyte bearing tall candlesticks and candles. These were followed by a train of altar-boys dressed in red cassocks, white surplices, and decorated with crimson sashes. The clergy, dressed in the usual costume employed in their functions, followed, the Right Rev. Bishop of Newark, JAMES ROSEVELT BAYLEY, D.D., in the rear; a deacon and sub-deacon accompanied him, wearing flowered silk vestments, called delmantics. Two small boys -- a mitre and crosier bearer -- followed these ministers. Temperance and other societies, with bands of music and gay banners, formed lines occupying in close column several blocks around the new edifice. The societies formed in open line and allowed the clergy to pass through and ascend a flight of steps on the first floor of the new edifice. The prelate commenced the religious ceremony by the blessing of a large cross erected in the place intended for the altar. He returned to the west end or front of the edifice to bless the corner-stone, the clergy meantime chanting several psalms. Instead of the usual papers in sealed bottles, it was tiles, or delf tablets, which were placed within the cavity of the cornerstone. The memoranda were in Latin, and read to this effect: ""This stone of the Church of St Peter's was laid Sept. 17, 1865, by the Most Rev. J.B. BAYLEY -- ANDREW JOHNSON being President of the United States; JOEL PARKER, Governor of New-Jersey, and ORESTES CLEVELAND being the Prefect of the city -- in presence of a large assembly of the faithful. God be praised."" On the second tablet was: ""Dedicated (this building understood) to God, the Great Omnipotent -- PIUS IX. being (Supreme Pontiff, and $#8224;JOHN Archbishop of New-York; J.B.

REED; trustees, * * and JOHN MCBRIDE. J. GARAGTHY, W.N. HENRATTI. The exercises closed by a discourse from the Rev. E. MCGLYNN, D.D. A collection was taken up, and apparently a liberal sum was contributed on the occasion toward the expenses of the building. The church is 142 feet in length, by 70 feet in width to the transept. In this latter part which is cruciform, and termed the transept, the width is ninety-four feet. It is being built of brick, trimmed with a light-colored freestone, from the Belleville quarries. It will be very lofty, having clere story and aisles. There is a high basement, for a chapel and free school. The tower and spire will be 120 feet high. The cost of the building, it is said, will not exceed $45,000.

MORRIS' Infantry Tactics, carefully revised and corrected by the author, is in readiness for the press, and will soon be published by D. VAN NOSTRAND, Broadway. This work, resulting from the experience of our troops in the field, contains the flank movements which have superseded those of the old school; and the formations of columns in mass by successive movements instead of by the complicated and fatiguing methods derived from European systems. By rejecting useless and absolete evolutions and unnecessary details, Gen. MORRIS has given us a purely practical work, which greatly increases the efficiency of infantry, and is easily acquired. Some twenty State Adjutant-Generals have given their opinions of this system and greatly prefer it to all others for State troops on account of its simplicity, and the short time required by its use to prepare troops for the field. The work is also strongly recommended as one resulting from our campaigns, and better suited to the wants of our service than the system still under government patronage, by Gens. Thomas, Meade, Foster, Warren, Humphries, Couch, Pleasonton, Dix, Hartsuff, Peck, Stoneman, Emory, Sickles, Butler, Carr, Lockwood, Stahel, Hazen, Johnson, Wilcox, Ferrero, Lanman, Cook, Meredith, Sturges, Fisk, Sweeny, Fry, Pitcher, Prall, and many other distinguished tacticians, whose brilliant careers stamp them as the highest authority.

"MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS IN A CHURCH -- INVESTIGATION BY POLICE. -- Considerable excitement has arisen in Jersey City in consequence of grams, yells and unearthly sounds said to emanate from a church in the upper part of Jersey City for some nights past. The first known of these mysterious sounds was some ten days since, when the pastor had occasion to return to the church after evening services to procure some manuscript which he had forgotten, and had occasion to make use of. The edifice had been closed for the night, and was in total darkness. On entering he lit a match to guide him along the aisle, and when approaching the altar at the roar, his attention was attracted by a low meaning sound, which gradually increased and at the same time drew nearer to him. To tide he at first paid but little heed, presuming it to be the antics of mischievous boys; but presently the sounds changed to seemingly unearthly yells, shrieks and groans, from innumerable invisible beings clustering around in close proximity to his person, until finally his feelings were so wrought upon that he felt impelled to leave the building with all possible haste. The above are substantially the facts of the case as stated by the pastor of the church to Chief of Police MCMANNUS, after reports were beginning to be circulated in the neighborhood that the church was haunted, and requesting that the matter might be kept as quiet as possible, believing that in a few days at furthest he would be able to unravel the mystery, and satisfactorily explain the cause of the sounds. Since that time the church edifice has been thoroughly examined, inside and out, but without unraveling the mystery, and meantime these dismal and unearthly yells and cries are heard almost every night. A couple of nights since, Chief of Police MCMANNUS, accompanied by Aid DOYLE and Detective E.L. MCWILLIAMS, determined to pay a visit to the reported haunted church. They accordingly procured the keys and entered the edifice shortly after midnight. Taking their position in the centre of the church, in total darkness, they had remained there but a short time when they heard a low moaning sound, apparently proceeding from the vicinity of the pulpit, which gradually grew louder and came nearer until it finally culminated around their heads into howls, yells, groans, &c., and then gradually died away as it came. After a few moments of perfect silence, Chief MCMANNUS drew from his pocket a revolver, loaded with blank cartridge, and fired one charge, when almost instantly the edifice seemed filled with thousands of infuriated demons, making the most hideous noises and apparently bent on tearing them to pieces. The officers describe having experienced a very peculiar sensation in the head, and finally the noises became so hideous and unearthly that they made a hasty retreat, apparently pursued by the infuriated demons to the door, which they closed and locked. The officers then crossed the street to the opposite walk, and remained there until daylight, but heard no further sounds, and made no discoveries which would tend to explain the mystery. The people residing in the immediate neighborhood claim to have been disturbed at all hours of the night by these demoniac sounds, and a number of them have determined to leave the neighborhood.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/18/archives/newjersey.html,,"MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS IN A CHURCH -- INVESTIGATION BY POLICE. -- Considerable excitement has arisen in Jersey City in consequence of grams, yells and unearthly sounds said to emanate from a church in the upper part of Jersey City for some nights past.

"The Independence Belge is responsible for the following story: ""The events which we are about to relate occurred in a Belgian village near the frontier of France. The hero is a farmer of considerable property, who has been a widower for some years past. Since the death of his wife this farmer, whom we will name M.X., has addicted himself to drinking, and on the evening of the 13th August he returned home in a state of intoxication. On the following day, the morning was already far advanced, and M.X. had not appeared. One of his sons went to the door of his room and knocked, but received no answer. Entering, he saw his father apparently asleep, but found all efforts to awake him fruitless -- M.X. gave no sign of life. Terrified by this, the young man called in his family, a doctor is brought, and all sorts of pains are taken to recover him. He is, however, to all appearance, dead. At the moment of signing the certificate for his burial the doctor hesitates. Certain signs makes him doubt whether his patient is really dead. For forty-eight hours he never quits the bedside of the farmer whom he strives to reanimate, even calling in the help of another physician. They try everything which can be thought of, but all is useless, and the funeral is ordered. M.X. was generally respected, and the neighbors wish to show their kind feeling toward the children -- hence all the village is on foot to carry him to his last home. His orphan children fellow the coffin with sobs and tears. Chief among the mourners in the eldest daughter of the deceased, a young girl of eighteen, who suffers under a heavy affliction -- she is dumb. The sad ceremony goes on until suddenly -- just at the moment when the coffin is about to be lowered into the grave -- a noise is heard, which undoubtedly proceeds from the coffin. The frightened undertakers fled, but the courageous doctor rushes forward, and with the help of some of the bystanders wrenches off the lid, when forth steps M.X. alive and well. At this moment the dumb daughter's emotion is so great that the infirmity which had held her for the last ten years disappears, and with filial love she exclaims, 'Mon pere!' and faints away.

In this case Mr. HENRY D. STOVER seeks to show that while he was incarcerated in Fort Lafayette, his counsel, Mr. DAVID M. PORTER, defrauded him of $25,000 by pretending that for that sum he could secure his release. The testimony of Mr. WILSON was substantially as follows: I reside in Washington; was Assistant District-Attorney from Feb. 1, 1864; am acquainted with David M. Porter; never authorized him to receive any money from Mr. Stover; lived eight years in Washington; was appointed special counsel to the Navy Department by the Secretary of the Navy; saw Mr. Stover for the first time on the 6th of July; cannot say of how many charges Mr. Stover was found guilty; I saw the charges about four months since; Mr. Stover never tried to retain me as his counsel, but his friends did; the first I knew of my name being in the case was in Washington; I went to Stover, and asked the reason why my name was used; did not know whether the government intended to make additional charges; have been books and am making an examination; am thinking of preferring charges, but am not satisfied about Stover's guilt; never told Mr. Porter that charges would be preferred; tried several cases; had my suspicions aroused; suspected all the Navy Agents were acting improperly; also knew that Mr. Stover was the largest contractor; was informed Stover and Henderson were immediately connected; did not think that any open bribes were given. The witness denied that any money or presents, given either directly or indirectly, would have been acceptable as a compensation for what he might have done to procure the release of STOVER, and he d d not receive any compensation from Mr. PORTER. A report was made by witnesses to the Secretary of the Navy as to the case of STOVER, and he (witness) supposed that a note had been sent to Gen. DIX, and in that way he thought the release of STOVER had been effected; did not know of any other agency that had been employed.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Stover-Porter Case.; THE TESTIMONY OF MR.

The building was one of the largest in the city, having a frontage of two hundred and forty feet on Cherry-street, and about one hundred feet frontage on the river side. A fierce northerly gale prevailed at the time, rapidly sweeping the flames through the building, which was filled with cotton, sugar, hemp, saltpetre, rosin, linseed oil, and a great variety of other merchandise on storage. Fortunately, the wind was ""off shore,"" else the destruction of property must have been enormous. So rapidly did the flames leap from story to story, that 15 minutes subsequent to the discovery the entire edifice was a mass of fire, and before the fireman had limbered their hose the roof and walls of COE's warehouse had fallen, and there was evidence that the adjoining five-story warehouses, which are designated as No. 750 and A, B, C, and D Water-street, and which were occupied by Mr. WILLIAM LAWRENCE, must also fall. Half-an-hour subsequently these five stores were a vast sheet of flame, presenting one of the wildest of imaginable scenes. Fears being entertained that the Judd Oil Works and other establishments in Cherry and neighboring streets must be consumed, and it being manifest that the burning warehouses could not be saved, the firemen bent their energies to the work of confining the fire; and in this they were, happily, successful until about 4 o'clock, when the fire again threatened surrounding property, and Chief-Engineer KINGSLAND sent a telegram for steamer Metropolitan, No. 1, and other down-town fire machinery. These soon reached the spot and went to work with efficiency; but even with all the steam power thus added, the firemen were unable to keep the flames under, and at about 10 o'clock last night the piers on East-street took fire, driving the Fire Department off. A telegram was promptly sent for Harbor Police-boat No. 1, but as she is lying up for repairs, Chief KINGSLAND was compelled to press several ferry-boats into service. The fire was burning in an immense mass of cotton, hemp and resin, at our hour of going to press, and the eastern heavens were illuminated.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FIRES.; Disastrous Conflagration on the East Side Incendiarism.

L.; Changes in England in Few Years","To a traveler who has not seen England for ten years, it is very plain that great changes have been going on in the nation. The ""middle class,"" almost unconsciously to itself, has been rising continually in power. The manufacturers and merchants have accumulated immense fortunes, many of which have been at once invested in land, thus creating a new kind of land-holding class. The nobility have often been only too glad to connect themselves with these wealthy commoners. But the great changes have arisen from the intense mental activity and unbounded energy of the middle class. In all departments the purely intellectual, the scientific, the reformatory, the works of organization and industry, and the immense range of their financial enterprises, one sees the fruits of this powerful body. And they are growing conscious of their strength. For the first time in associating with Englishmen, have I seen in this visit no toadyism. No commoner had happened on a single occasion to speak incidentally of his friendship or acquaintance with Lord this or Duke that in any different tone from what he would use if speaking of Mr. Smith or Mr. Brown. I see that the middle class circles are often sufficient of themselves, with less social struggling for an intimacy with the aristocracy than used to be the fact.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Changes in England During the Last Few Years.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Changes in England During the Last Few Years.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e9e57f5e-78f3-5ad2-a16d-729a0a4064c4,1543,nyt://article/e9e57f5e-78f3-5ad2-a16d-729a0a4064c4

A gallant soldier of the republic inaugurated the exhibition in an eloquent address, fitly complimenting the vigor and brain of the men whose strength and will had been so largely instrumental in bringing the nation through its peril, and then happily urged an immediate return to the channels of olden pursuit and success. A great crowd attended, and for its information and delectation were provided at every point evidences of the skill and handiwork of the people. In one room are clean cut models for ships; in another engines as conspicuous for capacity and power as for simplicity of construction and cheapness; beyond are pianos and other instruments of melody; around the walls hang specimens of photography, the equal of which the world is defied to bring, while countless inventions for the saving of labor and the advancement of our national interests crowd the rooms.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The American Institute Exhibition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The American Institute Exhibition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f21d8312-ffd1-55bd-a52f-5892c3ea6096,687,nyt://article/f21d8312-ffd1-55bd-a52f-5892c3ea6096

"""HAUNTED CHURCH"" EXCITEMENT. -- The announcement of hideous and unaccountable noises, said to have been heard for a few nights past in one of the up-town places of worship in Jersey City, and which has caused a story to be circulated that the church is haunted, has occasioned considerable excitement not only in Jersey City, but elsewhere. On Sunday night hundreds of men, women and children congregated in the vicinity of the up-town churches, intent upon satisfying a morbid curiosity. About forty persons came over from Hoboken, -- among them a self-constituted committee of church members -- to investigate the mystery. There were also persons present from New-York and other localities, who listened to all sorts of stories told by the knowing ones, and they went away no wiser than they came. A mob of about 200 persons assembled in front of Grace Church, in Erie-street, corner of South Seventh, while services were in progress, and caused much annoyance to the worshippers. Under the fear that a demonstration would be made upon the building, Chief of Police MCMANUS was applied to and dispatched a posse of police, who dispersed the assemblage. The German Catholic Church in South Eighth-street, and the Third Reformed Dutch Church at Hamilton-square, were also surrounded until a late hour, but the parties eventually departed without having their curiosity satisfied.

It deserves to be remembered to the honor and sagacity of these railway princes, that it was during the very stormiest period of the late conflict that the bulk of the money for the building of the Atlantic and Great Western Road was raised under their auspices in England. It is true that nearly every other industry at the North, as well as that of building railroads, was maintained in a state of activity during all the years of war. It is true that the energy and spirit of our commercial and manufacturing class at no period -- even the darkest of the struggle -- failed them. But it is none the less to the credit of men like Sir MORTON PETO and Mr. KINNARD that, as foreign capitalists and non-residents, they saw throughout the whole of our conflict sufficient reason, amid evil and good reports, to trust in the stability of our institutions, in the financial honor of our business public, and in the permanent and uninterrupted material and social progress of the country. The organs of public sentiment most trusted by the British people -- especially those organs which best reflected the opinions of the financial world of Europe -- were all devoted to daily illustrations of the rapidity and certainty of our downfall as an independent nation. Our credit was assailed in the daily issues of the ""leading journal"" of Europe as the credit of no other nation had ever before been assailed. Universal bankruptcy, from one end of the United States to the other, was predicted for us with a confidence and assurance which men were not permitted to gainsay. Our ""securities"" served to give point and pungency to the sneers of the Anglo-Confederate oracles, and were a standing joke at every commercial resort where the SAMPSONS and the SPENCES were accepted as authority. Germany and her small capitalists were held up to the derision of the English world as the credulous dupes of United States borrowing agents. And it was made a special reproach against the late RICHARD COBDEN in the leading columns of the London Times, that he was righteously a victim, financially, to his trust in American stocks.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The British Railway Kings and Their Investments.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The British Railway Kings and Their Investments.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/405e17b6-2520-56bd-aa9c-f26f3aafec32,508,nyt://article/405e17b6-2520-56bd-aa9c-f26f3aafec32

Upon cross-examination it was found that Cassills denied that it was the pocket-book of witness, as the money she alleged was in it did not correspond with what Cassills saw in it. He asked what was in the pocket-book she left, and the reply was, ""Three $10 bills, some Confederate money and some pawn tickets."" Cassills then said no such amount of money was in the pocket-book, and it couldn't be hers.

The answer was accounted good. If wealth lifts an individual above venality, even without the aid of moral principle, there is no reason why it should not have that effect upon a newspaper.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/20/archives/general-city-news.html,,"SOLDIERS DRUGGED AND ROBBED. -- The outlines of a system of atrocious robberies that have recently been perpetrated upon our returning soldiers, are given by Col. GURNSEY, of the Twenty-sixth United States Colored Infantry, as follows: Steamboats are chartered to make excursions in the harbor; soldiers who have just been paid off are induced to take passage to the city; when on board they are carried about the harbor and amused, while drugged or stupefying liquors are sold to them, and ruffians sell them spurious jewelry or other worthless articles, and by false representations and sometimes by threats, succeed in robbing them of a large part of their wages. The soldiers are in many cases paid on Hart's Island, from one hundred to four or five hundred dollars each on final settlement, and the gains of the persons who swindle them are proportionally large. There were some very singular occurrences on board the steamboat Massasoil on Monday of last week. Three hundred soldiers of the Twenty-sixth United States Colored Infantry, who embarked at Hart's Island, were not landed, as they desired, but were conveyed to various places in the harbor, were sickened with vile drinks, and thieves operated freely among them. Finally, the commander of the soldiers, Col. GURNSEY, found it necessary to put the Captain of the boat, MCLEAN, under arrest; and, in consequence of this fact, the soldiers were not robbed to the extent, the officers believe, they would otherwise have been. Col. BROWNE, the United States Paymaster, who had paid the colored soldiers $400 each, was on the boat. He had $40,000 government funds in his possession; and information was given to him that some of the ruffians on board were making plans to seize the money. For two hours and a half he held his loaded pistol in his hand, and he was not molested. It was by his advice that Capt. MCLEAN was compelled to place the colored soldiers on shore at Peck-slip. Col. GURNSEY and one of his officers have since been arrected for constructive assault and battery upon the Captain of the boat, and the suit will soon come before the courts. Mr. JACKSON S. SCHULTZ is the bondsman of the officers, and Col. GEORGE BLISS their counsel. The case will come up on Friday morning, before Justice DOWLING, at the Tombs.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-09-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78b691d2-c5b4-53d1-be0d-16db8f651807,1239,nyt://article/78b691d2-c5b4-53d1-be0d-16db8f651807

But the region has been, and still is, to some extent, dominated by savage Indians. Within the last ten years, the wild Apaches have driven off, very often, parties of American explorers and miners, and large numbers of these adventurous men have lost their lives. But latterly our government has been sending troops there, and posts have now been established at the principal commanding positions in the territory. There are good prospects for the mines and for the miners and settlers of all kinds.

Mr. Wm.H. Anthon represented the prisoner, Ferris, and Mr. A.O. Hall appeared for the people. The facts involved in this case are briefly as follows: At a late hour on the night of Friday, the 9th of September, 1864, Ferris, the prisoner, made an attack on his wife, Rosannah Ferris, at their residence, No. 31 James-street, in this city. The testimony subsequently given all tended to show that the attack was made with an ax; that he struck her several blows on the head, penetrating the skull. The surgeon, who was called in soon after, found that the brains of the unfortunate woman were oozing through the skull, and, owing to the irregular and jagged nature of the orifices, the operator was unable to close the skull until he had cut off large portions of the protruding brain. The wife remained insensible for about two days after the assault, when she expired. On the Coroner's inquest it was shown that both the husband and wife were quarrelsome. Ferris was arrested, indicted, and on the 27th and 28th days of February, and the 1st day of March of the present year, he was tried before Hon. Recorder Hoffman. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and thereupon the Recorder soon after sentenced him to be hung on the 14th of the ensuing April. This sentence would have been carried into effect on the day specified, but for the fact that prisoner's counsel obtained a stay of proceedings until such time as the matter could be brought before the Supreme Court at General Term on a writ of error, and bill of exceptions to the charge of the magistrate who presided at the trial.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ferris Wife-Murder Motion for a New Trial Before the General Term.; SUPREME COURT GENERAL TERM SEPT. 19.

A report was circulated during the earlier stages of the conflagration that a large quantity of combustibles and explosives were on storage in the warehouses, and hearing this, many firemen withdrew; but they subsequently resumed work on being assured that the report was erroneous. One of the buildings was one hundred and fifty feet by two hundred and fifty, and three stories high. The second building was one hundred and fifty feet by two hundred and fifty, and five stories high. These two warehouses were separated by a space of five feet. At the time of the fire the windows of the bonded stores were open, and the flames almost instantly communicated from the free to the bonded stores. Many of the owners had open accounts at these warehouses, and it is not known precisely how much merchandise they had therein at the time of the fire.

That any party here -- counting a bare baker's dozen -- seriously proposes to garrison every county of the South with black regiments, we do not believe; first, because there have been no serious disturbances on the part of the black or the white population of the South since the war closed; and next, because the whole people, North and South, believe in the early reduction of the national army to a point which would make the garrisoning of the South impossible. A few raving fanatics may still shout for subjugation and extermination, as they did all through the war; but they belong to that class which rendered the least service to the nation while the conflict was going on.

"lished three or four most entertaining volumes of military history. They summoned before them nearly all the Generals of the Union army, engaged in nearly all the battles, from the Susquehanna to the Red River, and obtained their testimony as to their own behavior and that of their fellow-officers. Would it not be well for this committee to continue its labors, and summon before it for examination the leading Generals of the late army of the late Southern Confederacy? If the object of the committee's labors was to get at the facts of the various campaigns and furnish material for history and literature for posterity, it would be well that they should carry out this suggestion. There were many points left in the dark; there were many intricate things left unraveled, because we could not get at the facts as to the condition of things on the other side of the lines, and as to the movements, manoeuvres and purposes of the enemy. All these matters can now be reached. The Southern officers would doubtless he very glad to give their testimony. LEE, JOHNSTON, LONGSTREET, EARLY and the others, would promptly obey the summons.

They summoned before them nearly all the Generals of the Union army, engaged in nearly all the battles, from the Susquehanna to the Red River, and obtained their testimony as to their own behavior and that of their fellow-officers. Would it not be well for this committee to continue its labors, and summon before it for examination the leading Generals of the late army of the late Southern Confederacy? If the object of the committee's labors was to get at the facts of the various campaigns and furnish material for history and literature for posterity, it would be well that they should carry out this suggestion. There were many points left in the dark; there were many intricate things left unraveled, because we could not get at the facts as to the condition of things on the other side of the lines, and as to the movements, manoeuvres and purposes of the enemy. All these matters can now be reached. The Southern officers would doubtless he very glad to give their testimony. LEE, JOHNSTON, LONGSTREET, EARLY and the others, would promptly obey the summons.

"The market opened Monday morning with 3,540 beeves upon the books, including 510 sold during the closing days of last week. Only 16 came in during Monday night; 1,705 head were sold at Bergen, mostly on Saturday; 170 were taken direct to butchers' stalls, and 874 to the other smaller yards in the city. Some few very choice lots of corn-fed cattle brought this week as high as 19c. lb., but those were superior in quality to any offered at the market last week. Taking an average of the market from its opening to its close, prices for the same grades were not more than 1/2c. lb. higher than last week. There were as usual several lots of poor Canadian stock, consisting of working cattle, thin cows, &c, which went off at a very low figure. The present high rates are calling in everything with hide and horns at all fit for butchering purposes, from all parts of the country. The actual demand is more than equal to the supply; nor does there appear to be, as some suppose, any very great reserve held back by speculators for the purpose of keeping up prices. Especially is this the case with beef cattle. The enormous price of pork at the West has led to a larger consumption of beef than hitherto, and now the demand for this article is taking off the supply as fast as it can be fitted for the market. At the same time we do not deny that speculation has aided in maintaining advanced rates at the meat market, as elsewhere.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/21/archives/cattle-trade-on-fortyfourthstreet.html,,"The market opened Monday morning with 3,540 beeves upon the books, including 510 sold during the closing days of last week.

L.; European Social Reforms; Irish Prison System","Some fifteen years ago, the writer of this, in company with some friends, was making a foot journey over England. In the course of their wanderings, they chanced on some persons enthusiastically interested in a new system of prison treatment, as it had been applied by a certain Capt. MACONOCHIE, on Norfolk Island. The ideas and method struck the whole of them as something wonderful, yet most natural, and as far in advance of any prison system then in use in the world. One of the party, whose name has since become widely known in England and America, Mr. F.L. OLMSTEAD, wrote a brief account of this remarkable system and its principles, in a little work called Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England. This was, perhaps, the first description of the ""mark system"" presented in America. The writer of this has also, at various times, urged it in the American Press. But in general, it may be said that the most reasonable and original system for the treatment of convicts, which modern benevolence has invented, was utterly unappreciated in the life of its founder, and that the ideas which Capt. MACONOCHIE planted twenty-five or thirty years ago, and which only brought annoyance, disappointment, and almost heart-break to himself, have just now begun to take root and spring up in what is called the ""Irish Prison System.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; The Irish Prison System.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; The Irish Prison System.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a228cb2-0822-546c-bbba-344e298335f3,1048,nyt://article/0a228cb2-0822-546c-bbba-344e298335f3

"Edward Tracey, a laboring man, was charged with assaulting Officer Cornelius Western, of the Eleventh Precinct. Witness said he caught defendant's son attempting to commit a burglary. The thief fled, and took refuge in a large tenement building in which his father resided. The officer was near enough to see the entry way in which the fugitive took refuge, but lost him in the darkness as he groped his way up stairs. On one of the upper floors, where the officer thought the burglar might have entered, he knocked at the door of an innocent German, and roused him up. The German opened the door, with night-cap on, in undress, and with a sickly-looking candle in his hand, and was almost frightened out of his wits when he saw the embodiment of law, if not justice, standing on the sill of his door. When informed that it was supposed that a burglar had taken refuge in his apartments, he said: ""Mine herr, mine herr; up, up,"" and he conducted the officer to the room overhead, where somebody had entered in haste a few moments before. The German and the officer, after getting the door opened, entered together, and the burglar was found in bed undressed. He had made a quick undressing. He asked for time to put his pantaloons on. This was granted; and as soon as had got one leg in he made a dash for the door to get out, but was stopped by the officer. He then got both legs in his pantaloons, mounted a chair and tried to jump through a small window that would have landed him in the hallway. His gymnastic feat was a failure; he only butted his head against the wall. By this time the father of the burglar, Mr. Tracy, who had gone to bed legitimately, had finished dressing himself; and when Officer Western seized his prisoner to take him off, he clasped his arms around the officer's neck and gave him a choking hug.

Dexter, Gen. Butler.Geo. Wilkes, for $1,000","The first of the two great Fall purses offered by the proprietor of the Fashion Course, came off yesterday, viz.: Mile heats, best three in five, in harness. The entries comprised the stallion George Wilkes, the brown gelding Dexter, the black gelding Gen. Butler, the gray mare Blonde and the chestnut mare Lady Emma. Of these the first three only came to the score, the other two, for obvious reasons, declining to put in an appearance. The probabilities of a great and exciting race, and the certainty that with a clear day and good track something unusual would be on the tapis, induced an unusually large attendance. It seemed a foregone conclusion that something beyond an ordinary trot was on hand, and due preparations were made by the management, represented by Mr. CROCHERON, for doing it full honor. For once in a while we are disposed to award the Flushing Railroad credit for the excellence of their arrangements. The early morning trains were run with due punctuality; the half-past 1 o'clock specially advertised, which so few believed that they refrained from purchasing tickets until it was in the shed, was absolutely a fixed fact, and, strange to say, on time -- a fact which we record to the credit of the company, as their lapses have neither been few or far between, and it is pleasurable to notice anything in the shape of an improvement in the management of this road, which is the great and only outlet of New-Yorkers to the Fashion Course, unless they possess private vehicles. Unblest in this respect, it is really with extreme satisfaction that we record the fact that on this occasion the railroad people fulfilled their promises. For a day or two previously Dexter had been unquestionably the favorite against the field -- the odds settling down on Wednesday evening to 100 to 60 on him. On Thursday morning, prior to a departure for the course, he stood at even against the field. The track was crowded, the patrons of the trotting turf flocking to it by rail and road, many of the latter, owing to the crowded state of the ferries, not being able to put in an appearance until after the first heat was disposed o[???]. Rarely have we seen so unexceptionable an attendance at the Fashion Course. The strictest decorum was maintained, a large force of the Metropolitan Police being present, but as far as their services were required, they might just as well have been in New-York -- the days when roughs and rowdies can rule a race course are past, and henceforth the strong feeling of gentlemanly management, and the observance of strict propriety will be observed -- not only at the Fashion Course, but at every other which bears a time-honored name.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUT-DOOR SPORTS.; The Trotting Turf.

"WALLACK's THEATRE. -- Mr. LESTER WALLACK drew to his establishment last evening one of the most fashionable and critical audiences that could at any period of the season be attracted to a place of amusement. Every one was there, and every one listened to the new play with attention. The name of the play is the ""Serf"" -- a piece powerful and even painful in its interest, but not we think destined to a phenomenal longevity. Writing hastily after a protracted and late performance we cannot speak of Mr. TAYLOR's production in due terms of criticism. We prefer for the moment to record the success of the artists who took part in it. Mr. E.L. DAVENPORT was received with favor, and justified every hand that was raised in his applause. Miss MADELINE HENRIQUES was in each scene thoroughly admirable, and in the last act touched every one with the true pathos and naturalness of her style. Mr. JOHN GILBERT and Mr. FISHER and Mr. GEORGE HOLLAND -- in a way which we shall hereafter discriminate -- obtained their usual degree of applause.

The rumored alliance would set a seal upon the diplomatic relations recently established between the two countries, and would go far to heal the hurt which the Re Galantuomo inflicted on his Bourbon cousin of Spain, by consenting to receive at the hands of GARIBALDI the crown rent from his Bourbon cousin of Naples. Since it is rumored that the King has lately shown a tendency to favor the least liberal faction of politics among his subjects, the match might afford some further crumbs of comfort to the patient Reaction which has gone empty so long in Italy. It might be taken as a sign that the revolution, which placed VICTOR EMANUEL at the head of nearly all the Italian States, had accomplished itself, and that generous patriotism was hardening into selfish order. The Pope might look with satisfaction on a union of the family of his erring son with that of most Catholic Spain, and might cordially join with the heirs of FRA DIAVOLO, (to whom VICTOR EMANUEL still pays the pension bestowed on their illustrious ancestor,) in rejoicing over the introduction into Italy of that royal Spanish blood which has always been so favorable to brigandage.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spanish-Italian Amity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spanish-Italian Amity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SPANISH', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/54e869ac-d122-5767-8d35-65b710115d0b,1030,nyt://article/54e869ac-d122-5767-8d35-65b710115d0b

It is not by any means to be understood that this decision arose from any new doubt which had sprung up in the Judge's mind as to the illegality of the tax, for he says again, in his decision, the though the question is not a clear one, his best justment is that the tax cannot be legally imposed.

Gen. BARLOW was a hater of slavery, from conviction that liberty was the equal right of all human beings. Educated at Harvard, where he was the honor man of his class, he was known to his fellow-students as the keenest, the most logical and most combative of disputants on the great question which then agitated the country.

And among the methods proposed for his benefit, assisted emigration to various tropical regions has been much discussed. In the pamphlet which Mr. MITCHELL has just issued, he furnishes a statement of the action of President LINCOLN and the late Congress in regard to such emigration, and the present condition of the question. Quoting the Act of July, 1862, authorizing the President to make provision for colonizing such of the colored race as were willing to emigrate, Mr. MITCHELL calls attention to the Emancipation Proclamation of September 1862 and January 1863, which he considers contain solemn obligations to carry out the provisions of that act. The commission to Mr. MITCHELL was issued on August 4, 1862, and is still unrevoked. The funds necessary were provided by a clause in the tax law of June 1862, the amount subject to requisition on July 31 of the present year being $205,980.

High Freight Rates on Coal,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/23/archives/gas-coal-the-baltimore-and-ohio-railroad.html,High Freight Rates on Coal,"-- A singular policy has been adopted by the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company in the inauguration and maintenance of freight rates which are injurious to all the great interests lying along its immense extent. The City of New-York consumes some two hundred and twenty-five thousand tons of gas coal, Brooklyn and Williamsburgh sixty thousand, Hoboken and Jersey City twenty-five thousand, or upward of three hundred and ten thousand tons for this city and its suburbs. Owing to the high freight which the Baltimore and Ohio road imposes, it is impossible to bring to market the excellent gas coal lying west of Cheat River. The Cities of New-York, Boston and all those in this section are thus forced to resort to Nova Scotia, Cape Breton and Pictou. The Baltimore and Ohio Railway will move flour and Western freight, which it has to handle, for fifty cents per ton from the Ohio River less than coal, which it simply transports, and other way freight, which has to be transported over two to three hundred miles less of road. It charges this intermediate freight fifty to eighty cents more for not being two to three hundred miles further from its destination.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GAS COAL THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GAS COAL THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8657f32-c039-5b61-b62e-b3692e4f1a40,291,nyt://article/c8657f32-c039-5b61-b62e-b3692e4f1a40

This occurrence might not be deemed worthy of notice were it not for the statement in the same journal that the number of military murders of this class committed of late seems to call for exceptional treatment at the hands of the British legislature. Indeed, the London Times proposes, if it does not advocate, that cases of this description might, with advantage to the public interest, be taken from under the cognizance of the civil courts and referred to courts martial.

London Telegraph on Shoddy in Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/24/archives/shoddy-in-paris.html,London Telegraph on Shoddy in Paris,"Shoddy is here at last; and the mouth of Paris waters and the ears of Paris tingle at the sight and sound of its well-filled pockets. I have just returned from half-an-hour's lounge in the court-yard of the Hotel, SHODDY's headquarters. Behold him in his magnificance as he reclines gracefully upon two chairs, one arm thrown over the back of a third, his boot heel resting, at an elevation considerably higher than his head, upon the rim of one of the wooden tubs that contain the fan-like palmiers. He is smoking his seventh cigar, while he waits the return of his wife and daughters from their drive -- be it recorded en passant that female Shoddy never walks -- and here they come! Fat, sallow and long past forty, the matron Shoddy sits bolt upright, for if she reclined the world would lose half her attractions, and while seeing she drives to be seen. She has diamonds in her ears; she has pearls around her neck; and a Niagara of pearls flowing over her mountainous bosom. She has heavy bracelets on her arms, rings epon her fingers, and would have bells upon her toes if the prejudices of society were not against such a fashion. The Shoddy maidens are as refulgent as their mother. The whole courtyard as they enter brightens up as with a sudden burst of sunbeams, and as they descend, which they do somewhat heavily, from the carriage, there is a prolonged metallic rattle, as though they wore, which in great part they do, chain armour over their clothes. Shoddy himself, cigar in mouth -- it is never out except to eat, drink, or spit -- iounges over to them, consults his watch, a costly affair, a size or so smaller than the hotel clock above his head, and hinting that it is luncheon time, states his intention of ""putting himself outside of something right off."" The ladies replying, through their noses, that they have no ""objecshuns,"" the whole party shine and rattle up the steps, and are soon engaged in ""taking stock"" -- the phrase is Shoddy -- of a light and elegant repast, consisting of Strasbourg pie, pickled salmon, lobster salad, cucumber, and cheese, washed down by two bottles of Cliquot, and concluded with what the ladies denominate a ""freshener up,"" and the gentlemen a ""corpse reviver!"" This glorious vision had scarcely vanished from my view, when my attention was called, by their very high voices, to a meeting of shoddy ladies who were waiting, as they termed it, ""to be hauled up to their rooms by the diving bell."" They were yellower in every way than the party I have just mentioned, as brassy and more bilious, keeping up a high-pressure conversation in voices pitched to the keynote of a railway whistle. Forced to become a listener, I was favored in less than five minutes with much domestic information, which, wiser than they, I shall keep to myrelf, merely recording the fact that Jane, the daughter of one of the ladies, was at that moment ""fixing herself up"" for a drive in the Bois, and that STEPHEN had gone out with his father ""to liquor."" Do I exaggerate? Certainly not.

SMITH, President, promply sent two of their steam ferry-boats to the dock, which put on eight streams of water. The committee also hired private engines and tug-boats to work by the day, paying from $15 per hour to $100 per day. The late heavy losses by fire and the evident inefficiency of the fire apparatus, have rendered both insurers and insured extremely anxious as to the present condition of affairs.

According to the affidavits, THOMAS SMITH, of Prince-street, who had been gambling in ""Fatty"" WELSH'S den, in Broadway, near East Houston-street, on the morning of the 19th inst., went from that place with $1,185 in his pockets, and was accompanied by MATTHEW MOORE to a saloon at the intersection of Greene and Prince streets, where MOORE demanded SMITH's money. SMITH refusing to surrender, MOORE garroted him, and took the $1,185 from him; then, springing toward the door, ho was about to escape, but was seized by SMITH. MOORE now drew his revolver, and, placing its muzzle at SMITH's forehead, threatened to blow SMITH's brains out. SMITH having released MOORE, the latter leisurely walked away, coolly remarking that no one need trouble to arrest him, as he had five hundred politicians to aid him out of the meshes of the law. Notwithstanding this threat, Justice DOWLING issued a warrant, on Friday, and Capt. JOHN JOURDAN took the case in hand. Meantime the case was presented to the Grand Jury, and that body promptly brought in a true bill against MOORE for robbery in the first degree, and a bench-warrant was granted by City Judge RUSSEL. On Friday night Capt. JOURDAN and Sergeant QUINN arrested MOORE, and he was committed to the Tombs prison, yesterday morning, without bail.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Tombs Before Justice Dowling.; THE MOORE-FRIERY GANG', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Tombs Before Justice Dowling.; THE MOORE-FRIERY GANG', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a04f4a06-ca7b-5597-94ea-ac623b4d8a6c,254,nyt://article/a04f4a06-ca7b-5597-94ea-ac623b4d8a6c

Mr. ADDISON, his daughter, and Mr. SOTHERN, visited the celebrated ""blarney stone."" Nothing daunted by the discovery that the party performing the kissing operation must of necessity be held by the heels over a parapet some hundred feet from the ground, Mr. ADDISON insisted on Mr. SOTHERN seizing him round the ancles, two guides also holding Mr. SOTHERN. The stone was triumphantly kissed, and Mr. SOTHERN becoming rather tired of the novel position of holding 14 stone by the heels, suddenly called out to the guides to pull away. They did so; but the 14 stone, not anticipating such an energetic hoist without some signal, clung to the iron bar by which the celebrated pebble is supported. The consequence was one of Mr. ADDISON's boots came off, and for a short time he was held in this frightful position by one ancle only. By a great effort, however, he at last succeeded in giving Mr. SOTHERN, his other foot, and he was hauled up. During this scene his daughter was so terrified that she became speechless and sunk to the grass.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b92ee5b2-8f06-57a1-af39-66ad948a8da9,2760,nyt://article/b92ee5b2-8f06-57a1-af39-66ad948a8da9

"Jenkins, the, on the Beach Shooting Case",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/24/archives/the-jenkins-of-tragedy.html,"Jenkins, the, on the Beach Shooting Case","Some days ago we read in an evening paper, with that subdivision of sensation which the arrangement of the different phases of an event under as many different captions, is apt to produce in the reader, an account of the suicide of an unhappy priest who cut his throat on the cars somewhere in Massachusetts. We thought at the time it was perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing, in many respects, which we had ever seen. There was an awful simplicity, and a kind of compressed breathlessness, if we may so speak, in the narration, which we found very admirable; we recall with peculiar distinctness the thrill awakened by the description of the conductor who ""took the razor from the maniac, closed it, carried it to the other end of the car, and laid it in a place of safety;"" after which, we think, he retired and left the madman to his reflections. In this history, -- for though not philosophized narrative, this account certainly rose above mere report in dignity, -- there was visible a certain repression of language and manner which was also extremely fine: a result as from a powerful and glowing imagination, held in check by the chilling probabilities of the editorial management: the stern, rigid, all-but Dantesque compactness of a Jenkins who knew that his noblest sentiment and most eloquent imagery would have been mercilessly lopped away, and who avoided the humiliation by avoiding the obnoxious splendor of diction and thought. We feel sure that the being who produced the history in question, would have added some general observations on suicide; but the same exigency which forbade him to adorn his tale, would not permit him to point his moral. He was therefore obliged, apparently, to tell his story straight-farwardly, and to stop when he got through; to let the homily which would have followed so naturally, rot in his breast, like the suppressed disquisitions of Sancho Panza.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Jenkins of Tragedy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Jenkins of Tragedy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'CHICAGO', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f3616240-c3ac-5ec1-bb43-f007f819d30d,1516,nyt://article/f3616240-c3ac-5ec1-bb43-f007f819d30d

A veteran with a long nose and but little energy (a member of the old Fourteenth,) was deputed to turn the wheel, while Mr. JONES kept the record. Mr. WEIR, Jr., held the schedule of seats, and Mr. LOWBER made out the checks. The wheel turned and the lucky name of GRIMES was recorded as the first chooser. Many bitter jokes were made on the fortunate GRIMES.

These form the Private Cabinet of his Majesty, and the Chief or First Secretary is looked upon as one of the most important personages in France. The well-known Monsieur MOCQUARD filled this post up to last year, the date of his death. The duties of the Chef are varied and numerous. He is generally called upon to prepare all the public speeches made by the Emperor, to look over and arrange in accordance with their importance, the dispatches, letters and petitions addressed to his Majesty, while he is to answer them or give directions to his attaches as to the will of the sovereign in each case. Persons desiring audiences of the Emperor receive their replies from the Chef du Cabinet, and as he is allowed great latitude in deciding whether the applications shall ever reach his imperial master, his own importance is from this very fact vastly increased. Each morning the Chef receives from his subordinates the documents to be presented to the Emperor. He selects from the number such as are to be at ouce answered, and with a scratch of his pen disposes of a petition for pardon, for advancement, relief, &c. Non scrawled over an epistle means that the attache shall make a decided refusal. A curt peremptory ""no"" is to be addressed to the unlucky person who wrote the petition -- ""Desole, mais pas possible"" -- (very sorry, but it is not possible,) is understood by the attache to mean that a polite note of regret shall be sent in this case.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""FRANCE.; The Emperor Napoleon's Private Cabinet."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""FRANCE.; The Emperor Napoleon's Private Cabinet."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4bd61d45-6009-5b85-90c4-edb07f8ec43e,1358,nyt://article/4bd61d45-6009-5b85-90c4-edb07f8ec43e

It is identical with that of Mississippi, and is passed with yet closer approach to unanimity -- the vote being eighty-nine against three. There is little doubt that the vote, yet to be taken, on the report of the committee declaring the secession ordinance null and void, will show a similar preponderance. All the proceedings of the convention thus far denote that it is animated with an excellent spirit. Like that of Mississippi, it is generally composed of old Whigs, who originally were utterly opposed to the secession movement. They belonged to the Union party of 1860, which in all probability, would have defeated the secession ordinance had it been submitted to the people, and which actually did carry more than one-third of the secession convention itself against that measure -- the vote then being sixty-one to thirty-nine.

Mr. BEECHER, in the morning, preached a powerful sermon, drawn from the story of Christ washing his disciples' feet, thereby inculcating the doctrine that the superior should, by virtue of his superiority, serve the inferior; that the Lord and Master should become the minister or servant, and that thenceforth the law of love, which insists upon the extension of aid and service from the strong to the weak, should be enforced.

"Lamoriciere, the French General",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/26/archives/obituary-death-of-gen-lamoriciere.html,"Lamoriciere, the French General","Foreign news, received last night, announces the death of CHRISTOPHE LEON LOUIS JUCHAULT DE LAMORICIERE, the well-known French General. He was of the old Legitimist stock, was educated in the college at Nantes, in the Polytechnic School of Paris, and in the Academy of Military Engineers at Metz, on leaving which (says the American Cyclopaedia) he joined the Algerian army, and entered the corps of Zouaves at the time of its formation (November, 1830.) Placed in 1833 at the head of the office (burean Arabe) organized by Gen. AVIZARD, for the purpose of facilitating the relations with the native population, his intercourse with the Arabs became as useful to him as it was agreeable to them. Depending solely upon the influence of kindness and affability, he carried about his person, in his exploration of the country, no other means of defence than a light cane; hence the name of Bou Aroua, or father of the cane, conferred upon him by the Arabs. He took an active part in the capture of Constantino, the expedition against Mascara, the battle of Isly and many other engagements. He commanded the Zouaves for several years until June, 1840, when he was succeeded by CAVAIGNAC. The celebrity of the Zouaves was chiefly due to the skill which from the beginning LAMORICIERE had brought to bear upon their organization. In November, 1845, on the departure of Gen. BUGEAUD, he became provisional Governor-General of Algeria, but went to France in 1846, in the hope of being able to exert a favorable influence upon the destiny of the African colony, by taking part in the parliamentary discussions on the subject. At first defeated as candidate for one of the arrondissements of Paris, he was elected to the Chamber in October, 1846, as member for St. Calais, Sarthe. Returning to Algeria soon after, he crowned his military career by organizing the expedition against ABDEL-KADER, which finished the war. He was reelected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1847, and when the revolution of Feb., 1848, broke out, exerted himself in favor of the formation of a new administration under LOUIS PHILIPPE, and, as Colonel of the National Guard, went among the people assembled on the Boulevards, in order to allay the public excitement. But he was not listened to, and, after the abdication of LOUIS PHILIPPE, he was slightly wounded while on his way to the Palais Royal, to proclaim the regency of the Duchess of Orleans. He soon recovered however, and on the same evening tendered his allegiance to the provisional government. He took his seat in the Constituent Assembly as a member for Sarthe, and became prominent in the Committee on Military Affairs. During the bloody days of June, 1848, he fought with so much spirit against the insurgents that three horses were killed under him. He officiated as Gen. CAVAIGNAC's Minister of War until Dec., 1848, and was instrumental in introducing various measures for the benefit of Algeria. He strenuously opposed the election of LOUIS NAPOLEON to the Presidency, and even questioned his right to citizenship. Being elected to the Legislative Assembly, he became President of the Constitutional Committee, and opposed the projects of the ultra radical party. In the course of the Hungarian struggle with Austria, he was intrusted with a diplomatic mission to Russia; but on his arrival there the Hungarians had already been crushed by the armed interference of the Czar. On hearing of the overthrow of ODILON BARROT's administration (Oct. 31, 1849) he returned to France, and resumed his seat in the Legislative Assembly. After the coup d'etat of Dec. 2, 1851, he was arrested, and detained in the fortress of Ham until Jan. 9, 1852, when he was permitted to go to Prussia. A letter of his, refusing to recognize the government of LOUIS NAPOLEON, was published in May, 1852. He afterward successively resided in Coblentz, Montz, Wiesbaden and Ems. In April, 1860, having gone to Rome for the purpose, he was appointed by Pope PIUS IX.

"Diplomatic Correspondence; Seward's, Secretary, Dispatch on Prioleau Cotton Case",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/26/archives/mr-sewards-dispatch-on-the-cotton-case.html,"Diplomatic Correspondence; Seward's, Secretary, Dispatch on Prioleau Cotton Case","The bonds on the rebel Cotton Loan declined one per cent., we see, after that famous meeting of Confederate bondholders at the London Tavern, at which was urged so pathetically the bounden duty of the United States, upon international and moral grounds, to assume the Confederate debt. The reason for this fall is stated to be that ""the proceedings at the meeting afforded little ground of hope to the bondholders."" We suspect that if some one of those parties present, who so cruelly laughed aloud at the idea of the ""justice and policy of the Federal Government taking the debt upon itself,"" could have produced and read to the meeting the dispatch which Mr. SEWARD has written to Mr. ADAMS in reference to the decision of Vice-Chancellor WOOD, the bonds would have fallen considerably more than one per cent. For although the idea of the duty of the United States feeling themselves ""internationally and morally bound"" to assume the loan was too absurd to be even caught at like a straw by the most desperate of the drowning bondholders, the fact that Mr. PRIOLEAU had by the decree of the Vice-Chancellor been secured against the loss of the £20,000, which he was out of pocket for the Confederacy, and that the bondholders, too, might, by some streak of good luck, be helped in the same way, was a grain, and about the only grain, of comfort which the meeting had. But the hope that any such doctrine, as that on which that decree was based, would ever be accepted by our courts or our government, must have been utterly destroyed by Mr. SEWARD's letter. For he is entirely clear and explicit in his declaration that our government would not accept that doctrine, but claimed the cotton still as theirs, notwithstanding the decision of the Vice-Chancellor. As a matter of precaution it was doubtless well for Mr. SEWARD to send that dispatch to guard against any notion of acquiescence on the part of our government in the doctrines laid down in that decision. For whatever may be the result of the litigation before the English courts, that question involved in it, and many other questions arising out of the rebellion will ultimately have to be settled not by the courts but by the governments themselves. The courts will decide the questions when they are brought up, according to the present views of the respective governments concerning them. Our courts will not hold that the United States are the ""successors"" of the rebellion, because our government has always maintained, and will, we think, always maintain, in the words of Mr. SEWARD's dispatch that the United States ""are now, and during all the time of the rebellion have been, just what they were before the rebellion began, a sovereign State, absolutely entitled to the regulation and control of all property and persons within the United States, subject only to the limitations of their own constitution,"" and if the English courts hold that we are such successors it is because that view has found favor, as Mr. SEWARD says, ""even with the British Government.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Seward's Dispatch on the Cotton Case."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Seward's Dispatch on the Cotton Case."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5889cf97-89bc-562d-ae37-dcc1f5e41271,675,nyt://article/5889cf97-89bc-562d-ae37-dcc1f5e41271

In a leader, quoted in our summary of European news this morning, it denounces Capt. WADDELL as a pirate, and declares that unless he can clearly show that he had no knowledge of what was known to every one else in the same latitude, he has no claim to mercy. The Times characteristically adds that while England has already done everything required by international law, it would be well, under the circumstances, (that is, circumstances in Ireland,) if British ships of war were instructed to treat the Captain of the Shenandoah as a pirate, and to lend their assistance in putting an end to his wanton and wicked depredations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PIRATE SHENANDOAH.

Pres. Johnson's reply to Brazilian Minister; Reply to the Brazilian Minister,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/26/archives/the-presidents-speech-to-the-brazilian-minister.html,Pres. Johnson's reply to Brazilian Minister; Reply to the Brazilian Minister,"As the first ship in our new Brazilian line is about starting, to open closer commercial intercourse between Brazil and our own country, the address of the President to the new Brazilian Minister is as fortunate in time as it is felicitous in tone. It manifests much more warmth of feeling than usually marks such state receptions. It evinces clearly that the President attaches peculiar importance to the cultivation of intimate relations with this first of the South American States. His concluding sentence is particularly strong: ""If Brazil shall agree with us in this policy we shall hereafter be not only close friends, but practically we shall become firm and fast allies."" But this is not the first time that such close relationship with Brazil has been officially suggested. President BUCHANAN's Minister to Brazil, RICHARD K. MEADE, in presenting his credentials, in a memorable speech expressed his hope that the two nations might be brought into the closest alliance. The special motive he assigned, was that the two great slave-holding nations of America needed to combine to resist the anti-slavery pressure of the rest of the world. What is the policy President JOHNSON advances as the basis of this alliance? ""Our policy,"" he says, ""is simple and easily to be understood. We wish to promote the progress of civilization in this hemisphere, and for that purpose the development of material resources, the improvement of commerce, and the introduction, as fast as possible, of free intelligent labor into the virgin fields of the continent.""

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC -- OPENING OF MR. MARETZEK's SEASON. -- Italian opera has been well described as the most captivating form of the drama. The truthfulness of this definition is found readily in the favor with which every class views so agreeable an institution. Even they who have but little relish for music in itself are captivated with the many accompaniments and surroundings of opera. The ordinary drama has, indeed, borrowed much from its grand cotemporary, and so involuntarily complimented it. There are but few pieces now that do not boast of their new and original music, of their dances and scenery. In melo-drama we have almost reached the recitative. Speaking ""through the music"" is an ordinary device, and where intonsity is aimed at, prevails in whole scenes. But in Italian opera the senses that best bear refining are appealed to in the most direct way. A fictitious world is created for our pleasure -- a world of poetry, tinted and burnished with the other arts. To penetrate this realm of magic illusion is a privilege that the world has never been slow to acknowledge. Curiously, too, it happens that a practical people generally take most readily to this form of recreation. In New-York opera has become a necessity of every class, and in London it has been found to thrive lustily in the eastern districts, where the bands are horny, and the voices boisterous but honest. When Mr. MARETZEK commences a season, he scarcely considers the subscription list except for the convenience of the habitues. He looks to the amphitheatre, the family circle, the lobbies where ""standing room only"" is the modest requirement, and there he reads the verdict of the town. He will, we fancy, be satisfied with the one recorded last night. We have rarely seen a more brilliant gathering, or heard applause that was more hearty and encouraging alike to the artists and the manager.

Boston is now moving in the same direction. The Directors of the American Steamship Company have felt justified in undertaking to construct the first two steamers of the Boston and Liverpool line. Two steamers have been purchased for the trade between Boston and Havana; and lines to Mobile and to New-Orleans are in operation. We have frequently spoken, since the close of the war, of the importance of the capitalists of this great commercial metropolis taking comprehensive measures for the establishment of American steamship lines, communicating not only with our own ports on the Gulf and the Pacific, but with the ports of Europe, of South America, and of China. Something has already been done in the way of establishing the Brazilian line, and the China line; and we have heard of several hopeful projects for lines to Europe. But nothing has been done, or even projected, compared with what ought at least to be in the way of accomplishment. Capitalists move in this business with a timidity that is certainly very un-American. We should think that if rich men fail of their duty in this matter, the establishment of joint-stock ocean steamship navigation companies, upon a plan in which persons of small means could take stock, might prove successful as well as profitable. A company, for instance, under the supervision of such an experienced man as Capt. MARSHALL, who died last week, would have commanded universal public confidence. It has also been suggested that lines of ocean steamships might be started in connection with and under the auspices of some of our great railroad companies that terminate near the seaboard; and this idea is being carried out in the Baltimore line, we believe.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OCEAN STEAMSHIP LINES.

Apprenticeship and Albany Trades Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/26/archives/journeymen-and-apprentices-a-word-to-.html,Apprenticeship and Albany Trades Convention,"MECHANICS. -- We notice that among the questions to be considered at the convention of Trades Societies at Albany is that of regulating the laws of apprenticeship. It is the widespread complaint that, owing to the inefficient system of apprenticeship in this country, the number of good workmen in every branch of the mechanical arts is growing less year by year. Young fellows will go to a shop for a year or so and learn the rudiments of a trade, and then start off for another city where they set themselves up as journeymen. They get employment in consequence of offering to work cheaply, or because of the great demand throughout the country for skilled labor of all grades and kinds, however poorly skilled. Hence we have in the United States such a vast amount of wretched work of every nature, and such vast numbers of wretchedly poor workmen-wretched engineers, wretched carpenters, wretched shoemakers and tailors, wretched printers, wretched members of all the mechanical crafts. Hence, also, really efficient and trained workmen are discredited and damaged, and those who have served a long apprenticeship to a business are put on a level with those who have taken no pains to learn it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JOURNEYMEN AND APPRENTICES A WORD TO ...', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'JOURNEYMEN AND APPRENTICES A WORD TO ...', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'ALBANY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de5a1ea2-df83-57ea-a7b8-83513ad0d382,460,nyt://article/de5a1ea2-df83-57ea-a7b8-83513ad0d382

In 1830 one Wm. Cooper died, leaving surviving him as heirs-at-law Mary Cooper, a daughter; Mrs. Euphemia J. Barr, Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Ann S. Lyons and Wm. Cooper, all children of one John Cooper, who is a deceased son. The parties above-named are heirs-at-law. A daughter of William Cooper, whose name is Catharine, is also interested in the litigation. The plaintiff, whose real name is Mary Flood, was taken from an asylum when she was about six years old, and brought up and educated by the deceased. This Mary Flood assumed the name of Mary Cooper, her protectress, and by that name she went until the death of the latter, which occurred in August, 1861. After the death of Wm. Cooper, Mary Cooper, after consulting with her relatives as to how she should rid herself of the plaintiff, finally compromised the matter. After her father's death, Mary Cooper resided in Eldridge-street until her decease. During that time she received an annuity of $1,000 from her father's estate, which sum was paid her quarterly by the defendant, after deducting $300 per year for house rent. The amount was always paid in coin, or, by the request of Mary, changed into coin, and this money the latter very carefully secreted in a trundle bed in the house. She practiced this system for many years. At the time of her death, or soon after, there was a large amount of gold coin and jewelry found on the premises.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Constitutes a Gift?

Several hundred of the lowest ruffians of New-York society are said to have been on hand, and the presence of a strong constabulary force was doubtless required. But the question arises, should New-York be called upon, at her own expense, to furnish protection to outlying towns, on such occasions as this of the Sing Sing boat-race. If these races are of a character to attract hordes of the thieves and vagabonds from the metropolis, there ought to be a special tax levied on those who take part in such sports, to meet all the contingencies of keeping the public peace. Otherwise the community, which is immediately affected by the concourse of lawless characters, should have the power of forbidding such assemblages altogether. It is altogether preposterous that the tax-payers of New-York should be called upon to supply police protection to communities seventy or a hundred miles distant. If the commissioners here are to meet such demands, let them have the power of collecting a special tax to indemnify themselves.

The directors presented a report setting forth the results of the late effort, and sanguine expectations for the future deduced therefrom, expressing a determination to press forward with the work, and announcing that they had already entered into a contract for renewed operations. Under this contract the Telegraph Construction Company undertake, for the sum of £500,000 sterling, (that is the mere cost price,) to manufacture and lay down a new cable next year; and if successful, but not otherwise, they are to have in shares and cash and profit of twenty per cent. on this cost. They also undertake, without any further charge whatever, to go to sea with sufficient cable to complete the present broken cable, and use the best endeavors to that end. Carrying out this contract requires that the Atlantic Company should raise a minimum of £250,000 to a maximum of £500,000 sterling in cash, upon which new capital a preferential dividend of twelve per cent. is proposed, with a share in the profits of the dividends to which they are entitled, have been paid on old shares.

Prophecies of financial crash in 15 years,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/27/archives/wise-prophets.html,Prophecies of financial crash in 15 years,"-- One of the atrabilious papers, which has always been predicting disasters for the country -- military disasters during the war, and financial disasters ever since its close -- and which is suffering disappointment, owing to the failure of its recent prophecies of ruin, now predicts that we will have a grand financial and commercial crash in fifteen years -- that is to say, in 1880. We are not told in what month the crash will come; but it is quite likely it will come in December, when the thermometer is below zero. If the crash should not have happpened when the end of 1880 has arrived, then the prophets of evil could do as do the millenarians, and show that they simply made a miscalculation of, say, fifteen years, but that the crash will surely happen in 1895, say in the month of July, or in the dog-days. It is in that season that financial crashes usually occur in England, and why should American history not be a transcript of that of England? It shows good sense in the authors of oft-refuted predictions, when they begin to fix the period for the fulfillment of their prophecies a safe distance ahead.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WISE PROPHETS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WISE PROPHETS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2795a10d-c1c4-5e29-a719-834ff6a5d5a5,201,nyt://article/2795a10d-c1c4-5e29-a719-834ff6a5d5a5

"Cuba, Slavery and Labor in",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/27/archives/cuban-slavery.html,"Cuba, Slavery and Labor in","-- We referred some days ago to the perils that now surround slavery in Cuba, owing to the abolition of the institution in this country, and the growth of the Liberal and Anti-Slavery party in Spain. The latest issue at hand of the London Times discusses the same subject. It declines that ""the influence which the abolition of slavery in the United States may exert indirectly upon the existing system in Cuba, has not escaped the attention of the leading merchants of Havana, whose conclusions with respect to it, however, are not discouraging, either as regards the prospects of the colored population or the continued prosperity of the island."" The large majority of the Cuban planters look to the adoption of a plan of gradual emancipation, and are confident the result will in no way permanently impair their commercial strength and resources. Their ground for this belief consists in the experience for the last few years of the rapid advance of mechanical as compared with manual labor. Statistics recently published show that in 1846 there were in the island 323,772 slaves, while the production of sugar was 17,729,589 arrobas. In 1862 the slaves numbered 368,550, and the production of sugar reached 41,418,444 arrobas. Thus, while the increase of slaves was less than 14 per cent., the increase of sugar production was more than 130 per cent. The introduction of machinery, new and improved methods of culture, and immigration from China, have been the cause of this change, and they are considered certain to continue in a still increasing ratio to replace slave labor.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CUBAN SLAVERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CUBAN SLAVERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Cuba', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/40c44290-377f-51ca-8777-b29de9fa6bd9,263,nyt://article/40c44290-377f-51ca-8777-b29de9fa6bd9

"-- There is, of course, the greatest interest in financial circles as to what measures will be recommended by Secretary MCCULLOCH to Congress, which meets in two brief months. The financial question will divide the attention with the question of reconstruction; but we judge from what is known of the Secretary's thoroughly practical mind, from the opportunity he has had of testing the value of various schemes, and from the fact that no partisan issues are involved, that it will be much easier to reach a wise decision on the financial than on the political question. It is an admirable characteristic of Secretary MCCULLOCH's administration that his special measures or projects never leak out in advance. Nobody can speculate upon anything that ""they know"" the Secretary is going to do at any particular time or in any particular crisis. All that anybody ""on the street"" or anywhere else knows of his policy is that so far as is in his power he will adopt, or will try to have adopted, such measures as will increase the financial strength of the government, improve its credit at home and abroad, and secure the nearest approximation possible between the value of its securities and the universal standard of value, gold. He expressed his views, in general, when he first accepted office, and declared that it would be his constant aim to secure the adoption of such measures as would favor a speedy return to the specie basis. He has been able to do but little in this way as yet, owing to the condition of affairs consequent upon the close of the war, the dissolution of our armies, and the heavy amount of work and of cash involved in the settlement of accounts. But he has now time and opportunity to systematize and perfect his plans, and he has the means at his disposal and in prospect to carry out the most comprehensive measures of financial improvement. The extent of the public debt, and the interest demand, have been ascertained; the estimates, military and civil, for a year of peace can be intelligently made; he can give data as to customs returns, past and probable; and he has been able to judge the permanent value of the internal revenue system, and the amount it will bring to the National Treasury. With those important points clear, with a large surplus of gold in his hands, and with a healthy condition of all the branches of his department, the Secretary of the Treasury will go before Congress in December able to speak with authority, sure to be heard with profound attention, and almost certain to command full support for all his recommendations.

He tarried there until after 10 o'clock, and then, taking cheerful leave of his companions, departed, as every one supposed, for his dwelling. But on Saturday morning his son, EDWARD WOLFSOHN, the pianist, having learned that the Doctor had not been home, made inquiry, but was unable to trace him beyond the threshold of the club-room. Dr. WOLFSOHN having been a man of regular and abstenious habits and well-balanced mind, and never having been away from home at night without making his whereabouts known, his family naturally feared that he might have fallen a victim of the Sixteenth Ward banditti while on his way home from the club; they therefore notified Superintendent CARPENTER and the several Captains of police throughout the city, and offered a liberal reward to any person who would give them a clue to the Doctor's whereabouts. Nothing, however, was heard of him until Monday morning, when two boys who were rowing a boat in the North River off Twenty-third-street, discovered the body of a man floating near the Twenty-second-street pier. They secured it with ropes and at once informed the Sixteenth Ward Police, and when the corpse was taken from the river it was found to be that of Dr. WOLFSOHN. The doctor's gold watch, wallet, (containing a considerable amount of money,) his gold spectacles, and other valuables being on his person, of course all idea of foul play was banished from the minds of the spectators and police; but the relatives, unable to take a cool view of the subject, insisted that he had been foully murdered, although they could see no earthly reason for the commission of the deed. They therefore insisted upon a searching inquest; and in compliance with their request, Coroner WILDEY impanneled a jury this morning, and after examining ten witnesses, among whom were many members of the club, with whom the doctor conversed on Friday night, nothing being found that was in any way satisfactory to the family, the Coroner adjourned the investigation one week, to enable the police authorities to search for any evidence that may bear upon the case. The club men testified that on Friday evening Dr. WOLFSOHN conversed with his usual vivacity and betrayed no sign of mental aberration, that he drank nothing intoxicating whatever, and that he departed from the circle shortly after 10 o'clock, apparently rational and cheerful; and it having been shown that when the body was taken from the river, on Monday, everything valuable which he is known to have had in his possession was yet on his person, it seems probable that the Doctor, when he left the stage which he took at the club-room door, busily engaged with his own thoughts, walked in the wrong direction and into the river. This theory is supported by the testimony of the watchmen on two vessels which were moored near the Twenty-third-street pier, who say that at about 11 o'clock on Friday night they heard a splash and shout for aid. Dr. WOLFSOHN was of German nativity, 69 years of age.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroner's Inquests.; BY CORONER WILDEY THE BODY OF DR.

It is certainly very alarming to find such utter feebleness and lack of organization as marked the firemen's efforts at the great fire last week. The commissioners can hardly fail to appreciate the actual perils of the situation, and they must know that the public look for promptitude and decision at their hands.

"Hamilton-avenue, South Brooklyn, is by no means an inviting street. It is devoted to tenement-houses, junk-shops, third-rate porter-houses, old-clothes dealers and vile stenches -- a remarkable fact enough when it is considered that thousands of persons have daily to run the gauntlet of these nuisances on their way to the important ferry at the terminus of the street. There is yet hope, however, of redeeming Hamilton-avenue from its indecency. The first step has been taken by Messrs. SMITH & JEWELL, extensive millers and flour merchants. These gentlemen have recently completed near the lower end of the street an imposing brick building six stories in height, 200 feet in length and 75 in width, extending through to India Wharf, Atlantic Basin, which they have named the ""Atlantic Flour Mills,"" there being also in connection with the main building a grain elevator on the basin, of dimensions about 45 by 25, which, in its capacity for work, rivals anything of the kind in the country. A late visit to the establishment we found quite interesting. On the first floor, besides the neatly-fitted offices and the capacious delivery-room, is the motive power of the mill. This is an engine of about 600 horse-power, which was built by the Cuyahoga Steam Works Company, Cleveland, Ohio, and which operates upon a comparatively new principle, so far as it is adapted to driving a flour mill. The mill has now in operation ten run of burr-stones, and is manufacturing from 700 to 800 barrels of flour daily. There is room, however, for an additional ten run of stones, which are now in process of setting, and when they are at work, the capacity of the mill per diem will reach the enormous aggregate of fifteen hundred barrels. The machinery of the mill for cleaning wheat, bolting, and, in fact, for doing everything required in the process of taking bulk wheat from the boats, manufacturing it into flour of the various grades, packing it into barrels, and delivering it for market, is complete and efficient. In the adaptation of this machinery to milling purposes, many improvements have been made, which are the fruits of the ripe experience of the proprietors and of their fathers before them, after practical milling in this city and in Western New-York for more than fifty years. The storage capacity of the mill is about 100,000 bushels of wheat and 10,000 bushels of flour. The elevator takes bulk wheat into the mill at the rate of 4,000 bushels per hour, and vessels are loaded with flour direct from the mill dock. The principal trade of this establishment is with South America and the West Indies, the climates of which require what is termed ""high ground"" flour, made from the choicest wheat. The entire appointments of the Atlantic Flour Mills are substantial and excellent. The building was designed by Mr. JEWELL, and constructed under his personal superintendence. He, unhappily, barely lived to see the fruition of his labors. In addition to the Atlantic Flour Mills, the firm owns the Brooklyn City Mills, at Fulton Ferry, and a smaller mill in Westchester County.

"Bonn, The Murder of Prince Alfred's Cook at",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/27/archives/the-bonn-murder-more-work-for-european-intrigue.html,"Bonn, The Murder of Prince Alfred's Cook at","The recent assassination, at Bonn, of Mr. OTT, Prince ALFRED of England's cook, appears likely to assume considerable political importance. The incidents connected with this homicide appeared at the time at length in the public papers, and were substantially as follows: The deceased was quietly walking at evening on one of the public streets of Bonn, when he met, coming in an opposite direction, three officers of the Prussian service, one of whom, without any provocation or insult sufficient to justify even a rebuke, drew his sword and cut down Mr. OTT. The result proved fatal, and investigation showed the murderer to be a Mr. EULENDERG, a son of one of the Cabinet Ministers of Prussia, and holding an advanced military grade. An attempt was made to hush the matter up, ordinarily a very easy undertaking in Prussia, in cases where the culprit belongs to the patrician order and the victim is a member of lower social rank. But exceptional circumstances threw an unexpected difficulty in the way of this contemplated evasion of justice. Poor OTT was, it is true, only a plebeian, which was a good deal against him in those latitudes, and he was only a cook by avocation, which fact did not help him much. But as he happened to be in the service of Prince ALFRED of England, and as a maitre de cuisine once lost is not easily replaced, His Royal Highness naturally demanded justice. But even this unpleasant contretemps, in which light only the military aristocracy was disposed to view it, might have been got over had not another still more powerful influence demanded redress for the murder. Poor OTT was a French citizen, and it seems that the Emperor insists on full justice being done, regardless of the rank of the offender. Up to the present time, however, the disposition to a fair investigation appears to be wanting, for at latest accounts the aristocratic assassin, after arrest and a short nominal detention at the barracks, had been allowed to rejoin his regiment and enjoy the same liberty as his brother officers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Bonn Murder More Work for European Intrigue.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Bonn Murder More Work for European Intrigue.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ee4400d-28d2-5751-b918-ebbeaff16346,714,nyt://article/9ee4400d-28d2-5751-b918-ebbeaff16346

Officials; Charges Before Gov. Fenton,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/27/archives/the-dereliction-of-city-officials.html,Officials; Charges Before Gov. Fenton,"-- Our city officials accused of certain derelictions in office, appeared yesterday at Albany, to answer to the charges preferred. Little was done beyond the formal reading of documents. There is a strong array of counsel, and of course a great deal of public interest in the matter. Naturally enough, the first point raised is want of constitutional power on the part of the Governor to make the investigation. It is probably beyond the capacity of the human mind to make a constitution or a law so explicit that no one will question its meaning, and, indeed, we have heard so much of ""unconstitutionality"" within the last ten years that we regularly anticipate that as the first point of defence in any matter, however trivial. Years ago a fellow was convicted of some crime and put in the stocks, while his counsel was searching musty folios to prove that such punishment was ""unconstitutional."" Hurrying to the court-room with his invincible argument he was hailed by his client who was actually in the wooden purgatory. ""I tell you,"" said the lawyer, ""they can't put you in the stocks -- they caan't do it -- it's unconstitutional."" ""Oh! confound your pother about constitutional; don't you see I am in the stocks?"" It is to be hoped that no scruples upon constitutional points will prevent a fair investigation into the grave charges against our city officers. If they are innocent, as we trust they are, a full examination will be the very best proof of their purity that could be desired. Why not have it?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DERELICTION OF CITY OFFICIALS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DERELICTION OF CITY OFFICIALS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8b3cc8e-bb51-5df1-8113-ae4e6ee2c1e2,262,nyt://article/d8b3cc8e-bb51-5df1-8113-ae4e6ee2c1e2

Their habits and character adapt them to every part of it -- to the desert plains this side of the Rocky Mountains, and the barren regions between that range and the Sierra Nevada. Where provender is scarce, where water is scarce, where the qualities of endurance and patience, and great capacity for labor and travel are required, there the camel is an invaluable beast of burden. They would be far more serviceable, far more economical, better fit for extensive use than are the ox-wagons and mule trains that are now employed on the plains.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/28/archives/local-news.html,,"At Police Trials, yesterday, before Commissioners ACTON and MCMURRAY, one hundred and seven charges were preferred against officers of various grades. The number of complainants and witnesses was far greater than usual, and twice during the day the Trial Chamber seemed too small to accommodate them. Manhattanville alone sent a host to testify concerning the Lion Park murder. In this case, which was against Patrolmen SOMERSET KINNAIRD and ROBERT B. DENNISON, Capt. BOGERT, of the Thirty-first Precinct, preferred the charge at the request of President ACTON, to whom an appeal had been made by many persons who thought it desirable that the murder should be thoroughly investigated. Officers KINNAIRD and DENNISON, who were defended by Senator THOMAS C. FIELDS, cleared their skirts by showing that when the inebriated assailing party, whom they had once ejected from the Lion Brewery bar-room, burst the doors and reentered, they exerted themselves to protect the place and its inmates. The weight of testimony went to show that the brewery employes, in defending the place, wounded several of the rioters, and killed DANIEL CLAFFY in the struggle. The landlady of a first-class family boarding-house, who appeared, on the 20th inst., against Patrolmen RALPH P. BARKER and JOHN BECHMAN, of the Fifteenth Precinct, resumed her case yesterday, and Mr. EDWARD STERN, of Lafayette-place, her late boarder, testified that, having tired of paying $104 weekly for his family's board, and subsisting upon unsavory meat at that, he had striven to move to other quarters, but that the landlady had sought to detain his household goods; therefore, he had summoned the officers to preserve the peace while he removed his property. The commissioners intimated that their officers had been in error in protecting him in taking goods from the landlady's house, and Mr. STERN, at the suggestion of a representative of the press, volunteered to pay the officers' fine, whatever it might be. Many complaints were entered by civilians who clearly do not comprehend the rights and duties of policemen; and several complainants, dissatisfied with the commissioners' rulings, notified the board that they should bring action against the defending officers in the civil courts.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5fd7087c-c814-5d95-850c-9a23da762481,707,nyt://article/5fd7087c-c814-5d95-850c-9a23da762481

The rentrees of these tried and valuable artists were, we need barely say, entirely successful. The lady is in excellent condition, and in the second and third acts displayed that intensity of style and abandon for which she is famous. In the earlier scenes her voice did not appear to be thoroughly in command, and it was only in the splendid finale of the second act, and in the famous piece of the last, (""Sounds of Harps Angelical,"") that she was at once impassioned and full toned. The acting of Mme. ZUCCHI was statuesque, graceful and spirited. It is always good.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a949166-f631-5fc8-bc65-fa0523e33bdb,513,nyt://article/6a949166-f631-5fc8-bc65-fa0523e33bdb

Quite a numerous assemblage were present, among them a fair delegation of the belles of the village, although the hour -- 11 A.M. -- was early for a base ball match. The contest proved to be a very enjoyable affair throughout, the weather being delightful. Some very good play was shown in numerous instances, although ruffianism prevailed at times to a considerable extent. The game had not proceeded far before it became evident that the Wood's party were altogether the most skillful exponents of the game, the score at the close of the fourth inning standing 13 to 2 in favor of Wood's nine. Afterward Hooley's troupe pulled up a little, but when the total score was called, the figures proved to be 34 to 12 in favor of the New-Yorkers. BEALS and HEWEY specially distinguished themselves in the fielding department on the part of Wood's nine, and FINNEGAN and MCCORD on the other side. BEALS, MUDGE and HEWEY carried the palm in batting, MCCORD's display being the best on the other side.

probabilities of Friery's Punishment,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/28/archives/the-criminal-law-frierys-case.html,probabilities of Friery's Punishment,"The conviction of JAMES CLARK as an accessory to the murder of HENRY LAZARUS, recalls to mind the case of FRIERY, and stimulates the public to inquire what probability there is that the most atrocious murder of the year will be adequately punished. The friends of the murderer not only maintain the certainty of his escape from justice, but facetiously declare that they will ""run him for the Legislature,"" as a candidate from the Fourteenth Ward. Their confidence is based upon the fact that from one of the several courts to which the prisoner can appeal he may obtain a new trial. A new trial being granted, the evidence given at the former trial cannot be used, or read to the jury, but the witnesses must be produced by the people, and the case regularly proven as though no other hearing had ever taken place. And here the delays for which his counsel have striven come in to aid the prisoner, with those chances which time always brings forth. The chief witness, the bar-tender in the saloon kept by LAZARUS, is dead; another one of the witnesses has been convicted of a felony and sent to the State Prison; still another person, whose testimony is important, has disappeared and cannot be found. The absence of three witnesses would make it so difficult for the District-Attorney to prove his case, that the confident insolence of the murderer's friends is not without grounds. His escape might work more good than his execution, if the case should compel the Legislature to knit more tightly the meshes of the law. The chief utility of punishment is lost where convenient laws and pernicious precedents bring hope so prominently before the mind of the evil-doer. Any criminal who can command a little money has the power to delay the execution of his sentence for a year or more by appeals from court to court, when, if some technicality grants him a new trial, lapse of time may render it impossible to obtain a second conviction.

"Currency, The Uniformity of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/28/archives/the-uniformity-of-the-currency.html,"Currency, The Uniformity of the","Four several attempts have been made by certain uneasy spirits among our bank officers to disturb the quiet, uniform and highly satisfactory working of the National Currency, by proscribing and otherwise causing a discrimination in the notes of the National Banks, not contemplated by the Banking Law, and all of which notes are already redeemable at the commercial centres named in the law -- nine-tenths of them in New-York, Philadelphia and Boston. For two months or more a prescriptive plan or machine for assorting, sealing up and running home the country bank notes was in secret preparation, and early in August was matured and presented to the New-York Clearing-house Association. It was received, and laid upon the table. It was also presented to the Boston Clearing-house, and, we believe, unanimously rejected. It was also presented to the Philadelphia Clearing-house, and rejected by more than a two-thirds vote. Thus ended the first effort. The comparatively close vote in New-York encouraged a second attempt, after four or five weeks' delay, and on the 12th inst. the scheme was again brought into the Clearing-house, but immediately and by almost general consent thrown out as impertinent to the objects of the Clearing-houses. Then a meeting of Bank Officers, Local and National, was organized outside the Association. Forty-one Banks out of the sixty-six Banks in the city were represented. The leaders in the scheme refused to consult with the original National Banks, not in the Clearing-house, and succeeded by a vote of 29 to 12, in keeping the subject alive for a third attempt to force it on the majority. This attempt was made on the succeeding Tuesday, Sept. 19. Less than one-half the Clearing-house Banks were represented at the close of the meeting, when a fourth attempt was resolved upon, to be made through the old committee by privately canvassing the National and Local Banks for Tuesday the 26th of September. The result was, that thirty-nine Banks were willing to entertain some acceptable plan for assorting the National Currency, and a meeting was organized of the representatives of these Banks, then present. The old committee and the old plan were thrown overboard, and a new committee ordered to be selected by the Chairman for a fifth trial, on the basis of only thirty-nine banks in place of a general cooperation of all New-York, Philadelphia and Boston as originally contemplated. When this is to be made is now wholly uncertain. The whole affair was uncalled for; irrelevant to the banking law, and mischievous, if not mischievously intended, from the start, and its failure on Tuesday was even more complete, if possible, as a voluntary investment in New-York, than when it was rejected six or eight weeks ago as a Clearing-house obligation in all the three cities. The failure is, in one sense, the more signal because the movement being pushed to the extreme of a private and urgent canvass or drumming up of the banks to only consent to do something or other to disturb the working of the national currency, it has arrayed twelve or fourteen of the very best and most practical, as well as important in point of capital and deposits, of the Clearing-house Banks against it. They stand by National Bank redemption under the law. They stand by the perfect uniformity of the National Bank currency as against discrimination and discount; they stand by the country Banks who are faithfully providing for their notes at the commercial centres, and stand by the merchants, shopkeepers and business people generally of our great metropolis, who recognize this currency as equally national, equally sound, and having the same Treasury seal and pledge of faith and redemption as the greenbacks of the government themselves, and don't mean to be shaved on the one any more than on the other.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Uniformity of the Currency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Uniformity of the Currency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Currency', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f1fbe1c5-7860-5531-bfde-0a1b5803f6d4,634,nyt://article/f1fbe1c5-7860-5531-bfde-0a1b5803f6d4

"Last evening a select audience assembled in Dr. Chapin's Church to hear Mrs. C.F. WINDLE's lecture for the advancement of the late Mrs. FARNHAM's novel theory of Woman. Mrs. WINDLE proved herself a graceful speaker, and the lecture was well written, although somewhat dogmatic. The theory upon which she based her lecture was the introduction of woman to new and momentous relations in the Divine plan of human progress. She claimed the grand natural truth that woman was capable of a still higher sphere, by proper culture, than that which she had already attained, and the theory of Mrs. FANNHAM was that the human mind was capable of a grander exaltation than was at present dreamed of by philosophers.

London Times on Canadian Confederation,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/29/archives/a-gloomy-view-of-britishamerican-union.html,London Times on Canadian Confederation,"-- We publish in another column the main portion of an article from the London Times, on the prospects of Canadian Confederation. Our cotemporary takes a view of the question which is the reverse of flattering to the patriotism and commercial spirit of the Provincials. It seems that Dr. MACKAY, who has been prospecting in Canada on behalf of the London Times, has discovered that, while the local government may be earnest in their desire for Union, with ""the mass of the population it is a pecuniary question."" The popular reasoning takes this shape: ""If England wants Confederation, let her pay for it. We have not the least objection to comply with her wishes, but it must be for an adequate consideration."" It must be confessed, if this is the actual view of their political future taken by the Canadians, it is a very low and sordid view, and the British organ may with some reason denounce it, and threaten the colonists with desertion. It does seem like the most stolid kind of indifference to find the Provincial government setting itself first to the task of buying out the Hudson Bay Company's rights with British money, before taking any practical steps to form a closer connection with the maritime colonies. The purchase of these rights is only of immediate account, because there is the prospect of a British loan being granted to make that purchase. Giving that scheme precedence over confederation, certainly does look as if the people of Canada must have an ""adequate consideration"" at every step they take in carrying out the policy of the central government. They refuse even to deepen their canals -- on the ground of economy -- while they are ready to buy up half a continent of wild territory, provided they are supplied with funds to make the investment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A GLOOMY VIEW OF BRITISH-AMERICAN UNION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A GLOOMY VIEW OF BRITISH-AMERICAN UNION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c33cfdb6-ad57-51ca-98b0-67f4b13b6ead,306,nyt://article/c33cfdb6-ad57-51ca-98b0-67f4b13b6ead

NATHANIEL R. MILLS, bearing a warrant from Coroner WILDEY, took the 6 o'clock train for that town, with authority from the managers of the Hudson River Railroad to use their telegraph, and stop the train at Tivoli -- the 6 o'clock train usually passing through that town without stopping. Capt. MILLS ascertained that the corpse was to be taken to an interior town, but knew not whither, and as he feared that it might be removed from the train at some point south of Tivoli, he consulted the telegraph operators at Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck, and learned that the body had crossed the Hudson to Saugerties at about 6 o'clock. He arrived at Tivoli at 10 o'clock and was rowed across to Saugerties, reaching that town after the undertaker had retired. But observing, opposite the undertaker's, a light and three women at the door, the Captain accosted them, asking when the funeral was to take place, and was informed that 10 o'clock on Thursday morning was the hour be requested them to show him the corpse, and inquired whether Mr. HICKS was there; upon which he was shown in and introduced to Mr. HICKS. With Mr. HICKS he sat up with the corpse on Wednesday night and yesterday returned to the city, bringing the corpse Mr. HICKS, and Miss FANNY GRAY, a young woman who accompanied the husband and body to Saugerties on Wednesday. The body was taken to the Wooster-street Police-station, last evening, and after a postmortem examination had been made by Dr. WOOSTER BEACH, Jr., and the testimony of Mr. HICKS had been recorded, the Coroner dismissed him, and he went with the corpse back to Saugerties.

"THE MARCUS L. WARD CLUB -- GRAND DEMONSTRATION AT PATERSON. -- A very large and enthusiastic meeting was held on Thursday evening, at the Wigwam. Although the Democrats had a great deal of firing and noise, yet it did not decrease the attendance, for the old Wigwam was completely filled, a large number being ladies, who seemed to be as much in earnest about the right men being put in office as anyone else. The orators of the evening were Gen. HITE, of Kentucky, and Col. HAWKINS, of Tennessee. Gen. HITE was the first speaker presented to the audience. Gen. HITE, on taking the stand, spoke substantially as follows: Fellow-citizens: When engaged some two years ago in the service of my country, I had the pleasure of appearing before you in the City of Paterson. I told you then that I believed the rebellion would be put down, because our cause was a just one, and the God of our battles was a just God. But as I said to you, if I had been deceived or mistaken, and if it would be the decree of Providence that this government should be severed as strongly and tenaciously as I clung to life I humbly and sincerely prayed that God should not allow me to witness the destruction of this glorious Union, and He has not. [Applause.] And now that our country is once more freed from bloodshed, it becomes you, my fellow-citizens, to buckle on the armor, and put patriotic and faithful men at the head of your State Government -- men who have been trustworthy during the late struggle, for only such will be faithful and trustworthy in time of peace. The speaker then gave a lengthy account of his services under Gen. ROUSSEAU, and the many battles that that able General was engaged in. He said: Ask Gen. ROUSSEAU what he would do with these Copperheads you have up North, and he would say, ""I would send them every one over to the rebels."" [Cheers.] In relation to the candidates he could say nothing, as he did not know them, except that he had heard that Mr. WARD was the soldier's friend, [cheers -- ""That's so,""] and that Gen. RUNYON was always opposed to the Union cause, and therefore he was not his friend. This State is the only one that has not come out boldly for the side of the government, and now it is your duty to come out fearlessly, so that you may have your State free. When you do that, you, as a State, will be prosperous, and we will have a happy and peaceful confederacy, such as the world has never before seen. [Great cheering.] Col. HAWKINS was then presented, and greeted with raptures of applause. He said: As you have heard from Kentucky it would be well to hear from my native State, I have visited the enemy's camp on the corner above before I came here, and I heard a man speaking there whom they call WINDFIELD, but I think there is more wind than field. [Laughter.] He has been speaking against me, and said that the gentlemen now traveling through the State, with their shoulder-straps are Copperheads. [Laughter.] Now I think the best thing we can do is to go down to them and give them battle, as we are three to their one, and before the election in November we will be five to their one.

WARD CLUB -- GRAND DEMONSTRATION AT PATERSON. -- A very large and enthusiastic meeting was held on Thursday evening, at the Wigwam. Although the Democrats had a great deal of firing and noise, yet it did not decrease the attendance, for the old Wigwam was completely filled, a large number being ladies, who seemed to be as much in earnest about the right men being put in office as anyone else. The orators of the evening were Gen. HITE, of Kentucky, and Col. HAWKINS, of Tennessee. Gen. HITE was the first speaker presented to the audience. Gen. HITE, on taking the stand, spoke substantially as follows: Fellow-citizens: When engaged some two years ago in the service of my country, I had the pleasure of appearing before you in the City of Paterson. I told you then that I believed the rebellion would be put down, because our cause was a just one, and the God of our battles was a just God. But as I said to you, if I had been deceived or mistaken, and if it would be the decree of Providence that this government should be severed as strongly and tenaciously as I clung to life I humbly and sincerely prayed that God should not allow me to witness the destruction of this glorious Union, and He has not. [Applause.] And now that our country is once more freed from bloodshed, it becomes you, my fellow-citizens, to buckle on the armor, and put patriotic and faithful men at the head of your State Government -- men who have been trustworthy during the late struggle, for only such will be faithful and trustworthy in time of peace. The speaker then gave a lengthy account of his services under Gen. ROUSSEAU, and the many battles that that able General was engaged in. He said: Ask Gen. ROUSSEAU what he would do with these Copperheads you have up North, and he would say, ""I would send them every one over to the rebels."" [Cheers.] In relation to the candidates he could say nothing, as he did not know them, except that he had heard that Mr. WARD was the soldier's friend, [cheers -- ""That's so,""] and that Gen. RUNYON was always opposed to the Union cause, and therefore he was not his friend. This State is the only one that has not come out boldly for the side of the government, and now it is your duty to come out fearlessly, so that you may have your State free. When you do that, you, as a State, will be prosperous, and we will have a happy and peaceful confederacy, such as the world has never before seen. [Great cheering.] Col. HAWKINS was then presented, and greeted with raptures of applause. He said: As you have heard from Kentucky it would be well to hear from my native State, I have visited the enemy's camp on the corner above before I came here, and I heard a man speaking there whom they call WINDFIELD, but I think there is more wind than field. [Laughter.] He has been speaking against me, and said that the gentlemen now traveling through the State, with their shoulder-straps are Copperheads. [Laughter.] Now I think the best thing we can do is to go down to them and give them battle, as we are three to their one, and before the election in November we will be five to their one. [Cheers.] The Colonel then gave a description of his sufferings in the South, and the horrid effects of slavery.

on Condition and Wants of the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/30/archives/southern-affairs-hon-ec-cabell-on-the-condition-and-wants-of-the.html,on Condition and Wants of the South,"Hon. E.C. CABELL, formerly member of Congress from Florida, writes from Memphis, Tenn., to the Tribune, an able and sensible letter on the condition of the Southern States, and especially their need of labor. He says that, for the last thirty years, the people of the North and South have been educated to hate each other, and that this studied and systematic mutual villification produced a state of feeling which resulted in the desolating war just closed. Without wasting time in inquiring which party was most at fault in this matter, Mr. CABELL urges it as now the common duty of the people of both sections to obliterate the feelings of bitterness engendered by the past four years of strife, to foster the interests of the whole country, and to devote their united energies to the work of repairing the ravages of the past, and building up new glories for the future. Slavery, he says, is dead, and maintaining it so long was a crime on the part of the South; that crime has been punished with adequate severity in the desolation and ruin that has followed it. The first feeling of the leading southern men, upon the failure of their hopes and plans, was to abandon their country or bury themselves in seclusion. But this, with few exceptions, has passed away, and they are now prepared to accept their situation, and make the best of it Whatever they may have thought of the superior advantage of two governments, all now see that we have now, and must have hereafter forever, but one country, one destiny and one duty, and all feel called upon to devote all their energies to building up its permanent and supreme prosperity. The experiment of free labor must, and will, have a full and fair trial, and for himself, Mr. CABELL says he believes it will be far more successful than is generally believed. But the losses from death and from other causes, among the negroes, renders indispensable, in his judgment, large accessions to the free white laboring population of the Southern States -- and the main object of his letter is to set forth the inducements to such immigration offered by the condition of affairs, and especially by the low price and great fertility of the Southern lands. ""The mass of the Southern people,"" he says, ""lost everything in the late revolution but their lands, the larger portion of which they are now unable to cultivate for want of labor. This large surplus they must sell. Hundreds of thousands of acres of good lands are thus offered for sale at the very lowest prices. Many fine plantations may be purchased for a sum much below the cost of the buildings erected on them, and highly improved estates at less than half the price of wild lands in the same vicinity four years ago. There are, besides, millions of acres of unimproved lands to be purchased at prices proportionately low. The lands in the Mississippi Valley, liable to inundation, are capable of producing cotton enough to clothe the civilized world, and corn enough to feed the population of America. The price of many of these lands is nominal. They will some day become of inestimable value.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SOUTHERN AFFAIRS.; Hon. E.C.

As a matter of course, there was some intemperate talk and a little of the old-fashioned South Carolina bluster and bravado; but it was subdued in tone and was promptly overruled by the good sense of the great body of the convention. Mr. ALDRICH, from the Barnwell district, relieved his overburdened mind by declaring that the people of the State were living under a ""military despotism,"" and offered a resolution to be ""patient under evils they could not avert,"" and to ""await calmly the time and opportunity to effect deliverance from unconstitutional rule."" But Mr. MCGOWAN, who bore on his body the scars of wounds received in the rebel service, denounced the temper of this proceeding with stirring eloquence, and was greeted with thundering applause; and ex-Gov. PICKENS, of old the fiercest of secession fanatics, calmly remarking that it ""did not become the people of South Carolina to bluster now,"" moved to lay the resolution on the table, which was promptly carried, with but four or five dissenting votes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Unionism in South Carolina.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Unionism in South Carolina.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/13c08c22-aba7-527c-840d-d9c50820b883,875,nyt://article/13c08c22-aba7-527c-840d-d9c50820b883

People of N. Y. vs. 3d-av. Railroad Co.; Appeal; Right to lay Switches,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/30/archives/an-important-case-in-the-supreme-court-general-term-the-rights-of.html,People of N. Y. vs. 3d-av. Railroad Co.; Appeal; Right to lay Switches,"The People of the State of New-York Resp'ts. vs. The Third-avenue Railroad Company, Appellants. -- This case come up, yesterday, on an appeal taken by the Third-avenue Railroad Company, from a judgment rendered by Justice Clerke, at the Special Term of this court, on the 19th of October, 1864. The action was brought in the name of the people of this State for the purpose of permanently restraining the Third-avenue Railroad Company from operating a certain switch or branch track, which had been by them constructed from Third-avenue up One Hundred and Thirtieth-street toward the Fourth-avenue. The company further claim that this switch or branch track was constructed by them for the better accommodation of the public, and that they were legally authorized to construct and operate the same by virtue of a resolution of the Common Council of the City of New-York, passed on the 28th day of March, 1864. By this resolution they contend that they were required to construct the switch or branch railroad. They did construct it, and undertook to operate it. They claim that it was a necessity resulting from the constantly-increasing travel on that thoroughfare. Soon after the company commenced to operate the branch railroad, the people of the State, through their Attorney-General, Mr. John Cochrane, commenced a suit and obtained a preliminary injunction. The case was tried before Justice Clerke without a jury, and the result was a permanent injunction. The company have now taken an appeal to the General Term for the purpose of getting the judgment reversed and the injunction removed. The case was argued at length yesterday by Mr. C.N. Potter in behalf of the railroad company, and by Mr. Anderson for the people. The first point argued on the part of the appellants was that it nowhere appeared as a matter of fact who the owners of the fee of One Hundred and Thirtieth-street were, or that the people of the State of New-York had any interest therein, there was no proof on that subject. The interest of the people could not be inferred; it must be made to appear in order to maintain the action. To support this position the cases of Davis vs. The Mayor, in the 14th of New-York Reports, and the People vs. Kerr, in the 27th New-York were cited. The second point argued was that the Common Council had power to direct the occupation of One Hundred and Thirtieth-street, as required by their resolutions. Counsel said that it was undoubtedly a temporary occupation at the pleasure of the Common Council, revocable by them at any moment; there was no exclusive right to the switch; not only the railroad company, but any one could use it, and moreover, there was no right to compensation for business done on it; in fact the resolutions of the Common Council expressly forbid compensation. The courts of this State have nowhere declared that such a resolution is beyond the power of the Common Council. In Davis vs. The Mayor, (14 N.Y. Rep.) the distinction between carrying passengers for hire, under an agreement giving permanent, exclusive use to the grantee, and a revocable temporary license is distinctly taken. Three of the justices declared that a revocable license to lay rails in the city would be valid. In Milhau vs. Sharp, the resolutions for a Broadway railroad were decided to be beyond the power of the Common Council, because they conferred an exclusive permanent right to carry passengers on Broadway for hire. Under the general powers of the city over streets, the counsel said, the right of the city to authorize show-cases, stands, booths, tramways to coal-yards, elevators, elevated railways near docks, and temporary rail tracks, to be erected in the streets during the pleasure of the city, has been constantly exercised. In this connection he called the attention of the learned judges to the children's department of the late United States Sanitary Fair, erected on Seventeenth-street; also to the general recruiting-tent formerly situated near WASHINGTON's statue on Union-square. If the Common Council could authorize those erections, why could they not this track? As to his third point, counsel said he should insist that if the Common Council had not otherwise the power, it must be considered that this switch was a necessary incident to the principal subject of the grant, ratified by the act of 1854, and that, in any event, no damage whatever had been shown; no one's rights had been infringed; no human being had been injured in person or property. The court, he said, should take into consideration the increasing interests and the growing necessities of the inhabitants of the upper portion of this great city. In ten years past the population of this island had increased about ten per cent.; but it could be shown by statistics which were above suspicion, that the wants and the necessities of the people in respect to conveyances between the upper and lower part of the city has increased in the proportion of 130 per cent. in the same time.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Important Case in the Supreme Court General Term The Rights of Railroad Companies to Lay Switches, and to Occupy Streets.; SUPREME COURT GENERAL TERM SEPT. 29.

Judge Hale on Colchester Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/09/30/archives/judge-hall-on-spiritual-mediums.html,Judge Hale on Colchester Case,"Judge HALL's opinion on the motion for a new trial in the case of the spiritual medium COLCHESTER, must be taken everywhere to be not only a conclusive argument against the points urged in his favor by his counsel, but also a very strong argument against the claims of Spiritualism itself; and thus questions involved have an interest far beyond the particular case before the court. The first one was the point urged that COLCHESTER's performances were not public. But the Judge, while obviously strongly inclined to hold that his performances were public in a proper sense, holds that it makes no difference whether they were public or not, the only necessary element being that they constituted the ""business"" of the defendant, the evidence of publicity and performance for pay being only pertinent to show that this was his business.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Judge Hall on Spiritual Mediums.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Judge Hall on Spiritual Mediums.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a701226b-804c-597e-9405-eb387495d25c,870,nyt://article/a701226b-804c-597e-9405-eb387495d25c
