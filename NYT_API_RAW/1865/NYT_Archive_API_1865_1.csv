on forecast of the Rebellion,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/01/archives/a-forecast-of-the-rebellion.html,on forecast of the Rebellion,"-- We give place to-day to a communication, written fourteen years ago, in which our distinguished cosmopolitan correspondent, DON RUFINO M. DE ALFARERO Y. CAMPION, shows how shrewd ly he was able to forecast many of the great events which have transpired since the opening of the rebellion. Among the arguments most lucidly illustrated in our correspondent's letter, are those which show the impossibility of securing Peace by Disunion, and which make it apparent that a dissolution of the Union would be ruin of the South. There is admirable pertinence, too, in our correspondent's illustrations of the logical consequences of the South depending, for the establishment of a separate nationality, upon England.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A FORECAST OF THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A FORECAST OF THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/085f17b7-e333-5a0d-84cb-807d7000269e,177,nyt://article/085f17b7-e333-5a0d-84cb-807d7000269e

Whenever an irregular or unjust action is committed by our naval officers, or generals, or magistrates -- when the only rational course for any sensible American is to at once confess that the thing was out of order, and must be redressed -- there at once starts up some so-called ""statesman,"" or industrious journalist, who amazes the public with an immense list of English precedents, with precisely the same odious, tyrannical or unjust character as the deed in question. The docile people are instructed that such actions are excusable or even right, because England has committed similar, and they leave the perusal of these clever briefs of their attorneys with the idea, that on the whole the American Republic is right if it does not do more or worse than its powerful ancestor has done. When the Trent affair occurred, there was not a popular leader, so far as we remember, who recalled to the nation its own advanced and liberal position on international questions, and the noble traditions and precedents of its past, and its duty in taking a more enlightened and generous view of these matters than had been taken by the Old World.

I was taken to Orange Court-house, and the next morning conveyed to Gordonsville, en route for Lynchburgh. About three miles from Charlottsville I made my escape from the train of cars, and after wandering about for two days was recaptured and taken to Lynchburgh, thence to Danville, and thence to Macon. In Macon I was placed in a stockade inclosing 2 1/2 acres, in which 1,800 Union prisoners were confined. In command of this post was Capt. TABBS, C.S.A., one of the most b[???]d cowardly officers I ever knew. He is now a prisoner in our hands. In the morning he would get us in line and use the vilest and most insulting language toward the ""d__d Yankee scoundrels,"" as he called us. He was relieved by Col. GIBBS, TABBS being ordered to Petersburgh. On his way he was captured by SHERIDAN's cavalry. While TABBS was in command over us, one of our officers give him his watch to sell. The owner of the watch shortly after inquired for the proceeds, when TABBS took him to his quarters, and ""bucked and gagged"" him, and kept him there suffering torture, until some citizens interfered and procured his release. While in the stockade we finished five tunnels, and three more would have been completed in about four days, which would have secured our escape, if our plan had not been betrayed by one of our own officers.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ESCAPE OF COL.

"The Winter, although mild, may, as far as navigation is concerned, to considered fairly ""set in."" With the exception of a few miles above the harbor the North River is closed, and for several days but few vessels have had the temerity to venture below Hudson.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/01/archives/affairs-along-the-ducks-navigation-new-improvements-arrival-of.html,,"The Winter, although mild, may, as far as navigation is concerned, to considered fairly ""set in."" With the exception of a few miles above the harbor the North River is closed, and for several days but few vessels have had the temerity to venture below Hudson. The damage done to the docks by floating ice last Winter hue proved a sufficient warning to our shipowners to induce them to properly guard their piers. Most of the spiles have been double planked, and but little injury to shipping from ice this Winter need be anticipated. An effort is being made by merchants doing business in the vicinity of the Battery, to race a subscription to build a new dock for the landing of small bouts. It is a disgrace to the city that an enterprise of this character was not thought of before. It is a singular fact, so say travelers, that there is not a harbor in the world where there are such poor accommodations for reaching t[???]r[???] firma as at the City of New-York. Except at Pier No. 1 North River, there is no place where a small boat can land with safely. The tide at Castle Garden is stronger than at any other point in the harbor, and, when the fact is remembered that the steamer George Leory, on her trial trip, nearly cut the Battery dock in two, in consequence of the strong current, while trying to ""found the Point,"" it will readily be seen that small craft are not safe without strong dock protection. Guests of the city, arriving from foreign ports, have on several occasions been comp[???]led to remain on shipboard for hours -- if being impossible to land in safety. In Jersey City the dock improvements are extensive, showing in enterprise on the part of shipowners on that side of the river worthy of emulation in New-York. The new steamship docks of the Bremen and Hamburg line of steamers are completed, and will compare favorably with the best piers in this city. A new company have recently been docking out from the lower part of Jersey City toward B[???]loe's Island, nearly a mile, making a secure landing for vessels of all classes. The arrival of foreign vessels during the present month is greater than during the same period last year, and the weekly report of the arrival of coast streamers is larger than at any time since the war. Thursday, as the sailors say, ""the moon fulled,"" and as the wind was southwest, the indications are that it will [???]ow from [???]t [???]arfer for the next fourteen days. Hence any vessels driven off the coast by stress of weather will soon reach the harbor. In connection with harbor matters, it is well to give our skippers a hint concerning the observance of Sundays and holidays. In almost every civilized country shipping in harbor display bunting on the Sabbath, but in New-York the reverential custom has been almost entirely ignored. On Christmas, not one but of ta[???] [???]an vessels in port displayed signals, and the [???] to honor this day was generally noticed. The fog which for several days hung over the rivers has risen, and the ferry-boats were able to run their regular trips, much to the accommodation of the traveling public. During the prevalence of the fog there were a few accidents; a[???] the number the sinking of the steamer Com[???]d[???]r which struck on a rock while going through Hell Gate, and was run on the flats at Hunter's Pol[???]t, where the is now lying in about three feet of water. The steamer Kalahain ran on a reef near the Bellevue Gardens, opposite Blackwell's Island, but was soon floated off. The pro[???] Potomac, of the Portland line, also touched on the [???] near the Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island, and after b[???]ea[???]ingone anchor proceeded down the river without [???]e[???] damage. There were several collisions of vessels, but no considerable damage was done. Old river Captains say our harbor has not been visited by such a dense fog for many years.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs Along the Ducks.; NAVIGATION NEW IMPROVEMENTS ARRIVAL OF FOREIGN VESSELS THE WEATHER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs Along the Ducks.; NAVIGATION NEW IMPROVEMENTS ARRIVAL OF FOREIGN VESSELS THE WEATHER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76034268-a677-558d-8db5-80df6f492cc4,677,nyt://article/76034268-a677-558d-8db5-80df6f492cc4

They disapprove of local bounties altogether. They have had experience in the matter, and they tell us that, while the system was well enough as a stimulus to volunteering in the early stages of the war, its effect is to make the liability to military service an affair of bargain and sale, to lower the morale of the army, to deaden ""all living interest in the war,"" to destroy all sense of personal responsibility, to make ""dollars take the place of patriotism, and substitute paper credits for men."" Much more in the same rhetorical vein occurs in the memorial. And then follow sundry recommendations. Among these are, that the President should be empowered to draft for one, two or three years during the war; to discourage offering local bounties; to have the Government bounty restricted to those who receive no local bounty, and generally to discourage volunteering by relying on an unconditional draft for the recruitment of the army.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bounties for Volunteers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bounties for Volunteers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7910c6fe-4a86-565e-9924-b285db6fad61,426,nyt://article/7910c6fe-4a86-565e-9924-b285db6fad61

Our veteran and triumphant army, our powerful and gallant navy, have operated on the great rebellion during the year with an effect which would assuredly prove mortal to it, even if they were henceforth to stand still in their career of conquest. GRANT holds and commands Virginia more even than LEE; SHERMAN is master of Georgia and the Carolinas; we control the Mississippi; we are masters of Tennessee; the key positions of the great central mountain range are in our hands; the seaboard is under our power. Our armies are able to march anywhere through the Confederacy, and demolish its resources at their leisure. Within the last few weeks we have had bodies, consisting merely of cavalry, operating at their convenience over the State of Mississippi. The body which started from Baton Rouge have scoured across the Southern part of the State; the body which started from Vicksburgh rode across the central part; and we operate at pleasure in the whole Northern section. We mention this, merely to show from it, as well as from SHERMAN's march, the real weakness and hollowness of the Southern Confederacy. When SHERMAN started out from Atlanta in November, Lieut.-Gen. GRANT was in this city, and to a gentleman he made the remark: ""The South is a mere shell; Gen. SHERMAN will soon prove it to you."" Since then, SHERMAN has proved it, as he marched leisurely through Georgia, demolishing the railroads and supplies, capturing the State capital and its chief city, and doing, unmolestedly, whatever seemed to him wise and proper. South Carolina now lies open before him; and we do not suppose his experience there will differ greatly from what it was in Georgia.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Year Retrospect and Prospect.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Year Retrospect and Prospect.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8de427b-e8c0-5bdb-9e52-4919468e5a80,476,nyt://article/a8de427b-e8c0-5bdb-9e52-4919468e5a80

Improper Publication of by Provost-Marshals; Improper Exposures; Conscription Exposures of Physical Disability,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/02/archives/improper-exposures.html,Improper Publication of by Provost-Marshals; Improper Exposures; Conscription Exposures of Physical Disability,"We said a few words a day or two ago about the necessity for greater secresy on the part of assessors of the income tax. Most of our remarks will apply, mutatis mutandis, to the Provost-Marshals. The newspapers are filled every day with appeals to the public to assist in correcting the enrollment lists. Persons who are far any reason exempt from serving, are earnestly entreated to come in and prove their claims, so as to have their names removed from the books, and it is a constant subject of lamentation with the officials that so few respond to these appeals. Of course a large number refrain from doing so through sheer carelessness or unwillingness to give the necessary time to it. But of that very great class of persons, those who are disqualified by reason of physical disability, a large number are deterred from putting in their claims to exemption by the strong and most natural dislike to have their bodily ailments set down in black and white, in a book, which if not absolutely open to public inspection, nobody is under any obligation to keep private. There is, we believe, no restraint of any kind imposed on anybody connected with the conscription and recruiting service to keep anything he hears, sees or writes, secret or concealed. He may permit anybody he pleases to look over his list of exemptions, and ascertain the precise nature of the bodily infirmity which keeps any of his neighbors or friends from rushing to arms; or the Provost-Marshal may communicate it to him by word of mouth, or talk of it to his own acquaintances, not only without incurring any penalty, but without laying himself open to any imputation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Improper Exposures.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Improper Exposures.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1671691d-fba1-5812-b8f8-aa793f844025,674,nyt://article/1671691d-fba1-5812-b8f8-aa793f844025

Mr. SEWARD has taken simply the ground with Brazil, that he has taken with England.

As the pirates of the Florida were brought to the United States unlawfully, or rather by agents entirely unauthorized to make the capture, the prisoners will be given up to Brazil.

Public Feeling in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/02/archives/public-feeling-in-georgia.html,Public Feeling in,"Perhaps the most remarkable and significant revelation made by SHERMAN'S march through Georgia, is not the internal weakness of the Confederacy, the want of military strength inside tile ""shell,"" but the entire absence of desperation on the part of that portion of the population which still remains at home. If the war were felt by them to be a national war, in the sense in which this phrase is ordinarily understood, a war in which everything that men hold dear was at stake, and in which death was preferable to submission, it is impossible to believe that their resistance to SHERMAN's progress would have been so feeble. The proclamations of the leaders, of the Governor and Generals, of the Senators and Congressmen, and the articles in the newspapers, were couched in terms worthy of the occasion. They were just such as ought to have been issued by revolutionary chiefs to followers who were really and terribly in earnest. They called on the Georgians to ""come in squads or come singly,"" to ""bring such weapons as they could find,"" to ""rise to a man in the in vaders' path,"" ""to bushwhack him without mercy."" The planters were to shoot at him from behind fences; the negroes to be employed in cutting down trees across the road and breaking down bridges; and, last and greatest sacrifice of all, they were to lay waste everything before him, to drive off the cattle and horses, and burn and destroy what they could not convey away.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Public Feeling in Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Public Feeling in Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Georgia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b246c22-46db-5dbf-99d7-ec4be819bc06,636,nyt://article/2b246c22-46db-5dbf-99d7-ec4be819bc06

"Messrs. JACOB A. WESTERVELT & SON, of this city, are building for the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, of Liverpool, England, a beautiful side-wheel steamer, to be called the Favorita, and from present appearances, she will probably be one of the fastest steamers of her length ever built in this city. The Favorita is intended for the route of the company on the west coast of South America. Capt. JAS. HALL, one of the company's officers, is here superintending the construction of the vessel. The Favorita is 200 feet long, 30 feet beam, and 9 feet depth of hold. She is being built of the best of material, and will be in every respect a first-class passenger and light-freight steamer. The All[???] Works are building the engines, which have a 56-inch cylinder and 11 feet stroke, and the power that can be developed will certainly tend, with her fine model, to make her a very fast vessel. No pains or expense will be spared to make her as attractive and comfortable as possible for a vessel of her small dimensions to be. The bull is thoroughly iron-strapped on the outside of the frame, the bolts or fastenings all clinched on the inside aide of the timbers. She will have EMERSON's improved patent windlass and some other modern improvements. Capt. HALL, was called to England by the directors of the company for the purposes of having the vessel bunt there. But the builders of all the company's steamers, Messrs. RANDOLPH, ELDER & CO., of Glasgow, having at the time three large steamers of ever 2,000 tons each for the company, beside seven others for other parties, could not undertake to build the Favorita within the time named by the directors, and as the steamer was urgently wanted on her route, the directors decided to have her bunt in this country. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company have, within the fast two years, sent into the Pacific four first-class steamships, all fitted up in the most expensive and comfortable manner, and fitted expressly for the coast trade, and to meet all the requirements of the passenger trafic. These shi[???]s are of the following sizes: Peru, 1,400 tons; Chile, 1,750 tons; Quito, 1,350 tons; Payta, 1,860 tons. The passages made by the above steamers from Liverpool to Valparaiso, were: Peru 35 days; Chile, 33 days; Quito, 36 days; Payta, 31 days. The three large steamers now building on the Clyde for the company will be the finest steamers yet sent into the Pacific. They will have every improvement that can add to comfort or safety, and are guaranteed a speed of 14 knots per hour. These steamers will leave Liverpool in September next. The Favorita will leave this city about first of March, making four more steamers sent out to the coast in less than one year.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/02/archives/an-american-steamer-building-for-an-english-company.html,,"Messrs.

RANDOLPH, ELDER & CO., of Glasgow, having at the time three large steamers of ever 2,000 tons each for the company, beside seven others for other parties, could not undertake to build the Favorita within the time named by the directors, and as the steamer was urgently wanted on her route, the directors decided to have her bunt in this country. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company have, within the fast two years, sent into the Pacific four first-class steamships, all fitted up in the most expensive and comfortable manner, and fitted expressly for the coast trade, and to meet all the requirements of the passenger trafic. These shi[???]s are of the following sizes: Peru, 1,400 tons; Chile, 1,750 tons; Quito, 1,350 tons; Payta, 1,860 tons. The passages made by the above steamers from Liverpool to Valparaiso, were: Peru 35 days; Chile, 33 days; Quito, 36 days; Payta, 31 days. The three large steamers now building on the Clyde for the company will be the finest steamers yet sent into the Pacific. They will have every improvement that can add to comfort or safety, and are guaranteed a speed of 14 knots per hour. These steamers will leave Liverpool in September next. The Favorita will leave this city about first of March, making four more steamers sent out to the coast in less than one year.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An American Steamer Building for an English Company.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An American Steamer Building for an English Company.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/60d3104a-04d5-5fca-9e38-be677cf120ad,472,nyt://article/60d3104a-04d5-5fca-9e38-be677cf120ad

Beauregard not Directing Hood's Movements,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/02/archives/beauregard-and-hood.html,Beauregard not Directing Hood's Movements,"-- It has hitherto been supposed that the strategy and movements of HOOD were in part subject to the control of BEAUREGARD. The conclusion, however, was not drawn inferentially from the results achieved by the rebel Commander in Tennessee. Most people, indeed, were agreed that such results could only be due to one military genius, and that genius, HOOD. But during the early part of December, it was sedulously given out by most of the southwestern as well as the Richmond rebel journals, that BEAUREGARD was moving mysteriously by HOOD's side, of slightly in his rear; that the inspiration of the great rebel Engineer was continually available for the purposes of the invasion, and that the campaign would be made an assured success by the general superintendence of a military master spirit. One Georgia sheet, we believe, did admit that BEAUREGARD was at Macon on the 30th of November. But that left it open to be inferred, that he might be hovering around there to dash upon SHERMAN's rear, and strike out toward Atlanta and Chattanooga in cooperating with HOOD.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEAUREGARD AND HOOD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEAUREGARD AND HOOD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6ea7d47-3675-514d-8bff-b655cac1a010,321,nyt://article/f6ea7d47-3675-514d-8bff-b655cac1a010

At about 7:30 o'clock Rev. HENRY WARD BEECHER, Pastor of the church, briefly addressed the audience. He said he wished to congratulate and offer the compliments of the season to all present, and particularly to congratulate those who should be so fortunate as to secure the seats they wished, and to sympathize and condole with those who failed in so doing. Some dissatisfaction had been expressed by a few at this manner of disposing of the seats, but he thought it the only fair way thus to dispose of them in public, before all who cared to attend, and by so doing giving an equal chance to all to secure their favorite seats. It was the intention of the Board of Trustees that one third of the best seats of the house, should pay at least two-thirds of the expenses of the house, so that the poorer members of the congregation might secure seats at the other end of the list, at prices within their reach. For years past through the generosity of the congregation this desirable result had been accomplished, and he hoped the same generosity would be again extended. He then introduced the Auctioneer, Mr. PITTSBURY, who immediately commenced the sale of the pews.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Annual Renting of Pews of Plymouth Church.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Annual Renting of Pews of Plymouth Church.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f3b1ce6-a4eb-5f2e-8599-9ffa8882926c,563,nyt://article/2f3b1ce6-a4eb-5f2e-8599-9ffa8882926c

Message,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/04/archives/gov-fentons-message.html,Message,"Gov. FENTON's Message to the Legislature of New-York is exceedingly comprehensive. And the space it covers -- although large -- will scarcely be considered inordinate, when the importance of the questions which the Governor takes under review are carefully noted. The great social problems involved in our public charitable institutions necessarily occupy a considerable portion of the Message. And the Governor's statements, especially in regard to the large body of our insane population, now in a great measure uncared for, cannot fail to excite a deep feeling which ought to find practical expression by an immediate legislative provision. We are apt to forget, in comparing the liberality of the annual appropriations for charitable institutes in this country, with similar appropriations in other countries, that a large proportion of the benefactions which go to maintain the aged, the imbecile and the disabled in older communities, are the result of private and special bequests. Many years must elapse before the same class of charitable foundations -- many of them laid centuries ago -- can come into account here as great auxilliaries of the State. We must, therefore, be prepared to hear the painful statement that, outside of this city and its great suburb on the East River, there are between thirteen and fourteen hundred lunatics, growing more helpless in their misery each day, by reason of the inadequate provision made for their sustenance and relief. Attentive regard must also be paid to Gov. FENTON's report of the increased demand made upon the charitable appropriations of the State, by the daily increasing population of military invalids which the war has thrown back upon our benevolence. The State has given its sons by the hundred thousand to the national service, and whatever may be the national provision made for the invalided, New-York cannot afford to see their wants unsupplied, where the pension fund may require to be supplemented.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gov.

These men are needed to strengthen the gallant armies now administering such effective blows to the rebellion, to assist those who are so fearlessly risking their lives for the life of the nation, to aid GRANT and SHERMAN, SHERIDAN and THOMAS, FARRAGUT and PORTER, in securing the fruits of the victories they have so bravely won. We cannot allow the enemies of the republic to triumph now, when they are so nearly vanquished, -- when each successive assault is resulting so auspiciously to the cause of the Union and so disastrously to that of its adversaries. The war for its preservation must continue until the last enemy of the national supremacy shall be subdued. In the great contest in which the nation is unhappily involved, New-York has not been behind her sister States in earnest efforts and sacrifices; she will not be now. I do earnestly invite the people of this State to exercise the utmost diligence in filling the quota, which may be assigned them under the call of the President.

FENTON to the patriotism of the Empire State. For two dreary years we have heard no such language. Nothing has been heard from the Executive Chamber at Albany in support of the war but cold, measured, perfunctory words. The only earnestness has been reserved for efforts to destroy the confidence of the people in the administration of the Government. All the influence which has emanated from that high position has gone to depress the popular spirit and unnerve the public arm. But now we hear a voice that stirs the blood like a trumpet -- a voice that not only summons every man in the State to his duty, but animates him with a spirit to go straight on in its performance.

It is, perhaps, going to the other extreme to anticipate it at Niblo's Saloon. In that not over-large apartment, mimic life is colossal. An ordinary individual becomes a giant and a chorus a crowd. This, however, has, in a measure, been overcome by M. JUIGNET's French artists. Their natural tact and knowledge have enabled them to accommodate themselves to a limited sphere of operations. We cannot say the same for the members of the Italian Opera Buffa. Although this description of work requires the best of acting, it was obvious, last evening, that most of the artists were at least inexperienced, and better disposed to look at the audience than to consult the interchanges and necessities of the scene. We do not propose to criticise the performance in a musical point of view. The artists were evidently laboring under indisposition, and it would be unjust to suppose that they did their best. There was a small but good orchestra, which accomplished its object satisfactorily. The chorus was as large as the stage could accommodate, but it did not by any means accommodate itself to the stage. For its numbers, it was as bad as could be expected. We hope, on some future occasion, to say more of a speculation which, if successfully conducted, would add to the enjoyments of city life. The cast of the of the opera last evening was as follows: Adnia, Mme. CAVIOLI; Nemorino, Signor MONGIARDINI; Dulcamara, Signor ARDAVNI; Belcore, Signor FELLINI; Gianella, Mme. PICKANESER. It will be repeated on Friday.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8542ba95-5cf8-5c59-8d86-6ab6fe4f23eb,574,nyt://article/8542ba95-5cf8-5c59-8d86-6ab6fe4f23eb

"George Opdyke vs. Thurlow Weed. There was a large attendance in court yesterday, to hear the argument of counsel. Judge Pierrepont, on opening his remarks, paid a tribute to the court and jury.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/06/archives/the-weedopdyke-libel-suit-supreme-court-trial-term-before-hon-judge.html,,"George Opdyke vs. Thurlow Weed. -- There was a large attendance in court yesterday, to hear the argument of counsel. Judge Pierrepont, on opening his remarks, paid a tribute to the court and jury. It is with sorrow that any right-minded man feels himself compelled to prosecute his fellow-man for crime of any kind. But there comes a time in the life of every man when he must choose between being a coward for his ease, or a brave man for the right. This controversy is the culmination of a feud of somewhat ancient date. As you have seen from the evidence quoted from the libels themselves, as well as from other evidence in the case, Mr. Weed was the party upon whom the attack first was made. He was assailed as ""the father of the lobby,"" the ""corrupter of public morals,"" the ""contriver of various corrupt schemes,"" a ""coarse fellow,"" as engaged in the fraudulent charter of the steamer Cataline, all which, and much more, was reiterated in the public newspapers, barking and snapping continually, until Old Thurlow turns, and with one snap of his whip sends his assailant whining to a court of justice, in search of a greenback plaster to cover his smarting wounds. Is that a manly way in which to act, when worsted in a political feud? But this cause involves a higher question; a question of public morality; a question of political responsibility. Whether the corruptions of men in office can be exposed; the freedom of the press, the greatest question that ever came before the world -- whether our free institutions shall continue, or corruption shall destroy them, and liberty perish from off the of the earth. This, gentlemen, is a time of civil war, and do you suppose there can be a great civil war which will not shake the great foundations of the nation? The war on battle-fields, will, in a few months, be over; but the war of ideas has just begun; and when the bells shall ring in the joyful news of peace, beware lest they ring in a peace without liberty. The charge which the court shall give you will be of more moment than the order any Major-General has issued; and your verdict will be vaster in its consequences than the issue of any battle. The instinct of the people tells them so; and even the march of Sherman and the stack on Wilmington were not able to direct the attention of the people from this issue. It has even excited the attention of the religious community, so much so that it has been spoken of in the churches. [The counsel was about to read a report of some pulpit remarks, when Mr. Field interposed, and it was ruled out as irregular.] Gentlemen, the counsel for the plaintiff has stated in your presence that the World newspaper was sued for the same libel, and the damages are laid at $50,-000, the same sum that Mr. Weed is sued for; so that, it successful, Mr. Opdyke will make money by these suits almost as fast as out of his secret contract with the Government, or out of Mariposa stock, or out of his fraudulent gun claim on the city. In Mariposa it is shown he did not invest a dollar, and he has made $800,000 or $900,000. Now sane men do not act without motive. Perhaps personal feeling had something to do with it; but the great motive for this suit was the love of money. If not for the sake of money, why drag Mr. Weed into a civil court, instead of having him punished in a criminal court? Let these suits prevail, and tell me how much of civil liberty the people have left? Counsel went into a consideration of the wrongs often unavoidably committed on the liberty of individuals in a time of civil war. The tree of liberty is not growing very vigorously just now. Give a verdict which will muzzle the press, and you will find next year it is dead. You may water it with your tears, but it will not survive. This is a public question. Is it not right to expose the frauds of men in public places? If it is right to expose them, then it is wrong that Mr. Weed should be punished for ex posing them. He ought to have a monument, rather. The only tribunal before whom such offenders can be brought, is that of public opinion; and the only instrument we can use is the public press. Will you destroy that? The question has been asked a thousand times: ""How dare Mr. Opdyke bring this suit?"" Why, the evidence was all his own, in his own possession; the witnesses we had to call were in his interest; Mr. Blunt was his friend; he did not believe the thing could be proved; and it is a miracle that they have been proved, and more than proved. He did not think he ran any risk. But when a man is engaged in a fraud, he always runs a risk, and sooner or later it will be revealed. Now, I call your attention to the first part of the article complained of as libelous. ""Mr, Opdyke may enlarge the field of inquiry and look into this alleged sale of the Surveyorship of the port of New-York."" Suppose there was no truth in this statement, taken in connection with what precedes, ought there to have been a suit about it? But it is true, in substance and in fact; and if one of the parties did cheat a little, by keeping back part of the price, it does not alter the fact of the sale. When this suit was brought, gentlemen, the plaintiff must have had in mind the old saying: ""The greater the truth the greater the libel."" But his friend Orison Blunt, who is a lawyer, should have informed him better -- that there has been no change in the law -- that the old adage does not prevail -- and that when a man has proved the truth of the libel, he is protected. Counsel went into a review of the testimony on this point. Could it be believed that McNeil, who had been a member of the Legislature, had been engaged in political life, and a friend of Mr. Opdyke, had concocted all the story which he related. As a counterfeit bill was detected by its appearance, so could the jury tell by the manner of a witness on the stand, whether he was telling the truth. McNeill was the friend of Mr. Opdyke, and desired his election as Mayor. Mr. Andrews was also his friend, and himself was looking for the Surveyorship. What more natural than that he should go to McNeil and tell him he wanted Opdyke's influence -- that he wanted him to drop Stanton and support him? McNeil says. ""How will it be to Mr. Opdyke's interest?"" Andrews replies, ""I will have $10,000 collected in the Custom-house to help his election as Mayor."" McNeil reports this to Opdyke next day. Opdyke seems contented with it, but says, ""Will he not cheat you?"" ""I think not,"" says McNeil, ""but pick your man and we will go and meet him, and have the thing fixed."" Says Opdyke, ""Suppose you take Amos J. Williamson?"" Agreed. Next day they see Andrews; make an appointment in an eating-house on 5th July, in a private room, where Andrews says there was a ""spread."" How happened there to be a ""spread?"" The bargain is there made. Both McNeill and Williamson tell you the same thing; that when they sat down McNeil says, ""Well, Andrews, let us go to business."" That Andrews entered into the arrangement; when leaving McNeil says to Williamson ""Are you satisfied?"" he being Opdyke's picked man. He says he is satisfied. That they went to Opdyke, who expressed himself satisfied. Do you think they have both contrived this story? Andrews, after he gets the office, thanks McNeil and Williamson both for aiding him. Had Williamson and McNeil any motive to be false in this narration? You cannot conceive of any. Go to the Custom-house and see what they do to carry out that bargain. Mr. Barney says he never heard of any money being raised in the Custom-house on a Mayoralty election before this. No one ever did. Federal officers do not hold under the Mayor. Why was this assessment made? It was made to carry out the arrangement between Andrews and Opdyke. Barney tells you he was opposed to the whole thing. He had no knowledge of this secret contract between Andrews and Opdyke, to assess the Custom-house for $10,000. And what kind of a thing was that for George Opdyke, a man of great wealth, to enter into? to get $10,000 out of the poor laboring clerks of the Custom-house; to do what? to make him Mayor of the City of New-York. In Heaven's name, if he wanted to be Mayor of the city, why not pay the expenses oat of his own money -- money got out of the Government and his vast trade. You are told it was all ""voluntary."" Of course it was very voluntary. A circular issued by the head of the department. Ah! if any of you were a clerk in the Custom-house, you would find out what a ""voluntary"" subscription means. If it is not responded to, it will not be long before you receive a ""voluntary"" note, stating ""voluntarily"" that your services will be no longer required. Yes, Mr. Opdyke ""may enlarge the field of inquiry, so as to embrace the alleged sale of the office of Surveyor of the port of New-York."" We have made a brief examination of it, and find it pretty satisfactory. Counsel reviewed the testimony of Mr. Andrews himself, as, on close inspection, tending to show the truth of the matter he sought to deny. The next libel was in relation to the Mariposa estate; that Opdyke, Ketchum and Hoy obtained $2,400,000. The fact proved was, that they received $2,500,000. No one of them but Mr. Opdyke had sued for libel, when Mr. Fremont was asked whether any advantage was taken of him, his answer was: ""Any unfair advantage? I (hesitating) think not."" The business was urgent, the pressure was great, and he wisely took his hand out of the lion's mouth. Gen. Fremont was willing to give two and a half millions to adjust difficulties, and Opdyke and the other gentlemen got each $800,000 or $900,000 for nothing. Mr. Fremont was required to give, in addtion to his first agreement, $700,000, out of which Mr. Field got his counsel fees, and then to give a proxy for a large amount of his own stocks, and at last to sell 5,000 shares at $25 a share, when it was worth about double in the market. Then Fremont commenced an action about $180,000 of bonds, which he afterward adjusted. The next libel was in regard to secret partnerships. It was proved that he made $172,000 out of one batch in a very few months. William Churchill sold to Opkyke three distinct contracts with the Government for clothing, for which Opdyke paid him 12 1/2 cents per coat. Churchill could not get the goods except of Opdyke. Mr. Spaulding sold Opdyke a quantity of cloth which was so bad, as the plaintiff claimed, that it would not take an indigo blue dye, but somehow or other they did ""work it in."" Then there was the contract with the State for military clothing. Mr. Carhart produced a list of contracts in his own name, amounting to $4,600,000, in which Opdyke was interested and at the same time surety, making as his share $172,000. In September, 1863, Opdyke says it was true that he had no contracts in the present tense. But when a man states ""equally ungrounded is the charge that I have any interest in Government contracts; I have none direct or indirect, and they exist only in Mr. Weed's imagination,"" do you not understand that he means I have had no contracts? In regard to the guns, if there was a [???]aud in presenting the claim. It was to be laid to the charge of the Mayor of the city in 1863. It was hoped that a wealthy Mayor would be proof against corruption. But we find him secretely interested in contracts. Instead of guarding the City Treasury he took money illegally from the city and pocketed it. Opdyke went into a contract for making guns, a hazardous business, with which he was entirely unacquainted. Marston, who is making them, requires more and more money, until Opdyke advances $65,000. Then Opdyke buys out the establishment in the name of Farley. He was then willing to get out of the business at a loss of $10,000 or $20,000. At length his advances amounted to $185,000, when he said he would be willing to sell out at a loss of $25,000 or $30,000. Then came the destruction of the armory. A great effort had been made to show that Opdyke did not connive at the destruction of his establishment. No such charge had been made in the opening. The only thing that he (Mr. Pierrepont) said, was that when it was found that the factory was going to be destroyed, the plaintiff felt very quiet about it, knowing that the city would have to pay for it, and that his ruinously losing and bankrupt concern would be better paid for by the city. Now all an insurance company would have to pay would be the actual value of the property destroyed, not any prospective profit. While Opdyke was thinking how to make up his claim, Lorein Jones came in and suggested to charge the contract price, less the cost of furnishing the goods, that would protect the patentees and all, Opdyke had been thinking that he might claim what he had paid out; but he says, ""he thought that would be highly illegal,"" so he adopted the suggestion of Jones, by which he gets all he put in, with all the prospective profits beside. That would not be illegal. Now Jones swears that he could duplicate all the machinery and tools for $40,000, thus showing an overcharge of $63,000. The cash-book showed that Jones had told the truth in regard to the matter. Only $15,000 had been received from the Government until the 11th of September, so that the balance of the $28,000 was kept out. The $15,000 balances itself in the books. In making up the account they had to estimate the value of the materials for unfinished guns. The value of the different parts of the guns was proved accurately on this trial. Now if they had put in an exact account of the materials destroyed, it would have reduced the claim $63,000. Supervisor Blunt, who had dismissed, riot claims with a five minutes, hearing, takes up the claim of Opdyke into his own choice keeping, and in a few days he is nominated for Mayor in Opdyke's place. Mr. Fields, on behalf of the Corporation, was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses, or hear the testimony. Supervisor Purdy resigned the very day the claim was passed. Counsel reviewed the testimony of Mr. Farley before the Supervisors, in which he stated that the articles were charged at the prices they cost to make them, and points out several discrepancies in the items as compared with the inventory, among others, $3,000 for the model gun, which cost only $500. The great question for the jury to decide was, whether a man who, in office, had been undertaking to get, by indirection, and by means which the law regards as fraudulent, money out of the city, when he himself was its trustee and guardian, If the jury should say that that was right, then corruption had overridden justice, fraud triumphed over honesty, the day of our destruction was near. Gentlemen, the responsibility that rests upon you is the gravest that has been cast upon you in a lifetime. All I ask is, that you shall do your duty in a way that, when you go out from here, you may feel that you have done right, and may be able to tell your fellow-citizens why it is right.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WEED-OPDYKE LIBEL SUIT.; Supreme Court Trial Term.

S.J. GILMAN, of the Schooner Charter Oak, of and bound to San Francisco, from Boston, called at our office yesterday, and gives us information respecting the capture of his vessel by the rebel pirate Shenandoah, in lat. 7 north, lon. 27° 30′ west. The Charter Oak had a cargo of coals and hardware, furniture and preserved fruits. On the 5th of November, about 5 A.M., when the wind was very light from the southwest, saw a large ship (looking for all the world like a clipper) astern, which ship the Captain, a half-hour later, discovered was getting up steam and making for the schooner. At 6 A.M. the stranger ran up alongside to the windward, flying the English flag, having fired a gun for him to heave to, which the Charter Oak did, when the steamer ran up the Confederate flag. A small boat with an officer and several men, all armed, then came up alongside, and told Capt. GILMAN that the schooner was a prize to the Confederate States steamer Shenandoah. The Captain and crew were then ordered on board the small boat, and taken to the steamer, the former being allowed to gather up and carry with him his papers, &c. He was conducted to the cabin of the steamer, and introduced to the Captain, WADDELL, who after duly examining his schooner's papers, gravely informed him that nothing could save the schooner, and that after taking what he wanted from her, he should burn her. After removing a few things from the schooner she was set on fire, the pirate remaining in sight until she was dismantled and nearly burned to the water's edge. Capt. GILMAN and his crew remained on the Shenandoah seven days, during which time she burned the bark D. Godfrey, of Boston, Capt. HALLETT, bound to Valparaiso, and sunk the brig Susan, of New-York, bound to Rio Grande, S.A. The course of the Shenandoah was, of course, very erratic; but her principal cruising-ground seems to have been from 26 to 32 W. lon.; it is probable, however, that by this time she has crossed the line, following the Brazil coast, and cutting across to the Cape of Good Hope. (Capt. GILMAN comes to this conclusion from the fact that the pirate-chief took his chart, which was the first and only one he ever had, giving this course, and seemed to be highly delighted at obtaining it.) On the seventh day Capt. GILMAN and his crew were but on board the ship Kate Prince, of Portsmouth, N.H., Capt. H. LIBBY, bound to Bahia or St. Salvador, Brazil, where they arrived on the 23d of November. The Kate Prince was bonded for $40,000, which would seem rather strange were the fact not known that her cargoes (consisting chiefly of coal) was English. Capt. HALLETT, of the bark D. Godfrey, of Boston, and Capt. STAPLES, of the bark Helena, (captured eight days before the Charter Oak,) were put on board a Danish brig and sent to Rio Janeiro. Capt. GILMAN and his crew reached this city on Sunday last, in the bark Grace. His crew was as follows: Zairil Burges, mate; Charles E. Burse, second mate; Jno. M.

FORBES, Esq., called the Meteor, and the results were highly satisfactory. The ship is of the same size as the larger sloops-of-war of the [???]nderoga class, measuring about 1,400 tons, having a midship cross-section immersed of about 485 square feet. Her boilers are of the horizontal tubular variety, having 204 square feet of grate surface only, without blowers, and the cylinders are 62 1/2 inches in diameter and three feet stroke, with an independent cut-off, cutting off at about one third of the stroke. The safety valves were set so as to blow off at 22 pounds' pressure, and although the boilers were tested up to 53 pounds, the valves could not be loaded heavier on the trial, on account of their location, so that the test had to be made with much less steam than the machine is entitled to carry. The trial was made under the direction of Capt. BOGGS and Chief-Engineer W.W. WOOD, with the assistants, and the ship was run four times over the two measured knots now used as a race course in the lower bay. The result was that a uniform speed of sixty-three revolutions a minute could be maintained on a twenty-three pitch, now driving the ship twelve knots, or fourteen miles an honor; while at the same time the tubes were furnishing more steam at the limited pressure than could be used by the engine. It the pressure had been increased to 35 lbs., as it could have been with a heavier load on the safety valves, the speed would have gone up to about thirteen and a half knots, as the engineer said. Capt. COMSTOCK, who was one of the company, said that it was the fastest time he had ever known made by any propellor on a trial on measured distance, and to all others said: ""This is the sort of ship to send after the Shenandoah.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Trial Trip of Mr. R.B.

It is not merely in the measures of policy adopted by the rebels that we see this; for the grounds, the import, the bearing, the purpose and the effect of their measures may often be misjudged by us; and for more than two years past they have very often acted in a way that can be characterized as no other than desperate or despairing. But under it all, in all circumstances and amid all fortunes, the popular temper, so far as we could judge it through its exponent, the press, has been unyielding in its devotion to the rebellion, and unflinching in faith of its final success. There has been temporary despondency often enough, but there is a great difference between despondency and its indications, and the indications of despair.

The body of the Waikatoes are still in arms; they have retired indeed from the frontier portion of their territory, and the war is for the moment suspended, but they have evidently retired with the determination of renewing the conflict next season, and attempting to recover possession of the abandoned districts. Nor would this enterprise prove difficult of execution were the Imperial Government, as is threatened, to withdraw most of its troops from New-Zealand, and leave the colonists to deal with the enemy single-handed, for, in that case, the Maories would meet but feeble opposition from the scattered settlers of the border, and would speedily become again masters of the confiscated territory.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs in New-Zealand.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs in New-Zealand.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/14b0ff17-5971-5a67-8f0f-ac57e4f17de8,605,nyt://article/14b0ff17-5971-5a67-8f0f-ac57e4f17de8

The testimony of several witnesses was taken, showing that late on the night of the 3d inst., TONER was among a gang of thieves who had gathered near WM. VARLEY's drinking saloon in Chatham-square, and there created a disturbance; that PRIER THOMPSON, having been struck and very seriously wounded, entered VARLEY's, where he was acquainted, and took thence a cart-rung; that he then returned to the street and engaged the fellows in a free fight; that he prostrated two or three, and that, on reentering the liquor-store, he remarked: ""I've laid two of them out!"" Shortly after this occurrence, Officer MAHONEY, of the Fourth Precinct, appeared on the scene and dispersed the gang, not, however, until he had apprehended THOMAS VARLEY and PETER THOMPSON. The prisoners were held until Wednesday morning, and then, no complainant appearing against them at the Halls of Justice, they were dismissed; but, subsequently, TONER failing rapidly, and being evidently at the threshold of death, they were rearrested. After listening to the testimony of several witnesses, the jury rendered a verdict as follows: ""We find that JOHN TONER came to his death by compression of the brain, the result of blows on the head with a club, at the hands of PETER THOMPSON, on the night of Jan. 3, 1865, at the corner of East Broadway and Chatham-square. We further believe 'Irish Tom' and MICHAEL WHITE to be accessories."" The Coroner required THOMPSON to find $1,000 ball to await the action of the Grand Jury, and the police authorities were directed to find WHITE and THOMAS KERRIGAN, alias ""Irish Tom.""

Hartt; Stated Meeting; Lecture on Law of Progress; Americus Club, Annual Ball of; Hecker, John,Card from on Injunction","Since the announcement that the quota of NewYork was only about 3,500 on the last call, the people seem to have folded their hands in content and dismissed from their minds all fear of conscription. If this apathy continues until the 15th of February, the deficiency will be but little reduced by enlistments. The County Volunteer Committee only received ninety-two men during the week just past, hardly as many as they formerly had in a single day, and the prospect for this week is not very encouraging. The action of the Board of Supervisors in voting $4,000,000 fort he payment of bounties, and the proposal to pay $1,000 to recruits, with the subsequent action of the Volunteer Committee declining to increase the bounty, has almost stopped recruiting in this county. The men, who are willing to go look around for the highest bounty offered, and finding that New-York is the lowest bidder, go elsewhere. Those who want to enlist here are holding off with the expectation that the county will be compelled to raise the bounty to $1,000, as recently proposed by the Supervisors.The committee have the money now, and if their efforts to fill the quota are seconded by the people, there will be no draft. And while engaged in the laudable endeavor of avoiding a conscription, they can also obtain first-class men in abundance, if their efforts are put forth in the proper direction. This paper has once before suggested the offer of a special bounty to veterans, of whom it is believed there are some 15,000 in this city. It is well known that the Government is raising a corps composed exclusively of this class, and has offered unusual inducements to men enlisting in it, without any marked success. Let the Volunteer Committee give $1,000 bounty to all veterans who will enlist in HANCOCK's corps, and be credited to this county, and with the cash Government bounty of $300, each man will receive $1,300 as soon as mustered in. Certainly this will bring out the veterans, fill the quota of the city, and till it not with limping imbeciles, or too active bounty-jumpers, but with the best class of trained soldiers. Patriotism and interest both call upon the committee to take this course.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE NEW CALL FOR TROOPS.

Wounded near Savannah,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/08/archives/a-member-of-congress-elect-seriously-wounded.html,Wounded near Savannah,"Col. J.H. KETCHAM, of the One Hundred and Fiftieth New-York Volunteers, was severely wounded on the 21st, while at the head of his troops near Savannah, Ga. His brigade had been ordered to hold Argyle Island and the South Carolina shore opposite, and thus to intercept the retreat of the rebels northward. Two days afterward, Savannah surrendered, and the brigade was ordered back. Argyle Island and the main land adjacent being a swamp full of ditches and dykes, to withdraw the troops was a most difficult and dangerous undertaking. They were outnumbered and unprotected. The enemy pressing their rear, a river before them, only small boats and scows in which to cross it, the wind all the time blowing furiously. The One Hundred and Fiftieth New-York was the first to cross, got safely over, and was ordered to protect the crossing of the remainder of the brigade. Its position was very uncomfortable and dangerous. The Colonel passed along the lines to see that his men were not unnecessarily exposed; he had just returned to the right of the line when a shower of bullets fell around him. He was standing unprotected on the dike, and received a very serious, though not mortal wound. Col. KETCHAM had just returned to his regiment, the first of all the officers who left Atlanta to come North to election. Having been triumphantly elected to Congress from the Twelfth District, he returned to duty the first opportunity, notwithstanding his orders permitted him to remain here until Gen. SHERMAN should occupy Savannah. He traveled by night after he landed in Georgia, over a road constantly shelled by the rebels; went immediately into action, received this severe wound, which will probably prevent his serving the country further for the preent: perhaps until he takes his seat in the next Congress.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MEMBER OF CONGRESS ELECT SERIOUSLY; WOUNDED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MEMBER OF CONGRESS ELECT SERIOUSLY; WOUNDED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7af65900-ac06-5435-b76a-185d5dbdec73,303,nyt://article/7af65900-ac06-5435-b76a-185d5dbdec73

Our Minister in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/08/archives/our-minister-in-england.html,Our Minister in,"A factious journal of this city is indignant because Mr. Minister ADAMS chose to return a civil answer to the address of a number of Englishmen of high social and intellectual standing, who have been from the beginning ardent sympathizers with the Government of the United States in its efforts to restore the National supremacy. The argument is that if a number of Englishmen had the right to be listened to by the American Minister, when they tendered him their friendly congratulations on the success of the national cause, they had the same right to approach him with a remonstrance against the policy adopted by President LINCOLN in putting down the rebellion. And in illustration of its reasoning, the factious organ proceeds to contrast the conduct of Mr. SEWARD, in rejecting the English peace address, with that of Mr. ADAMS, who gives a welcome reception to an address equally impertinent. It is hardly necessary, we presume, to defend Mr. SEWARD from the questionable compliments which it is thus intended to thrust upon him. It is only necessary to recall the fact, so far as the Secretary of State is concerned, that he has been repeatedly the President's organ since the rebellion broke out, to convey to liberal associations, both in England and the Continent of Europe, the thanks of the Executive for friendly addresses. The Swiss address, for example, could not have been forgotten, when Mr. ADAMS was assailed for deviating from the policy marked cut by his superiors. The peace address of the English rebel sympathizers was rejected by the President, because it was an insulting appeal to the United States Government to prostrate itself before the starving conspirators of Richmond. The congratulations of a body of liberal and intelligent Englishmen on the progress of the National arms, and the complete vindication of the National policy, are accepted in the President's name by our Minister at St. James, because these congratulations establish the community of feeling which everywhere prevails among the friends of human freedom and the progress of mankind. Such addresses, however friendly, are not necessary to sustain the Government of the United States in the course it has marked out for itself. But they may fairly be accepted as a counterpoise to British opinion which has been so sedulously manufactured in the interest of the rebels for the past four years, Doubtless, the rebel organs here would prefer more peace addresses to an address like that presented to Mr. ADAMS. Their indignation is natural.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR MINISTER IN ENGLAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR MINISTER IN ENGLAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e036f973-c8b8-5ace-848a-58f292965fa5,417,nyt://article/e036f973-c8b8-5ace-848a-58f292965fa5

Its first issue came out on Saturday last, and its success in every respent was proved at once. The lighter topics in literature, in art, especially in music, and in theatrical gossip and general affairs, are treated with ability and vivacity. It gives evidence that there is abundant talent in this city for the conduct of a journal of its cast, as we are sure there is a sufficiently large community of the right kind to give it a handsome support. We have said this is the first issue of the journal, but the Weekly Review is really a continuation, in a new form and character, of the old and popular Musical Review. In giving the latter greater scope and making it of wider interest as an organ of general literature, it will by no means lose sight of its old speciality of music, as is shown in the present issue. We hope this will supply the want that has long existed in New-York for a literary journal, and that by its high tone and character it will merit the support it is sure to receive. Mr. C.B.

The Pressing,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/09/archives/the-bankrupt-bill.html,The Pressing,"-- The Bankrupt Bill is still before the Judiciary Committe of the Senate. There are but little more than seven weeks remaining to the present Congress, to finish up the business it has on hand. It would be too much to expect that in all the details of the Bankrupt Bill passed by the House, the Senate should entirely agree. The measure, therefore, may be expected to be thrown back for revision, either in the House or in a Conference Committee of both Houses. In view of this, is it too much to hope from the Senate promptness of action in the preliminary steps it has to take before the measure comes up again for open debate? There are few questions so really pressing, so entirely practical, so universally regarded with interest. It will be a most serious discouragement if it is not brought to a final solution before Congress closes its labors.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BANKRUPT BILL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BANKRUPT BILL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d3844b8b-9323-54d7-8a23-a5914de6fb29,153,nyt://article/d3844b8b-9323-54d7-8a23-a5914de6fb29

This process has been begun, and partly accomplished, by SHERMAN's victorious march through Georgia. But it will be far more apparent in what is to follow, if SHERMAN pursues his course, with the military sagacity which has heretofore guided him. His march on the single line of railroad through Branchville, (at any point on it which he may select,) his march on the railroads of North Carolina, and thence on the Roanoke, (at Danville,) utterly destroying all communication between LEE and his supports, are matters of course, unless the rebels can throw an army across his path stronger than that of LEE.

Quotas Under Call not to be Reduced by Credits,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/09/archives/the-chances-for-a-draft-important-order-respecting-quotas-300000.html,Quotas Under Call not to be Reduced by Credits,"Gen. HAYS has received instructions from Washington not to fix the quotas of sub-districts in accordance with the order issued by Provost-Marshal General FRY, already published, and has been directed to report to the Department all the enlistments up to the 31st day of December. The object of this call for information is probably to arrange new quotas on the basis of the enlistments up to that date. It will be seen, by the order printed elsewhere, that the Government intends to have 300,000 men in the field as the proceeds of the last call in addition to all credits heretofore allowed. No credits will be allowed for officers or invalids, or men enlisted in the navy upon papers, and assigned previous to the 19th day of December, or for anything but able-bodied enlistedmen -- a very judicious determination on the part of the Government. The contemplated change in the quotas, it is to be hoped, will not deprive New-York of any of the credits which have been so justly awarded to her. Supervisor BLUNT went to Washington last night to see that the interests of the county are protected, and to make the proper representations to the Department. In view of this new order from the Department, and the uncertain position of districts, it will be well for every man who can spare the amount necessary for a substitute, to deposit the money for that purpose at once with the Volunteer Committee. There are now plenty of substitutes offering, and no substitute money in the hands of the committee.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHANCES FOR A DRAFT.; Important Order Respecting Quotas 300,000 Men Actually to take the Field Under the Last Call Slow Progress of Recruiting, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHANCES FOR A DRAFT.; Important Order Respecting Quotas 300,000 Men Actually to take the Field Under the Last Call Slow Progress of Recruiting, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f806a3fc-a2c3-54ba-b6c1-326fb087a74c,539,nyt://article/f806a3fc-a2c3-54ba-b6c1-326fb087a74c

The rebels are now as much puzzled in regard to the nature and direction of the next campaign of SHERMAN as they were about his last campaign at the time of its inauguration and during its progress. They know that it must be eastward and northward, as there is no enemy in the whole region west of the Savannah worthy of his attention. But is he going to strike first for Augusta, or for Branchville, or for Charleston? Or, will he adopt his Georgia policy and move his forces so as to appear to be striking for several places in one direction, while his real objective is another place in a different direction? It will be as hard for the rebels to find out as it would be for us to tell; but as the Unionist dispatches from Savannah a few days since announced that ""SHERMAN's army was being rapidly reorganized and reequipped, preparatory to the commencement of a campaign as remarkable as its last,"" and, as the rebel dispatches are already beginning to report movements on SHERMAN's part, of a singularly incomprehensible character, we think it not unlikely that before the close of the present month, they will find out the whole secret of his puzzling plans.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sherman and Thomas The New Campaigns in the Cotton States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sherman and Thomas The New Campaigns in the Cotton States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f90cef1a-4a92-50f8-854e-3a249d1b70c6,526,nyt://article/f90cef1a-4a92-50f8-854e-3a249d1b70c6

"The late collission in the Bergen Tunnel has revived the uneasiness felt by those compelled to travel over the Morris and Essex Railroad at the alleged lack of proper vigilance to guard against accidents, and yesterday morning a meeting of passengers, presided over by Mr. W.J. BEEBE, was improvised on board the ferry-boat Hoboken, as she was making her trip to this side the river. After brief and spirited speeches a committee of five commuters was appointed to take the matter in charge, and to urge upon the managers of the road the necessity of immediately adopting certain precautions. The manner in which the ferry-boats have frequently been over-crowded has lately given rise to considerable excitement. A committee of passengers appointed to remonstrate against this abuse, waiated upon the Superintendent of the Ferry a short time ago, and were answered that the matter should be looked after and that teams should not be allowed to trespass upon the space set apart for passengers. A few mornings since, however, upon the deck hands of the ferry-boat attempting to override this pledge, the passengers took the business into their own hands, and as they were armed with umbrellas, presented such a serried array to the teams as they attempted to pass on board the boat, turn they easily and effectually repelled their advance. The occurrence caused quite a stir, although it has not effectually remedied the evil complained of. A larger number of boats, that more frequent trips may be made, are imperatively demanded by the increased travel which the change of the terminus of the Morris and Essex Railroad to Hoboken has thrown upon this ferry. Then two ferrymasters should be regularly detailed to attend the gates during those hours of the day when the largest number of passengers are crossing, as individuals are frequently belated in consequence of the inability of one ferrymaster to take the tickets.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/10/archives/the-morris-and-essex-railroad.html,,"The late collission in the Bergen Tunnel has revived the uneasiness felt by those compelled to travel over the Morris and Essex Railroad at the alleged lack of proper vigilance to guard against accidents, and yesterday morning a meeting of passengers, presided over by Mr. W.J.

A few mornings since, however, upon the deck hands of the ferry-boat attempting to override this pledge, the passengers took the business into their own hands, and as they were armed with umbrellas, presented such a serried array to the teams as they attempted to pass on board the boat, turn they easily and effectually repelled their advance. The occurrence caused quite a stir, although it has not effectually remedied the evil complained of. A larger number of boats, that more frequent trips may be made, are imperatively demanded by the increased travel which the change of the terminus of the Morris and Essex Railroad to Hoboken has thrown upon this ferry. Then two ferrymasters should be regularly detailed to attend the gates during those hours of the day when the largest number of passengers are crossing, as individuals are frequently belated in consequence of the inability of one ferrymaster to take the tickets.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Morris and Essex Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Morris and Essex Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/882c9123-b1fd-5817-bd68-535a62a83b17,317,nyt://article/882c9123-b1fd-5817-bd68-535a62a83b17

"George Opdyke vs. Thurlow Weed. At the opening of the court, yesterday morning, Mr. Evarts, before resuming his consideration of the topics which he was examining at the adjournment on Friday.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/10/archives/the-opdykeweed-libel-suit-supreme-court-trial-term-before-judge.html,,"George Opdyke vs. Thurlow Weed. -- At the opening of the court, yesterday morning, Mr. Evarts, before resuming his consideration of the topics which he was examining at the adjournment on Friday, made some suggestions as to the legal rule governing the claims of parties against the city for property destroyed by ricters. The claim of the owners of the armory, destroyed on 13th July, 1863, against the City of New-York, was based on the statute of 1855; and the measure of such claim is the actual value of the specific property destroyed at the time of its destruction, and in its mere quality as property, without any allowance for use and enjoyment, or for gains expected or accruing. The relation of the county is that of an insurer or indemnator. (2d Philipe, p. 58, citing Laurent vs. Chatham Ins. Co., 1 Hall, 41.) Addressing the jury, Mr. Evarts resumed his consideration of the ""Gun Claim"" against the city, and passed to the machinery and tools. There were no difficulties in presenting a complete account of the tools and machinery, the material and the articles in an unfinished state; for these elements had to be considered in making up the claim in its present shape. The proper way was to set down the schedule of machinery and tools, and giving its value as it stood at the time of its destruction. Setting down the articles at their value, they would then come to the portion of the carbines which had a fixed price, then the labor expended, and thus the claim would have been made distinct and clear, beyond the material and labor, of over $20,000 for petantee's fees on arms that had never been completed, and also the profits expected on future construction of the guns. But how does the claim for machinery and tools appear to have been made? The principle and result, us exhibited in the schedules, was not to give values, but, dollar for dollar, all that had been expended by the capitalists and speculators on the subjects contained in the schedules. In the statement of the claim before the Board of Supervisors there was no suggestion that the cost of 1,050 guns delivered to the Government was not included. An opportunity of explanation was offered to Mr. Farley and Mr. Opdyke, and they failed to give it. All the expenditures were considered at the cost of making the 6,000 guns, and in that view there was an absolute suppression and exaggeration of the claim by what appeared in the general expenditures and outlay as attributable to the 1,050 carbines being carried to swell the cost of the 6,000. Suppose certain machines had been sold, would it not have been dishonest not to have deducted the product of their secondary sale? The $185,000 should have had a reduction by the $15,000 received from the Government, but which being balanced in the cash-book does not appear as a reduction. Counsel adverted to the attempted impeachment of Mr. Stover. Of course it would not have been attempted had his testimony been unimportant. But the witnesses who were brought to impeach him were not much acquainted with him, and the attempted impeachment was a failure, Mr. Gibbs said that in the claim as presented, to the Board of Supervisors there was a large swindle. Was there not an artifice in the presentation of that claim? It was a deliberate artifice on the confession of the plaintiff. All the sums put in were put in as cost and not profit. There was not a lisp of the money got from the United States Government, nor of the portion that was to go to the patentees, nor of the profit to the owners. And when the claim was paid the patentee was kept out of his portion on the principle of ""equity."" The testimony before the Board of Supervisors was taken down, read over to the witnesses, and by them signed, and now the plaintiff wanted you to read it all backward with this and that interpolated. Mr. Weed based his allegations upon the testimony as it was rendered, and for so doing he was held for accountability at this tribunal. The question was, had injustice been done by the defendant to the plaintiff, by the narratives which appeared in the public prints? The evidence showed that Mr. Weed was the assailed party, and that he undertook to unmask his assailants, among whom was the plaintiff. And from testimony drawn from the friends, employes and dependents of Mr. Opdyke, the facts upon which the charges rested, had been abundantly shown. The plaintiff had overlooked the fact of his public relations. He had put himself on the level of Farley, McNeil and Jones in the gun contract, and treated himself as under no obligation of strict official duty, of honor, of dignity, of public spirit, of public character, toward this community. So, likewise, in regard to the Mariposa matter; Mr. Opdyke had treated himself as a private individual, and not in his assumed position of devotion to the public interests and the public good. So, too, in regard to the Surveyorship; he put himself on the level of the common plotters to secure office by means of money, political management and strategy. He never had been a subject of comment by the defendant, except in the light of his public relations, and of his ostentatious and paraded claim that he had no connection with these kinds of pursuits since he became a public man. And what was his justification? That he was not a thief, a robber, a forger, an escaped felon? If a man displays himself for admiration, he must run the risk of admiration. If he is afraid of the glare of the footlights, let him shoot the pit. Diogenes sought for an honest man with a lantern. We, in our joy at the discovery, have place two lanterns at the doors of our Mayors, and Fernando Wood and George Opdyke are the latest illustrations of our success. [Laughter.] They come, one after the other, from opposite parties, so that we can feel no disappointment of party feeling. We made them, and we must stand by them and share their fate. How much came from placing rich men in office? Principle, character, moderation, self-control, are the test whether a man be rich or poor. Many a poor man has remained poor because he has been shifting, vascillating, and either actually dishonest, or so near it that be never was trusted. These evil habits are quite as likely to grow upon what they feed upon as to become eager from abstinence. It was out of a crowded harem that King David desired Uriah's wife. This case is already decided. The evidenee has been impartially displayed by the press and promulgated all over the land. The question is not so much what the evidence or conclusion is, but whether you and I, and all of us have virtue enough of our own to put a true standard of measurement upon this transaction. We have a maxim in our law that when the guilty escapes, the tribunal that tries him is convicted. So it will be with us to-day. It is the measure of our judgment that is asked for. You have that issue in your hands. You have the keeping of the public fame, public character and public safety. Now, if you like this kind of public men, or public conduct, and think that evil has been done to this community by the comments and denunciation of the defendant, clothe the plaintiff, is he asks you, in the purple and fine linen of your applauding judgment, put the golden chain of your favorable verdict about his neck, carry him from this court-room on your Ajax shoulders, blow your sychophantic trumpets for him, and proclaim, until it shall ring through the land, as my friends say, ""Thus shall it be done to the man that the people delight to honor.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE OPDYKE-WEED LIBEL SUIT.; Supreme Court Trial Term.

Other testimony showed that the engineer threw a pailful of water into the furnace with a view of quenching the flames, and that the explosion followed.

"A meeting of the members of the Produce Exchange was held yesterday afternoon, at 1 o'clock, at the Exchange Building, to take action in reference to the relief of the suffering citizens of Savannah. Mr. GEORGE D. CRAGIN, President of the Exchange, presided, and introduced Col. JULIAN ALLEN, who said it gave him great pleasure to find that the people of the North were so ready to respond to the call in aid of the destitute of Savannah. He believed the people of Savannah were worthy of all the sympathy that had been expressed for them, and he was glad to know that something of a substantial character was about to be added for the relief of their wants. He did not come to beg for the citizens of Savannah. He had been sent on a far different mission. Anything given willingly and unasked for, to the poor and suffering, was a noble charity. It did his heart good to find the North taking this view of the matter. The people of Savannah, as a general thing, were loyal; but if only a few of them were true to the Union, the case was not altered. It was better that ten guilty rebels should be fed than one loyal man die of starvation. The enemy had left the people of Savannah in an exceedingly destitute condition. When, as has been remarked, Gen. SHERMAN found himself accidentally in the city and Gen. HARDEE accidentally out of the city, the people had nothing to eat. The speaker believed that the Union sentiment was not confined to Savannah, but extended throughout the State. He spoke of the meeting of citizens after the occupation of the city by Gen. SHERMAN, and said that hearty cheers were given for the Union and the President of the United States. It must not be thought, because many of the former residents of Savannah were in the rebel ranks, that the people were not at heart loyal. Those who were in JEFF. DAVIS' army were conscripts, and were compelled to fight under the rebel flag. Col. ALLEN concluded with an eloquent appeal to the citizens of New-York to send immediate relief to the destitute of Savannah. The Chairman said a letter had been received from the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, which had been answered by the officers of the Exchange.

LEEMAN, from Ragged Island, Dec. 27, with salt to BRETT, SON & CO., arrived yesterday morning. On the 4th Inst., in lat. 32° long. 73°, she picked up one bale of cotton. No date, lat. 30° 42′, long, 72° 55′, she spoke schooner J. Smith, ORLANDO, from Fortress Monroe for Wilmington, with sails split and loss of foreboom; supplied her with twine. On the 8th inst., lat 38° long. 74°, about 3 A.M., the Captain reports that his attention was attracted by calls from the water. He lay to and lowered a boat, and after some searching discovered a piece of hurricane deck, part of a wreck, floating upon which was a man named ALBERT L. BAYDON. BAYDON stated that he had taken passage on board of one of WHITNEY & HATHAWAY's steamers, the Melville, which sailed from New-York on the 5th inst., bound to Hilton Head, and had encountered heavy southwest winds, with a heavy sea, until the 7th, when at about 9 P.M. the steamer's bows were stove in by the sea. The captain ordered a boat lowered, when he, the chief engineer, the first cook and one seaman, with several others, were swamped in it. The passengers, by bailing with buckets, were enabled to keep the vessel afloat until about 11 o'clock the next day. (Sunday morning,) when the remaining boat was lowered -- a metalic life-boat -- but before we could get the lady passengers into it, the Melville went down, port bow first, upsetting the life-boat. There was a vessel in sight from about 12 o'clock at night, which was seen often until we foundered, when she was seen no more. I saw a great many perish, and many clinging to pieces of the wreck. I was in company with the life-boat, and within hailing distance of her until about sunset. She was then free of water, and had only three persons in her -- I think two men and one lady; they answered my call, but kept clear of me. We were in sight of portions of the wreck until sunset. The boats' crew made no efforts to save any who were still clinging to the wreck. We even burned our mail, consisting of three newspaper bags and one letter bag, with all the matrasses and every combustible thing on board, to signalize the vessel in sight. We had about sixty-five passengers, five of them ladies, and about sixteen officers and crew.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AWFUL MARINE DISASTER.; Foundering of the Port Royal, S.C., Steam Packet Melville.

If DAVIS has any prominent characteristics, they are self-possession, determination, energy -- a self-possession not to be affected by any event or circumstance, or course of events or combination of circumstances -- a determination which will scruple at nothing whatever to compass its ends -- an energy remorseless and unflagging, capable of executing, under any circumstances, whatsoever is dictated by necessity or his judgment. In the greatest stress of fortune, he has never given any sign of the least yielding; and, whoever among the rebels might at any moment be discouraged, he has always stood imperious and firm, hurling maledictions and defiance, and backing up his most desperately ferocious words by still more fiendishly ferocious deeds. He has had concentrated in his hands all the power that exists in the South; and over and again has he sworn that to the end, and to the last extremity, would he use all that power for the accomplishment of the purposes for which this great rebellion was projected, and has been for four years prosecuted.

For he assured them that, if the system of election had been in vogue, it was highly probable that not a man of them would have been chosen. The natives of the metropolis of fashion and civilization had been weighed in the balance and [???]ound wanting. It had been demonstrated that they did not possess intellect, or acumen, or discernment enough to select proper municipal representatives. Nay, they could not even appreciate the merits of those whom their Sovereign had been graciously pleased to choose for them. But this was not to be wondered at. The Parisians are, in fact, not Parisians. The capital of the Second Empire, according to M. KAUSSMAN, has no ""large permanent population.""

A Glimpse of; Davis calls a miserable scoundrel; elected Senator from Arkansas","There is no man associated with the Confederate cause in whom the Southern people have so great confidence, as Gen. LEE. Yet, of all the Southern leaders, he is the most taciturn. The attitude of silence which he has maintained has been a serious habit, and not a bare theatrical assumption, as in the case of weaker men. Even the position which he holds to-day, is not one for which he has striven, or which, having obtained, he consciously assumes, as more ambitious men would have done; and he has shown none of that calculating sagacity which awaits opportunity for self-advancement. It can scarcely be denied that, from the first, his counsel has been often overborne even in the adjustment of policies, where his judgment ought to have been commanding; but he has never exclaimed at the reverses which have followed upon the mistakes of those higher in authority. He has not shown irritation, nor thrown up his commission. He has not, like DAVIS and LETCHER, and TOOMBS, and BEAUREGARD bristled with manifestoes. As a military man, he has not been prodigal of promises, and his dispatches have been decent. Like all the rest, he has been a traitor; but the venom and fanaticism of their treason has not been exhibited in his career. In a bad and ruinous cause, he has yet shown himself simply a soldier.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Glimpse of Gen.

The committees appointed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Produce Exchange have been exceedingly successful in obtaining large subscriptions, most willingly made, from our merchants and business men generally. Already the hold of the Rebecca Clyde is nearly filled with provisions, and when she sails, which will probably be as early as Tuesday next, she will take out not less than 1,700 barrels of flour, beside an assorted cargo of that meats, beans, bread and not a few luxuries.

ALLEN seems to be endeavoring to outvie the committees in his efforts to promote the good work. The Government has placed under his control the steam-transport Daniel Webster, and up to yesterday he had purchased on his own account $40,000 worth of provisions. The Colonel is also receiving donations dally, and the indications are that the Daniel Webster will be ready for sea nearly, if not quite, as soon as the Clyde. Many of our citizens, too modest to have their names brought prominently before the public, have liberally contributed money anonymously, and letters inclosing greenbacks signed ""A Friend,"" ""Cash,"" &c., are not infrequently received.

and Northern Retaliation,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/16/archives/highly-improbable.html,and Northern Retaliation,"-- A telegraphic dispatch from Washington ascribes to the President the threat that, if the rebel authorities ""harm"" their fugitive Member of Congress, H.S. FOOTE, he will retaliate upon ""five of the most distinguished rebel prisoners in our hands."" This strikes us as simply absurd. What have we to do with FOOTE, any more than with any other adherent of the rebel Government? True, he has become disgusted with secession, and was trying to secure his personal safety by escaping within our lines. But that gives him no more claim upon us than any other deserter has, and we certainly do not threaten ""retaliation"" for punishments the rebels inflict upon their soldiers for attempted desertion. It is unfortunate for Mr. FOOTE that he can't get away; but he could easily have avoided that difficulty by never joining the rebels. Having done so, he must stand the consequences. Neither the President nor anybody else in authority, we venture to say, has ever made the remark ascribed to him. If Mr. FOOTE succeeds in reaching Washington, he will probably find himself under arrest, as one of the active and responsible leaders in the rebel cause, though he may doubtless count safely on the Executive clemency.

"Edward, Death of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/16/archives/death-of-edward-everett.html,"Edward, Death of","We are startled this morning by the announcement of the sudden death of EDWARD EVERETT. He died of apoplexy yesterday morning, at his residence in Boston. Mr. EVERETT has latterly held no public position, but his death will create as much deep and respectful regret as if he had held the highest office in the land. His accomplishment as a scholar, his eloquence as an orator, his public services as a patriot and his personal qualities as a man, have commanded for him the universal respect and esteem of his countrymen. No young man ever entered more brilliantly or with more deserved applause than he upon the public career which was so long and so honorable -- nor were the promises of youth ever more completely fulfilled than in his instance. Mr. EVERETT was almost the last of the great orators of this country. He had cultivated eloquence as an art. Everything he said, whether the occasion was great or trivial, was the best, and was said in the best style and manner, which the most careful and conscientious preparation could devise. All the resources of his splendid scholarship were made tributary to the completeness and effect of his public speeches. Some of his orations will stand permanently as the very best productions of American eloquence, not merely in a single department, but on all the various topics, of which he seemed to be equally master; and all his writings are characterized by eminent clearness and purity of style, and the utmost grace and felicity of language. But Mr. EVERETT's strongest claim upon the affectionate gratitude of the American people, lies in the complete and absolute consecration of the last years of his life to the cause of his country. Previous to the outbreak of the rebellion, foreseeing its imminence, and despairing of the ability of any party or political successes to avert it, he devoted himself, with all his heart and strength, to a systematic appeal to the patriotism of the people, as embodied in their love for the memory of WASHINGTON; and from the moment the existence of the Government was threatened by armed insurrection, he brought every faculty of his mind, and every energy of his soul to its defence. With a degree of laborious industry which find few parallels, he has used his voice and his pen upon every opportune occasion, and with eminent ability, in support of the Government, and in aid of every movement to increase its energy, or supply the necessities and relieve the sufferings of those engaged in its defence. It would not be easy to name any man to whose labors, within his proper sphere, the country is more largely indebted than to Mr. EVERETT. He has spent a long and laborious life in the service of the public; he had reached a ripe age before his labors were interrupted, and his memory will be held in lasting honor by his grateful countrymen.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Edward Everett.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Edward Everett.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/df057a66-1d07-5358-8fb7-453258dcf292,492,nyt://article/df057a66-1d07-5358-8fb7-453258dcf292

THOMAS CHURCH BROWNELL, D.D.LL.D., who departed this life at his residence in Hartford, on Friday morning at 5 o'clock, in the 80th year of his age, was born at Little Compton, R.I., in 1779. He graduated at Union College, Schenectady, N.Y., in which college he was for a time afterward Professor of Chemistry and Natural History. He made on foot, while a young man, what is known as ""the tour of Europe."" Returning home he became a Presbyterian clergyman, which position he occupied until he was nearly forty years of age. In 1817 he was made a Deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in the following year was made a Priest. In 1819 he was consecrated Bishop and was supposed to be the oldest Protestant Bishop in the world. He has been the presiding Bishop of the United States for the last ten years. He was Bishop of the Connecticut Diocese up to the date of his death, although, on account of having broken his leg some ten years age, which disabled him from active service, he has not discharged the active duties of the office since that accident happened. During his life he was prominently connected with several important institutions in the State. For many years past he has been President of the Insane Retreat. Trinity College numbers him among its founders. From the time of the establishment of the college, in 1823, to the year 1831, he was its President, and to the time of his death was its Chancellor. He was also active in founding the Connecticut Historical Society. Bishop HOPKINS, of Vermont, being the oldest Bishop surviving, will become the successor of Bishop BROWNELL as presiding Bishop of the United States, and Assistant Bishop JOHN WILLIAMS will succeed him as Bishop of the Diocese of Connecticut.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; THE LATE BISHOP BROWNELL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.; THE LATE BISHOP BROWNELL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe210909-9234-59ff-84ea-e30e1bcbceb0,304,nyt://article/fe210909-9234-59ff-84ea-e30e1bcbceb0

KAVANAGH achieved the championship at the great National Tournament, in June, 1863, when he encountered seven of the most expert players in this country, and was successful in every game save one. Since that occasion he has maintained his supremacy in four single contests, the present being the fifth attempt to wrest the honors from his grasp. He is well known as one of the most brilliant living demonstrators of the game of billiards. COLDTHWAITE has, for some time past, been looked upon as a successful rival to KAVANAGH, his manipulations in the specialty being equally remarkable. At a contest between these parties in June list. COLDTHWAITE maintained a large advantage until near the close of the game, when he seemed to become enervated, and KAVANAGH, by his superior physique, was enabled to secure the victory by seventy-eight points in a score of fifteen hundred. Although the contest was nearly equal on that occasion, the friends of KAVANAGH still have unlimited confidence in his ability to vanquish GOLDTHWAITE, or any other player at the American game; and for the match of Friday evening, offer any reasonable amount at an odds of $100 to $75; yet, even at this difference there is little speculation.

In the case of FRIARY, brought up for trial yesterday for the murder of LAZARUS, the District Attorney so strenuously and successfully resisted an application for delay, that the prisoner's counsel were obliged to obtain it for their client by the unusual method of throwing up their briefs and withdrawing from the case. The court seconded the District-Attorney by promptly assigning other counsel and ordering the trial to proceed to-day. Let such examples be followed.

We presume also, as a general principle, that the proposed inquest has the approval of the Executive. We have found at least in two very recent instances of a notable kind, that in the matter of the suspension or abrogation of important conventions between Great Britain and the United States, there has been perfect accord between the Executive and both houses of Congress. The appearance of rebel pirates on the lakes has compelled us to terminate the convention by which both Powers were prevented from maintaining naval armaments thereon. The questionable neutrality of the British colonial authorities -- quite as much as the inequitable operation of the Convention of 1854 -- has determined the fate of the Reciprocity Treaty. The revival of the passport system belongs logically to the same train of events.

The Rumors of; Army must be Defeated before Peace,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/17/archives/the-rumors-of-peace.html,The Rumors of; Army must be Defeated before Peace,"We reiterate the conviction we have already expressed, that the reports of attempted or intended negotiations for peace, which are so diligently pressed upon public notice, are utterly without foundation. We see nothing here or at Washington to give them the slightest claim to the slightest credit.

"The news of the capture of Fort Fisher, given officially and in detail this morning, following so closely on the heels of the late failure, will surprise and delight the country. It was accomplished on Sunday afternoon and evening, by a joint assault of the army and navy after the fort had been subject to a furious bombardment of two days by Admiral PORTER's fleet. The assault was protracted in its character, the fighting lasting from 3 P.M. to 10 P.M. before the entire defences were finally secured. The entire garrison, 2,500 strong, were captured, including Gen. WHITING and Col. LAMB, two leading officers, who were both wounded.

The great commerce in war materials, in general supplies and in cotton that they have carried on there, has been for nearly two years as their very lif-eblood. The port was found to be impossible of blockade by a naval force; and the rebels, with the aid of their English friends, have taken the utmost advantage of this circumstance, by keeping lines of fast steamers running perpetually between there and British and West India ports. The Southern correspondent of the London Times lately gave us a glimpse of this great traffic, and asserted that the fall of Wilmington would be the heaviest blow that could now be dealt to the Southern Confederacy. The rebels have said so much to this effect that they cannot possibly now belittle their loss.

Cotton Stored at; Cotton at Savannah and Wilmington,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/18/archives/cotton-at-savannah-and-wilmington.html,Cotton Stored at; Cotton at Savannah and Wilmington,"There was at first some considerable doubt in this city as to the accuracy of the official report that at the capture of Savannah we had come into possession of thirty-three thousand bales of cotton. But since the matter has been looked into, at Savannah, there is reason to believe that the official estimate was much below instead of above the mark. The Boston Traveller gives the statement of a wealthy and enterpising merchant, of that city, who has just arrived from Gen. SHERMAN's Department. He fully confirms the report of the immense quantities of cotton found in the city, and says that not only are the storehouses filled, but in many private places bales of cotton are concealed. In the seaboard region, south of the city, also, as far as the Altamaha, where Kilpatrick's cavalry lately operated, large quantities of cotton were seen; and as the railroad was destroyed as far as that river, and no rebel troops are there, the cotton will doubtless quickly find itself within our lines. As Wilmington has been the great export city for cotton for the last two years, we may possibly get a large haul when it falls into our hands one of these fine days.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'COTTON AT SAVANNAH AND WILMINGTON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'COTTON AT SAVANNAH AND WILMINGTON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SAVANNAH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c2be72e1-ed33-5fbc-ad89-c148a2542886,204,nyt://article/c2be72e1-ed33-5fbc-ad89-c148a2542886

Even the stupidest private soldiers in the rebel ranks are now beginning to see that the cause for which they have fought so long, and suffered so much hardship, and swallowed so many lies, is an absolutely hopeless cause. A thousand places we have taken, which, up to the moment of their capture, the rebel leaders persisted in declaring we could never take. In a hundred battles we have not only won the victories, but reaped their fruits, while the rebel papers indulged in frothy talk of our defeat. Vast tracts of country we have seized, and hold irrevocably, which the rebels declared we could never either hold or cover. Nearly all the large cities of the South are in our peaceable possession, though it was again and again declared, on behalf of their citizens, that they would perish before submitting to our flag.

Millspaugh vs Adams; Divorce Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/19/archives/law-reports-a-naval-case-of-criminal-conversation-the-validity-of.html,Millspaugh vs Adams; Divorce Case,"Andrew J. Millspaugh vs. Seth Adams. -- The plaintiff in this case is an importer doing business in this city, and brings this action to recover damages from the defendant for alleged criminal intercourse with his wife. The case, as stated in the opening of the counsel for the complainant, possesses peculiar features. It is alleged that in 1862 Mrs. Mary Millspaugh, the wife of the plaintiff, accompanied Seth Adams, the defendant, to the Town of Fort Wayne, in Indiana, and after remaining there a few days filed a bill of divorce against her husband on the ground of habitual drunkenness. In order to do this she was required by the laws of Indiana to swear that she had been for one year a bona file resident of that State. This she did, and having submitted testimony as to her husband's habits, the courts of the State granted her a divorce. Returning to this State she subsequently proceeded to Boston, Mass., and was there married to the defendant, Seth Adams. The plaintiff ignores this marriage, and claims that the defendant and Mary Millspaugh are now, and have been since the year 1862, living together in adulterous connection. The parties have resided at various hotels in this city, and are now living together at the Bancroft House. After opening the case, Mr. Fullerton, for the plaintiff, called the defendant as his first witness.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; A Naval Case of Criminal Conversation-- The Validity of Divorces Obtained in other States to be Tested.

It commends itself to public favor by its clear common sense and its practical character. It ignores entirely all the subtle theories by which the matter of reconstruction has been befogged and treats it in the most direct and practical manner. Georgia, as a State, he says, has never been out of the Union, and there is no necessity, therefore, to devise means for getting her back. Some of the people of Georgia have been and still are rebelling against the Government of the United States; and that Government is compelled to levy war against them to suppress that rebellion. But when this has been accomplished -- when the people lay down their arms and cease fighting, the war will stop, and things will go on, in all essential respects, just as they did before the war began. The war in its progress has made some very important changes in the affairs of Georgia as of other States. An immense amount of property has been destroyed, -thousands of their people have perished, slavery has been extirpated, and the whole structure of society has been shaken and shattered as by a convulsion. These things cannot be restored. Some of the losses may in time be repaired, but the internal condition of Southern society can never again be what it was before the war.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

New March of and previous Record,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/21/archives/shermans-new-march.html,New March of and previous Record,"Now that the knotty case of Wilmington may be considered as successfully settled, the eager attention of the whole country is di- rected to the new campaign of General SHERMAN, the first step in which has just been taken. We give an important letter this morning from the Department of the South, by which it will be seen that at the very moment when our army and navy appeared before Wilmington, and commenced the operations which resulted in the capture of Fort Fisher, SHERMAN's army was put in motion -- the right wing marching upon the Charleston Railroad, where it quickly achieved a handsome and most valuable victory at Pocotaligo, and the left wing moving almost simultaneously from Savannah, on a line which the enemy may possibly ascertain for himself. The enthusiastic spirit with which this veteran army moves, and the confidence in its own prowess and invincibility with which it is possessed, may be judged by the letter of our correspondent. The skillful veteran soldier who leads this army -- of whom the Lieutenant-General says that the ""world's history gives no record of his superiors, and shows few equals"" -- is possessed of the same heroic spirit and invincible resolution as his troops; and he is as proud of them as they are of him. He has fought and marched all over the Southwest, during the last four years, from the day on which his abilities shone forth at Shiloh, onward through his two Vicksburgh campaigns -- his great march across Mississippi -- his subsequent marvelous march from Memphis to Chattanooga, or rather to Knoxville, engaging in a great battle on his way -- his Atlanta campaign, with its twenty battles -- his late march across Georgia, ending in McAllister and Savannah; -- and when a soldier with this vast experience declares that he can carry his army anywhere through the Southern States, he speaks according to the record. Though this is the case, we have the best reasons for believing that Gen. SHERMAN does not commence his new campaign without exhibiting a due appreciation of its conditions, its difficulties and its necessities. The fact that the Lieutenant-General has sent him reinforcements from the West, has been published in every newspaper on the continent; and if the South Carolina rebels can draw any consolation or strength of spirit from the fact, they will doubtless draw it. SHERMAN, too, as appears from the news, has begun his movement very cautiously and adroitly; and the rebels are doubtless as much puzzled now to learn whether his first objective will be Augusta, Branchville or Charleston, as on his leaving Atlanta in November, they were puzzled to discover whether his objective was Lynchburgh or Beaufort or Pensacola. We may also repeat a remark we made a few days since, that our success at Wilmington greatly simplifies his new campaign, be furnishing him, as it were, a halfway house on his onward march.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Sherman's New March."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Sherman's New March."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/16fe049b-aa71-5bf9-bf57-ae0602cd2770,645,nyt://article/16fe049b-aa71-5bf9-bf57-ae0602cd2770

This was the most important station on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, and heretofore has been defended by the rebels with great vigor. Reliable information places the main body of the rebels at Ashepoo, a station on the railroad thirty miles south of Charleston, where it is supposed they will endeavor to make a firm stand. At the date of our correspondent's letter, the left wing of Gen. SHERMAN's army was moving from Savannah; and it may be considered certain that the rebels have no force sufficient in numbers to check his onward progress.

London Times Getting New Light,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/22/archives/the-london-times-getting-new-light.html,London Times Getting New Light,"The public will learn with great pleasure that President LINCOLN has formally disapproved the order of Gen. DIX with respect to the pursuit of the Confederatemarauders across the Canadian frontier, and that the order has been virtually recalled. Nothing less could have been expected from any Governmentwhich claims a place among civilized nations. To break with us by putting on us an insult like the violation of our territory, would be ungrateful and unjust, as well as imprudent. These considerations were so likely to prevail, that it is without surprise we learn that the hostile demonstrations of Gen. DIX have been rebuked. There is every reason to hope that this cause of difference between the two countries will soon pass away. Should there be any repetition of the acts which have led to it the Northern States will have just cause of complaint, and it is therefore satisfactory to learn that the Canadian Government and people were fully sensibleof the necessity of repressing such outrages. The exploit of the St. Albans raiders must not be repeated. Technical questions of jurisdiction must not be allowed to imperil the dearest interests of British America. Not only are the Canadians bound as neighbors and friends to prevent the egress of murderers and robbers from their territory but a due regard for the future of their own province, and of that great Confederation which it is their purpose to form, should cause them to use every effort in keeping the peace. They must always be closely connected with the Federal States, whatever may be the future polity of either nation. They have a large and increasing trade with the Union, their readiest means of communication with Europe is through Federal territory, and a misunderstanding will, at any time, inflict upon them incalculable evils. As long as this war lasts it is the duty of the Canadian Government to see that the American territory is not violated from their frontier. They have sufficient men for the purpose, and they cannot use them better than in preventing enterprises which may at any time cause a rupture. It is stated that the authorities intend to send thirty companies of volunteers at once to guard the frontier. If they do this and take measures for the restitution of the stolen property they will only have performed their duty, and shown the American Government that, while resolute to maintain their own independence and honor, they know what is due to a neighboring people:",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The London Times Getting New Light.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The London Times Getting New Light.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Times, Jan. 2', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Jan', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/493a63fe-c718-5420-a28c-f4cff308feed,1002,nyt://article/493a63fe-c718-5420-a28c-f4cff308feed

If any of our readers, not personally interested in this terrible question, will imagine his own brother, or son, or friend, gradually starving during twenty months -- the light of reason giving out under want of food, the influence of bad quarters, miasma and filth, subjected to brutal and cruel jailors, bodily strength failing, and life dying out in wretchedness and despair -- a man who might have been an honor to the nation thus slowly murdered by inches, and ending as a lunatic or idiot, his only crime that he had served his country -- he will appreciate the tide of indignation and wrath which is now slowly rising with irresistible power against these damnable wrongs in the hearts of our people. The conviction has taken fast hold of the public mind that this whole thing is a deliberate and devilish plot of the leaders of the Confederacy to force us to exchange an army of healthy and vigorous soldiers (made so by our humanity) for an equal number of these broken wrecks of manhood (made so by their cruelty.) The same cool system of murder seems to have been tried in South Carolina (where we had been led to expect more generosity,) as in Virginia, where we counted on nothing but cruelty and dishonor. The same close confinement, want of shelter, and deprivation of wood for fires or building, was enforced in Andersonville, where wood and space abounded, as in Richmond, where they might have been scant; the same scarcity of food in Georgia, where the land was overflowing with abundance,as in Virginia, where rations were short.

By the same Scheme of rebel confiscation, such commercial cities as Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore lost some eighteen or twenty millions each. The three last together probably sacrificed something over half as much as New-York. During last session of Congress the Philadelphia Board of Trade busied itself with petitions against the Bankrupt Bill, primarily on the ground that certain Philadelphia tradesmen would be unable, if it should become law, to collect their different accounts after the restoration of the Union. The same sort of petition came up on Tuesday in the Senate from the Boston Board of Trade. And the report says that the Board set forth that ""there is now due by the people of the revolted States to merchants of the North, between $150,000,000 and $200,000,000; that there has been no opportunity to press the claims for settlement in the local courts; and that, if the Bankrupt Bill should become law. the rights of these creditors would be seriously prejudiced.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Bankrupt Bill.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Bankrupt Bill.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'BOSTON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8673423-bb33-598b-acda-0ea774adcba6,659,nyt://article/c8673423-bb33-598b-acda-0ea774adcba6

It had hardly got itself erected, when the fire of our artillery and the force of our steel were brought to bear upon it. Wall after wall was brought low, pillar after pillar was tumbled into ruins, and, with the fall of each f[???]ll hosts of its builders and defenders. The aspect of it now, is one vast wreck and ruin, with but here and there a blackened column still standing.

The journal in question herein makes a needless effort to deceive its readers. There is no appeal to the English Courts or to the Privy Council, in criminal cases. There is not even coordinate jurisdiction between the English and Canadian Courts of Queen's Bench. This point was settled a few years ago in the case of a negro fugitive charged with felony. The decision of one of the Provincial Judges to surrender the criminal was attempted to be reversed by a writ of habeas corpus by the Lord Chief Justice of England. A conflict of authority was prevented solely by the reversal of the first decision in the Provincial Court of Appeal. The Sheriff of the county where the fugitive was in custody was, however, fully advised to disregard the order from the British court if the messenger put it in his hands. And during the ensuing session of the local Parliament, a law was passed which formally declared the non-existence of coordinate power between the British and Colonial courts in all matters of criminal jurisdiction.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTRADITION OF THE PIRATE BURLEIGH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EXTRADITION OF THE PIRATE BURLEIGH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/54f65ef2-91d5-5f18-b981-e93e468a2553,293,nyt://article/54f65ef2-91d5-5f18-b981-e93e468a2553

And probably the London journal that announces Capt. SHERARD OSBORN as the designated commander of the force, has quasi official authority for its statement. But there is great reason to question the report received yesterday as to the number of vessels and men detailed by the British Government for this new service. We doubt whether there are thirty gunboats in the British service of a class at all adaptable for lake service. The locks of the St. Lawrence canals are of ample length -- two hundred feet; but their width is only twenty-six feet, and their depth only ten, while the Welland locks are but one hundred and fifty feet in length, with dimensions otherwise the same as the St. Lawrence. We very much doubt whether there is now such a fleet of serviceable gunboats corresponding with these measurements, and also whether such a fleet could be ready by the opening of lake and river navigation. But the story otherwise is improbable. It comes through a rebel, or at least most unfriendly channel. And it is difficult to believe that the British Government, by commencing with so formidable an armament, would desire to enter into a competition with us in a naval enterprise which is solely and purely defensive -- and defensive not as against Great Britain or her colonies, but as against outlaws and pirates who find now, or may find hereafter, refuge on British territory.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval Armaments on the Lakes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naval Armaments on the Lakes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Lakes', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6713e64c-8515-59f4-bf04-88b6848aeaf5,501,nyt://article/6713e64c-8515-59f4-bf04-88b6848aeaf5

It is by a New-York artist -- L. HOPE -- who having formerly been a Captain of Volunteers, saw the pageant which he here transfers to an extensive canvas. It represents the Army of the Potomac (1862) at Cumberland Landing, on the Pamunky River, where for the only time in the history of the war 80 000 men were encamped on a single-field. The artist was detailed by Gen. Baldy SMITH and made a careful sketch of the spectacle, to the accuracy of which, many officers have borne willing testimony. The details of such a work are necessarily embarrassing. By the exercise of the rarest patience, Mr. HOPE has brought them before the eye in a remarkably vivid an I striking manner.

Rebels Last Ditch; Last Ditch; Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/24/archives/the-last-ditch.html,Rebels Last Ditch; Last Ditch; Richmond,"When the leaders of the rebellion plunged the country into war, the military problem was one of extraordinary difficulty for our Government. The area of rebeldom was so vast, that the occupation of the whole South, even if almost unopposed, would have required armies of enormous strength. A mere accidental collection of States, as yet lacking all moral and political unity, there was no one point in the South which could in any way be considered the key of the position, the possession of which would in any very material point lessen its prestige. It was then more important to attack the Armies of the South wherever found than to capture any one city or port. The progress of the war for nearly four years has very much changed this state of affairs. That which commenced as a mere agglomeration of slave States, banded together for purposes of defence, has ended by becoming a centralized despotism in which the question of destroying even the form of constitutionalism is now mooted; and with any man of less powerful character and prestige than JEFFERSON DAVIS at its head, the military dictatorship of LEE would have been consummated long before this.

During the year 1864, with an increased population of 80,000, they amount to 28,645, which is a nominal increase of 449 over the preceding year; and yet, when the increased population of the city is considered, there is no increase, but a diminution in the percentage of deaths, which is the more to be remarked when we consider the fact that such vast numbers of our brave soldiers, rendered ill and dying from wounds and exposure, return to their families in New-York to be cared for, die and are buried here, and form part of our general record of the mortality or our city.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The City Inspector's Annual Report.; STATISTICS OF MORTALITY, MARRIAGES AND BIRTHS--THE COST OF STREET-CLEANING."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The City Inspector's Annual Report.; STATISTICS OF MORTALITY, MARRIAGES AND BIRTHS--THE COST OF STREET-CLEANING."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b8a7cfa1-4320-5b6b-a86e-b1bc832198fa,738,nyt://article/b8a7cfa1-4320-5b6b-a86e-b1bc832198fa

He is now at Annapolis. He brought a number of those significant slips of paper, of all textures, colors and degrees of legibility, known so well to persons familiar with the Southern prisons and with the returned Union prisoners -- deaths, memoranda, messages, &c.

The floor was covered and the boxes filled with the prettiest and best dressed ladies and the most gallant and attentive gentlemen one might wich to see gathered together. Enjoyment was everywhere visible, and between the merry voices of the ladies, the singing of the birds, the delightful music of the bands, the magnificent dresses, the sparkling diamonds and the bright eyes of their fair owners, the Academy seemed to show a glimpse of fairy land, rather than a scene from real life.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Light Guard Ball.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Light Guard Ball.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e89892cf-48b0-5687-a40a-1abc536b5e93,408,nyt://article/e89892cf-48b0-5687-a40a-1abc536b5e93

"The enlistments by the County Volunteering Committee average only ten men a day. At the other recruiting stations in the city, not less than three hundred men are daily enlisted, most of whom are ""run"" into adjoining counties, or out of the State. This species of swindling is being carried on by a class of unscrupulous bounty-brokers, who not only rob the county of men, but rob the men after they get them out of the county. So intent has this matter become, that with military officials it has ceased to excite surprise. The recent issue of an order from the War Department, prohibiting the payment of bounties to soldiers (except the hand-money, $25,) until they are in the field, will probably effectually stop much swindling. In future, the sum of money a soldier is entitled to will be placed to his credit for the use of himself or family. In the City Hall Park, and on the Battery grounds, there are not more than three or four recruiting stations that place their men to the credit of the city. The rascality practiced by the swarm of bounty-swindlers who infest our public thoroughfares, and not unfrequently force men from the State, is becoming an intolerable nuisance. It has grown to be the case that an honest man having a substitute to enlist cannot approach either of the county recruiting stations with safety. This is particularly the case in Brooklyn, where a man if he be not a licensed broker must pay a hundred dollars to one of these individuals for the privilege of sending a substitute. There is a law which imposes a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars on any person found guilty of inducing men to leave the State and the hone is that it may be put in force. Most of the men enlisted by Supervisor BLUNT are intelligent and know their rights. There never have been any complaints concerning the men enlisted by the Volunteer Committee, and it is very rare that cases of desertion occur when men have been legitimately enlisted. As an evidence of the class of men supplied to the Government by bounty brokers, the circumstance of the arrival of ninety-three men at this port last week, by the steamship Great Western. may be mentioned.

Wilson's Bill; Conscription Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/25/archives/a-new-conscription-theory-a-new.html,Wilson's Bill; Conscription Bill,"conscription bill, which owes its parentage to Mr. WILSON, is before the Senate. Its most remarkable feature is, that it makes principals responsible for the desertion of their substitutes. This is an ingenious proposition, to say the least of it. We had supposed that the interest of the principal in his substitute ceased the moment the latter was accepted by the military agent of the Government. It has been generally presumed, at least, that a substitute, in the very nature of things, could not belong, at one and the same time, to the Government, and to the man who procured him for the Government, in lieu of personal service. Mr. WILSON proposes to change all this by a legislative provision, which is to make the substitute duplicate himself, so that while he surrenders his physical services to the Government, his body may be mortgaged to the citizen who invests in him. The principal, on common commercial grounds, can hardly be expected to resign all control over the person of a substitute, and yet stand responsible at the same time for said substitute's being found ready to answer the muster call every day in the year for the whole term of service. Giving the military authorities absolute control of him is simply imposing upon the military authorities the same responsibility they charge themselves with now -- that of seeing that men who are accepted for the service shall not desert. We hardly see how Senator WILSON's device is to work.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NEW CONSCRIPTION THEORY.

"Thomas' and Terry's Campaigns; the, in the South",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/26/archives/the-aspects-in-the-south.html,"Thomas' and Terry's Campaigns; the, in the South","The strong confidence which has lately sprung up in the public mind, not only of the ultimate success of the Union cause, but of the final and glorious triumph of our arms within a reasonable time, continues to be justified. This confidence is not based upon any one victory or its results, nor is it based alone and exclusively upon field victories. Nothing, indeed, could be more inspiriting and grand than the three campaigns of the last three months, under SHERMAN, THOMAS and TERRY; and nothing could he more hopeful of important and decisive military results than the new campaign of SHERMAN, which has already begun, and the other great movements which are on the eve of execution under the eye of the Lieutenant-General. The chief value of THOMAS' victory was in reducing the rebel military power in the Southwest to such a feeble condition that he not only leaves it powerless for offence in the future anywhere, but that. on the other hand, he can either sweep southward through Alabama and Mississippi, and, by seizing upon the remaining strategic positions and railroads, reduce the war in the Southwest to the guerrilla stage which will probably for a brief time precede its final close; or, on the other hand, he can furnish from his army large reinforcements to the main armies operating on the Atlantic seaboard. It would not be surprising, indeed, considering the present aspect of affairs, if the veteran army of Gen. THOMAS, instead of spending its entire energies this Winter in a campaign to Mobile, were to furnish heavy detachments of troops to be concentrated with the two great armies (GRANT's and SHERMAN's) which may now be said to be conjointly operating against Richmond. This view is confirmed by the published news of this morning, which sets forth that, in addition to the troops brought East from Tennessee by Gen. MEAGHER, the Twenty-third Corps, under Gen. SCHOFIELD, with this gallant commander, have already arrived in Virginia. This splendid body of troops has a history unsurpassed by that of any corps in the West for deeds of valor; and if the Lieutenant-General intends that, with their Western compatriots under SHERMAN, they shall now take a part in the closing scenes of this great war, on fields a thousand miles distant from those upon which they have heretofore fought, we may he sure that they will sustain the reputation they have always borne. It is certain that there is no danger whatever in taking a large body of THOMAS' troops from the West; for HOOD's army is so badly ""played out,"" that we we have no doubt two-thirds of THOMAS' present force could whip and disperse it, and then pass on to Mobile. Whether SCHOFIELD's corps reinforces the army on the James, or the army on the Savannah, it will in either case reinforce the armies operating against Richmond.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Aspects in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Aspects in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/230a51f7-b61a-538c-a405-4aa97c522dfd,933,nyt://article/230a51f7-b61a-538c-a405-4aa97c522dfd

As shown by the evidence, the prisoner attended a political meeting at the corner of Prospect-street and Hudson-avenue, on the evening of the 1st of October last. While there he got into a dispute with some men in regard to the presidential candidates, and offered to bet that LINCOLN would be elected. Some blows were struck, and YATES drew a pistol and fired, the ball grazing the head of a gentleman named MCJENNA, but inflicting no serious injury. The prisoner then ran to make his escape, keeping the pistol still in his hand, and followed by a large crowd of excite! people. On reaching the corner of Water and Adams streets. YATES was seized by Officer CURRAN. Being unable to free himself from the officer's grasp, he threatened to shoot if he did not let go, and almost at the same instant fired, the ball entering Mr. CURRAN's skull. The prisoner, still pursued by the crowd, who cried out ""Stop the murderer,"" ran to the corner of York and Pearl streets, where, entering a public house, he went up stairs, and secreted himself under a bed in one of the upper rooms, his hiding-place was soon discovered and he was taken into custody. He still retained possession of the revolver, and it was found that three barrels had been discharged and two were still loaded. CURRAN was conveyed to the City Hospital, where he died a few days thereafter. Several witnesses were examined for the defence, and counsel attempted to show that the prisoner was unaware of CURRAN's official character, or he would not have fired, -- but supposed him to be one of the crowd who were pursuing him with so much ferocity; that believing himself in danger of his life he defended himself as best he could. It was held that, under the circumstances, the act was not premeditated, but came under that class of cases in which a jury could consistently decide upon a verdict of justifiable homicide.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb300a99-1bdc-5ecf-8fdc-9a6ed29443a3,772,nyt://article/bb300a99-1bdc-5ecf-8fdc-9a6ed29443a3

Spectator gives a very interesting account of what it terms the ""Olena Tragedy."" From the narrative, it appears that a Mr. DAVIDS, who had been to the western part of Iowa to buy a farm, on his return fell in with a couple of men, who persuaded him to let them ride with him some distance. After they had kept him company a day or two, they took advantage of a lonely part of the road to discover themselves as highwaymen by demanding his money, presenting a loaded [???]ver to compel compliance with their demands. [???]. DAVIDS had no alternative but to yield to their [???]ts, and surrendered all the funds he had with him -- $24 in all. To extricate himself from the difficulty, and to recover his money, if possible, he feigned to be a member of the gang of thieves to which these wretches belonged, and succeeded in convincing them of the fact so well that they returned him most of his money, and consented to assist him in undertaking to rob several wealthy citizens of Olena, near Burlington, Iowa. Upon reaching that place, Mr. DAVIDS promptly informed these gentlemen of the facts, and plans were immediately perfected to kill or capture the robbers, who had meanwhile brought into their project a desperate fellow also living at Olena, who Mr. DAVIDS had named as a member of the gang. The house of Mr. J.J. BROOKS had been selected as the first one to be attempted, and a number of the neighbors armed themselves, and prepared to give the robbers a warm reception, Mr. DAVIDS agreeing to pilot them on the occasion. After one failure to meet an appointment, the gang, numbering three beside Mr. DAVIDS, went to the house of Mr. BROOKS, about 8 o'clock in the evening and asked admittance, alleging some trivial excuse. The door once opened, they forced their way in and demanded an immeate surrender of the valuables in the house. Mr. BROOKS retreated toward the foot of the stairs, and at a prearranged signal the neighbors, who had been stationed in adjoining rooms and out of sight of the robbers, fired. The leader of the gang, a fellow six feet two inches in height, succeeded in firing one or two shots from his revolver before he fell, having been struck by a ball which killed him instantly. Another of the gang received a wound of which he died a day or two afterward, and the third was injured, but it is thought will recover. The affair created the most intense excitement in Burlington and vicinity, and vigilance committees were promptly organized to guard against any such attempts in the future, although there is every reason to believe that the treatment which these scoundrels received will be a pretty effectual protection.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Olena (Iowa) Tragedy.; A DESPERATE GANG OF ROBBERS BROKEN UP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Olena (Iowa) Tragedy.; A DESPERATE GANG OF ROBBERS BROKEN UP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d879a08f-aa7a-5e07-9dcd-e35a19d66cfd,471,nyt://article/d879a08f-aa7a-5e07-9dcd-e35a19d66cfd

There are several inconsistencies in this statement apart from the absurdity of the report about Dr. GWIN. The conveyance of security by MAXIMILIAN to reimburse France for the expenses of the Mexican war is no new thing, as that was one of the conditions on which MAXIMILIAN got his sceptre. The statement, therefore, that several of these States have been conveyed to the French Emperor by trust deed, is not unlikely. But there is a vast difference between simply that and an absolute ""cession"" of the States, placing them under the control of NAPOLEON, who would therefore provide a military force for their protection, and the appointment of a Governor of some kind would not be out of place.

Prospects Ahead; and Wilmington Cotton Prospects ahead,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/27/archives/savannah-and-wilmington-cotton-prospects-abroad.html,Prospects Ahead; and Wilmington Cotton Prospects ahead,"The rapid dissolution of the Confederacy as a military power, forces into the foreground the great question of the return of the cotton trade to something like what may be called its normal condition. In spite of all the flying reports and predictions that have been uttered to the contrary, the people of the South have not made a general bonfire of their cotton accumulations. They destroyed small quantities, or there is at least sufficient evidence that the Confederate soldiery destroyed small quantities in the parishes adjoining New-Orleans, after the capture of that city. They did the same at Baton Rouge, at Natchez, at Vicksburgh, at and around Jackson, and at several points along the Red River. But there is not a scintilla of evidence to show that the mandates of the Richmond military authorities in regard to the destruction of cotton were obeyed, except where there were military agents present in sufficient numbers, at particular points, to overawe and to defy the opinion of the civilian population whose property interests were concerned. In Savannah, where, as it has turned out, the conscripts and agents of DAVIS were not sufficiently strong to carry out the behests of the Richmond oligarchy, the cotton was spared.

This war has done a great deal to cure this. Military law and military success alike demand the most absolute obedience of the inferior to the superior. There must be no hesitancy and no equivocation. Subordination is the main condition in martial affairs, of celerity, order, and victory. Our whole people and our leaders have learned a new and most useful lesson -- to obey; and certainly no better foundation for true liberty can be found than the self-control gained in a voluntary and intelligent obedience.

MEADE, late of the firm of Messrs. MEADE BROTHERS, of No. 233 Broadway, was found dead in his bed at the Tammany Hotel. On the table in his room were four empty phials, with the apothecaries' labels and the written word ""poison"" thereon, and five letters to his friends, which we give below, as tending to throw light upon the case which we have in hand. These phials are small, the largest probably not having contained more than an ounce of poison, or about the quantity which a druggist might unsuspectingly supply to any applicant whose movements were not manifestly those of a maniac. From the statements of Mr. JOHN E. BROWN, clerk at Tammany Hotel, it appears that Mr. MEADE, who had frequently tarried over night at that house, applied for a room and registered himself as ""H.W. SHANAGER, of New-York;"" that he retired, but before locking his door ordered a hot brandy sling, and this was sent up. He then exhibited no evidence of aberration, and no person in the house gave him another thought until late yesterday morning, when he was found as above stated. A messenger was at once dispatched to the Coroner's office, and Coroner GAMBLE and Drs. PARADISE, WELTJE and SHAW promptly responded, and the two latter at once made a post-mortem examination, which revealed nearly three ounces of laudanum in the stomach. This, the empty phials, and the deceased's letters, rendered it a clear case of suicide, and the jury so declared it to be.

It is simply carrying out the original programme. That NAPOLEON entered on his Mexican campaign merely for glory, or in the interest of civilization merely, no one ever believed.

Of those who were or had been in active public life -- some of them high in rank -- among ourselves, a year ago, we miss to-day such names as TANEY, DAYTON, JOSIAH QUINCY, DALLAS, LOVEJOY, GIDDINGS. From among the clergy we find absent Archbishop HUGHES, GORDON and MYRON WINSLOW, EDWARD HITCHCOCK, THOMAS STARR KING, Dr. POTTS, and scores of others scarcely less known through the different sections of the Church. From the catholic world of science, of art and of letters, the ingathering has seldom been so heavy in a single year. We call up, for instance, such names as HAWTHORNE, SILLIMAN, MORRIS, PARK BENJAMIN, WILLIAM HUNT, DAVID ROBERTS, JOHN LEECH, CATHARINE SINCLAIR, WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR, ALARIC A. WATTS, Miss PROCTOR, SPEKE, (the traveler,) N.W. SENIOR; besides in dramatic and lyric art WALLACK, ROBSON and Mrs. WOOD. From the military and naval lists we find absent such glorious names as SEDGWICK, WADSWORTH, MCPHERSON and W.D. PORTER -- how many others, alas! -- scarcely even second to these in the nobility of their record! Of titled and leading representative men in Great Britain and continental Europe, the necrological record is more than of average length. In the list we find the Dukes of NEWCASTLE, ATHOLE and CLEVELAND, the Earls of CARLISLE and ABERDEEN, the Marquis of BRISTOL, Sir WILLIAM ATHERTON, Mr. W.S. O'BRIEN, the Duke of MALAKOFF, M.

The association has recently had its energies aroused to the fullest activity by the proposal of the North British Railway Company to open up a new and more extensive system of Sunday traffic than it has heretofore engaged in. Most of the Free Church Presbyteries of the south and southwest of Scotland have taken decided action in the same way as the Sabbath Protective Association, employing all their power and influence, which, in that particular section of country, is very great, indeed, to compel the Government and the public companies into what is called the ""Sabbatarian"" view of Sunday obligations and duties. The Free Presbytery of Glasgow, which is composed of many of the ablest clergymen of that branch of the Presbyterian Church, is in the fore front in this battle. And an eminent Professor of the same Church, Mr. GIBSON, speaking for the Presbytery, has thrown down the gauntlet to the secular press of the, whole United Kingdom in a challenge which is almost as formidable as a papal bull. The challenge is put forth on the ground that Prof. GIBSON regards the secular press as all but atheistical or infidel in its sympathies and teachings, especially in all that bears upon the observance of the Fourth Commandment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Church and the Press in Scotland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Church and the Press in Scotland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Scotland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1b541cb7-01dd-5d6f-a2ef-0c4ca853a1d4,1091,nyt://article/1b541cb7-01dd-5d6f-a2ef-0c4ca853a1d4

WHEELOCK, who died at Washington a few days ago, the Albany Evening Journal says: ""At the outbreak of the war, he was engaged in a large and prosperous business. This he abandoned after the fall of Sumter, and immediately devoted himself to raising men for the army, pledging himself to provide for their families. In a conversation with the writer of this, in the Summer of 1861, he said: ""I am worth, I think, in the neighborhood of $10,000. Half of this I have already given of pledged; and if my country wants the other half, it can have it and myself in the bargain."" Becoming impatient with the slow progress of the war, be soon after commenced raising a regiment on his own hook, fed and housed several hundred men at his personal expense for many months, and after a series of embarrassments and disappointments that would have disheartened almost any other man, completed its organization and marched it to the field. Entirely without military experience, and with but a very limited general education, he become one of the best volunteer officers in the service, and so signally distinguished himself that he was breveted Brigadier-General for bravery and good soldiership. He had seen much service, was engaged in many of the bloodiest battles in Virginia, was taken prisoner, if we mistake not, at the second battle of Bull Run, and tasted for many months the sweets of prison life at Richmond, but was subsequently exchanged, when he rejoined his old regiment and did more gallant service in behalf of the old flag.

Parliament of; Debate on United States Relations,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/29/archives/our-relations-with-canada-interesting-debates-in-the-provincial.html,Parliament of; Debate on United States Relations,"In the Legislative Assembly, Jan. 23, the Address in answer to the Speech being under discussion, Col. Haultain echoed the statements in the Speech with inference to the outrages which had been committed on the territory of the United States by persons seeking in our hospitality immunity from their evil deeds. He spoke not as a lawyer but as a soldier, and declared that these acts were not war. He congratulated the country on the prompt steps which had been taken to put an end to these acts, and was glad the House was asked to give larger powers to prevent these sets for the future, and to punish those who might perpetrate them. No thoughtful man could contemplate a war between Great Britain and America, without shuddering at the idea. Nevertheless, we ought to prepare for defence. Four years ago, the military position was all in our favor. Then we were an integral part of the greatest military and naval nation in the world, while the Americans had but small numbers of soldiers, a few, though admirably appointed ships. Now, the American armies mustered by hundreds and thousands, and their ships were numberless. What, then, was to be done? Fortify the weak portals, in order to retard the enemy and give time to train the defenders of the country. We must also gradually train the population of this country. We were not, like the mother country, defended by sea; so that her partially trained forces can never be hastily called into action. Our levies would be brought suddenly into collision with the invaders, who, if they meant attack, would certainly not give us time to prepare for it. We must, therefore, have a number of trained men; we must also have more military schools to fit those who are to take command of the armies which would have to be called out. So, again, we should forward the instruction of the volunteers, and last, though net least, he mentioned that we shall require, as military adviser of the Government, one who, from military experience, is competent to give counsel for military affairs: who should be willing to think that he had much to learn of the people and the country, and by going among the people, would give them confidence in his management.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR RELATIONS WITH CANADA.; Interesting Debates in the Provincial Parliament.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR RELATIONS WITH CANADA.; Interesting Debates in the Provincial Parliament.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5d840b1-b3f2-5479-97ca-f5220a4cb683,1598,nyt://article/b5d840b1-b3f2-5479-97ca-f5220a4cb683

We hear of the disease on every hand; and yet, as is well known, the relatives of the persons diseased will seldom report them as cases of small-pox, on account of the odium it excites in the tenement-houses, and the fear of their removal to the public hospitals.

We are just beginning to learn, at the close of the fourth year of the war, that there is science, and a great deal of science in the business of taxing a large community -- if we do it on a moderately large scale, and do it with a fair consideration for the various industrial interests of the nation. Already great progress has been made by those who have had the business in hand; but, it is no reflection on their honesty or earnestness of purpose to say that it has been a progress looking more toward immediate results -- that is, actual money returns -- than toward a nice and equitable distribution and adjustment of the public burdens. However, actual, returns in money are precisely what are wanted at this particular juncture, and in this view we think the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may fairly and honestly be congratulated on his financial exhibit, covering the whole transactions of his branch of the service for the fiscal year ending in June, 1864.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Internal Revenue Gratifying Returns.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Internal Revenue Gratifying Returns.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/036be494-cffc-56cf-93df-df918f3f95a5,576,nyt://article/036be494-cffc-56cf-93df-df918f3f95a5

As there is hardly any species of violence or injustice of which Great Britain has not at one period or other been guilty, of course there is an abundance of these precedents always at hand.

Canada; good will and U S Diplomacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/30/archives/diplomacy-of-a-practical-kind.html,Canada; good will and U S Diplomacy,"There are few among us that expect to find the practical way of dealing with international questions adopted by the National Government perfectly understood abroad -- just at the moment. It takes time, generally, to make questions bearing on our foreign relations so apparent that the instant assent of a friendly neighbor can be reckoned on. But still, our way of doing things sometimes finds appreciation much sooner than we could almost have ventured to hope for. The people of the bordering Provinces, a ten months ago, supposed that they might keep up a profitable commerce at one and the same time with the United States and with the States in rebellion against the national authority. These hopeful people have just begun to find out that they cannot do this sort of thing with any profit. The journals which have come to us from Quebec during the past week are filled with parliamentary speeches from members in office, and from members out of office -- all couched in terms of good will. The frontier, according to these reports, is now protected by a volunteer force which is to cost the people one million of dollars a year. The laws which relate to the protection of so-called political refugees are to be amended by an enactment which will compel them to give security for their good behavior. The money stolen at St. Albans by the ""Confederate"" robbers is to be at once repaid. The Judge who connived with the felons is suspended from office. And, in short, the colonial people have begun thoroughly to understand that they cannot, at one and the same time, live in friendship with the President and people of the United States, while they lend themselves, their policemen and their Judges of the Petty Sessions to the small larceny business of JEFF. DAVIS. Let us here note, also, that the Chief Justice of Upper Canada, W.H. DRAPER, C.B., gave, on Friday, a common-sense decision, which is final in its character, and by which the pirate BURLEIGH will be at once surrendered, in accordance with the Extradition Treaty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Diplomacy of a Practical Kind.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Diplomacy of a Practical Kind.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-01-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5ffa836-e981-54e9-9cdb-7c73c1095302,677,nyt://article/b5ffa836-e981-54e9-9cdb-7c73c1095302

"RAGES. The substitution of a national for a local currency will remedy more evils than one. The prime ends sought, of course, are first, uniformity of value, and next a reasonable security against counterfeits. The former of these objects, we have a fair assurance, will be secured; the latter will also be, in a measure, attained. At least, we shall not have one-tenth the number of spurious bills in circulation that we have now.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/01/31/archives/a-national-currency-petty-trading-out.html,,"But there are incidental evils of a minor, but most aggravating kind, which will also disappear with the general introduction of a national currency. We desire to draw especial attention to one of these evils, and also to give one out of a hundred illustrations that might be given of the practical working of the thing. Day after day, complaints reach us of respectable persons -- honest and respectable house-keepers -- that have been subjected to insults for offering State money of a perfectly current character, at retail shops and market stalls in New-York. Many of these cases, but for the desire of the victims to avoid publicity, would have had an immediate and thorough exposure in these columns. One case, however, came under our notice on Saturday afternoon, which we feel authorized to bring before the public. A gentleman who does business down town asked another to meet him, for the sake of convenience, at a chop-house kept by one GUN, or GUNNING, near Exchange-place. The gentleman with whom the appointment was made was first at the place of rendezvous; and, having to wait for some time for his friend, he called for something, as the best excuse for being in the house at all. He tendered in payment for what he had a $5 bill, New-York State money. This was refused, and he was abruptly and rudely told, in the presence of a crowd of strangers, that he had offered counterfeit money. Perfectly satisfied that the bill was good, the gentleman was not inclined to lose his temper. He put the rejected bill back in his pocket, and tendered another, which was, first, likewise pronounced bad, but afterwards taken in payment. Just as this transaction was completed, the gentleman who had made the appointment came in. Nothing was said on either side about the money dispute, and the two sat down to lunch. When this was over, the last-arrived of the two gentlemen went to the desk to pay for the lunch. He had just come from his banker's, and, as luck would have it, he had only large bills about him. He tendered a New-York bill in payment, and without so much as looking at it, the person in charge tossed it back to his customer, and at the same time drew from the drawer the bill previously accepted from the gentleman who first entered the place, rudely and insolently demanding that his change should be given back to [???]. This man's insolence became perfectly outrageous. But both of the gentlemen, were determined to avoid a quarrel in such a place. The person in charge was civilly asked to send a waiter to one of the thousand adjoining broker's offices and see if the bills tendered were good or bad. This he at first declined to do; and made a parade of handing the money round among his comrades all of whom declared it bad. The determined attitude of the gentlemen, however, soon made the keeper of the place take another view of the matter. He sent or pretended to send out to test the genuineness of the money. The reported answer of the messenger was that ""the brokers had refused it."" But said the chop-house man, ""I will take the bill,"" putting it again in the drawer. ""You will do no such thing,"" said the gentleman who had tendered it. You have charged us with passing bad money, and insulted us, and we must now see if the bills are good."" The money was then taken by one of the gentlemen to WHYTE, MORRIS & CO.'s, on Wall-street, and there promptly exchanged for greenbacks, the second gentleman meanwhile mortgaging his person at the counter, until the exchange of bills was effected. No words can convey an idea of the outrageous insolence to which these gentlemen -- either of them probably carrying enough money about them to buy out the entire eating-house -- were subjected. They could not condescend to raise a personal quarrel with the individual who had thus treated them, and made them for the time the jeers of his companions. They could have had no redress at law, for insolence, unfortunately, is not an indictable offence. And their only mode of redress is that which is now adopted -- exposure -- so that others may not unwittingly be made the victims of a similar outrage in the same quarter.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NATIONAL CURRENCY PETTY TRADING OUT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NATIONAL CURRENCY PETTY TRADING OUT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-01-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64f4b608-dbaa-58fa-86bd-abd2bed5fca2,735,nyt://article/64f4b608-dbaa-58fa-86bd-abd2bed5fca2

Travelers have often observed it. We bear anything, and suffer anything, from our rulers, or those who are serving the public. Abuses which would set an Englishman's blood in a fever, and fill the columns of the London Times with indignant letters, and certainly lead to litigations, are endured here day after day, without a murmur. People come to look on the wrongs they suffer from the public -- especially on those inflicted by great corporations -- somewhat as they do on the sufferings caused by the weather -- as a thing inevitable, and not to be grumbled at or cured. This is especially a frontier peculiarity. Every one in a pioneer community must be good-natured; each must help the other; no one must grumble, and no one expects anything very complete, either in public or private arrangements.
