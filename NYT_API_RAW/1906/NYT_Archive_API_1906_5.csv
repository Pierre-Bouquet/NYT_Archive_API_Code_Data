"BOSTON, May 25. -- Cornell Varsity eight won the second annual boat race from the Harvard crew this afternoon on the Charles River by over three lengths. The race was rowed down the stream, a distance of a mile and seven-eighths. Cornell's time was 10:41 3-5, while Harvard's was 10:52. The event, which was the concluding feature of an interesting regatta, was a splendid exhibition by two carefully trained and finely balanced set of oarsmen.
