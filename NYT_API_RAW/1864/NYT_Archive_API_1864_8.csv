We see in these reports, so far, simply the sudden dash of two or three separate squads of cavalry or mounted infantry, firstat one point, then at another -- at ,Point ofRocks, at Adamstown, near the Monocacy, close to Shippensburgh, at Chambersburgh, at St. Thomas, at Mercersburgh, at Waynesboro', at Greencastle, and at a number of less important points in-Upper Maryland and South-western Pennsylvania. At none of these points is the rebel force estimated at more than eight hundred, and it is possibly the same squad that reappears at different points and succeeds in duplicating itself by quick movements. Be this, however, as it may, we can find nothing to indicate that the band operating in Pennsylvania, the advance portion of which occupied Chambersburgh early on Saturday morning, and burnt the town later in the day, is much superior in numbers or equipment to the flying squads that pounced on the railroad lines round Baltimore a few weeks ago. They move quickly. They show a bold front. They do not burden themselves with trains. And they have a thorough appreciation of the kind of resistance they may expect from the State cavalry or Pennsylvania. We do not see, then, what is to hinder a force, say of a couple of thousand mounted rebels, to burn a score or more of border towns and villages, at the same time that they keep up the appearance of being the advance of a large invading army.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Scope of the New Invasion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Scope of the New Invasion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1df79b21-c12e-5355-8d14-d43cfcf538f7,646,nyt://article/1df79b21-c12e-5355-8d14-d43cfcf538f7

Any new work of hers is sure to win its way to thousands of family circles where the story of the great reformation has acquired new life and significance from her attractive treatment. In her Sketches of Christian Life in England she employs a larger canvas and covers a wider extent of time with her historic groups. The nine sketches or stories, indeed comprised in the volume, relate to characteristic and remarkable events in the religious history of England from the introduction of Christianity by the companions of the Apostles to the era of WYCLIFFE and the Lollard persecution at the beginning of the Fifteenth Century. They show a familiarity, far from common, with remote times, and are evidently the production of one who has studied diligently the literature and existing monuments of the epochs she delineates. At the same time, she does not allow her learning to stifle or overshadow the vivid dramatic power, that recognizes the essential elements of humanity through every garb and costume, however strangely it may strike on our modern eyes. In what are commonly called the Dark Ages, through which these stories pleasantly and instructively lead us, the authoress has the good sense to see that it was not all one ""palpable obscure,"" but that the various influences then working to produce the results now presented to us, must have had their oases of light where the germs of Christianity flourished individually with a strength and vigor that gave no uncertain promise of the better days to come. In sketching the elder days of English Christianity, the authoress has the advantage of more perfect acquaintance with the scene than she could possess of Germany, and her subjects naturally come nearer home to our sympathies and associations. The book is, therefore, likely to meet with a more extended demand than has welcomed the Cotta Family, and cannot be perused without deepening faith in the Divine government of the world, so wonderfully displayed in the memorable historic record of Christianity.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE EARLY DAWN; or SKETCHES OF CHRISTIAN LIFE IN ENGLAND IN THE OLDENTIME.

"Mulligan, Col James",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/02/archives/the-late-col-mulligan-recovery-of-his-remains.html,"Mulligan, Col James","The reports we have had regarding the wounding and death of the gallant Col. MULLIGAN are at last confirmed by the announcement of the arrival of his remains at Chicago. Col. MULLIGAN was born in the City of Utica, N.Y., in the year 1829, consequently was thirty-five years old at the time of his death. After the death of his father, which occurred when young MULLIGAN was but a child, his mother removed to Chicago. JAMES was educated at the University of St. Mary of the Lake, and in college, both with professors and with pupils, stood highest among the high. He was a Roman Catholic. He was, from boyhood to his death, a regular communicant of that church. In 1852. '53 and '54 he read law in the office of Hon. GRANT GOODRICH, and at the time of his admission to the bar was a student in the law office of Hon. ISAAC N. ARNOLD. After leaving college, and before entering on the study of law, he accompanied Mr. STEPHENS on one of his expeditions in Central America. In 1854 he edited, for a short time, a religious Roman Catholic weekly paper published in Chicago, called The Tablet, but in 1856 he commenced the practice of the law. He always had a taste for military life, and even while a law student he volunteered as a private in the Shields Guard, a company then organized in Chicago. In this company he was soon promoted to a Lieutenancy and afterward became Captain. In 1857-8 he desired to see life at the capitol, and through the kindness of Senator FITCH he was appointed by Mr. BUCHANAN to a clerkship in the Interior Department. He spent one Winter in Washington and saw enough. When the war broke out he was Captain of the Shields Guard and proposed to organize a regiment of Irishmen for the war. The regiment was raised, but others were elected to its command, he being given but a subordinate position. The supply of volunteers was so great that the State authorities could not accept it. MULLIGAN, however, was not to be repressed in that way. He obtained from Senator DOUGLAS, then on his death-bed, a letter to Secretary CAMBRON, who at once gave him authority to raise a regiment. He returned, and in a few weeks he succeeded in enlisting as fine a regimentas ever left Chicago; he was made Colonel, and was at once sent to Missouri. He left Chicago in June, 1861, and skirmished his way up to Lexington, which point it was deemed important to hold. He had with him, besides his own regiment, a regiment of Illinois cavalry armed with cutlasses, and a regiment of Missouri ""Home Guards."" PRICE, with his 15,000 troops, soon surrounded Lexington, demanding its surrender. For five or six days the heroic Bommander maintained the unequal contest, and it was not until he had neither ammunition, water nor food that the demand for surrender was compiled with. The officers and men were paroled, and allowed to return; MULLIGAN, however, refused a parole, and being joined by his wife and babe, was carried off as a prisoner by PRICE, who treated him with the most marked kindness and respect Early in November he was exchanged for Gen. FROST, and on his arrival in Chicago was honored with a magnificent ovation. In the Spring following he was ordered to Western Virginia, where he has since served in various capacities faithfully and gallantly, at times discharging the duties of a Major-General, while holding the rank of Colonel. Once he declined promotion to a Brigadiership unless he could take his old regiment with him, and lately the prejudices of some of those high in office have stood in the way of his preferment.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Late Col.

At 5:30 the charge was made, and the fort, with a portion of the line on each side, was carried in the most gallant manner. The second line, a short distance beyond the fort, was also attempted; but at this critical moment the colored troops, which had advanced in good order to the first line, wavered and broke under a galling fire. They were rallied and again pushed forward, but without success, most of their officers being killed or wounded. Their losses were very severe. Their struggle continued for some time, but the rebels had such great advantage that the highest efforts were unavailing. The reserve were not ordered to advance, and our troops fell back as best they could. Our losses in the affair have been estimated as high as four or five thousand.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bd0ba3b0-b5d6-52fd-ad40-d3af82865036,352,nyt://article/bd0ba3b0-b5d6-52fd-ad40-d3af82865036

There is no man of intelligence and patriotism at the North who does not acknowledge that Government is not only one of the most important of human pursuits, but that too much talent, integrity, learning, experience and wisdom, cannot be brought to it, and that the happiness of nations and the progress of mankind in civilization is in the highest degree dependent on the manner in which it is carried on. And there is nobody who acknowledges this, who will not also acknowledge that, like all other arts, it has to be acquired by the usual mixture of study and practice, that it needs much knowledge and much experience, and the entire devotion of his time and attention to it to enable any man to succeed in it. To be well done, therefore, the work of Government has to be made the business, the whole and sole business, of some class or other. It can no more be carried on successfully by men whose training and pursuits draw them away half the time in other directions, than the profession of the law or of medicine. In England and the South, the class which takes up Government as a calling, has been and is the aristocracy of birth and wealth; and nobody can deny that, in both places, the ideas of the end and aim of Government, held by this class, have been admirably carried out. Their theory of the best form of polity, and of the great objects of political institutions, differ widely from ours; but it is impossible to deny that, such as it is, it has been properly practiced. The problem before them has been to construct and perpetuate, under given conditions, the strongest form of oligarchy; and the world knows what skill, courage, tenacity, and fertility of resource, they have brought to its solution.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Public Service and the Public Weal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Public Service and the Public Weal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cd5808ba-6be1-5c93-af0b-c919729aa266,1153,nyt://article/cd5808ba-6be1-5c93-af0b-c919729aa266

Gen. ROSECRANS has called for ten regiments of volunteers to operate against them, and Gen. FISK, commanding in Northwest Missouri, has called upon ""five thousand true and loyal men, with each a horse and such arms as they may have or can procure, and ammunition therefor, to rally for the protection of life and property and the extermination of the Confederate guerrilla fiends that infest Northwest Missouri."" The Governor of the State has issued a proclamation to the people, appealing to them to respond promptly and with alacrity to the call of Gen. ROSECRANS. If the volunteers called for are not quickly furnished, he will draft a sufficient militia force for the purpose, and that militia force, he says, ""cannot be paid, for the reason that the State has not sufficient means for the purpose."" In the appeal of Gen. FISK, which does not interfere with that of Gen. ROSECRANS, a terrible picture is given of the doings of the ""robbers and murderers who are spreading death and desolation in their bloody pathway,"" and he urges loyal men to promptly respond to this call for their ""swift and sure destruction.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Guerrillas in Missouri.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Guerrillas in Missouri.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01580903-4dbb-5246-9f58-0cb6d003c87f,520,nyt://article/01580903-4dbb-5246-9f58-0cb6d003c87f

They were as much greater in proportion to ours, as our losses were greater than the rebels in our recent assaults upon their works in Virginia, at Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor and Petersburgh. The conditions between the two combatants were reversed in the West and in the East. In the West it was the rebels who assaulted, and our troops were, to some extent, enabled to throw up their lines of works, from behind which they poured their fire into the enemy's ranks. We had, the other day, a telegraphic abstract of an official statement made by Gen. THOMAS upon this matter, of which to-day we give the text. Gen. THOMAS is too cool and careful an old soldier to indulge in any misapprehensions upon this subject.

We see nothing in any one of the freebooters' exploits, or in the aim of these exploits, which represents the military organization of the public enemy. We find small bands of well-drilled brigands, acting as independently of the main rebel force as if the scene of their adventures were Northwestern Missouri or New-Mexico, instead of the Cumberland Valley. We find them engaged in nothing that can be said to rise to the dignity of warlike enterprise. What railroads have they destroyed? What bridges burnt? What public stores have they laid hold on? Where have they sought to make anything approaching to the semblance of a military assault? Destroying railroads, bridges, public stores, or even making such haphazard assaults upon passing trains as that at Gunpowder Bridge, may come properly into the category of military enterprises. They do more or less to diminish facilities of communication. They serve to delay the concentration of troops. They injure the commissariat. Or they run a chance of making such valuable captures as that of Gen. FRANKLIN. Coming with these intents, they have usually a responsible leadership, and we give them a consideration which is not extended to mere bushwhackers or prowling thieves. We see in their very mode of doing business that their operations are part of a well-considered plan; that their relations are immediate and direct to the main invading force, and that they are worth the attention, at least, of whatever portion of the regular cavalry force can be spared.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Brigandage on the Border The Coming Struggle.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Brigandage on the Border The Coming Struggle.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f291733-4288-5f53-983b-b3b6c74fcc82,895,nyt://article/2f291733-4288-5f53-983b-b3b6c74fcc82

We incline to the same opinion; still, in a matter so uncertain, and dependent on unknown combinations of Gen. GRANT's strategy, it is difficult to form any positive judgment. But it is apparent on both sides that 20,000 or 30,000 men can hold the respective capitals, behind scientifically planned intrenchments, against the whole force of either army, unless the regular approaches of a siege be made. Therefore the rebels can, during any short interval of time -say two or three months -- leave Richmond almost out of view, and we equally Washington. There are, it is true, combinations always possible with a General like GRANT, which make it dangerous to have a weak force in front of him. Mining attacks may not always fail. He may suddenly, before a weakened enemy, transfer great masses of his army entirely to the rear of Richmond and attack it, as he did Vicksburgh; or he may make another attempt on the north of the James, or, in fine, he may try some new expedient which no one has thought of.

"A MAN FATALLY INJURED. -- On Wednesday night last a serious disturbance occurred in Sixth-avenue, near Forty-third-street, during which a German, named HENRY MILEY, was beaten so badly that it is believed he cannot survive. It seems that the horseshoers employed in a blacksmith's shop, situated in Twenty-fourth-street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues, have for several weeks past been on a strike. MILEY was employed in that shop, and after the others had struck he kept on at the old rates. This conduct on his part greatly exasperated his fellow-workmen, who threatened to punish-him severely when he left the shop. These threats were, however, unheeded, and MILEY continued to work as usual until Wednesday night. He then left the shop and proceeded up Sixth-avenue, followed by several of the strikers, among whom was one JAMES BRANNIGAN. The latter was armed by what is known among that trade as a ""turning hammer,"" a broad-faced tool with a handle about 18 inches in length. When near the Sixth-avenue railroad depot, MILEY was stopped and violently assaulted and beaten by the strikers. BRANNIGAN struck MILEY a powerful blow with the hammer above mentioned, sinking the whole face of the weapon into the skull. MILEY fell to the pavement, and the brows on his head were then several times repeated. BRANNIGAN ran away. Several citizens, who witnessed the affair, attempted to stop him. He was finally arrested by Officer NEWLET, of the Twenty-ninth Precinct. The instrument he had used on his victim was found in his possession, covered with blood. MILEY was conveyed to the Station-house, where he received the requisite medical attendance. His physicians say he cannot recover.

"At a late hour on Thursday afternoon a case of much interest just at this time, when the business of substitute brokers is so brisk in this City, occurred in the Second Ward. Policeman HIRAM B.

If be wished to serve his country, now was his time. The broker would take FERGUSON to Philadelphia, where he could enlist and receive a bounty of $500; at the same time he, the broker, would be benefited to the amount of $150.

The return of MASON to his undignified post in the outer lobbies of the British Foreign Office; the parliamentary exercitations of LINDSAY and CLANRICARDE; the deputations of retired Admirals, rural Justices, and Tory parsons, expostulating with Lord PALMERSTON; the ""honorable Secretary of the Southern Independence Association,"" assailing Lord RUSSELL with a mythical list of memorialists from the factory districts, all in favor of instant mediation, prove to us one thing, if they prove nothing else.

It is generally looked upon at home as well as on the continent as a formal declaration that hereafter the English foreign policy is to be one of strict, isolation; that she will rigidly refrain from all interference in the affairs of other nations, excepting advice and ""protests;"" and that she will in no case use either fleet or army, except for the purpose of warding off direct and palpable danger to her own possessions or interests. The London Times is in reality, or pretends to be, on the whole, well pleased with this decision, and proceeds to base on it an elaborate and energetic argument in favor of the total cessation, on the part of Great Britain, of any attempt to repress the Slave-trade. It declares that the maintenance of a squadron on the Coast of Africa, for the purpose of preventing, the exportation of blacks, is a clear violation of the rule now laid down, as it is forcible inerference in defence of foreign sava ges, whose condition, calamities and prospects are of no sort of concern to England, and to whom kidnapping and Slavery is, after all, but one of the ordinary incidents of a life which is, at least, very miserable.

Cession to France Spoken of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/07/archives/cession-of-sardinia-to-france.html,Cession to France Spoken of,"Again the cession of Sardinia to France is spoken of. This question was first broached in the columns of an Italian journal -- it is now revived in those of a French cotemporary, and some of the leading Transalpine journals have become, not unnaturally, alarmed at so very suspicious a circumstance. They do not hesitate, indeed, to declare their belief in the existence of a plot between the oracle at the Tuileries and the Government at Turin for the carrying out of the project. Even CAVOUR, they assert, was at one time favorable to the sale of Sardinia, provided a good price could be got for it, and the men who disposed of Savoy and Nice can hardly be trusted in such a matter. Under some pretext or other, too, all the Italian soldiers and officials are being removed from the island, and everything indicates that an act of treachery is in contemplation. But it is not exactly for the sale and purchase of Sardinia that NAPOLEON and the Turin Cabinet are now in treaty. The Italian King, according to our authorities, having eschewed the aid of revolution, and the instrumentality of arms, for the recovery of Rome, has no alternative save to let things remain in statu quo, or to offer some equivalent to the French Emperor which might induce him to withdraw his troops from the ""Eternal City."" The possession of Rome being indispensable to the maintenance of VICTOR EMANUEL's prestige, and the integrity of his Kingdom, he has determined to embrace the latter horn of the dilemma rather than the former, and so Sardinia is to be transferred to NAPOLEON in consideration of his recalling the French garrison from Italy, and leaving the old Pope to his fate.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cession of Sardinia to France.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cession of Sardinia to France.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SARDINIA', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/618a0812-0e8a-5e08-8c2b-0031d7b28f73,655,nyt://article/618a0812-0e8a-5e08-8c2b-0031d7b28f73
"Under the Bonaparte regime the rights of French authors and their publishers are no more respected than those of French editors. A case has recently been decided in the First Chamber of the Cour Imperiale, which shows this. The Duke D'AUMALE, eldest son of LOUIS PHILIPPE, having, to while away the dreariness of exile, written a ""History of the House of CONDE during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,"" arranged with M. LEVY, a Parisian publisher, for the bringing out of the first volume of the work. There was no attempt at concealment from the outset. The publisher and his printer had scrupulously fulfilled all the formalities required by the laws on the press. Two copies had been deposited in the Department of the Interior, and the proof sheets and revises had passed backward and forward from Paris to London, and from London to Paris, without any objection or impediment on the part of the Post-office authorities -- without any indication that the printing and publication of the book would be interfered with. When some four thousand volumes had been printed, however, the Prefect of Police, by order of M. DE PERSIGNY, suddenly sent his emissaries to the printing-office, and carried off the whole lot to a cellar of his prefecture, where for nearly two years they have remained under lock and key. Soon after, the Duke D'AUMALE and his publisher took legal proceedings against the Prefect, in order to compel him to restore the property which he had thus outrageously seized; but the civil Tribunal of the Seine, before which the case was, in the first instance, tried, decided that the act of the Prefect was in conformity with the order of the Minister of the Interior, and that it was therefore justifiable, while, by Article 75 of the Constitution of the year 8, the plaintiffs were debarred from proceeding against an agent of the Government for acts done in the discharge of his official duties, without the authorization of the Council of State.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/07/archives/france-the-armies-of-europe.html,,"The Moniteur de l'Armee publishes an article on the military forces of the various European Powers. On the question as to whether the Russian or the Austrian troops are superior as soldiers, the writer professes inability to decide, but his leaning seems to be to the Russians. He says: ""Since the war in the Crimea and in Italy, we have frequently heard these questions discussed and we have found among the French officers as many partisans for the one as for the other. A man whose voice was of immense authority half a century ago -- we speak of NAPOLEON I. -- in his sometimes harsh correspondence, allows himself to fall into severe expressions on almost all the troops of Europe; he, however, never makes use of an unfavorable word with respect to the Russians. In fact, under the First Empire, the armies of ALEXANDER I., although beaten by France at Austerlitz, Friedland, Moscow and Lutzen, and during the whole of the campaign of 1814, constantly showed themselves to be stout soldiers, worthy of combatting against the French legions. The Russian armies have not been in existence two centuries, as in 1689, when PETER the Great ascended the throne, he found only one regular corps of 15,000 men; at that period, however, they were making great progress. The Czar PETER in dying left to CATHERINE 110,000 soldiers, well disciplined and perfectly organized. In 1772. after the first partition of Poland, CATHERINE II, raised the peace footing of her troops to 270,000 men. At the moment of the campaign of 1805 Russia had 500,000 men, of whom 300,000 were combatants, for the armies of that Power always present a very great difference between the military element and the fighting one. For a long time, in fact, the sovereigns of Russia have the mania of assimilation, so that the real effective is very inferior to that which is enunciated by the regulation returns. At the end of the war of 1814, Russia had 900,000 men on her military rolls. Since that period her effective has always maintained very nearly that enormous figure, and yet she would have a difficulty in bringing into the field three armies of 100,000 men each. With her extent of territory, and the permanent germs of revolt on the extreme points of her distant provinces, which are ill subjected to her authority, she is obliged to maintain special corps -- in the Caucasus, 120,000 men and 120 pieces of artillery; in Siberia, 20,000 men and 40 guns, and on the frontier numerous bodies of irregular Cossacks. For a long time the Russian army tried to be a sort of Medusa's head for Europe; but the Colossus with feet, of clay, as it has been named and not without reason, has lost much of its prestige since the energetic Government of NAPOLEON III. succeeded that of July. The reverses of Russia on the Danube and before Silistria, with the loss of the battles of the Alma, Inkerman and Trakfir, and the fall of Sebastopol, have opened the eyes of all Europe. The efforts made now by Russia to reduce Poland confirm the existence of a radical vice in her military organization. That vice is above all the deplorable incapacity of almost all the men charged with the administration of the troops, and perhaps, also, of a part of those who exercise the commands. We must, however, admit that since the peace of Paris the efforts of the Emperor ALTXANDER have out been fruitless to introduce a little more regularity in the auministration of his numerous army. The Russian troops, we must admit, are becoming civilized, like the whole country. The period at which the Russian army was strongest was that during which the government succeeded, by means of deceitful promises, in amalgamating with its troops the Polish element, which is superior to all that exists in that vast empire. At present that element fails it.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FRANCE.; THE ARMIES OF EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FRANCE.; THE ARMIES OF EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88225628-e7e0-5e55-98f9-a40f451b583b,656,nyt://article/88225628-e7e0-5e55-98f9-a40f451b583b

Going from Paris, where little or no sympathy is heard for the Union cause, where the imperialist journals teach the people that the American Government is on the verge of ruin, and where American stocks are unknown, it was like a sudden change from darkness into light to find himself in the midst of many hundreds of bankers and brokers screaming themselves hoarse over American stocks, in a place (Frankfort-on-the-Maine) where more American stocks are bought and sold in one day than of all the European stocks combined, and where such an interest is felt in the national cause that the agency of the ERLANGERS in the Confederate Loan is charged against that house as almost a crime! These Federal bonds were bought in most part by permanent holders, and not by speculators -- by people who pay little attention to the fluctuations of war, because they have confidence in the future of the Union, and find this the best investment for their surplus funds. Nevertheless, the ""bulls"" and ""bears"" of the Frankfort Bourse speculate largely in these stocks on their own account, and appear to be quite as sensitive to small events as the same class of gentlemen on other Exchanges. Our correspondent went on to give the assurance that in the present situation of affairs at Frankfort, a loan of a hundred millions could be negotiated there by the American Government at a day's notice.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/07/archives/america-in-germany.html,,"Our Paris correspondent mentioned, yesterday, a pleasing circumstance connected, with a hasty visit he had just made to Germany.

"Notwithstanding the great efforts which have been and are being made to fill the quota of this City, under the last call for troops, it is evidently impossible that it should be filled by the time specified.

The new resolution adopted on Friday by the Board of Supervisors, directing the Volunteer Committee to furnish substitutes for residents liable or not liable to draft, in the numerical order of the registration of their names and of their payments, and to pay the substitutes the County bounty in addition to the private bounty, will, it is thought, have a very good effect, and greatly assist the officers in procuring recruits.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/07/archives/the-history-of-a-sword.html,,"The Memphis Bulletin says Major WILLIAM STUBBS, of the Eight Iowa Infantry, on entering the United States service at the commencement of the rebellion, was presented by the employes of the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, on which he had been a conductor, with an elegant sword, bearing an inscription expressive of their regard. At the battle of Sutton, Where the Major, with many other federal officers, fell into the hands of the enemy, he was obliged to surrender it to a rebel Lieutenant-Colonel. He was then sent to Selma, Ala., where he remained a prisoner for more than a year. Meanwhile his sword, the loss of which he much regretted, was doing service in rebel hands. At the second battle of Corinth, in the following October, the rebel Lieutenant Colonel was wounded and taken prisoner by a private of the Tenth Missouri Infantry, who, on divesting him of the sword he carried, accidentally discovered the incription, which indicated that it once belonged to a Union officer. A private is supposed to have no use for a sword when carrying a musket and bayonet, so he gave it to the Lieutenant of his company to use until such time as he, perhaps, might be entitled to wear it. The sword once more did good service in the cause of liberty and Union, in the hands of the Missouri Lieutenant, through Gen. GRANT's great campaign to the memorable fall of Vicksburgh. In the meantime the rightful owner of the sword was exchanged, and arrived at Chicago with other returned prisoners. Their names were published in the Chicago papers, one of which came into possession of the brave private, who while glancing over it, observed the name of Maj. STUBBS, and all at once concluded he was the owner of the sword he took from the rebel officer so long before. He was then with the army besieging Vicksburgh. Writing to the Major at Chicago, he informed him that he had a sword which he thought was his, and asked, if so, what he should do with it. As the Major was about to rejoin his regiment, which was also before Vicksburgh, he answered in person. He reached Vicksburgh on the morning of the 4th of July, when it surrendered to the Union army under Gen. GRANT, and finding the Tenth Missouri, met the honest soldier, who seemed overjoyed at discovering the owner of the weapon which the fortunes of war had thrown in his way. He conducted him to his Lieutenant, who was loth to part with the sword which had accompanied him through the great campaign of the Southwest, but gave it up cheerfully, The Major warmly thanked the soldier for the restoration of his sword, and tendered him a handsome sum of money as a reward for his trouble; but the noble fellow respectfully declined it. It was sufficient reward to have found the owner, as he was satisfied. Thus the Major unexpectedly recovered his blade, nearly a year and a half after its surrender.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The History of a Sword.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The History of a Sword.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca18be21-f4cf-590b-942c-33cf26442655,506,nyt://article/ca18be21-f4cf-590b-942c-33cf26442655

MCGEE has been arrested and lodged in jail heretofore, on a charge of kidnapping Mr. LAHEY's bov. On this charge he was bailed out and bound over to the next Court of Sessions. This forenoon the prisoners were brought up before Justice FLAGG, who committed them for examination on the 10th instant, without bail. The boy's statement to his father is that MURRAY gave the boy liquor until he became intoxicated, when he took him by the cars to Albany, and from thence to Poughkeepsie. Here he wanted the boy to swear that he was eighteen years old, but he refused to do so. The boy states that he was then brought to Troy and shut up in MURRAY's house, in South Troy, for two cays. Finally he was taken out by MURRAY, when McGEE took him to the Provost-Marshal's office, where he was enlisted as a substitute for THOMAS BUCKLEY. Of course Mr. B. knew nothing of these scandalous transactions. The sum of $600 was paid for him, but whether the boy received any or what portion of the money does not yet appear.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/08/archives/railway-traveling-from-a-letter-to-the-daily-news.html,,"The appalling murder committed with at least temporary impunity on a line of metropolitan railway by which thousands travel to and from the city every day, has very naturally raised the question as to how the traveling public, including not only ninetenths of the metropolis, but a large proportion of the whole community, may be best protected in future from exposure to such fearful risks. The only effectual method of doing this is undoubtedly that of establishing some system of communication between the passengers and the guards while the train is in motion. This question has more than once been talked about, officially inquired into, and discussed in this country; but as yet nothing has been done to correct the admitted and notorious dangers of our isolated and solitary-cell system of railway traveling. It will, however, be a most culpable neglect on the part of all concerned if, after the warnings we have just had in the murder of one passenger and the hair-breadth escape of another from a still more terrible fate, some reasonable precautions to prevent the recurrence of such atrocities are not generally adopted. The safety of the public in future imperatively; requires that the excitement of the present moment should be turned to practical account. The only wonder is that we have gone so long without the ordinary means of security in railway traveling, which, in some shape or other, have long since been adopted in every other quarter of the globe. The rapid development of our railway system, and the large annual increase in the passenger traffic, render the necessity of proper and effectual action in this vital matter more and more urgent. Something must be done at once to meet the obvious requirements of the public safety. It the government declines to interfere the appeal must be made to the railway companies themselves. Nor can it be supposed that the directors of these companies are insensible to their responsibility on this head, or unwilling to meet it at the loud and unanimous call of the travelling public. As intelligent and reasonable men they must know that the interests of the companies and the public in this matter are substantially indentical, and that the more completely they provide for safety and convenience of the public, the more effectualy will they in the end promote the interests of the capital and enterprise they represent.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RAILWAY TRAVELING.; From a Letter to the Daily News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RAILWAY TRAVELING.; From a Letter to the Daily News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/26355841-94fd-5283-859a-567bd907eed8,1081,nyt://article/26355841-94fd-5283-859a-567bd907eed8

Two weeks earlier, a Union General -- ROUSSEAU -- was in the heart of the rebel country, in Alabama; he found in a certain, village, named Loachapoka, a depot of rebel stores and a factory. These were very properly burnt, but the adjacent houses of the citizens were saved by the personal exertions of the General and his soldiers -- the latter putting their own wet blankets on the roofs. In Talladega, a Confederate gun-factory was broken up rather than burned, for fear that private houses might also suffer.

"About five o'clock Sunday morning Sergt. CRAFTS and Officer CAMPSIL, of the Forty-second Precinct Police, observed two suspicious looking men loitering about the corner of Plymouth and Main streets. On approaching them another man was seen coming through Plymouth-street with a lot of rope, and not being able to account for its possession in a satisfactory manner, was taken to the Station house. On going to the dock the officers discovered two boats, and also learned that a number of bags filled with allspice had been transferred to a junk-shop on the corner of Plymouth and Main streets. The police took possession of the boa[???]s and the officers visited the junk-shop, where they found eight bags of allspice, which had just been brought in. In the cellar they discovered a large quantity of allspice, cotton, new and old rope, sails, coffee, &c., which were taken to the Station-house, by order of Capt. JACOBS, where it now remains for identification. In working the case up the officers found that a large quantity of coffee had been removed from the junk-shop the day before. The expressman, who removed it, being found, said that he had taken it to WEDEMYER's store, in Raymond-street. The officers found there 9 1/2 bags coffee (1,281 pounds,) which had been sold to him by MULRANEY, the junkman. It was secured and conveyed to the Station-house. In connection with the above-named officers, policemen PEARCE and BOURNE succeeded in arresting HUGH MULRANEY, the keeper of the junkshop, PATRICK MALONE, and PATRICK BRESLIN, who are charged with stealing the goods and selling them to MULRANEY. The amount of property recovered is valued at $2,000. According to the account-books found, MALONE sold to MULRANEY, since July 2, coffee, wool, iron, rope, brass, &c., to the amount of $1,531 19. BRESLIN sold the same kind of goods since the same date, amounting to $323 75. The sugar and wool is supposed to have been stolen from the scene of the late fire at the root of Jerolamon-street.

It is nearly a month since they actually threatened Baltimore and Washington, and since the New-York militia were called upon to go to the assistance of the distressed citizens of the ""Keystone State."" During the whole of the interval which has since elapsed, the said citizens have not been for one moment free from panic. Large numbers of them have remained absent from their homes either as refugees in the fortified towns, or engaged in the pastoral occupation of driving their flocks and herds toward the northern part of the State, or in any other direction that promised safety from the raid. And during the whole of this period, too, it must be confessed, the soil of their State has never been entirely free from what is termed the ""polluting tread of the invader,"" or, in other words, the presence of a greater or less number of ragged marauders, commonly called ""raiders."" More than a week ago, about three hundred of them burned a town of considerable size, containing probably four times as many able-bodied male inhabitants as the whole attacking force, and one of the incendiaries being caught after the main body had departed, was duly ""stamped to death"" by the ""enraged citizens.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Raid and the Local Militia.; A PROCLAMATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Raid and the Local Militia.; A PROCLAMATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/91b1c45d-ddaf-51af-97f3-e87db915d3f8,778,nyt://article/91b1c45d-ddaf-51af-97f3-e87db915d3f8

Prof. HADLEY was one of those men whom this country can poorly spare. He was a scholar in the highest sense; with a mind so sensitive to truth, a judgment so candid and unbiased on all questions brought before it, with such patient powers of acquisition and such rich acquirements, that all who knew him expected noble fruits in his future gatherings in the great field of knowledge. Whatever opinion he settled upon, one felt it was formed under the pure influence of truth itself, and with no possible regard to any other consideration. He was but young, and has left behind no permanent memorial of himself, except in the lessons impressed upon the minds of his pupils in the Union Theological Seminary, and the affection and admiration of his friends. His great learning and long-polished and sharpened intellect, have been laid down in the service of his country, and shall appear no more among men. He had long desired most ardently to take part in this war for human rights, and had even attempted to enlist, but was prevented by various obstacles. Since June, he has been laboring in the service of the Sanitary Commission, at the front, for the benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers. In this noble work he was stricken down, and died -- as he would have prayed to die -- at the post of duty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Prof. Hadley's Death."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Prof. Hadley's Death."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bab0f9de-82ea-5932-af09-a00f651ffd0b,328,nyt://article/bab0f9de-82ea-5932-af09-a00f651ffd0b

The conclusion of the whole is that GRANT's campaign has been ""most unsuccessful.""

The rebels report that Fort Morgan sunk one of our monitors; but on the other hand admit that their great cuirassed ram, the Tennessee, surrendered after a desperate engagement, in which Admiral BUCHANAN lost a leg and was taken prisoner. Beside this, the Selma was captured; the Gaines was beached, and only the Morgan is reported safe and trying to escape.

Among the victims who suffered during that night, are GEORGE WEST, of No. 263 Broome-street, a man named SULLIVAN, and several others. There was in fact quite a gang of thieves on board who, no doubt, acted in concert, and according to previous arrangement. When the boat arrived at her dock in this City a man named BARNEY MCCLOSKEY, was arrested by Officer HULL, of the 57th Precinct, on suspicion of being one of the offenders. Before he was secured he threw away a pair of burglar's nippers. When MCCLOSKEY was searched an old-fashioned gold watch, with a small chain attached, one $20 bill on the Goshen Bank, New-York, one $10 bill on the Unadilla Bank, one $10 on the Cayuga Bank, and several other bank bills of smaller denominations, were found in his possession.

Mr. PETER COSG[???]GVE, of No. 100 Third-avenue, being unable to obtain a room, lay down in the saloon, and when he awoke he found that $700 in Treasury notes had been taken from him. Among the victims who suffered during that night, are GEORGE WEST, of No. 263 Broome-street, a man named SULLIVAN, and several others. There was in fact quite a gang of thieves on board who, no doubt, acted in concert, and according to previous arrangement. When the boat arrived at her dock in this City a man named BARNEY MCCLOSKEY, was arrested by Officer HULL, of the 57th Precinct, on suspicion of being one of the offenders. Before he was secured he threw away a pair of burglar's nippers. When MCCLOSKEY was searched an old-fashioned gold watch, with a small chain attached, one $20 bill on the Goshen Bank, New-York, one $10 bill on the Unadilla Bank, one $10 on the Cayuga Bank, and several other bank bills of smaller denominations, were found in his possession. He was taken before Justice HAGAN and committed to the Tombs.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe20edaa-6eb3-5f3f-8316-7ed2966339bc,585,nyt://article/fe20edaa-6eb3-5f3f-8316-7ed2966339bc

FREMONT runs against him because he disregards the Constitution, and WENDELL PHILLIPS speaks against him because he recognizes that instrument at all. Some censure his lenient method of treating the people of the Southern States, -- others his babarous and inhuman mode of carrying on the war. One set of politicians vilify him for not admitting the Southern States at once into the Union, and WADE and DAVIS, with equal malignity, brand him as a usurper for proposing to admit them at all.

The decision is one supported by various valid reasons, without requiring a recourse to be had to imputations on the fighting qualities of the negro. The disaster suffered by the Ninth Army Corps on the morning of Saturday, the 30th ult., is not a pertinent argument against the policy of employing black troops -- not more pertinent, at least, than the accidental success of the colored division would have been a sound argument on the other side. The majority of the Supervisors seem to think otherwise; or rather, instead of taking the simple ground that negroes are not to be had in numbers sufficient to make up more than the merest fraction of the call for reinforcements, they choose to make a party vote of it. This is unwise, to say the least. It should be sufficient, surely, for those who have the responsibility of dealing with this question, to know that dependence upon negro recruits, even in the matter of filling up the enrollment lists, would prove a delusion. Now, the simple fact is that our armies have not yet got at more than the scum of the black fighting material of the South.

Wealthy Men and the Public Service,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/10/archives/public-service-and-the-public-weal.html,Wealthy Men and the Public Service,"A correspondent, whose letter we published on Monday, commenting on what we recently said as to the unwillingness of our wealthy men to take office in the public service, ascribes much of this reluctance to the fact that those who might be disposed to do so, would find themselves so surrounded by persons so inferior in character and standing as to make their situation intolerable. In other words, that there is not much hope of getting a very large number of public offices filled by respectable men until all can be filled by them at the same time -- a consummation which, we need hardly say, we are not likely to witness. There must be a beginning. Some one of those who have made large fortunes, and have their time at their own disposal, must set the example of answering any call the country may make on them, before we shall ever see the practice become general. A wholesale rush of millionaires into the public service is not, in the nature of things, to be looked for all at once. The class has been too long excluded from it, and has lost the habits and ambition of office too thoroughly for it to be possible to recall them to the old paths in a day or even in a year. But this, so far from rendering it more excusable for those to whom a direct and personal appeal is made to do a given duty, to refuse to answer it, renders it really less so. If it were the fashion for rich men to devote their time to the service of the State, there would not be half as much merit in any one doing it, or half as much necessity for doing it as now. If a rich and honorable man takes office now, he is doubtless likely to find himself in the company of a very unsavory set, but this is part of the burden he is called on to bear. We should like to know, to recur to the contrast we drew in our former article on this subject, whether the young men who enter the army in thousands, always find their company select, of their associations agreeable; whether the camp is not, in a vast number of cases, an odious and repulsive change from refined and happy homes. When they set out to march and fight, and it may be live and die, in the society of Tom, Dick and Harry, of men of all grades, conditions and characters, it is certainly not asking too much of their well-to-do relatives, whose age or money, or lack of martial enthusiasm, saves them from the hardships and perils, of the field, to call on them to take charge of the Government offices at home, or sit in the Legislature, even at the risk of finding themselves now and then cheek by jowl with a hack, or adventurer, or jobber, to whom politics, like shoe or soap vending, is a trade, and nothing more.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Public Service and the Public Weal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Public Service and the Public Weal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f3fdf595-8509-57fc-a39d-fbb4fc44a7f0,1240,nyt://article/f3fdf595-8509-57fc-a39d-fbb4fc44a7f0

CURTIN's Message to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, the essential portions of which we publish to-day, is a State paper of no little interest. And if it has been partially inspired by a feeling of resentment at the jibes of unsympathizing sister States, it is none the less readable on that account. We might be inclined mildly to protest against being supposed to have indulged (speaking for this community) in any aspersions on the spirit and energy of the border people of Pennsylvania, which are not warranted by the Governor's own admissions in the paper before us. But it is hardly worth while to further contest the debatable ground. Only, let us ask Gov. CURTIN's attention, in the best spirit and temper, to one or two salient points in his own message, and let us ask him if these do not present a warranty for some of the comments which the helpless indifference of a portion of his commonwealth seemed to invite during the heat of these raids?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Protection of the Borders Gov.

LOGAN's official statement of the actual losses on our side, and of the computed losses on the enemy's side, in the great battle fought before Atlanta on the 22d of July, in which HOOD made his first great essay as Commander of the rebel army of the West. The desperateness with which HOOD went into the conflict has its illustration in divers ways. He made no less than seven attacks upon our lines during the day, each recoil being succeeded by a new effort, until his shattered columns could no longer be brought to time. Eighteen stand of colors were captured from him. He left 5,000 stand of arms in the field. We buried of his dead, or delivered up of his wounded, 3,220, and made prisoners of 1,017 more, including 33 officers of high rank. What proportion of the rebel wounded were taken care of by their own men can only be matter of imperfect estimate. Gen. LOGAN, however, says that it cannot be less than ten thousand in all. The total loss on our side was 3,521. The journals here which echo the Richmond press, in describing this as a victory for HOOD, might study Gen. LOGAN's official returns with profit. They will find that a few more such victories will reduce HOOD's responsibilities considerably.

"-- A very serious accident, resulting from the careless use of firearms, occurred yesterday, in the pawnbroker's office of Mrs. WOOD, in Grand-street. Two boys, named HENRY CRAWFORD and HUGO HIRSCH, were playing with a pistol, which it was supposed was not loaded.

Ireland; Emigration to United States; Debate in Parliament on,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/12/archives/american-topics-the-emigration-from-ireland.html,Ireland; Emigration to United States; Debate in Parliament on,"In the House of Commons, July 28, Lord E. HOWARD rose to call attention to the subject of emigration to the United States of America, in reference to the prolongation of the war now raging in that country; and moved an address for papers. The noble lord said that the gravity of the subject should be his justification for bringing it forward at that late period of the session. In consequence of his position as a member of the Distress Relief Committee at Glossop, one of the towns most affected by the cotton distress, he found it became necessary to have a census made of the population in that district, and one of the the elements of the census was the question of emigration. He found that a large emigration had prevailed from that district, and in the course of inquiries he found that it was also large from the cotton districts in general. In 22 towns taken promiscuously, from the cotton districs -- and he did not know that they were the largest towns -- within a few months, setting aside single men, of married men alone not fewer than 1,400 had left this country for the United States of America, of whom 780 had deserted their wives and families, leaving 2,160 persons chargeable upon the rates. Besides that, he had the names of 14 persons who had emigrated from one locality in Manchester within three months and of these, no less than twelve had also deserted their wives and families, and probably, most of these were young and newly married men. These circumstances tended to show that there must be some deep cause at work. It would not meet the argument to say that they had emigrated, intending afterward to send for their wives and families; because he knew that there had been instances in which the manufacturers of America had sent for manufacturing hands to England, paying the expenses of the voyage for themselves and their families, the agreement being that the amount so paid should be afterward deducted from their wages. He had further to say that great caution was exercised by the agents who were instrumental in taking these people out of the country, for they did not give written documents or money until the emigrants were sale on board the vessels which were to convey them to America. He would instance another case which showed how the emigrants were disposed of. He held in his hand a letter relating to the case of a man who was a private in the Manchester Volunteers. The letter was written by an officer of the corps, who stated that a young man in his company had been decoyed off to New-York. A companion of his had seen an advertisement in a newspaper stating that they would have permanent employment at the rate of 35[???]. per week. An interview was held between the young men (the volunteer) and the agent, and the former agreed to go to Canada. The statement made was that on their arrival in Canada employment would be obtained immediately. On this understanding six people were induced to emigrate. On arriving at Liverpool conveyances were waiting so carry them to the ship, and on being taken on board the Virginia they found that that vessel was bound to New-York, but they were told that on arriving there they would be reshipped for Canada. When they arrived at New-York they were provided with refreshment, and they were informed that they would be conveyed to Long Island. Before they were taken to Long Island the agent disappeared, and on arriving at the island two of the men enlisted. The young man in question made his escape, and hid himself in the hold of a Canadian steamer and returned to England, where he described himself as a ""miserable victim of Yankee rascality."" [Hear.] Nor was that a solitary instance. There was a case now before the Foreign Office, in New-York, with a letter or credit for £. He was drugged, robbed, and while in a state of stupefaction was enlisted into the Federal Navy. He believed that in all the large passenger ships sailing from Liverpool agents of the Federal Government were on board with a view of recruiting young men. He was told of such a case two days ago in which an emigrant was treated by a person on board an American passenger ship and invited to a house in New-York. He accepted the invitation, he was drugged with whisky, and the next thing of which he became conscious, was that he was a Federal soldier. He deserted, but was captured and placed in jail. If they opened any newspaper and referred to the police intelligence similar cases would be found. He had seen the case of a man from Hull who had been taken by force to an island near New-York -- no doubt Long Island -where he met with several other Englishmen who had been impressed info the Federal service, and it was complained that these outrages were constantly committed. There was another case in which a man received a check for £40, which sum he received from the Federal Government, and he was now in GRANT's army before Richmond. Mr. Justice FITZGERALD, in a charge he delivered the other day, referred to the terrible frequency with which such acts are committed. He had also in his possession a proclamation issued by the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland adverting to the subject. All these facts showed how patent the matter was. Many of these unfortunate men who had been enlisted in the Federal army would never return, for they had become food for powder. He thought it a great mistake to urge on emigration from this country, and he understood from a good authority that labor was becoming so scarce in England that if manufacturing should become active in Lancashire, the employers of labor would be embarrassed for want of laborers -- [hear, hear] -- and therefore if the manufacturers could find it possible to work their mills only to a small extent, it would be wise and prudent to do so. In addition to the large emigration which had been going on from this country, he found from the papers that about ten thousand persons had left Switzerland to join the Federal army. But to show what folly it was to emigrate at present, he would refer to a letter from a young man who was settled in Massachusetts, and he said that his wages of $9 a week were only equal to 16s., and that he was doing much worse than if he remained in England. He added that provisions and clothing were at enormous prices, and that his wages were not worth half as much as when he first went out to that country. Within the last few days papers had been presented to Parliament, and what was there stated was very much like a melo-drama, excepting that the jocose part was very little indeed. The scene opened with the conduct of two rascals who were acting with another, whom he might describe as an imp of the devil, in inducing people to emigrate to America from Ireland for the purpose of undertaking railway work. Not long ago, a cargo of these people, he might call them slaves, went out to America for the purpose of being employed on a railway, but on the voyage it was discovered that he had only one eye, and that although he would make a very good ""navy,"" he would not make a good soldier, and he was charged by the person in charge of the emigrants with having deceived him, so that it was evident that the men were required for soldiers. These people, upon arrival in America, were drugged with whisky, and then placed in the police cells, and they afterward found themselves in the Federal army. Many of them appealed to the British minister and to the consuls, and the end of it all was a large printed correspondence between the Government of America and the Foreign Office. It was said the premium was $700 for a recruit, but the wretches who enlisted these men managed to pocket as much as $500 of that sum themselves. In stating these facts to the House of Commons, he might add that he did not wish to make any charge against the American Government, but that he only desired to warn his fellow-countrymen against going to America at the present time, and he thought the only way to prevent them from being deluded, was to state these facts in that House. Lord LYONS, in one of his dispatches, stated that the number of British subjects who were serving in the United States army and navy was very considerable, and that complaints were constantly being received of the way in which those enlistments had been made. It seemed that no pains had been spared in investigating the cases brought to the knowledge of Lord LYONS, and every effort had been made to recover the men; but in few instances had the inquiries ended satisfactorily. [Hear, hear.] These men, who were kidnapped into the army of the United States, were both ignorant of and indifferent to the objects of the war, and yet if, under such circumstances they deserted, they were shot or otherwise punished. He wished to be fair to all parties, and, therefore, he must state that Major-Gen. DIX had taken steps to prevent, as far as he possibly could, this system of kidnapping from occurring again, but he feared that justice would not be done to those persons who had already been entrapped. He thought the persons who were engaged in obtaining these men for such a war were parties to the committal of murder. [Hear, hear.] Though he did not mean to say one word against the United States Government or their army -- for he cared not what form of Government the United States might have, whether it were monarchical, constitutional or republican, so that it protected industry and international right, and so that it did justice, and gave proper means for the employment of the energies of mankind, and was one under which human beings could with happiness live -- yet he hoped Her Majesty's Government would do all in their power to prevent these evils which were connected with emigration from going on. But what had become of the relatives of these people? There must be many in America whose earnest wish, he would venture to express was for peace. [Hear, hear.] What was the opinion of the man who was most competent to give an opinion? Earl RUSSELL, in his dispatch of 27th May, 1864, referred to the case of Irishmen enlisted at Portland and Boston, and gave the opinion, founded on the letters of Her Britannic Majesty's consuls, that these enlistments had been effected by the most fraudulent means, and in gross disregard of the neutral rights of this country. It appeared that the unfortunate emigrants when they landed at Portland, were plied with drink, and so induced to listen to the inducements which were held out to them. The recruiting sergeants gained access to them through the agency of the police authorities. These and other circumstances had induced him (Lord E. HOWARD) to bring the matter before the House. He had applied to the agents at Liverpool, but they had professed themselves unable to give any assistance in the matter. He hoped that Her Majesty's Government would use every exertion to distribute useful information on this subject throughout the country, so as to prevent our poorer fellow-subjects from being inveigled by American agents.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN TOPICS.; THE EMIGRATION FROM IRELAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMERICAN TOPICS.; THE EMIGRATION FROM IRELAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c8bed21-7dbb-563d-bf17-fc51494f234d,3321,nyt://article/1c8bed21-7dbb-563d-bf17-fc51494f234d

In a few minutes he returned to the street to find his horse and vehicle missing. The Dr. immediately went to the Twentieth Precinct Station-house, where he stated his case to the Sergeant in charge, at the same time describing his lost property. Officer ANDREWS was at once dispatched in pursuit of the horse-thief, and in about an hour after, that official saw a man driving at a furious rate in the upper part of Ninth-avenue. The horse and wagon which the man was driving answered the description that the Doctor had given, and ANDREWS, after much difficulty, succeeded in securing the driver, and also the property with which he was trying to make his escape. They were all taken to the Station-house, where, at a late hour, Dr. Von SCHOENING identified the horse and wagon as his. They are valued at $300.

The City Inspector added that the use of the Croton could not be guaranteed by the commission, for he himself was not allowed to use it now, even in Broadway. The Mayor was in favor of entertaining Mr. BADGER'S proposal, believing that the street manure properly belonged to the contractor who gathered it up, and that the expense limited by the Legislature relates only to moneyed compensation.

The article has special reference to the manifesto recently issued by Messrs. WADE and DAVIS, which is certainly the most extraordinary political paper of the day. It is by far the most effective Copperhead campaign document thus far issued, and we are not in the least surprised to find that it is to be issued in that form, and widely circulated by that party, for the purpose of aiding in the defeat of President LINCOLN. It seems difficult to believe that the authors of this paper could have deliberately aimed at such a result. For years they have been among the most prominent and effective advocates of, Republican principles. They have taken a leading part in all the acts and measures of the Republican party. They have sustained its doctrines, defended its action and sustained its candidates.

EDWARD DICEY, in the July number of Macmillan's Magazine, of which periodical Mr. DICEY was for some time the American correspondent. His letters were collected in two volumes, entitled Six Months in America, and are distinguished for fairness and impartiality. His acquaintance with HAWTHORNE commenced at Washington in the Winter of 1861, and extended to the limit of Mr. DICEY's stay in this country, including some time spent under HAWTHORNE's roof, at Concord. Mr. DICEY explains how, at Washington, circumstances threw them much together, leading to an intimacy that revealed an interior as different as possible from the icy chill of manner that shrouded to strangers the noivete and child-like simplicity really characteristic of the novelist. The paper is written with intelligence and good feeling, and deserves tranferrence to our journals, as, in the strife of war and other absorbing interests, scarcely justice has been done hitherto to HAWTHORNE in his own country.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edef19aa-2776-52b1-a299-da69a13eb44c,1638,nyt://article/edef19aa-2776-52b1-a299-da69a13eb44c

And Vienna Conference on Danish Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/14/archives/france-and-the-vienna-conference.html,And Vienna Conference on Danish Question,"The Vienna Conference has undertaken to effect what the London Conference failed to accomplish -- The solution of the Dano-German difficulty. That is, Prussia, Austria and King CHIRSTIAN have taken the matter out of the hands of the Western Powers, and have set about settling the question in their own way. But though they, as the actual parties to the squabble, have the best right to determine the grounds of compromise, it is not by any means certain that they will be permitted to do so. The conferring diplomats may decide indeed whether the Duchies are to be united in a single State, and whether the Danish sovereign or the Prince of AUGUSTENBURG, or his Russian rival, is to wield its sceptre; but beyond this, they will hardly be privileged to go. England doubtless, taught by past experience, will intermeddle no more in the business Such, however, is not the intention of France The rumor touching the contemplated annexation of the Danish Kingdom to the Germanic Confederation has evidently alarmed NAPOLEON, and aroused him from his apathy. The idea of a Germany with an extensive seaboard and a formidable navy, was not calculated to promote the tranquillity of the Imperial mind, and his Majesty determined to thwart, if possible, the consummation of this scheme. M. DROUYN DE LHUYS was accordingly instructed to address dispatches to the representatives of France at the Courts of Copenhagen, Vienna and Berlin, touching the negotiations in progress at the Austrian capital. These missives convey at once a warning and a menace to the belligerent Powers. The conferring Powers, says the French Minister, must not suppose they are free to act as they think proper because England declines to take part in the negotiations. If the arrangements entered into are contrary to equity and right, the hour of expiation will assuredly come. Should CHRISTIAN the Ninth manifest a greater regard for his personal interests than for the interests of the nation over which he was placed. by the Treaty of 1852 -- should he violate said treaty by ceding to Germany that portion of Schleswig the inhabitants of which are exclusively of Danish origin and character -- on what basis would rest his title to the Danish crown? Germany, of course, may sanction the annexation of a fragment of the Scandinavian race to her Confederation -- but, if she does, that Confederation ceases to be Teutonic, and she tramples on the Treaties of 1815. Now, the French would be the last of European Governments to find fault with Austria and Prussia for disregarding the acts of the Congress of Vienna. France, however, cannot, without protest, permit the desecration of an old right, merely that the pleasure of those Powers may be adopted as a substitute. If the old and written law, which fixes the limits of the Confederation, be cast to the winds, it must be only, on condition that it shall be replaced by the new law of the right of nationalities.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and the Vienna Conference.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and the Vienna Conference.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a44e8148-ec67-5d4a-97a9-b9528445c416,871,nyt://article/a44e8148-ec67-5d4a-97a9-b9528445c416

The corporate limits extend six miles north and south, and two for three miles west from the river. The thickly inhabited part of the city, however, extends for about a mile along the river, and nearly the same distance back to the westward. The site of the city is a sandy plain,gradually rising as it recedes from the water. The streets are generally regular, well paved and shaded, There are several fine public buildings, among which is a handsome market-house, with rooms for the municipal officers in the upper story. The Customhousehas also accommodations for the Post-office and United States Courts. Among the other noticeable buildings are the theatre, Odd Fellows' and Temperance Halls, Guard-house and tower, and the Barton Academy, occupied by the Public Schools, There are two banks, a savings bank, twenty-three churches, (three Baptist, one Bethel, four Episcopal, eight Methodist, four Presbyterian, and three Roman Catholic, including a fine cathedral, now [1860] nearly completed.) a Jewish synagogue, three orphan asylums, an infirmary conducted by the Sisters of Charity, a city and a marine hospital, several other benevolent institutions, and a literary society with a good library. A medical college was founded in 1859, and has a spacious edifice in course of erection. The suburban villages of Turnerville, Toulminville. Jacksonville, Summerville, Spring Hill, Cottage Hill, &c. near the city, are well supplied with churches and schools. St. Joseph's College, at Spring Hill, and the Academy of the Visitation, (for girls,) in Summerville, are flourishing institutions, under Roman Catholic control. There are many handsome villas and cottages in the suburbs and environs. Mobile is lighted with gas, and supplied with water of unusual purity and excellence, which is brought a little more than five miles, from the foot of Spring Hill. The construction of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which is to connect Mobile with Cairo, at the mouth of the Ohio River, and is now (1860) approaching completion, promises to give fresh impetus to its trade. The Mobile and great Northern Road, also inactive progress, will connect it with Montgomery and the roads leading thence to all Darts of the Eastern States. Several city and neighborhood railroads are about to be constructed.

APPLETON & CO.'s enterprise is, even yet, not so generally understood as it deserves to be, or there is scarcely an individual or family of ordinary intelligence who would be without it. It is within the daily experience of us all that the information most difficult to collect, and most commonly wanted, is that relating to the occurrences of recent years, too little removed from the present to come within the cognizance of ""standard"" works of reference, and too distant to allow the overtasked memory alone to be a safe guidance. Here APPLETON'S ""Annual Cyclopaedia"" at once comes in, and whatever the occurrence sought for -- if at all likely to interest futurity, or have any bearing upon the great social and political interests that govern the world -- will be found to furnish an account of it, under the year in which it happened, sufficiently full and minute for all general purposes. The significance of a work of this kind is so great, that no nation can be said to understand its own history and career, or entertain a proper sense of its responsibilities in the eyes of history, which does not possess such a record, where the chief prominence is given to national events, and where the lessons of the past may at once be read, and the springs of events now transpiring around us, carefully observed. England and France have long ago felt the necessity of a work of this kind, and the great name of EDMUND BURKE is associated with the youth of the ""Annual Register."" now venerable in its career of one hundred and six years. During this long interval of time the original form and arrangement of the volume was adhered to until the present year, when important changes were introduced assimilating the work in many respects to its foreign juvenile rivals. Without sets of the ""Annual Register,"" and the French ""Annuaire des deux Mondes,"" no library can pretend to passable completeness, and the ""Annual Cyclopaedia"" is even already effectually claiming for itself a similar position. To assimilate the work to the ""New American Cyclopaedia,"" an alphabetical arrangement of the matter is adopted; this, though open to some objections, is not carried out to a fatiguing extent, -- two hundred and twenty titles are made to include the entire extent of incidents, &c.; and of these, seventy are separate biographical notices of deceased persons considered too renowned to be consigned to the general ""obituary"" head, where the dead of less celebrity are massed together. The editor is perhaps right in calling 1863 ""the most turbulent year which the country has witnessed;"" at all events, it was one both at home and abroad, full of movement and progress, when principles adopted in previous years were now daily going into effect and manifesting their results. It was not a year that settled any great questions, but rather one that afforded free play for the strife and clash of opposing views and theories as well as for that of the more material forces to which mankind has yet to confide for the attainment and propagation of ultimate reason. For every American, the two organizations where the greatest, amount of interest centres, either as a man or a citizen, are those represented in the ""Annual Cyclopaedia"" by the heads,Army of the United States and Army Operations,"" and ""Congress U.S.""; and in both departments the information furnished will be found of the fullest and amplest description. The difficulty of furnishing a clear and comprehensive record of a series of operations so vast in their nature, and carried on over a territory of such immense extent as those which have engaged the national armies during the past year, is very great; but it has been ably overcome, and the narrative is everywhere supported by the authentication of official documents and illustrated by excellent topographical maps and military plans of every important region. The new and engrossing questions that during the same period came under the discussion of Congress will give permanent value to the copious summary of its debates here preserved in an accessible form. Among those most prominent are: Confiscation, Emancipation, Indemnity, official and pecuniary; the Relation of the Insurrectionary States to the Union; Personal Liberty; Martial Law; Prize; the Liability of Great Britain for Damage done by Privateers, &c., &c. ""Finance"" also forms a division second to none in interest. Here will be found ably collected and condensed all the material for estimating the extent of the strains made upon the national resources by the demands of the war, and the generous confidence or the people by which it has been satisfactorily met. European History -- Industrial Interests -- Scientific Researches -- Geographical Explorations -- The Progress of Literature and Publication -- Ecclesiastical Movements -- &c., all meet with their due portion of attention, and offer something attractive to everyone who is desirous of keeping up with the progress of the race. It may be proper to observe that, as in a former volume, a lynx-eyed scrutiny was supposed to have discovered some leanings to a particular system of polity, the publishers assure us that the greatest efforts have been made to preserve the Annual Cyclopedia ""free from every mark of partisanship.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE AMERICAN ANNUAL CYCLOPAEDIA AND REGISTER OF IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE YEAR 1863 Embracing Political, Civil, Military and Social Affairs, Public Documents, Biography, Statistics, Commerce, Finance, Literature, Science, Agriculture, and Mechanical Industry.

Instead of dropping down the river, the fleet on Saturday passed up, and landed the troops at Deep Bottom, near Dutch Gap.

Lord PALMKRSTON, in responding to the toast of ""Her Majesty's Ministers,"" said: ""In guiding this country through difficulties of the greatest magnitude, we have been influenced by the combined consideration, on the one hand, to maintain the honor and the dignity, and to defend the interests of the country; and, on the other hand, not precipitately, or without due and great and overpowering cause, to involve this country in the calamities of war. [Cheers.] We trust we have succeeded in maintaining the position of England among the nations of the world, while at the same time we have secured to the people of this country the blessings and the advantages of peace."" Lord RUSSELL, in returning thanks for the House of Lords, dealt with a different subject. ""You have recalled,"" he said, ""a time now long passed, when questions of civil and religious liberty were discussed throughout the country; and you have, Sir, very fairly made some just reflections upon the character and general conduct of the House of Lords. It is quite true that the House of Lords have sometimes thought that the opinion of the people was an opinion hastily taken up, and that it was not founded upon that due consideration of the various parts of the Constitution which it was desirable to preserve, and that further time ought to be given for the consideration of those opinions; but I think you have always seen that when the House of Lords considered that the public, upon due reflection and further consideration, thought any particular measure was useful to the country, and that it would not weaken the British Constitution, the House of Lords has never interposed its own special opinion as a veto to that well-considered opinion of the people. [Cheers.] That was the case in respect to the Reform Bill."" His Lordship then referred to the Reform Bill and proceeded: ""May I be permitted to hope that 33 years hence, when the discussions which have been so well and so ably conducted during the present year shall have passed partly into oblivion, that then those who live at that time will acknowledge that the Ministers of 1864 had not ill-consulted the honor of their country, did not ill-consider the interest of the country in the course which they pursued during the year, entangled as their path was with difficulty, and objected to as their course was at that time by some persons -- I trust that at that time the course which the Government have pursued will be confirmed and sanctioned by calm and deliberate opinion, and that they will receive credit for being guided by honest intentions and patriotic wishes to serve the country in the course which they had determined to pursue. Nations on the Continent which have forgotten or overlooked the duties of improvement and reform have encountered the evil of violent tumult and revolution. They have gone on tumultuously and rapidly in the way of change. I trust that in this country there will always be found a desire carefully to study its institutions, and a resolution to destroy abuses where they exist and to reform those institutions where they can be usefully reformed. I trust that the people and Government will always continue that determination with a fixed resolve to respect the great framework of our Constitution; because I am persuaded that, imperfect as all human institutions are, still, never did man frame a constitution which more happily combined respect for religion, regard for liberty, respect and loyalty for the throne, together with the preservation of the rights of every individual who lives under the sceptre of the throne. I am convinced that no people ever did combine these great and essential elements of prosperity and happiness so completely as the English people now do."" [Cheers.] In conclusion, the noble Earl stated that, in regard to foreign, as well as to the domestic affairs of the country, he trusted that the Administration, of which he had the honor to form a part, would not be considered unworthy of the approbation of the country.

Yesterday, as is the imprudent custom of many of our down town merchants, a small boy was sent by his employer with a bag containing $5,000 in gold, intended for a broker in Wall-sheet. Arriving at the office of the broker the boy placed the gold on the counter, but was told by a person behind it that the principal was not in, and that he (the speaker,) had nothing to do with the office business. A man who was standing outside of the counter, and who probably heard this reply, approached the boy, saying, ""All right, senny, leave the bag; they all know me; I'll 'tend to it for you, and see it's all right."" The unsuspecting boy, glad to be relieved of his charge, and also of the necessity of waiting, left the office, thinking of course that everything was all right, and that the stranger was every gentlemanly man.

Intelligencer and Wade Manifesto; and Peace--Wade Manifesto,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/18/archives/president-lincoln-and-peace.html,Intelligencer and Wade Manifesto; and Peace--Wade Manifesto,"The National Intelligencer notices our strictures upon the recent manifesto, and the general political temper, of Messrs. WADE and DAVIS not to controvert them, but to claim that they apply with equal force to the Administration in its conduct of the war. We denounced what we deem the ultra radicalism and barbarism which have characterized the action of these gentlemen ever since the war began. The Intelligencer says that inasmuch ""as they have previously uttered no complaint against the Administration,"" their theory of the war must be presumed to be that of the Administration itself. This is a non sequitur. Even if the fact alleged were true, the inference of the Intelligencer would not follow. They may have been restrained from complaining of the Administration at an earlier day, by many other motives than a full concurrence in its policy. They may have expected or desired office under it, and therefore kept silent. They may have lived and labored in the hope of inducing or forcing the President, sooner or later, to accept their dictation, and therefore have forborne earlier denunciation. Or, their sense of duty and responsibility to the country -- their desire to quell the rebellion and save the Union -- may have restrained them from openly assailing the Government by which alone that vast and imperative work can be accomplished. These motives might possibly have kept them still -if they had kept to themselves the discontent which has at last broken out in the fierce and intemperate manifesto with which they have lately delighted the breast of every rebel and Copperhead in the land.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'President Lincoln and Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'President Lincoln and Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/55c5a6c2-09bc-53bd-8258-46708d187d19,1564,nyt://article/55c5a6c2-09bc-53bd-8258-46708d187d19

The following are the facts: The emigrant-train left Jersey City at 18:15 P.M., and upon arriving near Augusta Bridge, about forty miles out, had slackened speed to about twelve miles an hour, being near the point at which the milk-train passes. Following was an extra freight-train, which must have been running at a fast speed, as it overtook and ran into the emigrant-train. The concussion was so great that the platforms were crushed instantly, killing six-emigrants, who were riding on the platforms, but no person inside was seriously injured. The conductor, MATTHEW FINN, who was in the rear car, saw the head-light of the approaching train, and running out on the platform, was also killed. Two of the freight cars jumped the track, and in less than half a minute after, came down and ran into the freight cars, demolishing one of them and damaging the engine.

Stores in Maryland; Sheridan Explodes Theory of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/18/archives/rebel-subsistence-and-transportation.html,Stores in Maryland; Sheridan Explodes Theory of,"Gen. SHERIDAN long ago proved himself a brave soldier, and yesterday proved himself a sensible man, by exploding the commonly believed theory that the rebels had procured from Maryland an immense amount of supplies. Gen. SHERIDAN, in his dispatch to the War Department published yesterday, indicates that the rebels obtained fromMaryland only sufficient to last them while they were in transitu, and that EARLY's train does not exceed 250 wagons. Gen. SHERIDAN knows that it is simply impossible for a force of 15,000 or 20,000 men to invade a State, as rich even as Maryland, in the face of an active enemy, and gather and send off supplies to any extent, at the same time subsisting itself. When the rebels crossed the Potomac, they, of course, brought little or nothing. Whatever supplies they had were left behind. To subsist 20,000 men in an enemy's country requires that at least one-fourth of that force be employed in collecting the supplies for daily subsistence, and the whole force must be kept in motion daily, for it will completely exhaust everything for miles around its encampment and along its line of march. Without resistance, it might accumulate supplies to some extent, but even then it must have time, and must use its whole force in the work. Gen. SHERIDAN is right when he says, ""the stories about accumulated plunder from Maryland are untrue."" He also puts EARLY's train at 250 wagons. During the late raid, we were daily amused by the report that ""EARLY's train numbered at least 1,200 wagons."" This would make a wagon-train twelve miles long, and of greater proportions than is possessed by even the Army of the Potomac at this date.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBEL SUBSISTENCE AND TRANSPORTATION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBEL SUBSISTENCE AND TRANSPORTATION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f716ce7-3567-5950-a940-212f5d886f69,282,nyt://article/8f716ce7-3567-5950-a940-212f5d886f69

The testimony given before the jury showed that there was a wedding on Sunday night, at No. 92 Henry-street, which was attended by deceased, MCGRATH, and a large number of their friends. As the party was about to break up at 2 1/2 o'clock in the morning, a quarrel occurred between deceased and MCGRATH, in regard to the singing of a song, whereupon deceased left the house and started toward his home. He had gone but a short distance when MCGRATH overtook him, and, without any previous warning, plunged a dirk knife into his abdomen. The wound inflicted was such as to cause death soon after. He was a native of Ireland, aged 27 years. MCGRATH, who was arrested at the time, was yesterday committed to the Tombs to await an indictment by the Grand Jury.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c12377ce-1c34-5a25-b351-969ae8c3a7e6,720,nyt://article/c12377ce-1c34-5a25-b351-969ae8c3a7e6

He is much more of a representative man, moreover, than the Democrats have been in the habit of nominating.

The work of Sunday, however, was not achieved without sacrifices; the Tenth and the Second Corps having lost, between them, over five hundred in killed and wounded. One brigade of the Second Division of HANCOCK's corps, under Col. MACY, in its fearless pursuit of the rebels, attempted to charge through a ravine which was intersected by a stream and an almost impassable swamp. The ravine was commanded by rebel artillery from the opposite heights, and Col. MACY was at last compelled to shelter his men from the enemy's fire as best he could, and to retire under cover of night.

The late lessee was a prudent man in times of storm and theatrical hauger, but it was a little wearisome that when the weather had cleared he still persisted in running his vessel under bare poles, with the hatches all battened down, the grog stopped, and the entire crew on half allowance.

If, therefore, we now feel profoundly overcome with the fact of another captain having stepped upon deck, it is certainly not with mad agony or wild regret at the loss of the old one. Mr. STUART's antecedents afford us the best promise of the future of the Winter Garden. In association with Mr. BOUCICAULT, and alone, he has produced more new (original) plays than any other manager, and in a style that has long since ceased to be common, so rapidly has the theatre degenerated during the period of his retirement.

Execution of Chiefs of Revolutionary Committee,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/20/archives/the-last-act-in-the-tragedy-of-the-polish-rebellion.html,Execution of Chiefs of Revolutionary Committee,"-- The Czar of Russia, having crushed out the Polish rebellion and the Revolutionary Government about a year ago, is now engaged in the work of hanging the leaders of the revolt. It will be remembered that while that great rebellion was in actual progress, it maintained profound secrecy as to who were its leaders, and as to its means and agencies of operation. The ""Revolutionary Committee,"" or ""National Government,"" was a secret affair; secret as to its members and as to its plans, while its edicts were issued in secret and executed secretly by mysterious agents. It issued orders for the assassination of obnoxious persons, and vast numbers were suddenly and unexpectedly slain by they knew not whom. Some of its active military chiefs were of course known; but both in field and cabinet, it tried to wrap itself in mystery. It assumed for a time very formidable proportions, and had it got the assistance that was promised from England and France, it might have achieved success. But the immense armies of Russia, when fairly set in motion, soon broke it down, and reduced it to a mere guerrilla war, which also in turn was crushed out; and all the notice we now find of the late Polish ""Revolution"" is such as is conveyed in the following telegram from ""Warsaw, under date of the 5th inst.:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LAST ACT IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE POLISH REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LAST ACT IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE POLISH REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24ad3195-c08f-55b3-8c32-54ef3af8e01d,300,nyt://article/24ad3195-c08f-55b3-8c32-54ef3af8e01d

"Mr. JOHN H. TALLMAN, for a long series of years a dry goods jobber and cotton factor in Pearl-street, died Friday, Aug. 12, at his residence in West Nineteenth-street. Mr. TALLMAN was in the eighty-eighth year of his age at the time of his decease, and up to his last illness had enjoyed almost uninterrupted health during his whole life. He was a native of Dutchess County, and came to New-York nearly seventy years ago, when there were less than 50,000 inhabitants. There was but one banker and an insurance company at that time in this City. Many years since he retired from business, but his large wealth and extensive real estate possessions kept him active as a man and diligent in financial circles. Mr. TALLMAN was well known in Wall street for his energy of character and the integrity of all his dealings. His rigid habits of temperance and constant daily exercise kept him vigorous, and nothing but an exhausted nature, from a most painful malady (dry gangrene in the foot) removed him from his family circle and the duties of life. Mr. TALLMAN's memory was remarkable, relating events of sixty years' standing with great accuracy, and repeating readily any verse or chapter in the Bible with ease. He was a genial old gentleman, a kind neighbor and an affectionate husband and father, dying in full communion with the Episcopal (Trinity) Church.

Waste and Prices,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/20/archives/our-habits-of-waste.html,Waste and Prices,"The evening journals of the City are well employed in laying bare the extortions daily practiced upon housekeepers. The strictures, it is true, will fall ineffectual upon the ears of the extortioners. But the housekeeper will listen and will listen most attentively. And this is probably, after all, what is most needed, if we are to reach the prime source of the evil. The farmer and the middleman may be, lectured till doomsday. We may appeal to the dairyman, who asks forty-five and fifty cents a pound for his butter by wholesale, that there is nothing to warrant his demanding such a price. He may be told that he pays barely 25 per cent, more for his labor than he paid two years ago, when he was content with twenty cents a pound for his butter. He may be reminded that he grows his own wool and wears it in flannels and in clothes; that sugar, tea and coffee are almost the only necessaries of household consumption he is taxed for at the Customs; and that the price of exchange only affects him as compared with others in an infinitesimal degree.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/21/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The situation before Petersburgh a new and deeper interest this morning. The official dispatch from Secretary STANTON, giving the brief but clear dispatches of Gen. GRANT up to Friday evening at 9 o'clock, invest the operations before Petersburgh with great magnitude. Two more serious engagements have been fought. On Thursday evening, the 18th, the rebels came out from their works on the north side of the James and attacked the Tenth Corps, under Gen. BIRNEY, which was in a fortified position. The attack was furious, but was repulsed with very severe loss to the enemy. Gen. BIRNEY says that the loss was not less than one thousand, and adds that the colored troops behaved handsomely. In front of one of the colored regiments eighty-one dead rebels were found. On the morning of the 18th Gen. WARREN's corps moved out of its position to the left, and soon [???]lanted itself across the Weldon Railroad, about one mile south of their works. From that point he advanced toward Petersburgh, meeting the enemy as he moved forward. He had considerable fighting during the day, but the loss was light. On Friday evening the rebels came out and made an attack on WARREN's right, with the evident intention of cutting off his connection with the old line in front of Petersburgh. He drove in our pickets and pressed back two of WARREN's divisions, when a severe battle ensued, in which the rebels were driven back and our lines reestablished. This is the latest news received at the War Department from Gen. GRANT. It is estimated that the rebel loss in the various engagements of last week amount to fully four thousand men.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17ef797f-e2bb-5b7f-b95b-2d323574cbfe,592,nyt://article/17ef797f-e2bb-5b7f-b95b-2d323574cbfe

It appears that she has a perfect right to secede from the Confederacy -- a better one, because more solemnly secured, than she had to secede from the United States; but should she attempt to exercise it, the Confederacy will instantly make war upon her. This act of aggression would of course not be committed because she seceded, but because, having seceded, the United States would probably not acknowledge her neutrality, and would still use her territory as a base of operations against the remainder of the rebels. The duty of self-preservation would therefore impose upon the Confederacy an obligation to treat her as an enemy, to march armies into her, seize her strongholds, gather her crops, levy contributions on her towns, drive out her inhabitants, carry off her negroes, and do all other things, if any others there be, which would be necessary to prevent the enemy's deriving any aid or succor from her.

Royal Sovereign; Turret-ship,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/21/archives/the-royal-sovereign.html,Royal Sovereign; Turret-ship,"The iron-cased turret ship Royal Sovereign, Capt. SHERARD OSBORN, C.B., arrived in Portsmouth harbor, on Saturday, from her short cruise outside the Isle of Wight, on which she started from off Osborne immediately after the visit of Her Majesty to the ship on Thursday evening. The return of the ship to Portsmouth harbor is solely owing to orders given some time since by the Admiralty to place her in dock at the earliest opportunity, in order to remove the band of zinc which is now fixed round the ship below the water line, and between the armor plating and the Muntz metal sheathing on the ship's bottom, and substitute in lieu of it a wooden band, on a plan which has been approved by the Admiralty. It is also understood that a peculiar kind of cement, simple in application and not expensive, which has been brought under the notice of the Admiralty by Capt. COLES, will be applied experimentally to that portion of the ship's armor plating below the water line. If successful, the experiment may probably help materially in the solution of the problem lately referred to by Lord CLARENCE PAGET in the House of Commons -- how to preserve and keep clean the bottoms of iron ships on service in tropical waters. The Royal Sovereign's necessarily short cruise, from which, she returned on Saturday, only extended to about 20 miles south of St. Catherine's, in a parallel line with the Isle of Wight, quite far enough from the land to test her rolling properties had the wished-for breeze been met with; but, although a nice Summer channel-breeze -- southwesterly -- was found, it was accompanied with no great swell, and a greater roll could not be got out of the ship than five degrees each way. Enough, however, was seen to give the officers every confidence in their ship under ordinary circumstances at sea, and it is evidently unnecessary to wish for any further confidence to be placed in the sea-behavior of a craft which, after all, is only a conversion, and is merely being used as a floating means of testing Capt. COWPER COLES' principle of working monster ordnance on board ship by means of revolving platforms, protected by cylindrical armor.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ROYAL SOVEREIGN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ROYAL SOVEREIGN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, Aug. 2', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Aug', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d5712d3-7621-51cb-bf6c-74ed59a91495,920,nyt://article/4d5712d3-7621-51cb-bf6c-74ed59a91495

It appears that self-destruction is at its maximum between the ages of 30 and 40; that it commences between 10 and 15, and dwindles to almost nothing after 70, which is not surprising, the suicides between 10 and 20 being three times more numerous than those committed after the age of 70 years. As regards the supposed causes -- for, in his case, there must be a margin left for imperfection if judgment -- it appears that insanity and suicidal monomania account for more than one-quarter of the whole; drunkenness and disgust of life, each, about one-tenth; absolute poverty for nearly the same proportion; misfortune and incurable, diseases, each, for nearly as many; [???], and close upon these, come disappointed love, domestic misery and misconduct of the suicide himself; accusation of theft stands for about one in in 26; fever and delirium for one in 33; and vexation caused by the remonstrances of others about one in 57. This, however, applies only to the made sex; in the case of women insanity stands fast, disappointed affection second, disgust of life third, drunkenness fourth, starvation fifth, domestic misery sixth, and incurable disease seventh. As regards the mode adopted out of the 1,766 cases recorded at the Morgue, 1,414 had recourse to drowning, 114 to hanging, 38 to firearms, 56 to the fumes of charcoal, 46 precipitated themselves from buildings or other elevated places, 16 made use of cutting weapons and instruments, 11 only had recourse to poison, 7 threw themselves beneath railway or other carriages, and 4 killed themselves by swallowing alcohol. Another table informs us that more than one-third of the whole of these suicides were committed between the hours of six in the morning and mid-day; while the first two hours of the afternoon exhibit by far the smallest number -- not one-tenth, as compared with the six preceding hours of the day. The number of females who committed suicide is scarcely more than a fifth of that of the male sex. It is a striking proof of the influence of misery on suicide -- unless, indeed, it be an evidence of a superstitious dread -- that only about one in six of the suicides was buried at the expense of his family or friends.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MORGUE OF PARIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MORGUE OF PARIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b0dc379-9f58-5b4a-b8e5-70c7dac45a2d,423,nyt://article/5b0dc379-9f58-5b4a-b8e5-70c7dac45a2d

One section, called the Rose, from the bronze has-relief of roses over it contains the famous Rossenwein, which is now two centuries and a half old. There, six large casks of Rhine wine. Johannisherg, and as many of Hocheimer, were placed in 1624. In the adjacent p[???] of the same division of the collar are twelve large casks, bearing the names of the Apostles, and containing wines not less precious, but not so aged by a few years; the wine bearing the name of Judas is considered the best. The other parts of the cellar are occupied with wines of a subsequent growth. By degrees, as a few bottles of Rosenwein are drawn off, the casks are filled up with Apostle wine, and that with some sort still younger, and so on, in such a manner that the different casks are always kept very nearly full. A single bottle of Rosenwein now represents an immense value. A cask of wine containing 1,000 bottles cost, in 1624, 1,200f. Calculating that sum at compound interest with the expense of cellarage, a bottle would positively cost 10,895,232f; and a glass or eighth part of a bottle, about 1,361,90[???]. The Rosewein and Apostle wines are never sold but to citizens of Bremen. The burgomasters have, alone permission to draw a few bottles, and to send them as presents to Sovereigns. A citizen of Bremen may, in case of serious illness, procure a bottle of 20f. on his obtaining the certificate of his doctor and the cons[???] of the municipal council. A poor inhabit of B[???] may obtain a bottle grat[???]s, after having [???] certain formalities. A citizen has also the [???] of demanding a bottle when he receives [???] celebrated personage at his house as guest.

Vallandigham's Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/21/archives/vallandighams-views.html,Vallandigham's Views,"The highest testimony that has lately been given touching the qualifications of Mr. LINCOLN for the Presidential office in the present crisis, has been given by VALLANDIGHAM in the course of his recent address to the Copperheads of Dayton, Ohio. After showing the imperative necessity of nominating a peace candidate at the Chicago Convention, and portraying the evils which would result from the election of a War Democrat, the Copperhead chief frankly declared ""that if they wanted a War President, they had as good a one as they could get in the person of LINCOLN."" ""I would as soon,"" said Mr. V., ""be drafted under him as under a War Democrat; and I would agree with ABRAHAM, that it is no time to swop horses while swimming a river."" It would be going rather far to infer from this that VALLANDIGHAM and the Copperheads will vote for the reelection of Mr. LINCOLN, if they cannot effect the nomination of a disunion peace candidate at Chicago; but it is nevertheless a frank admission by the coryphaeus of that party, that, in his opinion, Mr. LINCOLN is the best candidate for the Presidential Chair, if the people would have the rebellion crushed, and the integrity of the Union restored. Nay, he virtually avows his belief that the public interests would suffer were a President to be elected who, with none of the advantages derived from experience and acquaintance with affairs, should yet have to tread in the footsteps and pursue the policy of the present Chief Magistrate. He wants a President who would stop the war, withdraw our armies from the South, and proclaim in effect to the Governments of Europe that the North had been defeated in the conflict, and that the time for their recognition of the Confederacy was arrived. He probably thinks, too, that C.L. VALLANDIGHAM would be just the beau ideal of a President to carry out this programme; but, lest the delegates to the Chicago Convention should prove so obtuse as not to be able to discover the beauty of his policy, or his superior fitness for the Presidential office, he magnanimously acknowledges beforehand that he esteems his rival, ""Old ABE,"" to be in the second degree most worthy of the honor, -- following, in this case, the example of the Grecian admirals, who, after the Persian war, assigned to themselves respectively the first rank in merit, but unanimously assigned the next to THEMISTOCLES.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Vallandigham's Views."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Vallandigham's Views."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ad0c5a7-90b8-5659-9579-3f8dcb71fea9,407,nyt://article/9ad0c5a7-90b8-5659-9579-3f8dcb71fea9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/21/archives/the-kidnapping-case.html,,"At the Thames Police Court, on Saturday, HOWLAND, one of the summoning officers of the court reported to Mr. PAGET the result of his inquiries relating to a seaman named GEORGE LA PIERRE. It will be recollected that LA PIERRE'S statement was that he went to America as a seaman in the English ship Universe, was kidnapped in New-York by crimps, and taken on board the American ship, the Caroline Nasmith, in which he was obliged to work as a seaman on the voyage to London without wages and with not any change of clothes. He is a native of Quebec and a British subject. HOWLAND believed that the representations of LA PIERRE were in the main correct. The chief mate of the [???] Nasmith admitted that he had been ""Shangh[???]d' at New-York -- meaning that he was [???] on board drunk, after being kidnapped. He added [???] this practice was common there. The seaman complained that he had been taken on board after the vessel got to sea and that he [???] [???] to much work, as he was afflicted with a bad leg. The mate added that he thought there would be a piece of work in England about the way in which the man was taken on board in New-York. HOLAND afterward saw Capt. COTTER, the master of the Caroline Nasmith, who said that he paid $80 to an agent in New-York to bring him a man on board, and that LA PIERRE was a deserter from the ship, and owed him $50. The Captain admitted that it was very probable the seaman had not received any [???]ey, but he had nothing to do with that. He asked Capt. COTTER if the seaman had signed any articles of agreement, to which the Captain replied in the affirmative. He asked to see the articles, and the Captain said they were ""up town,"" and he could not see them. HOWLAND, in conclusion, said the seaman was in a wretched plight, and had no change of clothes or linen, and that he had, by direction of the magistrate, provided him with board and lodging at a coffee-house in Stepney. The seaman wanted to teach Liverpool, where his ship, the Universe, in which he sailed from England, was lying. His wife was also living there. A society for the protection of sailors, with which the Marquis TOWNSHEND was connected, had sent for the particulars of LA PIERRE's case, and meant to interfere on his behalf Mr. PAGET said the sailor's case appeared to be a very hard one. He directed HOWLAND to continue his care of the sailor for the present, and he would decide in a few days what was to be done with him.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE KIDNAPPING CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE KIDNAPPING CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Liverpool Mercury, Aug. 2', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Aug', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b8a0490-b312-53ea-82ba-6b421df7c671,455,nyt://article/9b8a0490-b312-53ea-82ba-6b421df7c671

Dr. HUBBARD WINSLOW, the author and clergyman, whose death we have lately announced, was born in Vermont near the commencement of this century, and came by direct line of descent from the Mayflower WINSLOWS. Both of Mr. WINSLOW'S brothers, Rev. MYRON WINSLOW, D.D., LL.D., of India, and the late Dr. WINSLOW, of the Sanitary Commission, have made themselves eminent in their callings. HUBBARD WINSLOW graduated with promise at Yale College, and entered the ministry of the Congregational Church. He soon rose to a high degree of eminence as a preacher. In 1831-2 his first volume, entitled ""Doctrine of the Trinity,"" was published. It was at a time when the public mind was deeply engrossed by the contests in New England between the Unitarian and Trinitarian parties. This work found its way over the ocean and was read by Dr. CHALMERS, who called it the ablest treatises on that topic that had then appeared. Mr. WINSLOW was then settled in Dover, N.H.; but when old Dr. LYMAN BEECHER left Boston in 1832, his mantle unanimously fell upon the young and rising minister. A successful pastorate of twelve years in Boston gave Mr. WINSLOW a wide reputation, both as a preacher and writer. The church numbered several of the most influential citizens of Boston, and its growing strength repeatedly colonized sister churches. A large part of Dr. WINSLOW's time and labor was given to the welfare of young men. and his Young Men's Aid, has been read by hundreds of thousands of young men. Reprinted in England, it found a ready and an immense sale, Mr. WINSLOW's partiality for philosophy led him to devote much time to that department of study. He published several philosophical tracts, and wrote largely for the reviews.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; REV. DR. WINSLOW. COL. A.D.

"The Poona Observer, of June 21, contains an account of a visit paid on the preceding day to the Free Church Institution in Poona by Dr. LIVINGSTONE, who was at the time the guest of his Excellency the Governor of Bombay, at Daporee. We take the following from its columns: ""Dr. LIVINGSTONE arrived about 11 o'clock, accompanied by Capt. LEITH, and was received by Mr. GARDINER, the missionaries, Maj. CANDY, Mr. Ross, Presbyterian Chaplain, several officers, and other gentlemen. Mrs. MITCHELL, Mrs. GARDINER and several ladies were also present. In reply to a request from Mr. MITCHEEL that he would give his opinion as to the prospects of South Africa in regard to its future civilization and trade, Dr. LIVINGSTONE stated that those prospects were not nearly so bright now as they had been when he arrived with the expedition at the mouth of the Zambesi River in 1858. They had procured the assistance and countenance of the Portuguese Government, and an order to its subordinates to give them every aid and support. The harbor was a remarkably fine one, and everything promised well when they made their first expedition up the river. They found the neighboring country thickly peopled, and some caution was required to avoid any demonstration, lest they should be attacked from the banks with the arrows of the natives, who knew no Europeans but the Portuguese, and were not disposed from what they knew of them to give strangers a very friendly reception. When they came dowa, however, they found that these hostile feelings had disappeared, and that they were well received. The expedition was sent out by the English universities, and accompanied by the excellent and devoted Bishop MACKENZIE, who was so regardless of his own comfort, that there is little doubt he lost his life thereby. The Portuguese had long carefully excluded all other Europeans from the country; he himself had obtained access to it on a former occasion by entering it from the south and coming down the river, when they could not for very shame compel him to go back. This was in 1856,and on his return two years later the expedition was allowed without difficulty to enter the country, as just stated. On ascending the river several cataracts were encountered, which Dr. LIVINGSTONE had not seen when he came down. On this account they took the direction of the Shire River, and ascended the beautiful valley of that name. It contained a thick population, flourishing villages, and fine cultivation. Above was an elevated plateau some thousand feet above the sea, which strongly resembled the Deccan, except that it was covered with trees and grass, and which, like the valley, contained a large populalation. But about that time the Portuguese sold a quantity of firearms and ammunition to one of the tribes, to be paid for in slaves. The tribe, thus armed, swept the whole neighboring country like a scourge, killing the men in the villages, and carrying off women and children into slavery. This produced a terrible famine, in which large numbers of the survivors perished; and the fine valley of the Shire was transformed literally into a valley of bones. Whole villages were found without people. On another expedition they ascended the main stream of the Zambesi, passing thirty-five miles of rapids, and reached Lake Nyassa, which was 270 miles long and 60 or 70 wide. Above it was a range of hills, which proved when they had amended it to be another plateau or table land nearly 4,000 feet high, extending for many miles, and filled with villages and cultivation."" The Government was of the patriarchal form each village being entirely independent under its own head man or chief. In one respect there was a great contrast to this country, for there were slaves in every village chained up and working for their masters. They were inhabitants of other villages, who had been kidnapped and brought into captivity. They were held by a collar round the neck, to which a long stick was attached, and they were thus secured for the night, or when made to travel, pushed along by the proprietor, who held the other end of the stick and followed. Many of the slaves were quite little children, whose parents probably had been killed, for Dr. LIVINGSTONE did not believe their mothers had sold them. In reply to various questions. Dr. LIVINGSTONE, who seemed good-naturedly desirous to satisfy the curiosity of those present, stated that the cultivation by the African natives was very good, though it was entirely carried on with [???]. They were very industrious, and while whole families worked in their gardens, which were often very large, men, women and children altogether, an infant in addition being sometimes seen deposited under a hedge. They grew beans of all kinds, pumpkins, maize and rice, but not wheat nor grain. Cotton they grew, span and wove themselves.

EDWARD EVERETT, of Massachusetts. I think I cannot be mistaken in believing that you are the author of that letter. Before the war I knew the style and manner of every Virginian writer of note or promise; and no small part of their writings which they wished the world to see, or from which they hoped to gain either fame or moneycame before me while in manuscript. From noone of these have I read more, and with more pleasure, than from JOHN ESTEN COOKE. NO one seemed to me to possess so delicate a fancy or tobe master of so graceful a style. There were always paragraphs in his communications which THACKERAY might have written. I find these characteristics in this letter to Mr. EVERETT. I do not think the last three years likely to have developed them in any other Virginian; and so I conclude that the ""Virginian"" who wrote the letter is yourself. That letter was copied into the NEW-YORK TIMES, and I avail myself of that medium far a reply.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NORTH AND SOUTH.; Barbarism of the Union and Rebel Armies Compared.

"FIRE IN A FOUNDRY. -- At 10:30 o'clock on Saturday night, a fire broke out in the large foundry in Ste[???]en-street, near Greene-street, Jersey City, owned by Mr. CULVER, and owing to the fact that there was a large amount of combustible material in the building, the flames spread with great rapidity. The Fire Department was soon at work, and eventually subdued the flames, not, however, until the interior of the building and contents was burned out.

The vessel was built by Mr. ZENO SECOR, of Jersey City. She belongs to the second batch of monitors, most of which are now in active service. The occasion was anspicious and the weather was clear, with a strong breeze down the river. The number of invited guests was large. Including several Europeans of high rank, who were anxious, to investigate the practical worth of the Iron-clads. Among the rest were the officers of the vessel, Capt. WM. A. PARKER, Chief Engineer CHENVER and others. Also, Admiral Gregory, Capt. Rogers, Capt. Boggs, Messrs. colwell and Broadnax, Capt. Worden, Messrs. Secor, and Mr. Birkbeck, superintendent, who had general supervision of the vessel. At 10 o'clock, when the vessel started under the guidance of two tugs, she was the object of curiosity from a large number of spectators on the different plers and vessels in the vicinity. But, swinging around against a heavy breeze, the splendid craft steamed up the Hudson, without any incumbrance, in fine style, and in half an hour was lost to view. The river was rather rough, and the larger waves frequently dashed up on the bomb-proof deck, making a clean sweep, to the discomfort of the ""land-lubbers."" Under the disadvantages of heading against a strong breeze and the working of new machinery, the vessel made six knots an hour by the log; under favorable circumstances she will make about nine knots. She has all the gracefulness which appertains to her peculiar class, and is certainly one of the finest specimens of the monitors. Her length is 235 feet; extreme beam over armor, 46 feet; breadth of beam of boat proper, 37 feet; depth of hold, 13 feet; sheet of deck, 12 inches. The general characteristics of the vessel are as well known as ""household words,"" and need no description. The engines worked admirably; no accident occurred, and the trip to the engineers was entirely successful. The armament consisted of two 15-inch Dalghren smooth bore guns, both long-range, and sixteen inches longer than any gun yet put in a turret. The weight of one was 43,110 pounds, and the weight of the other 42,970 pounds. When the vessel hove to off the palisades, a little above Fort Lee, these guns were tested. There were three discharges from each gun, composed respectively of one shell, one solid and one cased shot, the latter only a little lighter than a solid shot,) which weighed about 440 pounds. The charge for the shell was thirty-five pounds of powder, and for others it was fifty pounds. Upon each discharge the recoil of about 4 1/2 feet was about the same, the concussion being mostly outside of the turret, as the gun projected through the ports. The result was quite satisfactory, the length of time consumed in loading the pieces, perhaps, being the only objection. As the last gun was fired, a signal was given for the guests to proceed to lunch. An excellent collation was served up in the messroom, to which ample justice was done. A fast tug, which had been laying near by, then took off as many as wished to land in New-York, leaving those who wished to proceed in the Mahopec to the Brooklyn Navy-yard. At about five o'clock the iron-clad was safely moored at the navy-yard, where she will be fitted out immediately for active service.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Naval Movements.

There were a number of conflicting stories in regard to the melancholy affair, and it was almost impossible to obtain a correct account yesterday. It was well known that the father and son had been upon rather bad terms, and It is reported that while under the influence of liquor on Saturday evening, he went to the apartments of his son and smashed his door down; in fact, this is the statement which the accused made after his arrest by Officer WILLMARTH, of the Forty-ninth Precinct, yesterday afternoon. He contends that the old man created the affray, and struck him on the head after breaking in his door. He then seized a laborer's shovel and dealt the old man a blow on the top of his head, knocking him down in the half-way. He then went out and made a charge to the police against the old man, of drunkenness and disorderly conduct; and an officer took him in a senseless condition to the Forty-ninth Precinct Station, under the impression that he was stupid from the effects of liquor. The accused of course went off rejoicing at, as he thought, getting rid of the deceased so easily. Capt. WADDY, as is his habit, examined the old man, and found that he was bleeding from the wound on his head. He sent for Dr. WOODSUFF, who was near at hand, and had the wounds dressed. During the night, however, the deceased grew worse, and the Captain again sent for the Doctor. A further examination revealed the fact that his skull was fractured, and that he had a congestion of the brain. He was then sent to the City Hospital, where be. was examined by Dr. COCHRANE and the Hospital physicians, who stated that it was impossible for him to survive more than a few hours. The deceased died in four hours after. Officers were immediately sent in search of the accused, and he was arrested and lucked up to await the result of the investigation to be held by Coronet Norris this afternoon.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Brutal Murder.; A MAN MURDERED BY HIS OWN SON.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Brutal Murder.; A MAN MURDERED BY HIS OWN SON.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8672afa-9455-5d8f-9f5c-bbd88dc4cfee,381,nyt://article/e8672afa-9455-5d8f-9f5c-bbd88dc4cfee

At Charleston, as will be seen by our correspondent's letter from the Department of the South, there is a threatened recurrence to the barbarism of putting a large number of Union prisoners under fire. Six hundred of our officers are now retained in Charleston jail for the purpose of being thus exposed, provided the rebel terms of exchange are not acceded to. JONES, the rebel General in command at Charleston, has, meanwhile, been notified by Gen. FOSTER, commanding the Union forces before the city, that he will place six hundred rebel officers in an exposed position on Morris Island the moment the threat of putting the Unionists under fire is carried out. We should hope that whatever may be the temporary loss we suffer in the exchange, this business will be arrested before it goes further. Gen. FOSTER, it is understood, has sent to Washington for instructions; let us hope that these instructions will embrace other considerations beside those of strict military expediency. That, of course, would be not only the prime, but the only consideration were we reduced to the necessity of fighting the rebels, man for man. But with the vast preponderance of the national force in numbers, we can afford to have regard in our exchange, as well to the long endurance of our poor, suffering, half-famished soldiers now prisoners at the South, as to the mere etiquette on which a strictly equitable mutual release should take place. The patient endurance, the noble resignation, the unconquerable fidelity of the Union prisoners at the South demand sacrifices by the War Department, but they are sacrifices which we feel assured our people would make good by extra efforts at volunteer recruiting, rather than have a general exchange delayed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Union Prisoners in the South Eagerness of the Rebels for an Exchange.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Union Prisoners in the South Eagerness of the Rebels for an Exchange.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d18f8f1-c6d6-5d75-8481-f821353fe498,794,nyt://article/1d18f8f1-c6d6-5d75-8481-f821353fe498

It appears that the attack was a surprise to our forces, many of them being in their shelter-tents at the time, to escape the heavy rain that was falling. After a feint about noon, in front of the Third Division of the Fifth Corps, the rebels, at 3 o'clock, charged in heavy force between the Fifth and Sixth Corps, and succeeded in turning the flank, of the former, and capturing a number of prisoners. The advance of the enemy was checked by the arrival of the Ninth Corps. At the same time a heavy column of the rebels obtained a temporary advantage on our extreme left, where they took several hundred prisoners. Our whole line was forced back for a time, with considerable loss -- the enemy also suffering severely -- but our men were reformed before dark, and being strengthened by reinforcements, a desperate charge was made to recover the lost ground. This effort was successful, so that at night our forces occupied the same line from which they had been forced in the afternoon.

OLIVE LOGAN made her first appearance at this establishment last evening in a new drama called ""Eveleen."" The place is strongly sensational, and in that point of view, is better written, and contains more felicitous language than we expect or find in similar productions. Miss. LOGAN comes of a recognized dramatic family, and her infuitions give promise of a brilliant career. She has had a slight experience of the stage, but being yet young, it was at a time when routine had no acceptable significance. An interval of six years has enabled her to educate her mind in the best school of Europe, and a susceptible temperament gives her the power of thinking action, and rendering it, too, passionately and earnestly. But in art it is always necessary to measure space between the artist and the public. A painter places his picture in such a position that the stronger colors are merged in their weaker neighbors, and so the design becomes distinct yet soft; powerful but unobtrusive. Miss. LOGAN's inspirations are all good; they indicate a rare intelligence, but they lack the exact balance of art. A new actress of promise should be received with glad welcome, and we desire to hall Miss LOGAN cordially. She has every natural and acquired qualification for the profession she graces. Her voice is melodious, her presence charming, and her talent very distinct and discernable. She needs nothing, in fact, but practice. Not to be impetuous, not to act ""too close,"" not to sway the figure in sudden gusts of grief and tribulation -these are the mechanical restraints that she has to impose upon herself; restraints which it is obvious an intelligent mind will accept as necessities of the distance that separates the actress from the audience. For the rest, Miss LOGAN may safely be left to herself. Her abilities will speedily place her in the front rank of artists.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/533a26b1-eeed-5535-a78b-00e996662b75,329,nyt://article/533a26b1-eeed-5535-a78b-00e996662b75

When raised to his high position, two years ago, he had high repute in his profession and a stainless name. There was universal confidence alike in his character and his abilities. His first stage of official duty was marked by what seemed to be great faithfulness and efficiency. In time, whispers began to be heard about irregularities and abuses in his administration. They were imputed to jealousy and other sinister motives, and were not heeded. Even when these whispers had gradually grown into loud and strong accusations, the public continued incredulous. It finally became the duty of the Government to investigate them, and for that purpose the President ordered a court-martial, last Winter, consisting of nine officers of high rank and character. A trial was had, lasting nearly four months, conducted with remarkable patience and thoroughness. This trial was private, but so unwilling was the public mind to think such a man guilty, that it hardly imagined any other result than an honorable acquittal. The press almost universally, without distinction of party, abstained from all comment, and even surmise. The court weighed all the testimony, heard the defence of his able counsel, adjudged him guilty, and sentenced him to be dismissed the service, and to be forever disqualified from holding any office of honor, profit or trust under the Government of the United States.

"It seems to be nearly certain that a proposal will soon be made to us from some quarter -- either from LINCOLN or from the Chicago Democratic Convention, to assent to an armistice, or simple cessation of hostilities, to allow of negotiations ""for peace and reunion,"" and for that alone.

Andersonville; Petition from,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/24/archives/the-union-prisoners-at-andersonville.html,Andersonville; Petition from,"A delegation, consisting of four Union prisoners just released from Andersonville, Ga., will have an early interview with the President, for the purpose of presenting the case of the thirty-five thousand Union soldiers now penned up at that place as prisoners of war. The statement which these men are prepared to lay before the President is horrifying to a degree far beyond what the experience of this war has brought hitherto. In an inclosed field of thirty acres of ground, exposed to the heat of an all but tropical sun, fed upon a daily ration for each man of three-quarters of a pound of dirty corn bread and two ounces of rancid swine flesh, and supplied with water from a stagnant ditch, which forms the receptacle of the excrement of the camp, are thirty-five thousand of our bravest soldiers -- the men who were the foremost in the hard-fought field, and the most daring in the final grapple and crisis of battle. There they swelter and rot, or go raving mad, or find an end to it by crossing the ""dead line,"" where the friendly rifle of the sentinel brings them final release without the aid of cartel or Commissioner. A seething, reeking pen, surcharged with horrors unimaginable.

It holds that he is bound to prosecute the war for the abolition of Slavery, even after its prosecution ceases to be necessary for the restoration of the Union. We have already given our reasons for not concurring in this opinion. We do not believe that Mr. LINCOLN is so pledged by his antecedents or by his declarations, -- nor do we believe that his practical conduct of the Government will be guided by such a theory. If JEFFERSON DAVIS should offer, on behalf of the men in arms under him against the Union, to return to his allegiance to the Constitution and Government of the United States, we believe that President LINCOLN would thereupon stop the war. We do not believe that he would continue it for an hour longer, for the abolition of Slavery or for any other purpose.

Discussion with J. E. McDonald,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/25/archives/the-political-campaign-in-indianagov-morions-speechwho-is.html,Discussion with J. E. McDonald,"The political campaign now in progress in the State of Indiana is one of the most remark- able that has taken place for many years in the West, and is exciting great attention and in terest, not only throughout that State, but in the adjoining States of Illinois and Ohio. The two candidates for the office of Governor (OLIVER P. MORTON, the present incumbent, and JOSEPH E. MCDONALD, the opposition nominee,) are traveling together over the State, and discussing before immense audiences the all-important national questions of the day. Ample notification is given beforehand as to the time and place for the debate, and the people flock in from all the country around. A letter from Laporte, describing the recent discussion there, says: ""There were delegations from all the towns and villages in this region. Large wagons decorated with evergreens and poles, pendant with rational emblems, and filled with sturdy farmers from the prairies, with their wives, daughters and sweethearts, came into town at an early hour, and at the time appointed wended their way to the grove, and arranged themselves around the speakers' stand."" While there has always been displayed on both sides an earnestness befitting the great theme, the discussions have been characterized by the highest personal courtesy on the part of the disputants. The arrangement between the parties on several, if not all of the occasions, has been that Gov. MORTON should open the debate with a speech of an hour's length, followed by a speech of an hour and a half from his opponent, who, in turn, is succeeded by the first speaker in a half hour's closing speech. In this campaign, Gov. MORTON has shown himself to be a masterly debater, with a grand, bold, comprehensive, Western sweep of mind, with a keen and incisive force of logic, with great popular power, and with an all-sacrificing patriotism, that glistens through all his thoughts and sentences, as it has shone forth splendidly in all his deeds during the last four years.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Political Campaign In Indiana--Gov.

And the lecture ad dressed to the Canadian people by the leading English journal, which we publish in another column, will not be likely to alarm any large section of the province. As a specimen of drivel, it can probably bear comparison with anything lately published on that or any similar topic. The whole question is reduced to the problem of what might follow if a whole regiment of red-coats were captured on the Canadian frontier by a given number of United States soldiers. War, of course, between the United States and Great Britain would be the result. Therefore the regiment of redcoats must not be exposed to any such mischance. That is the argument in the vulgate.

Facts have come to our knowledge which convince us that there is serious dereliction somewhere. The statements of our correspondent are quite lenient, and when he says that no respectable gentleman will submit to the annoyances and indignities to which the present system necessarily subjects him, he states what is quite true. What do the authorities mean? Can they not see the daily result of the present condition of things? Does it not inevitably tend to discourage enlistments and disgust men with the service, when the recruit is subjected to so much delay and expense? Are men imbued with a spirit of loyalty and respect for the Government which they propose to serve, when traitorous workmen in the Navy-yard are allowed to blackguard and ridicule recruits as they pass along the avenue -- to call them ""victims"" --""abolitionists,"" etc. -- to approach them and advise them not to enlist, as they have done? Are gentlemen who seek necessary and proper information to be rudely rebuffed by the officials, because they ask a civil question -- as was done but yesterday? Can no system be devised by which parties visiting the rendezvous or the yard with recruits may know what to do and how to do it?

It seems that his men rode into the very heart of the city, assailing the Irving Block, where rebel prisoners are confined, visiting the Gayoso House, (the principal hotel,) plundering the stores, dashing into the headquarters of Gen. WASHBURN, the Commander of the department, rushing into Gen. BUCKLAND's headquarters, and making an effort to capture Gen. HURLBUT, formerly commanding the Department of West Tennessee. It is curious that FORREST, ""with three brigades of rebels,"" should have been able to get near the city without anybody finding it out. Though after he did get near it, it is not curious that he should have been able to enter it. The great work defending Memphis -- Fort Pickering -- is located a mile or two south of the city, and we can hardly suppose that the rebels advanced or were allowed to retreat by the main highway running east from the place, as that is commanded by the guns of Fort Pickering. The garrison must either have been all sound asleep on that early Sunday morning, or the rebels must have struck down from the northeast.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ATTACK ON MEMPHIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ATTACK ON MEMPHIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Memphis', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f025d0e0-3e56-5e62-8e3f-d63101b1bcba,279,nyt://article/f025d0e0-3e56-5e62-8e3f-d63101b1bcba

The melancholy event took place on Thursday, night, (Aug. 11,) at 12 o'clock. This popular come- dian (says the Men of the Time) was born at Margate, in the year 1821, and was apprenticed at an early age to a copper-plate engraver in the metropolis. Not relishing the occupation, he was tempted to essay the stage, and while yet a young man, made his debut at a private theatre in Catharine-street, in the part of Simm Mealbag, in the drama of "" Grace Huntley."" Had Mr. ROBSON been wanting in perseverance, the result of his first essay would have deterred him from any further prosecution of his new designs, as several professional critics strongly advised him to abandon all idea of adopting theatrical pursuits; but, fortunately for his future prospects, a conviction of latent power more than counterbalanced the depressing influence of their advice. And after two short provincial engagements at Whitstable and Uxbridge, he again appeared on the London boards, playing at the Grecian Saloon from 1844 to 1849. By this time he had so far acquired a reputation as an original delineator of character, that his services were eagerly sought by several provincial managers, one of whom secured him for the Queen's Theatre, Dublin. At the termination of this engagement, in 1853. Mr. ROBSON returned to London, having accepted an offer from Mr. FARREN, the lessee of the Olympic Theatre. His success was now placed beyond doubt, and so high an appreciation did metropolitan audiences evince of his peculiar talent that the pieces played at the little theatre in Wych-street were mainly selected with the view of affording a vehicle for their exhibition.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; MR.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/26/archives/kidnapping-swedish-emigrants-some-canadian-comments-from-the-quebec.html,,"In our yesterday's issue we had occasion to notice the arrival of the Swedish steamer Ernest Merck, from Stockholm, with 478 passengers. Certain facts have since come to our knowledge which clearly prove the complicity of the Federal Government in an attempt to kidnap a considerable number of these emigrants, as its agents have already kidnapped thousands of others in order to recruit the armies of the model republic. Out of the to tal number of emigrants on board the Ernest Merck, about 250 appear to have been legitimately engaged to work in the Lake Superior mines, and these, we believe, have proceeded westward to their destination. The remainder, some 220, are, however, not to be landed at Quebec, but at Portland, Me. -- having been forwarded, free of charge, by a person named TEFT, who occupies the post of United States Consul at Stockholm. The victims, however, had first to sign an agreement with TEFT, by which they bound themselves to reimburse the ""passage money and incidental expenses"" -- work being provided for them according to their respective trades and occupations. The men were to receive as remuneration $125 per annum, and the women $40 per annum, ""in current money of the United States,"" together with boarding and lodging. The agreement was signed by the emigrants on the one part, and by Mr. TEFT on behalf of the ""Foreign Emigration Association,"" on the other. No mention appears, however, to have been made of any agent at Portland to whom these poor people could apply for a fulfillment of the contract. This fact alone discloses the nature of the scheme. Every feature of the case, however, shows that the object of this traffic in human flesh is to crowd the Atlantic ports with thousands of destitute foreigners, whose wretched condition must at once force them into the ranks of the army, in order to avoid at least a lingering death. The agency of the United States Consul establishes the official nature of the speculation. A rush of starving emigrants might afford sufficient war material to render another conscription unnecessary, and thus ""stave eft"" the disturbance another draft is sure to create. And again -- at the terms of remuneration, in Federal currency, set forth in the contract, these unfortunate white slaves would find themselves obliged to work for years in order to repay their passage money and ""incidental expenses."" It appears that the Swedish authorities did everything in their power to counteract the efforts of the agent of the Foreign Emigration Society; but could not, of course, prevent the embarkation of the emigrants.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Kidnapping"" Swedish Emigrants.; SOME CANADIAN COMMENTS.

Policy in Withdrawing from European Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/26/archives/the-new-policy-of-england-philosophy-of-national-power.html,Policy in Withdrawing from European Politics,"The formal withdrawal of England from all active share in the management of European politics, and the formal declaration of the Government, with the approval we will not say of the people, but of the ""governing class"" -- that is, the middle class -- that she will henceforward, in no case employ force except in self-defence, have a greater significance than most people accord to them, and seem to be the beginning of very extensive changes in the distribution of power among the commonwealth of nations. We in America have for the last four years been so busily engaged in singing the praises of national debt, that we have almost forgotten that the question has two sides, and that there is a good deal to be said on both. A moderate national debt is unquestionably of great value in consolidating a nation with a strong tendency to disintegration, such as Great Britain was a century and a half ago; but there is a point at which the burden may become so great as to partially paralyze the national energies, and lower that mysterious something which for want of a better name we call vitality, and bring on gradual decay. Of this effect of a large debt there could not be a better illustration than Holland, and England seems very likely to furnish another. Holland incurred enormous liabilities, both in the struggle with Spain, afterward with England and Louis XIV., and came out of the ordeal victorious and glorious indeed, but owing so much that she had the cruel alternative presented to her of either surrendering the proud place among nations, which she had won by her valor, or else of breaking faith with her creditors. To her eternal honor she chose the former, shouldered her debt manfully, put on all the taxes the population could possibly bear, and sunk at once to the rank of a third-class Power. She owes now ninety millions sterling, with a population of about two millions, and a soil which has long ago reached the limit of its productiveness -- in other words, forty -- five pounds a head -- while Great Britain does not owe over twenty pounds a head. The Dutch meet the interest on this sum by untiring industry and frugality, and by diligent use of the enormous capital accumulated in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; but they can do nothing more. They have lost all weight in European councils, and preserve their independence mainly by a vigorous and careful neutrality.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Policy of England Philosophy of National Power.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Policy of England Philosophy of National Power.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9137799-19be-57d8-89d7-0b0d6485517b,1035,nyt://article/d9137799-19be-57d8-89d7-0b0d6485517b

Within less than a week of the time when Mr. BRIGGS was found lying, bruised, bleeding and speechless on the railway track, between the Bow and Hackney railroad stations, MULLER had left in different parts of London -- as the testimony taken yesterday shows -- abundant evidence to convict him ten times over. All that remains, indeed, for investigation now, (and this will be done in London,) refers to the precise point at which MULLER got on to the train, and the instrument he used in making his victim so powerless that he was able to throw him out of the narrow window of a tightly-locked first-class English railway carriage.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Muller Extradition Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Muller Extradition Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ba761479-2b9a-53bd-ba15-da79f4cfe0b0,632,nyt://article/ba761479-2b9a-53bd-ba15-da79f4cfe0b0
Correspondence on Draft and Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/27/archives/the-crisis-of-the-country.html,Correspondence on Draft and Politics,"One would imagine, to listen to much of the talk which is heard about the call for 500,000 and the draft which is likely to follow it, that the raising of men for the United States Army was the cruel freak of an Eastern tyrant; that the war was being carried on for the amusement or gratification of the President and the Cabinet; and that everybody owed it to his family and friends to defraud them of their prey by every conceivable means. The Albany Atlas & Argus contained a real or pretended letter, a few days ago, from a country reader, which represented a prodigious change as having come over the Republicans in his neighborhood; that they were so outraged by the determination of the Government to get more men for the army, that hundreds of them were going to vote against the tyrannical LINCOLN in November. They were raising men as fast as they could -- as fast as a proper attention to their farms and business would let them -- as fast, in short, as was convenient; and to think of drafting simply because they had not made up their quota, and were not likely to make it up, was more than they could endure. The story was told in a strong, bold, democratic way, and was probably half fiction and half exaggeration; but sentiments of this kind crop out in the conversation of a great many people who profess the most unbounded devotion to the war. Some people are furious with the Government for wanting more men; others think it quite natural they should want them, but think it brutal and inhuman that they should not make up their minds to go without them; but a still larger number -- and this class includes a great many ""loyal"" friends of the Union -- while acknowledging it to be the right and duty of the Government to get recruits, believe it to be the right of the public to prevent its getting them from amongst the native population in every way short of armed resistance; and they act up to their belief. They seem to consider their relations with the Executive something like those of a traveler with an armed highwayman; they surrender with a good grace what they cannot conceal, but nothing more.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Crisis of the Country.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Crisis of the Country.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bcadf8d6-b2f4-528c-9373-f8b571a78270,1013,nyt://article/bcadf8d6-b2f4-528c-9373-f8b571a78270

While CULLUM was lying partially insensible on the sidewalk, the prisoner, LAWLER, thrust his hand into his victim's pocket and stole therefrom the sum of $588 in bills, with which he made his escape.

Leaving out of account, however, the temporary and altogether insufficient relief which a recognition of the naval recruits in the Provost-Marshal's summing up would bring us, we do well to consider several important facts in our estimate of the dirty which the emergency demands. The first of these is that the national armies want filling; that uncredited naval recruits do not fill the army; and that by so much as the present draft falls short of bringing the requisite number of men, by that much will the numbers required by a new conscription be increased. The relief we shall get by any system of counting heads in the navy can be but temporary, and whatever may be the issue of the pending decision, the crisis demands fore-thought, work, a national system of recruiting operations, and an expenditure of time as well as money by those who really desire to cooperate with the Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bounty Brokerage and the Difficulties Thrown in the Way of Recruiting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bounty Brokerage and the Difficulties Thrown in the Way of Recruiting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5fa1fdff-ede3-5335-a2bc-9cc2b55765b5,857,nyt://article/5fa1fdff-ede3-5335-a2bc-9cc2b55765b5

Madman in Railway Carriage,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/28/archives/a-madman-in-a-railway-carriage.html,Madman in Railway Carriage,"The Edinburgh Scotsman reports an alarming incident which occurred in one of the Edinburgh carriages on the Great Northern Railway, on Thursday night: ""In one of the third-class compartments of the Express leaving King's Cross Station, at 9:15 P.M., a tall and strongly-built man, dressed as a sailor, and having a wild and haggard look, took his seat about three minutes before the train started. He was accompanied to the carriage by a woman, whom he afterwards referred to as his wife, and by a man, apparently a cab driver, with both of whom he took leave when the train was about to start. It had scarcely done so, when, on putting his hand to his pocket, he called out that he had been robbed of his purse, containing seventeen pounds, and at once began to shout and gesticulate in a manner which greatly alarmed his fellow-travellers, four in number, in the same compartment. He continued to roar and swear with increasing violence for some time, and then made an attempt to throw himself out of the window. He threw his arms and part of his body out of the window, and had just succeeded in placing one of his legs out when the other occupants of the carriage, who had been endeavoring to keep him back, succeeeed in dragging him from the window. Being foiled in this attempt, he turned round upon those who had been instrumental in keeping him back. After a long and severe struggle, which, notwithstanding the speed the train was running at, was heard in the adjoinining compartments, the sailor was overcome by the united exertions of the party, and was held down by two of their number. Though thus secured, he still continued to struggle and shout vehemently, and it was not till some time afterwards, when they managed to bind his hands and strap him to the seat, that the passengers in the compartment felt themselves secure. This train, it may be explained, makes the journey from London to Peterborough, a distance little short of eighty miles, without a single stoppage; and as the scene we have been describing began immediately after the train left London, the expectation of having to pass the time usually occupied between the two stations (one hour and fifty minutes) with such a companion must have been far from agreeable. While the struggle was going on, and even for some time afterwards, almost frantic attempts were made to get the train stopped. The attention of those in the adjoining compartment was readily gained by waving handkerchiefs out of the window, and by and by a full explanation of the circumstance was communicated through the aperture in which the lamp that lights both compartments is placed. A request to communicate with the guard was made from one carriage to another for a short distance, but it was found impossible to continue it, and, as the occupants of the compartments beyond the one nearest the scene of the disturbance could learn nothing as to its nature, a vague feeling of alarm seized them, and all the way along to Peterborough a succession of shows of ""Stop the train,"" mixed with the frantic screams of female occupants, was kept up. On the arrival of the train at Peterborough, the man was released by his captors and placed on the platform. No sooner was he there, however, than he rushed with a renewed outburst of fury on those who had taken the chief part in restraining his violence; and as he kept vociferating that they had robbed him of his money, it was some time before the railway officials could be got to interfere -- indeed, it seemed likely for some time that he would be allowed to go on in the train. As remonstrances were made from all quarters to the station-master to take the fellow into custody, he at length agreed, after being furnished with the names and address of the other occupants of the carriage, to hand him over to the police. The general impression of those who witnessed the sailor's fury sems to be that he was laboring under a violent attack of delirium tremens, and he had every appearance of having been drinking hard for some days.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MADMAN IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MADMAN IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-08-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b374bbcf-e223-573c-92fc-c5efd12dcf85,1346,nyt://article/b374bbcf-e223-573c-92fc-c5efd12dcf85

"The meeting of this body to-day will concentrate the attention of all parts of the country, rebel as well as loyal.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/29/archives/the-chicago-convention.html,,"The meeting of this body to-day will concentrate the attention of all parts of the country, rebel as well as loyal. Its postponement from early July, the time first designated for it, was designed to settle its discords. A hope existed that within the eight weeks thus gained to non-committalism, some change would take place in the military situation that would lurch the mass of the party decisively over to the side of war, or of peace, and fix the policy of the convention beyond all controversy. Should such disaster overtake GRANT and SHERMAN as the rebels promised, it was calculated that the peace feeling would set in at the North like a flood, and make the Chicago path clear to a peace platform and candidate. Should GRANT and SHERMAN, on the other hand, consummate their campaigns by the capture of Richmond and Atlanta, it plainly would not answer to give up the old coercive policy which was so effectively crushing out the rebellion. But neither of these events have happened. GRANT has gained possession of one of the two keys of Richmond, but the city is not yet his. SHERMAN has successfully emerged from the dangerous defiles of Northern Georgia, and laid virtual siege to Atlanta; but that stronghold, though it would seem it must soon fall, still baffles him. Just so FARRAGUT has accomplished the first stage of the capture of Mobile with signal success, but the consummation of the work is yet a question. The military situation is no more favorable to the settlement of a definite war policy or peace policy at Chicago now, than it was in July. Every element of discord which was in motion then, has just as free play now. We may, therefore, count upon a scene of intense excitement and perturbation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Chicago Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Chicago Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/709cf4ef-f07c-509c-aba3-c3d3cd5dbe65,1140,nyt://article/709cf4ef-f07c-509c-aba3-c3d3cd5dbe65

on Essential Differences Between North and South,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/29/archives/the-south-and-the-north-tendencies-of-civilization.html,on Essential Differences Between North and South,"JEFFERSON DAVIS informed Col. JACQUES, in the late interview at Richmond, that there were ""essential differences"" between the North and South, that will, however this war may end, make them two nations. DE TOCQUEVILLE observed differences between them also, but gave it as his opinion that there was not one which could not be ascribed to Slavery, or which would not disappear if Slavery were removed.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/31/archives/general-city-news.html,,"SUICIDE OF A YOUNG WOMAN -- A SAD CASE. -- Coroner WILDEY held an inquest on Monday on the body of a young woman named FANNY KIMBALL, a native of Boston, aged 23 years, who died from the effects of poison administered by her own hand, at a house in Wooster-street. From the testimony given before the Coroner, it appears that deceased was a woman of good education, and in her earlier life had moved in the society of the refined and virtuous. A few months since she had been led astray, and then abandoned. Feeling deeply the infumy and disgrace attaching to her condition, her spirits were thereby much depressed, and in the height of her despair she resolved to [???]end the ills she could not mend."" On Sunday night she partook of her supper, appearing at the time more than usually cheerful. Soon after she had retired to her room, she was found writhing in the agonies of death. Medical assistance was immediately called, and everything possible war done to relieve her, but without success. She did in about half an hour after being discovered. The postmortem examination made by Dr. GEORGE B. BOUTON, revealed the fact that death was caused by a quantity of cyanide of potassium, a very deadly poison, and the jury rendered a verdict of death by suicide, caused by taking that drug. On the table in her room was found two letters, one of which was addressed to her sister, who is a cripple, and whom she had for a long time supported, requesting her to take charge of her effects. The other letter was addressed to the keeper of the house where she died, regretting that she should have given so much trouble as to commit suicide there, but she said she was tired of life, and could no longer endure the infamy which had attached to her conduct. She hoped, that in another world more leniency would be shown her than there had been in this.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-08-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/07e53d6e-7d5c-5369-91f1-6f11774527aa,1150,nyt://article/07e53d6e-7d5c-5369-91f1-6f11774527aa

It is within the memory of every one -- a fact that comes out strongly in youthful reminiscence, mingled with the earliest lights and shadows of the past -- that the dreaded name ""Tory"" was a true ""word of fear,"" ""the heaviest stone that misfortune could throw at a man"" -- an imputation that comprised within itself whatever was most terrible in proportion as it was vague and undefined. This state of feeling, which all will recognize, succeeded to the more active and energetic opposition of two conflicting parties arrayed against each other with the peculiar bitterness of intestine strife. And now, such is the soothing influence of time -- it has already in one generation been succeeded by a temper of the public mind when laborious investigations are undertaken into the history of these very Tories that affrighted our youth, and minute explorations respecting their lives and fortunes occupy our Historical Societies, and are brought out, like the present volumes, with every advantage that the publisher can bestow. There is surely a lesson to be learnt from this of peculiar importance at the present moment. Looking at the violence, the passion and the deep-seated enmity with which different sections of the country are now arrayed against each other, the most sagacious men have often glanced doubtfully on the prospect, despairing to see the day when these elements of discord could be neutralized, and their fury allayed. Time, however, is wiser than our devices, and to its healing influences may be safely left the circumstances that defy immediate action; to our children the animosities of to-day will have softened down into the feeling with which we now regard the once dreaded ""Tory"" of the Revolutionary War.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF LOYALISTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, with an Historical Essay.
