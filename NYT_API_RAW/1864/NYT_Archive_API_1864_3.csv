He was transfixed by an iron spit seven feet long. The spit went in at the abdomen and passed out at the back, so that there were three feet of the spit before and three feet behind. Monsieur Feuillet was conveyed to the nearest hotel. His condition demanded all the resources of art. A surgeon being summoned, felt the patient's pulse, and asked him where he was suffering. ""In the abdomen,"" replied the wounded man. ""Indeed! How did it happen to you?"" The patient thereupon detailed the sad incident of his being transfixed. The surgeon shook his head, and resumed: ""Are they subject to this accident, Sir, in your family? ""No,"" replied the patient, ""not that I know. My father and mother are very old and have never been spitted. So with regard to my brothers and sisters, and my uncles and my aunts."" ""Very well, Sir, I required that information in order to give a correct prognosis. You experience, I suppose, considerable difficulty in lying on your back?"" ""Yes, Sir; it is, indeed, impossible."" ""Is it not easier for you to lie on your stomach?"" ""I experience precisely the same difficulty."" ""It must, therefore, be much easier for you to lie on your side."" ""That is the only position I can lie in."" ""That will suffice, Sir. It only remains to determine upon the treatment. Here the indications are very precise: either we can let the spit alone, but then you will most likely die of inflammation; or we can extract it, but then it is not probable that you will survive the operation. Science, Sir, has its limits; your fate is in your own hands; you can decide for either one treatment or the other.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Dreadful Democratic Dilemma The Final Decision.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Dreadful Democratic Dilemma The Final Decision.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Democratic National Convention', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/53fd03a3-3596-5fad-b7a9-a2db68c7e7c4,910,nyt://article/53fd03a3-3596-5fad-b7a9-a2db68c7e7c4

In reference to the claims of the United States for damages done by the Alabama and other rebel cruisers, Earl RUSSELL said that the British Government was in no way responsible for the losses, and he trusted that the United States would modify its views on the subject. The rumors that an armistice would soon be proclaimed between the Danes and the allied German forces seem to have been ill-grounded. The Danes, though in sorely tried straits, assert their determination of devoting the whole strength of the nation to the recovery of Schleswig, the whole of which, excepting the towns of Sundervitt and Alsen, they had been compelled to evacuate. On the 13th, the intrencked position of the Danes at Duppel was attacded by the allies, who were unsuccessful, and it was determined that to carry the position by direct assault would involve too much waste of life. Consequently mortar batteries were being erected with a view of dislodging them from their intrenchments. The Prussians had occupied the post of Kiel.

"There has been no intelligence, either directly or indi rectly, from Gen. SHERMAN; for several days -- not since his reported arrival at Selma, which still remains to be fully confirmed. A rebel dispatch from Atlanta, dated Feb. 26, states, however, that SHERMAN's advance had reached ""Pearly Pear,"" a point we cannot find on any map, but, undoubtedly east or southeast of Meridian, which point SHERMAN had positively reached by the 20th or 22d of February, for on the latter day Bishop POLK telegraphed to the rebel War Department that SHERMAN had ""halted at Meridian, evidently awaiting the arrival of cavalry reinforcements."" But as the latest dispatch is also from rebel sources, we may be sure that he did not tarry long at Meridian. The cavalry force which was destined to cooperate with SHERMAN, was SMITH and GRIERSON's expedition from Memphis, which, as is already known, returned to the latter point, having failed in its objects, after penetrating into Mississippi one hundred and thirty miles, or over half way to Meridian. This failure may embarrass SHERMAN considerably, though he can take care of himself abundantly well without cavalry, but he needed such a force to make his march felt by the enemy, especially if he moves across the State of Alabama, as he has across Mississippi. The cause of the failure of the cavalry is said to have been the concentration of all the rebel cavalry at West Point, Miss., to oppose Gen. SMITH'S column. As our force was about ten thousand strong, it ought to have been equal to all the rebel cavalry that Bishop POLK could muster. We are inclined to think that the leader of the expedition was deceived as to the enemy's strength, and that he did not make an earnest attempt to get through, for no severe fighting is reported, and our retreat seems to have been unnecessary. The charge that delay on the start was caused by the slow movements of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey regiments, may have some truth in it, but as there were but two of these regiments, and they new and raw at that, they ought not to have been considered essential to the expedition, or of consequence enough to have caused an hour's delay.

It is done in this way. A town meeting is held, at which the tax-payers raise a certain amount to pay each recruit $300. This is placed in the hands of a committee, and they, to expedite matters and save trouble, make a contract with some man to procure for them the number of recruits they need, binding him to pay each recruit at least $100, but leaving it optional with him whether or no he gives the recruit any more. This is, of course, a great inducement for bounty brokers to send recruits to these places, and very many ignorant men are so enlisted; they receive their $100, and are satisfied until they reach Riker's Island or some other military depot and learn how they have been wronged. Gen. Dix's office is completely overrun with these poor fellows, many of whom have families dependent upon them, asking him to get for them the $200 to which they are justly entitled; he is, however, obliged to inform them that he can do nothing for them. The agreement entered into between the town or county and the broker rendering it impossible. West Farms, Richmond County, S. I., and many other towns and counties have made such contracts. It seems a shame that the recruit who leaves his family to serve his country should have but $100 or $150 to leave with his wife and little ones, and brave the chances of death, which, in many cases, would leave them entirely helpless, while the bounty broker who remains at home at his ease gets $150 or $200 for swindling him. It is also a false idea that such inducements to brokers help recruiting, as the experience of this City well shows; for since the swindling recruits has been diminished they come in nearly twice as fast as they did when it was in full feather.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Serious Wrong to the Soldiers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Serious Wrong to the Soldiers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/faee03f1-bbeb-5b75-a954-6daf00724d80,340,nyt://article/faee03f1-bbeb-5b75-a954-6daf00724d80

We have, therefore, uniformly declined all Government advertising sent to us on these terms. We have a uniform rate for the insertion of advertisements, which merchants, business men and other private persons who seek the use of our columns for their own interest are required to pay; and we certainly see no reason why we should do the same work and render the same service to the Government for a fourth of the price.

SHERMAN's movements in Mississippi, we gather that he withdrew from Meridian about the 22d, and is now on his way back to Vicksburgh. A dispatch to the rebel War Department announces this officially, and it is confirmed from several other sources, though there are reports equally as late, placing him thirty miles east of Meridian, and Gen. POLK on the east side of the Tombigbee, at Demopolis, waiting to give SHERMAN battle, should he cross. These, however, may not be reliable. The rebel press view GRANT's operations at Tunnel Hill with alarm, and construe SHERMAN's movement as a feint to draw troops from JOHNSTON. The Governor of Florida announces the rebel victory at Olustee, and says that Gen. FINNEGAN would pursue our forces to Jacksonville. The rebels had already advanced to Baldwin. LONGSTREET has made a serious retrograde movement, which is differently explained by the rebel papers, some asserting that it was to avoid a flank movement, others that he could no longer subsist his army there. Gen. BRAGG's appointment as virtual Com mander-in-Chief is received by the Richmond Examiner with sarcasm and ridicule, while the Enquirer approves it, affecting to believe that, after all, he is not Commander-in-Chief, but only an advisory officer. On the whole, the tone of the rebel press is less gloomy, as they extract comfort from the late Union repulse in Florida and the withdrawal of SHERMAN, though there is a pang of grief manifest at every bushel of corn or pound of pork that our forces capture, consume or destroy as they move through rebeldom.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96c85049-00d9-5b45-88c5-a946c6179f89,618,nyt://article/96c85049-00d9-5b45-88c5-a946c6179f89

"The Board of Aldermen met yesterday. They adopted, by unanimous vote, the resolution to purchase and have erected at some suitable place in the City CLARK MILLS' duplicate bronze equestrian statute of JACKSON, at a cost of $33,500. The original cost $52,000, and the mould from which the casts were made has been destroyed by fire, so that there will be no other fac-simile taken. The duplicate was prepared for the State of Virginia, but the rebellion interposed an insurmountable obstacle to the completion of the terms of the contract for it. The board adopted the resolution to appropriate $12,000 for the erection of a monument over the Catholic soldiers' grave-plot in Calvary Cemetery under the auspices of the Joint Committee on National Affairs. This resolution passed both Boards last year, but failed to receive the Mayor's signature, and the year was too near the end to permit it to become a law by default. A resolution to widen the esplanade in front of the City-Hall twenty-nine feet, was referred. The Mayor sent in two memorials, one signed by merchants and owners of real estate, and the other by cartmen in the lower wards, invoking action of the Common Council ""to abate the nuisance caused by the form and construction of the rails laid down in Washington, West, Greenwich, South, Water and Front streets."" The message and memorials were referred to the Special Committee appointed a short time ago to consider this subject, (on a resolution presented by Alderman RYERS,) and who are now engaged in taking testimony and hearing suggestions pertinent to it. The Mayor also sent in complaints of citizens that the fat-boiling establishment at the foot of West Fortieth-street, and the varnish factory in West Thirty-ninth-street, are nuisances, which also were referred. The Comptroller replied to a resolution of inquiry that some of the laborers in the departments do not get their pay promptly because of delays necessarily incident to a rigid auditing system he has adopted, as required by the charter, which prevents payments of fraudulent pay-rolls till special examinations are made and the improper claims are excluded.

"The veteran regiments of this brigade, viz.: The Eighty-first, Ninety-sixth and Ninety-eighth Regiments, New-York State troops, Wednesday left their barracks at the Park, and escorted by the Eighth and Thirty-seventh Militia Begiments, were reviewed at the City Hall by the Mayor and Common Council; they then marched up Broadway, and at the Fifth-avenue Hotel were reviewed by Maj.-Gen. BURNSIDE; from there they marched to the arsenal, corner Thirty-fifth-street and Seventh-avenue, where a collation was prepared for them, and after partaking of it, they were escorted to the Hudson River Railroad depot, and took the cars for Albany. The Eighty-first Regiment was raised in Oswego and Oneida Counties, and is composed of a fine set of men. They were with Gen. MCCLELLAN all through the Peninsular campaign, and were afterward with Gen. FOSTER's Charleston expedition, at which time their Colonel (DE FORREST) was in command of the brigade and won honors for his and their bravery.

Longstreet's Arrival at Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/04/archives/longstreets-reported-arrival-at-richmond.html,Longstreet's Arrival at Richmond,"-- We hardly think any one need be made unhappy by the announcement which comes to us from Washington, that LONGSTREET's forces have arrived at Richmond. In the Lynchburgh Republican of Feb. 26 we find a statement, taken from the Jonesboro Telegraph of Feb. 24, and the Bristol Gazette of Feb. 25, to the effect that LONGSTREET's forces had fallen back to Greenville and Bull's Gap. In addition, a dispatch from Gen. LONGSTREET himself, dated Greenville, Tenn., Feb. 27, appears in Richmond papers of the 29th. The railroad communication from Greenville to Richmond is notoriously inadequate for the rapid transportation of large bodies of troops, and it would have been a physical impossibility for LONGSTREET's command to reach the rebel capital by that or any other route between the dates named (Feb. 27) and March 2. Then, again, had LONGSTREET left the vicinity of Knoxville to make a rapid movement to Richmond, the papers published at Bristol or Lynchburgh would assuredly have made some reference to the passing of troops through those places. Finally, if LONGSTREET had been ordered east, his troops would unquestionably have been at once incorporated with LEE's army, and the probabilities are altogether against their going further than Gordonsville. It is pretty plain, therefore, that KILPATRICK need not fear finding LONGSTREET's men behind the Richmond fortifications when he shall reach them, as we hope he has already done.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LONGSTREET'S REPORTED ARRIVAL AT RICHMOND."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""LONGSTREET'S REPORTED ARRIVAL AT RICHMOND."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d314db7d-26b0-5a35-8fde-44730b632b03,232,nyt://article/d314db7d-26b0-5a35-8fde-44730b632b03

Several United States vessels arrived in the roadstead on the night of the Georgia's escape. The case of the Pampero had again been before the Court of Exchequer in Edinburgh, and the defendants asked for a dismissal, on the ground that the proceedings were informal. The matter was adjourned, that opportunity for a reply might be afforded the Crown Solicitor. In Parliament, alleged seizures by Federal cruisers of British vessels in neutral waters had been under discussion, and in the course of the debate it was shown that the instructions by the United States Government, to naval officers, was very explicit against capturing under such circumstances, and that if a case of this kind occurred, prompt reparation would doubtless be made. A vague rumor, on the 18th, that France intended soon to recognize the Confederacy,caused a rise of the rebel loan stock, but next day doubts of the truth of the rumor sent the stock back to its old figures. There was no material change in the situation of the Dano-German war. The Austrians, on the 18th, attacked the Danes in their intrenchments at Duppel, and were repulsed. An Austrain fleet of twelve war vessels had been ordered to cruise for the purpose of checkmating Danish naval operations. A growing feeling in favor of the Danes was manifest in the tone of French and English sentiment, while the high handed proceedings of Prussia and Austria were exciting the jealouises of the minor German States to such an extent that opposition was not improbable. The Italian Government were openly purchasing supplies and war material in France, and an impression prevailed that this was ominous of the inauguration of war on the Adriatic.

The rebels indicated to us what were the strongest natural positions on the river; and some of them they made a hard effort to hold, but in each and every instance they failed for want of the proper appliances. These positions, such as Port Hudson, Vicksburgh and others, have been taken hold of by our troops, and around them have been built new works, compared with which the rebel works were contemptible, while our appliances of artillery and our iron-clad naval supports add indefinitely to their superiority.

Every one seems perfectly satisfied with the action of Congress on the Currency, Tax and Military Bills. The Commissariat is doing as well as we have any right to expect. All are furnished with an abundance of good corn meal, moderate rations of bacon and beef, and frequently molasses, sugar and GENUINE coffee.

A shell burst near him, took off his right leg near the thigh, his right arm above the elbow, broke his jaw and carried away the flesh under it, tore off the flesh of the left thigh, and broke the forefinger of the left hand. From these injuries he recovered, and has been supplied by Surgeon MCDOUGAL, Medical Director of the Department of the East, with an artificial arm and hand, and will be with a leg so soon as the stump will bear it.

On the 1st of September, it seems, according to Lord DERBY's statement, Earl RUSSELL informed Mr. ADAMS that there was no evidence sufficient to satisfy the British Government that these vessels were intended for the Confederate service, and that they could not, therefore, interfere to prevent their departure; whereas, on the 8th, he writes to inform him that ""instructions have been issued to prevent their departure.""

"-- A curious instance of the all-pervading influence and vigilance of the Imperial Government of France is shown in Messrs. DIDOT's great Biographical Dictionary Nouvelle Biographic Generale, which has been in course of publication in Paris for the last ten or twelve years.

The life of NAPOLEON I, ostensibly written by M. RAPETTI, but evidently draws its inspiration from a higher source.

On Interference with Elections Bill--Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/05/archives/slavery-and-the-negro-negro-equality-before-the-law.html,On Interference with Elections Bill--Senate,"WASHINGTON, Wednesday, March 2. The report made by Senator SUMNER to-day, from the Committee on Slavery and Freedmen, in the bill to secure equality before the law in the courts of the United States, reviews the history of our jurisprudence in respect to the exclusion of colored testimony in the courts, and examines the laws in the several States relative to this subject. South Carolina, it appears, has never had a law excluding such testimony, yet practices exclusion. In concluding this review the report says: ""It is difficult to read the provisions in a single State without impatience, but the recurrence of this injustice, expressed with such particularity in no less than fifteen States, makes injustice swell into indignation, especially when it is considered that in every State this injustice is adopted and enforced by the courts of the United States. It further appears that in no State can a slave testify against a white person, excepting that in Maryland he may testify against a white person who is not a Christian. Only under certain circumstances in Delaware and Louisiana can a free negro testify against a white person. The eccentricities of judicial decisions illustrating this branch are numerously cited -- among the consequences of exclusion are mentioned the maltreatment or murder of slaves, with impunity, and the perpetration of crime against white men, in the presence of colored persons, with the same immunity from punishment. The report traces this proscription to the barbarous ages, and makes it the offspring of Slavery originating in ignorance and prejudice. Among the ancient Greeks, a slave's testimony was not believed upon his oath, but was admissible under torture. The Romans adopted similar legal practices. In England, under the common law, this proscription was again recognized. The grounds for such injustice are examined at length, and the report concludes as follows: ""It is for Congress to determine whether the proscription shall continue to be maintained.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SLAVERY AND THE NEGRO.; NEGRO EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SLAVERY AND THE NEGRO.; NEGRO EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6dea05b-aec4-572d-97dd-ff4eb30c6c4c,919,nyt://article/a6dea05b-aec4-572d-97dd-ff4eb30c6c4c

Dr. RAY was a native of Massachusetts, and a pupil of BEN BUTLER, when the latter was a schoolmaster. He entered and was graduated at Harvard College, and subsequently studied at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, from which he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. After completing his studies, he began to travel over the various countries of Europe on foot. His wanderings of this nature were probably more extensive than those of any man living, and at one time he wrote a series of interesting sketches of travel and life, under the title of Fourteen Thousand Miles Afoot. He returned to his native country, and studied for the ministry of the Episcopal Church, upon the duties of which he entered at Indianapolis. Before many years he left the ranks of the clergy, and joined those of literature. He came to this City, and for several years before the breaking out of the war was employed mainly in writing for the weekly Press, to which he contributed many fine descriptive and philosophic sketches and articles. After the capture of Norfolk, he went down there, and engaged in various journalistic enterprises. Latterly he has been the special correspondent of the New-York TIMES, writing for that print under the signature of ""Tewksbury."" He was engaged in writing for us an account of Gen.

A large number of the most prominent proprietors of printing houses of this City and a number from Boston were present. The table was beautifully arranged, and ornamented with statues of JOHN GUTTENBERG, Liberty, WASHINGTON, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and a Catherdale Gothique, After the dinner had been fully enjoyed, the finest wines were produced, speeches made, toasts drank and a general good time had until a late hour. The President, CHARLES A. ALVORD, made the opening speech, paying a fine compliment to their late President, JOHN F. TROW, and tendering him a vote of thanks for the perfect manner in which he had performed his duties during the past year.

Various Proper Modes of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/06/archives/reconstruction.html,Various Proper Modes of,"-A year ago there was a terrible war among political theorists as to the precise manner in which the reconstruction of the seceded States was to be effected. Scores of nicely-pointed, elaborately-constructed highly constitutional plans were put forward, each of which was the only scientific or possible plan, and vehement debates were waged between the excited adherents to each scheme. Once at that time we suggested that the great work was not likely to be carried out upon any very scientific principle, or any principle that would be uniform as regards details and conditions. In three States the process of political reconstruction is going on -- in Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee. In Louisiana the first step taken was by the President, through Gen. BANKS, ordering an election for Governor and State officers, which election has just taken place, and Louisiana will now have a civil government, (limited.) In Arkansas the people first met spontaneously in convention, revised the constitution, abolished Slavery, and themselves inaugurated the measures that will soon result in the election of local civil authorities and national representatives. In Tennessee the first step taken has been in the Military Governor ordering an election throughout the State for county officers, judges, etc.; and after this preliminary labor of reorganizaion is effected, steps will be taken for crowning and completing the work. Each of these different modes of operation, as regards detail, has the approval of the President, and all of them are proper and right. There may be another mode adopted in Mississippi, another in South Carolina, and so on. All modes lead to the same desirable end, though we do not remember that any of them were indicated in advance by the theorizers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RECONSTRUCTION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RECONSTRUCTION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5436fa82-f3f6-57f4-83da-3d06acbdaad9,285,nyt://article/5436fa82-f3f6-57f4-83da-3d06acbdaad9

Within that range it may be safely said that there is no band of rebels gathered exceeding fifty. I found the soldiers defending the town on either side of the borders in Missouri and Kansas, acting in earnest and cordial cooperation. They are engaged, not in repelling or driving out guerrillas, but to use their favorite expression, killing them off. To illustrate, I found Maj. BIRCH and Capt.

L., No. 3","We have said that, on the doctrine against which we are contending, our eighty years political life, or seeming political life, would present only as series of unwise and irrational proceedings. Aside from the heavy expenditures before mentioned, and whose wisdom or justice could only be maintained on the ground of their being national acts for national purposes, let us call to mind the annexation of Texas, the war with Mexico, the foreign territory thence acquired, the purchase of Florida, the proposed purchase of Cuba for $200,000,000. What meaning in all this, if the secession doctrine, or the State sovereignty doctrine, which is identical with it, has even a shadow of truth! And here we cannot help making the strange practical contradiction that has been manifested in our political course. No men have been more clamorous for what we may call the false nationality, than those who have ever sought to undermine the foundations on which alone our true nationality can rest. Whilst the North has been thus truly national, it has, in the main, been contented with the old bounds, the old territory, so beautifully unique, and which God had so manifestly made for one people, one nation, whereon to dwell apart from all the nations of the earth. To this truly national feeling it was like a ""promised land,"" which the Divine Eye had measured off in that olden time when God made provision for ""separating the people,"" and ""determined the fore-appointed bounds of their habitation."" We broke this decree in the acquisition of Lousiana, to any extent beyond the mouth of the Mississippi, and hence one most aggravating cause of our national woes. The North was content (we speak generally and mainly) with establishing the nation rather than extending it -- with making sure its foundations -- with making strong its upward growth, instead of weakening it by lateral diffusion with its utter indefiniteness and unnaturalness of circumscribing bound. But whence came the cry of annexation, territoral progress, ""manifest destiny,"" ""extension of the area of freedom,"" the carrying of the American flag, the symbol of our one sovereignty, over Mexico and the American Continent? Whence came filibustering expeditions having ever professedly in view such national objects as these? We heard it first, we have heard it always, from these men, these men of the South, with their partisan allies of the North, who have ever denied our true nationality, or held doctrines utterly inconsistent with any such idea.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STATE SOVEREIGNTY.; Considered Historically, Conventially and Geographically.

"Hunt, William, English Painter",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/06/archives/foreign-items.html,"Hunt, William, English Painter","-- The Manchester Examiner, of Feb. 12, says: ""Mr. William Hunt, the well known painter in water-colors, died at his residence, Stanhope-street, Hampstead-road, at the age of 74. Mr. Hunt has exhibited in the gallery of the Society of Painters in Water-colors, since 1824. His works hale latterly formed one of the chief attractions of the annual exhibitions, and their absence will create a void that the Society will not easily be able to fill. His exquisite color and delicate manipulation were not more conspicuous than his intense perception of the beauties of those objects of still life which he so loved to paint. Nor were his powers limited to the faithful reproduction of fruit and flowers. As a painter of flesh he was, perhaps, unequalled, and his rendering of humorous phases of rustic life also was sufficient to win him an enduring reputation. His studies of landscape, sea and sky, reveal to the instructed eye a capacity for this branch of art equal to those by which he is more popularly known. Mr. Hunt was an honorary member of the Academy of Amsterdam in addition to being a member of the Water-colour Society. Although of late his infirmity has been greatly increased, Mr. Hunt has never relinquished work, except under temporary excess of indisposition. Debarred in a great measure from the pleasures of society, almost his sole delight was in his work. He may be said to have died in harness, for so lately as last Saturday, he was at his easel until mid-day, and only left it to visit the Gallery in Suffolk street, where the competition pictures of the candidates for associateships of the Water-colour Society were exhibited. Probably the last act of his life was sending his proxies for some of the competitors. During the night between Sunday and Monday, an attack of paralysis supervened upon the indisposition which had manifested itself soon after returning home from the Gallery. There was no return of consciousness, and shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morning he expired.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4e6da96-cafc-58f1-8cbc-15860194ea65,2126,nyt://article/c4e6da96-cafc-58f1-8cbc-15860194ea65

He was duly convicted of the offence; the plea of insanity was set up on the trial without effect, and he was sentenced to death. But some of his personal friends induced a surgeon and two of the ""visiting justices"" of the jail in which he was confined, to examine him and certify to the Secretary of State that, though he might not have been insane at the time of the commission of the offence, he had since become so, and was then actually non compos. Under these circumstances, the act of Parliament permits the Secretary to remit the capital sentence, and send the criminal to a lunatic asylum, and Sir GEORGE GREY accordingly, without more ado, reprieved TOWNLEY, and put him into the hands of a doctor. The result was a great outcry, as it was widey believed that the culprit owed his escape to his social position rather than to disease. A subsequent examination by more impartial judges established the fact that he was not insane, and he has accordingly been remanded to jail, but his sentence has been commuted to ""penal servitude"" for life.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pardoning Power.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pardoning Power.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eff25cff-692f-5b3e-a2a0-c639640b2932,710,nyt://article/eff25cff-692f-5b3e-a2a0-c639640b2932

Brooklyn U. S. Sanitary Commission Fair Closed,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/07/archives/the-closing-of-the-sanitary-fair.html,Brooklyn U. S. Sanitary Commission Fair Closed,"The great Sanitary Fair virtually closed on Saturday night, although the Academy proper will be kept open for two or three days longer at greatly reduced prices, in order to accommodate those who felt themselves unable to pay seventy-five cents. Single admissions will hereafter be twenty-five cents, and season tickets will be of no avail. The proceeds of the sale of goods will, as heretofore, be devoted to the purpose for which the fair was established; but the receipts at the door will be kept as a special fund to be distributed to such worthy objects as the Executive and Special Committees may deem most beneficial. The total receipts, as officially announced on Saturday evening, were $365,000. This is independent of a large amount of bills and checks, still uncounted, and which it is estimated will reach from $20,000 to $25,000, making the whole sum realized, above every expense, at from $385,000 to $390,000. The receipts during the coming week will doubtless swell the amount to $400,000. The population of the City of Brooklyn at the last census in 1860, was 266,674 -- it may now be over 300,000 -- thus showing that considerable more than one dollar per head, for each inhabitant, has been given in aid of the Sanitary Commission.

Long before the time of opening the doors they were besieged by a dense crowd of ladies. When the opera commenced the house was filled, up stairs and down, to its greatest capacity. Many hundred fair ones had to turn from the scene of their anticipated pleasure and decline on inferior entertainments. Not even during the PICCOLOMINI furore was there such an excitement. The performance was in all respects admirable. There was one change in the cast, necessiated by the continued indisposition of Miss KELLOGG. Owing to this cause the role of Margherita had to be entrusted to Mile. FREDERICI-HIMMER, who sang it in German, and was quite successful. The music belongs properly to the mezzo-soprano voice, and is therefore easily within the range of the German prima donna's powers. When Mr. ANSCHUTZ's company gave ""Faust"" we spoke favorably of Mile.

Kilpatrick's Raid to Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/07/archives/the-rebellion.html,Kilpatrick's Raid to Richmond,"Our special correspondent with Gen. KILPATRICK's expedition sends us a full and reliable account of the late cavalry raid to the vicinity of Richmond, Virginia. Gen. KILPATRICK, it appears, left Stevensburgh on Sunday evening last, and went by the way of Chancellorsville and Spottsylvania Court-house to Beaver Dam, where he met the first armed resistance. The enemy were finally repulsed, and 32 prisoners taken. The railroad track for miles on the Central Road and several different stations were destroyed when the command moved upon Richmond, arriving before that place early Tuesday morning. A fight was kept up within the defences of that place until near night, when Gen. KILPATRICK withdrew. That night he was attacked in camp, and again repulsed the enemy, and also on the following day, arriving Thursday at Williamsburgh with the loss of only about 150 men. Col. DAHLGREN, with a small command, destroyed the railroad at Frederick Hall and on the James River, below Goochland, destroyed the canal, six flouring mills, one saw mill, and the coal mines at Manikin's Bend. The property destroyed is valued at millions of dollars, and is the heaviest loss that has yet been inflicted upon the rebels by a raiding party. Some 300 prisoners were captured, several hundred horses and a large number of negroes. The command lived on the country. Cols. Dahlgren and Litch-FIELD and Maj. COOK are missing. We also print this morning the rebel accounts of the expedition. It appears that within four hours after the Richmond papers had first announced the passage of the Rapidan by our forces, KILPATRICK's guns were pitching shell into the suburbs of the city. Our own account will be found very full and interesting, as well as being the only one prepared by a special correspondent with the expedition.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97b8acad-63dc-5cbd-b77b-3fbab6a7df82,785,nyt://article/97b8acad-63dc-5cbd-b77b-3fbab6a7df82

"A sad accident occurred on Saturday afternoon last, in front of the premises No. 83 Henry-street, whereby a boy named THOMAS P. MCMAHON, aged 11 years, came to his death by being buried alive. Some workmen were engaged in the work of filling in an old well located in front of the above number, near the sidewalk, when the earth suddenly gave way. A large portion of the sidewalk went down, carrying with it the lad MCMAHON and another boy named WM.

Fortunately, the mass of falling earth and stones jammed at this distance, and thus two lives were saved. The well was some forty feet deep. The men immediately set to work to rescue the two children, WILLIAM KEARNEY and MAGGIE MOORE, who were seen in the mass below, but the lad MCMAHON, was buried under it; and, moreover, his fall had not been noticed. The little girl was not buried alive, and was promptly rescued, a rope being thrown her. The lad, KEARNEY, was buried up to his cheat; it was ascertained that his body was firmly wedged between a large flagstone and an ash-box, both of which had been carried down into the opening. The earth around consists principally of sand, and was constantly falling upon the imprisoned boy. The danger was imminent, for at any moment the adjoining earth might bury him alive. Sergeant EASTERBROOK, of the Seventh Precinct, was on hand, and aided very materially in the work of saving the boy's lite.

Neutrality Policy and its Consequences,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/07/archives/the-rewards-of-public-perfidy.html,Neutrality Policy and its Consequences,"It is remarkable how public injustice and want of faith always come back to plague their authors. During the time of what seemed to European eyes our national dissolution, when the great Republic was breaking up into fragments, the fitting out and sending forth of privateers from British ports to destroy,under a bastard flag, our falling commerce, seemed to many British eyes a highly agreeable and exciting pastime. Ships were openly built, fitted out, armed and manned in Great Britain. When complaints were addressed to the Government, the proofs were either not considered legally sound, or certain public officers were providentially stricken with diseases, so that the suspected ships might escape through their delays. ""Dodges"" of various kinds were adopted to shield and secure the departure of the dangerous privateers. It needed but a few fast-sailing steamers thus to go forth to destroy half our commerce, as our English friends well knew. When Mr. ADAMS protested in the name of the British Municipal Act, he was told by the public that they must judge of the execution of their own laws, that England could not proceed in violation of law, as some countries were in the habit of doing, and that evidence was exceedingly difficult to procure in such cases. When, standing on a broader platform, he protested against such acts in the name of International Law, and pled the unchanging example of the American Government in similar cases, he was put off with ambiguous declarations and replies, such as that both sides were thus receiving help from Great Britain, and neither had a right to complain.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rewards of Public Perfidy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rewards of Public Perfidy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e43f5b43-691e-5f5f-8009-201ce8fe6260,840,nyt://article/e43f5b43-691e-5f5f-8009-201ce8fe6260

We hope the interests of ""eternal truth,"" or ""eternal justice,"" or some other magnificent abstraction, are promoted by these investigations; for there is nothing more certain than that the discipline of the army will be, if it be not already, utterly destroyed by them. We say deliberately, that there can be nothing better calculated to render our army utterly worthless, than the practice to which Congress and the Government is addicted of listening to charges made by officers against their chief, touching his strategy or tactics. The only complaints which they should ever be permitted to make, or which by any sound and generally adopted theory of military duty, they are permitted to make, are complaints of personal wrong done to themselves, These are fit matters for examination; because examinations may be often necessary, to prevent the General from degenerating into a petty tyrant. But to allow any officer to arraign his superior before any tribunal, -- we do not care how composed, -- to answer for his manner of handling the army in active service, for retreating, or advancing, or fighting, is so subversive of all discipline, of all proper subordination, and all proper sense of responsibility, that we confess we cannot understand how any intelligent friends of the Government, in Congress or out of it, can possibly countenance it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

Resolutions were adopted by both boards, requiring the Harlem Railroad Company to extend their line for short cars to Forty-second-street, and also permitting them to extend their road through Thirty-fourth-street to the East River, and also permitting the Third-avenue Railroad to extend their line through Chambers-street to Broadway, through Fifty-seventh-street to Third-avenue, through Thirty-fourth-street to the East River, over the proposed Harlem track, and through One Hundred and Thirtieth-street to Fourth-avenue. The Third-avenue grant is entirely new, but the Harlem grant is identical with the one passed by the Board of Aldermen December 14, 1863, but which was killed by a reference in the Council Board to the Railroad Committee, where it was at the close of the year. There was no debate in the Board of Aldermen on these grants, but in the Council Board Mr. OPDYKE proposed to amend by requiring the Third-avenue Company to pay ten per cent. of their receipts on the extended route into the City Treasury, while Mr. JAQUES proposed to require a license fee for each car. The latter gentleman made a strenuous effort to secure a reference, but Messrs. BRANDON and GROSS held that these extensions were needed by public convenience, and that view of the matter seemed to prevail. In the Board of Aldermen, the City Inspector sent in a much needed ordinance to regulate disinterments within the City limits. In the Council Board, RUSH C, HAWKINS remonstrated against the proposed purchase of CLARK C. MILLS' statue of Gen.

It is the intention, we believe, to raise by public subscription in Massachusetts, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and to use it in the purchase of such articles of food and clothing as are imperatively demanded; and the report made on yesterday by EDWARD EVERETT, who has the matter in charge, shows that in a very short time nearly fifty thousand dollars have been subscribed, mostly in sums of about fifty or one hundred dollars. Some of the most prominent merchants of this City are taking an interest in the same work of charity, as will be seen by a correspondence in another column; and, under their auspices, a public meeting will be held on Thursday of the current week, at which the condition and wants of the people of East Tennessee will be set forth. For three years past the press has been setting before the country the persecutions of these Southern Unionists; and by the terrible nature and long continuance of their sufferings, their needs may now be measured.

The public was much disappointed, some time ago, to learn that the report of the blockade of the Alabama, at Amoy, China, was untrue. It was not only not true, but it appears that the Alabama never was further eastward than Singapore, in the Straits of Malacca. From there she sailed on the 24th of December, having taken on board 300 tons of coal, and the same day fell in with the bark Texan Star, otherwise called Martaban, from Moulmein, Burmah, for Singapore, with a cargo of rice. The particulars of the destruction of this vessel are well known. The pirate kept on her course up the Straits, and two days later burned the American ships Sonora and Highlander, both at anchor off North Sands (Sumatra) light-ship. The next heard of her was, that she was in the Gulf of Martaban, about fifty miles south of Rangoon, Burmah. She then seems to have crossed over the Bay of Bengal, swept around Cape Comorin, the southern extremity of India, and sailed up the western coast of that country; for we next hear of the capture of the bark Emma Jane, on the 14th of January, off Ajenga, on the southwestern coast of India. This is the last positive information of her whereabouts, though it was generally supposed she would pursue her course up the coast and touch at Bombay, as the Times of India, (Bombay,) of January 23, speaks of it as not at all unlikely. That journal urged the people to show no favor to the pirates. From these movements it would seem that SEMMES has given up for the present any intention he may have had of visiting the Chinese seas and Pacific Ocean, and we may possibly hear of him next in the vicinity of Cape Town again, as he is probably aware of the absence of the Vanderbilt. The other pirates are the Tuscaloosa, now seized by British authority at Cape Town; the Florida, just escaped from Brest; the Georgia, lately escaped from Cherbourg; the Rappahannock, under surveillance at Calais; and the Pampero, lately seized in the Clyde. The Georgia and Florida will doubtless soon be heard from in their work of destruction.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL PIRATES RAVAGES AND WHEREABOUTS OF THE ALABAMA.; ABOUTS OF THE ALABAMA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL PIRATES RAVAGES AND WHEREABOUTS OF THE ALABAMA.; ABOUTS OF THE ALABAMA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/56ac88df-5c44-5c93-b51c-1ae069e7041a,393,nyt://article/56ac88df-5c44-5c93-b51c-1ae069e7041a

Soldiers' Vote Amendment Ratified,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/09/archives/the-amendment-ratified.html,Soldiers' Vote Amendment Ratified,"The very reasonable anticipation that the people would indorse the amendment to the State Constitution, permitting soldiers to exercise the right of suffrage, was verified by the election held yesterday. The bald justice of the proposition was so palpable, and loyal men felt so well assured that the opposition to the measure would be weak, that there was much carelessness about going to the polls. No special effort was made to roll up a heavy vote; and, judging from the complete returns of this City and Brooklyn, about one-third of the vote ordinarily cast at gubernatorial elections was delivered. Although it would have been vastly more gratifying for the brave fellows who have forsaken home and friends, and risked their lives for the preservation of the national existence, to have received the just compliment of a full vote in a case where there has been little question of their deserts, we are not disposed to complain of the result. It is always difficult in elections, under circumstances marking that yesterday, to overcome the indolence and passiveness of the electors, and had it not been for the services of professional politicians, in this City at least, the amendment might actually have been floored through the sheer indifference of its friends. The Copperheads came out, presumably, in their full strength against it, seldom with an open ballot, but furtively, as is their nature. Our tables show that of the 25,000 votes cast, 6,899 were against the soldiers' rights. Indeed, three of the Wards of the City -- the First, Sixth and Fourteenth -- have won the disgraceful victory of giving small Copperhead majorities. As a set-off to them the Thirty-second Precinct only opposed the amendment by six votes, and the entire City of Brooklyn gave but 600 in the negative against 8,235 in favor.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMENDMENT RATIFIED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE AMENDMENT RATIFIED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b4a521c4-fd07-526f-b1e3-20f0fc6a1deb,302,nyt://article/b4a521c4-fd07-526f-b1e3-20f0fc6a1deb

The caulkers waited on the Admiral on the same day, and stated that they could get more wages outside than they were paid in the yard; but their determination was to state their case to him and not to strike. The Admiral promised to represent the matter to the Government. The watchmen now get 13 shillings per diem, and they are about to apply for two dollars or 15 shillings. The blacksmiths also ask an advance, and the carpenters are said to be similarly inclined. The decision of the Secretary of the Navy regulates the pay of Navy-yard employes as outside workmen are paid; but the hands now assert that since their wages were increased last, a still further advance has taken place outside; and the present movement aims to affect another ""equalization.""

The Corporation Counsel communicated the opinion, in answer to a resolution of inquiry, that it is altogether optional with the board whether they will pay damages to non-residents for losses of property by the riots. Mr. PURDY expressed the opinion that non-residents should not receive damages where their property is of a kind that does not contribute toward the support of the County. The board adopted a resolution appointing ANTONY EICKOFF Translator to the Courts of Record in the County, at a salary of $2,500, and another resolution was adopted granting a request of Comptroller BRENNAN, that he be allowed to appoint two additional Clerks in the County Bureau, at salaries of $1,000 and $1,200. A third resolution was unanimously adopted in favor of recommending the Legislature to repeal the act of 1855 creating the Record Commission. Thanks were voted to Gov. SEYMOUR at the instance of Mr. ELY, for securing a reduction of the State's quota of troops, whereby the county quota is reduced over 4,000, and is saved $2,000,000. The board decided to hire Nos. 159 and 161 Crosby-street, known as the ""Gymnasium,"" as an armory for the Ninety-ninth Regiment N.Y.S.N.G., at $2,200 per year, for five years. Bills for labor and materials on the Palace Garden building, amounting to $8,070 64, were passed.

Maximilian's Reasons for Wishing a Throne,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/10/archives/a-new-way-to-pay-old-debts.html,Maximilian's Reasons for Wishing a Throne,"The embryonic Emperor MAXIMILIAN was to arrive in Paris the first week of this month, on his way to the City of Mexico. Our Paris correspondent mentions that one of the reasons impelling MAXIMILIAN to run the risk of his neck in Mexico is that he is in debt eight millions of francs, which he is unable to pay, but which he hopes to be able to pick up in Mexico. This is the most plausible reason we have yet seen given for MAXIMILIAN's foolish eagerness to get a throne. Many are the shifts resorted to by men afflicted with debts they cannot pay, and who are pushed by their creditors. Debt has driven Kings to war, plunder and oppression; under its scourgings, respectable men have been guilty of murder, suicide, arson, and every crime prohibited by the decalogue; it has betrayed gentlemen into trickery and meanness, and ladies into wearing Spring fashions in Midsummer. The case in hand shows that a Hapsburg Prince in debt is as desperate as any other man; but whether the expedient he has resorted to, of getting out of it, will be successful remains to be seen. We do not know what wages MAXIMILIAN expects to get as Emperor of Mexico, but he must needs have a very large annual salary, and subsist very economically, and live to a very old age, if he would save up eight millions of francs during his reign in Mexico. At the very opening of his imperial career he will have to purchase a crown, and a throne, and a whole lot of new clothes; and it is evident that, being already so heavily in debt, he will have to get all these necessaries on credit and thus he will run still farther in debt. If he undertake to travel much through his empire, he will need to buy new garments very often, for we learn by recent advices from Mexico that the robbers who infest every highway in that country, are getting so desperate of late that they enter the diligences and strip all travellers stark naked -- which would be a dreadful plight for an Emperor to be in. We think, therefore, on the whole, that MAXIMILIAN's honorable ambition to pay up his old debts out of his pickings and stealings in the New World, is likely to be blasted; and as there will almost certainly be a scramble for crowns in Europe before many years, we advise him to stay there -- where his chances for getting and keeping one are much better than they are here.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f7ec18c-b1f7-58bd-9dab-fa978d24b7ff,432,nyt://article/9f7ec18c-b1f7-58bd-9dab-fa978d24b7ff

She has proved herself to be a splendid seaboat and she is a substantial, well built vessel in every respect. She was built in 1847, and most thoroughly constructed; her cabin skylights are emblazoned with the arms of the Earl of Eglington, whose crest also adorns the cabin windows of the prize steamers Scotia, Anglia and Adela, as well as the Cumberland's. The cabins of the Cumberland are fitted up in the most luxurious manner. Her machinery is pronounced faultless, the boilers are new, and the hull being of iron of extra thickness and well braced and fastened, renders her exeedingly stiff in a seaway. She could be easily transformed into a gunboat. The Navy could not make a better selection. She was used as a transport in the Crimean war, has been in the St. Petersburgh and London trade, and once ran in the Galway and New-York line. She is the finest steamship captured during the war. Her cargo is also very valuable; it is sent to New-York with the vessel for sale, and will be advertised in a few days by the United States Marshal of Florida -- JAMES C.

Economy of Force,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/11/archives/the-work-of-our-armies-economy-of-forces.html,Economy of Force,"There has undoubtedly been great wastage of men, and consequently of power, in the course of this war. We do not refer to the necessary destruction of life that accompanies all war, but to waste from following wrong military theories, from scatteration, from lack of experience and of system, from carelessness and blundering. We have gotten up great expeditions to accomplish unimportant objects -- some of which expeditions have succeeded while others have failed; and some of those which were failures have been less loss to the country than those which succeeded. Our expeditions to the Carolinas, North and South, for example, have cost us many thousands of men and hundreds of millions of dollars; yet what relative gain has the Union had from them? We have been enabled for some time past to make a pretty effective blockade of the coast line of these two States, and that is about all; but the great results which the country expected would follow those expeditions, such as the capture of Wilmington, Charleston and Savannah, and, above all, the pushing of an army inland as far as Raleigh and Columbia, are not likely to be accomplished soon, if, indeed, they are now thought of at all. So, again, immense numbers of men have been wasted, and are still being wasted, by the stationing of regiments, or parts of regiments, here, there and everywhere in the South, to hold posts, towns, or territory, that are of no earthly, or at all events, of no military account whatever. We doubt not that in the Southwest alone there are twenty thousand men employed in this kind of duty to-day who could profitably be withdrawn and united with either one of the two great armies in whose hands is now lodged the work of crushing out the rebellion. We can judge of the value of each one of these regiments -- we can judge of the wrong that is done to the country in this waste of the national force, by reflecting upon the great difficulty and dreadful expense which we now undergo in this City and elsewhere in raising a regiment of troops. Each of our great armies gains as much, nay, gains twice as much, when one of these detached regiments is drawn in from an unimportant post, as when, after all our trouble, we have succeeded in forwarding to the army a thousand men. We could hope that along with all the new regiments which are now being raised throughout the country, there were also a gathering in and a concentration at the fundamental points, of every regiment, every company, and every man, whose whole power cannot be brought directly and immediately to bear upon the rebel armies. In this way, we would soon be able to plant in Georgia and Virginia two armies of such magnitude, as to make sure and quick work of their opponents.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Work of Our Armies Economy of Forces.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Work of Our Armies Economy of Forces.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a9d2f5f-321b-5f00-8ae0-63b937e01c0d,889,nyt://article/3a9d2f5f-321b-5f00-8ae0-63b937e01c0d

We hope it will receive attention. The state of things now existing is utterly disgraceful, and is growing worse and worse. The City cars have always been packed to the extent of their capacity, without the slightest regard to the rights, comfort or convenience of their passengers; but until quite lately it was rare to find an omnibus driver keep on adding to his load after there were already twelve inside. Now, however, not the slightest attention is paid to this circumstance. We have seen policemen in Broadway put three ladies into an omnibus in which every seat had already been taken and paid for. A policeman who will do this ought to be dismissed. In Paris a driver who would allow it to be done would be arrested by the police: here, the police aid the drivers in thus imposing on the public. The proprietors of both omnibuses and railroads seem to have given instructions to pack as many people into their vehicles as they can possibly be made to hold.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MANAGEMENT OF OUR CITY CONVEYANCES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MANAGEMENT OF OUR CITY CONVEYANCES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bdf2ba37-02db-582f-b6d6-68a7fb928d8b,553,nyt://article/bdf2ba37-02db-582f-b6d6-68a7fb928d8b

Career of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/11/archives/bragg-and-grant.html,Career of,"BRAXTON BRAGG has just been appointed to the highest military office under JEFF. DAVIS, and ULYSSES GRANT, by his appointment as Lieutenant-General, assumes the highest rank of any officer in the army of the Union. The respective careers and fortunes of no two military men could be more opposite in character than those of these two ranking officers of the opposing armies. BRAGG's name is synonymous with disaster -- GRANT's with victory. The Richmond Examiner says that BRAGG's ""career has been a long, unvaried and complete failure,"" -- the very reverse of which statement would be nearly the truth concerning GRANT, BRAGG's first undertaking of any importance resulted in his failure at Pensacola; GRANT's first large action was his triumph at Donelson. BRAGG's last battle was at Chattanooga, where his whole army was routed by GRANT. Against GRANT's Vicksburgh we have BRAGG's Murfreesboro; against GRANT's Champion Hills we have BRAGG's Perryville. GRANT flanked the rebels at Bowling Green and Columbus, and BRAGG got flanked at Tullahoma and Shelbyville. GRANT began operations at Cairo, and the sweep of his successive victories, as he marched onward, extended a thousand miles. BRAGG once had his army upon the Ohio, and his successive retreats from there covered several hundred miles. So we might go on, contrasting in still other respects the history of the two Generals who are now the ranking officers in the two armies.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BRAGG AND GRANT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BRAGG AND GRANT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c86d57f4-a488-5498-8a3c-e75f5c80027d,232,nyt://article/c86d57f4-a488-5498-8a3c-e75f5c80027d

"The New-Jersey Railroad depot, at Jersey City, has for several evenings past been the scene of disturbances, which are growing more violent with every repetition. To protect themselves, as is alleged from fraud, whether by their own agents or passengers, does not appear, the company has revived and made more stringent than ever an absurd regulation, requiring all travellers commuters included, to show their tickets as they enter or leave the depot at Jersey-City. There are but two or three gates through which individuals desiring to take the cars or the ferry-boat, as the case may be, are permitted to pass, and the restriction which the regulation alluded to puts upon their movements, for from four to seven hundred passengers are frequently gathered there at one time, inevitably gives rise to the greatest confusion. On several occasions the passengers have become so irritated at the vexatious delay and the serious inconvenience to which they are subjected that they have attempted to clear a passage for themselves, and the demonstrations finally became so violent that the company was obliged to call in the services of a number of policemen, who are now regularly stationed in the depot to assist in the enforcement of the obnoxious regulations.

To protect themselves, as is alleged from fraud, whether by their own agents or passengers, does not appear, the company has revived and made more stringent than ever an absurd regulation, requiring all travellers commuters included, to show their tickets as they enter or leave the depot at Jersey-City. There are but two or three gates through which individuals desiring to take the cars or the ferry-boat, as the case may be, are permitted to pass, and the restriction which the regulation alluded to puts upon their movements, for from four to seven hundred passengers are frequently gathered there at one time, inevitably gives rise to the greatest confusion. On several occasions the passengers have become so irritated at the vexatious delay and the serious inconvenience to which they are subjected that they have attempted to clear a passage for themselves, and the demonstrations finally became so violent that the company was obliged to call in the services of a number of policemen, who are now regularly stationed in the depot to assist in the enforcement of the obnoxious regulations.

The performance was, in all respects, excellent, and needs but a few words of remark. Signor BIACHI being sick, Herr HERMANNS took his place. The last-mentioned gentleman will be remembered as a member of Mr. ANSCHUTZ's German company. He appeared with merited success in the ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" and in one or two minor parts subsequently rendered, maintained the honorable impression thus awakened. His addition to Mr. MARETZEK's company, last night, was, of course, a matter of necessity, but we think it may hereafter be a matter of choice. Mr. HERMANNS has a voice of beautiful quality, not powerful and striking in delivery, but melodious and appreciable to a large degree. As an actor he is immeasurably the best Mephistophiles we have had here. The rondo of the second act, although sung in German, won a deserved encore mainly because it was sung with an inclsive satanic spirit that has never before been infused into it. Mr. HERMANNS' acting, indeed, throughout was so good that -- whatever may be its precise Goethian value -- it gave a dramatic significance to a role that so far has only been musical in its direct interest. We may add here, as a matter of justice to the gentleman we have named, that he is fully competent to the task of singing the part in Italian, but being called upon at short notice, he had not time to learn the words.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d32f319-180f-51e2-bf2c-b916c0ce051d,340,nyt://article/1d32f319-180f-51e2-bf2c-b916c0ce051d

The board adopted a resolution in favor of recommending the Legislature to permit the City to donate a plot of land on Ward's Island to the ""Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Orphan Children in the City of New-York,"" provided they will use the the same exclusively for buildings to be erected in furtherance of the object of the society. To the resolution of inquiry why he has not perfected the purchase of the Fort Ganeavoot property, Comptroller BRENNAN sent in a communication, accompanied with legal opinions -- all making a lengthy document, which was ordered to be published in [???]. The substance of the whole is, that the lawyers think the mandamus of the Supreme Court, to compel the Comptroller to issue the bonds to pay for the property, likely will be affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and that, in such a event, he would be personally liable for damages, he having overstepped the purely ministerial line of his duty. The Board considered and passed the special order -- the Annual Appropriation Bill -- with an increase of $2,000 to the item for City Dispensaries, and new items as follows: To purchase MILLS' statue of JACKSON, $33,500; to prepare a Division Parade-ground, $40,000; for lithographing and engraving for, and binding of the Corporation Manual, $20,000; Northwestern Dispensary -- construction of new building, $10,000; removal of obstructions in Hell-gate, $40,000; improvement of the Russ pavement, $100,000; resetting boundary monument stones above Fourteenth-street, $40,000; settlement of claims for damages by the powder explosion, foot of East Seventy-eighth-street, $40,000; working Eighth-avenue as a country road, from One Hundred and Forty-second-street to Harlem River, $10,000 -- making a grand total increase of $335,500 over the amount reported by the Finance Committtee, and of $398,049 37 over the estimates of the Comptroller. In a discussion upon the propriety of reducing the Corporation Counsel's contingencies from $30,000 to $20,000, (he had asked for $50,000). Mr. HARDY stated that of last year's fund Mr. DEVELIN had paid out $12,000 during the last quarter, of which $7,200 went to the Assistant Corporation Counsel, as extra pay, over and above a handsome salary. The City Budget now to go before the Council Board, foots up $5,737,568 02, and inclusive of the appropriations to pay that part of the City debt falling due this year, and interest on Stocks and Loans, makes a full total of $8,411,313 23, and added to the County Budget ($5,854,907 65) already passed, a grand total of $14,266,220 88.

"We very much regret to say that the storm now in part raging, has made a perfect wreck of the ill-fated steamship Bohemian. In the height of the strong northeasterly gale yesterday, every vehicle that could be procured was early engaged for a visit to the scene of the disaster. From our special reporter, who left late yesterday afternoon, we learn that the ship was rapidly breaking up, and that the shores were strewed with the debris of the wreck. Packages of valuable goods came ashore, and many articles were washing about the seaweed, boxes of tea, many of them bursted, gloves, neckties, belts, silks, stockings, and every imaginable article, which were fished up by the multitude present. There were a large number of men present to protect the property, but it was so scattered and so broken up, that it was impossible to secure it all. Indeed, it would have been useless to have attempted it. Spools of cotton, skeins of silk and thread, torn silks, and other fragments were floating about at the mercy of the waves. The saddest walls of all were three bodies that washed ashore, a little girl, a woman and a man. The man was in a state perfectly recognizable, but we have not learned his name.

He has cultivated, moreover, with some success, the habit of attending to his own business, and leaving the members of Congress to attend to theirs, and he generally ""works"" through the columns of the TIMES rather than in the Congressional lobbies. He has expressed the opinion through that channel that there is no occasion whatever just now for the passage of such an act, -- that Slavery is being much more rapidly, certainly and wisely abolished by the action of the Slave States and the movement of our armies than it could be by amending the Constitution, and that the country has nothing to gain by throwing this new bone of contention into the Presidential canvass.

This, of course, means neither more nor less than a European war of the first magnitude, and well calculated to try to the uttermost the strength of every Power engaged in it: It would probably result in the dismemberment of Prussia, the reduction of Austria to the second class of Powers, the restoration of Poland, and the consolidation of Italy.

Magazines for March,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/13/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines for March,"-- The Atlantic Monthly, (Boston, TICKNOR & FIELDS,) spreads an attractive bill of fare before its readers. The first article that will be generally turned to, in all probability, is BAYARD TAYLOR's paper on WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY. Written, as it is, from personal recollections, and relating many interesting traits of character and anecdotes of THACKERAY, it contains more novelty than any of the similar tributes that the English press now teems with. ""The Queen of California"" is a curious resume of an old romance of chivalry of the Amadis de Gaul cycle. ""Esplandiar"" wherein the name is given to a country, (twenty-five years before the discovery of our California,) containing no metal but gold. It is described as an island ""on the right hand of the Indies;"" and it would appear that CORTEZ adopted the name he conferred on the country from the romance, by a strange and almost prophetic anticipation of its riches. ""Wet Weather Work, by a Farmer,"" (Ik. Marvel,) contains the customary blending of solid, and often recondite information on agriculture, with the graceful amenities of the literary essayist. Fiction is represented solely by Miss CHEESEBORO's ""Ambassadors in Bonds."" ""Our Soldiers"" and the ""Peninsular Campaign"" are well written articles on subjects of current interest -- the latter a searching review of the official reports of those operations. The poetry is contributed by JOHN G. WHITTIER, Dr. O.W. HOLMES and ALICE CARY, and sustains the reputation of those writers. Dr. HOLMES' ""Our Classmate,"" written on the death of a fellow student, is a poem that will touch many hearts. Mr. CABOT's learned and thoughtful essay ""On the Relation of Art to Nature,"" is concluded in the present number. Mrs. STOWE continues with spirit her ""House and Home Papers;"" and ROBERT DALE OWEN finishes his account of a very disagreeable subject, ""The Convulsionists of St. Medard."" A critical notice of WHITTIER, by D.A. WASSON, ends the list of original papers.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32cde9cb-f966-51e9-8294-00447a85dd9b,1055,nyt://article/32cde9cb-f966-51e9-8294-00447a85dd9b

"Democracy the, and Emperor Napoleon",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/13/archives/french-democracy.html,"Democracy the, and Emperor Napoleon","""All excesses,"" says WASHINGTON, ""are dangerous to liberty;"" and there is no country where this saying has been so often verified as in France. As the atrocities of the Reign of Terror brought about that reaction which led to the establishment of the first Empire, so the extravagancies of the Socialists were made to serve as a pretext for the setting up of the second, which has acquired stability from the schism between the Bourgeoise and the Operatives. Since the coup d'etat of '52, the strong hand of the Imperial Government has kept this schism from producing any marked effects, but now it suddenly begins to give signs of vitality once more, and that at a time when the combined efforts of the two great sections of the people are especially needed to sustain the cause of constitutionalism. In Paris, where every man, not a minor or a convict, can be a candidate for the Legislature, or an elector, certain of the working classes have just put forth a manifesto, in which they complain that their order is not properly represented in the Lower Chamber that there is not one among the Deputies who takes the trouble to expound or support their interests, and that they are tired of merely playing the part of voters at the requisition of a group of journalists who assume the exercise of a monopoly in electoral matters.

Such a person they found in a vice-principal of a neighboring school, (one of the first in the City) numbering over 2,500 scholars, with which he had been connected as teacher and vice-principal for upward of thirteen years. He was also well and favorably known in the Twelfth Ward, and had been from his boyhood. A very large number of students, prepared principally by him, had been from time to time sent from his school to the Free Academy. The people wanted such a man as principal of this school. Unfortunately, just before the matter came up for decision, the decease of the Hon. JAMES C. WILLET, late Commissioner, occurred; and though he was strongly in favor of appointing this principal, a delicate regard for his memory, prevented his colleagues filling the vacancy of Commissioner before the appointment of a principal for this school.

Chesapeake Case; The Release of the Pirates,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/14/archives/new-phase-of-the-chesapeake-case.html,Chesapeake Case; The Release of the Pirates,"We noticed some days since that the Marshal was sending a steamboat off to Halifax to receive and bring here for trial the pirates of the Chesapeake. It occurred to us at the time that it might be a little hasty, inasmuch as the result of the habeas corpus, which had been issued in their case might be such that the vessel would go to Halifax on a fool's errand. The result thus far has been as we feared it might be. The Judge before whom the habeas corpus was heard, decides that the prisoners cannot be delivered up to our authorities, for four reasons. Three of them are merely technical, being that the requisition was informal; that the magistrate who issued the warrant had no authority to issue it, and that if he had, the warrant itself was defective on its face. These are small points, and unimportant, because we take it that our officials can make out a requisition which shall be correct, and that there are magistrates in Halifax who have authority to issue such warrants and who are able to draw them correctly -- and, if these were the only grounds of discharge, a new proceeding would doubtless cure those defects.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New Phase of the Chesapeake Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New Phase of the Chesapeake Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d838ef6-9dfb-528a-861c-2f14829b6e96,469,nyt://article/0d838ef6-9dfb-528a-861c-2f14829b6e96

the Bill to Complete,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/14/archives/a-project-worthy-of-favor.html,the Bill to Complete,"-- A bill is pending in the State Legislature for the completion of the Chenango Canal, which merits the support and effective action of that body. The Chenango Canal was originally constructed in large degree for the purpose of obtaining access to the coal regions of Pennsylvania. It extends from Utica to Binghamton, within about thirty miles of the State line, to which Pennsylvania some years since opened her North Branch Canal, for the express purpose of making a connection with it. It is not easy to understand why this connection has never been made. At the time when the canal policy of the State was so vehemently assailed by the party interests of the day, the work was discontinued, and has never since been resumed. But the reasons for carrying the canal thirty miles further, so as to effect a junction with the North Branch Canal of Pennsylvania, are quite as strong as were those which led to its construction; and they are quite as strong to-day as they ever were. The demand for access to the coal beds of Pennsylvania is constantly increasing, and new sources of traffic and wealth have been from time to time developed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A PROJECT WORTHY OF FAVOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A PROJECT WORTHY OF FAVOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/594cf560-6541-5f1b-8af5-5ef7a6fef7da,339,nyt://article/594cf560-6541-5f1b-8af5-5ef7a6fef7da

A Lesson from St. Domingo,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/14/archives/the-labors-of-maximilian.html,A Lesson from St. Domingo,"-- Those who are busy in fastening a foreign yoke upon the Mexicans might learn something from the condition of affairs in St. Domingo. That island, like Mexico, was an ancient Spanish colony; and, shortly after our war broke out, the Spaniards, under false pretexts, landed a force on the eastern end of the island, suppressed the Dominican Republic, and established their authority. Ever since then they have been in difficulty, and for the greater part of the time they have been steadily fighting with the Dominicans. By every arrival from Havana during the past year we have had news that additional battalions of royal troops were being sent to St. Domingo, the greater part of whom have been destroyed by disease and the bullets of the Republicans. By the news published this morning, we learn of very large numbers of troops having left Havana, and we are told that the Government at Madrid is ""determined to put down the insurrection at any cost."" We have no doubt that it has cost them more already than the revenues of the island will return in a century; and yet, when the Spaniards seized the country, we were told how enthusiastically they were received by the populace -- just as we are now told how joyously foreign authority is being welcomed by the Mexicans. If MAXIMILIAN should ever get himself enthroned in Mexico, we venture to say that, as with the foreigners in St. Domingo, he will have steady and bloody fighting with his subjects as long as he attempts to rule them. Peoples who have once tasted republican liberty find colonial bondage or imperial authority very irksome.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LABORS OF MAXIMILIAN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LABORS OF MAXIMILIAN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca72fd69-d9f5-5595-bdab-ef53d9e271a8,276,nyt://article/ca72fd69-d9f5-5595-bdab-ef53d9e271a8

The New Call,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/16/archives/the-new-call-for-two-hundred-thousand-soldiers-sand-soldiers.html,The New Call,"The President yesterday issued a call for two hundred thousand more troops, to be enforced by draft on the 15th of April, if not sooner filled by voluntary enlistments. This call is not entirely unexpected. It may not be generally known, but it is nevertheless strictly true, that under the last call for two hundred thousand additional men in February, the Government has actually received a far less number of men than it called for, though most of the States have filled their quotas. The reason is plain. It was announced that the last call was for the purpose of squaring up accounts, and thereupon an extensive system of research and figuring was begun in every State; all loose accounts of Provost-Marshals and State authorities were balanced up; old credits, not before allowed, were brought forward and allowed on the new quota; scattering men, who had enlisted and never been credited, were counted for the first time; enlistments in the naval service have been credited as recently allowed by law; the veteran enlistments, which came in largely, were credited, and aided many localities to escape the draft; every exertion, and many systems of figuring, some of which we fear were not as straightforward as they ought to have been, were used, until many of the States have announced that their quotas were full under all calls, with a surplus. We have in memory at present New-Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Kansas, and many parts of Michigan, New-York and Massachusetts, all of which have filled their quotas under all calls, and most of them have a surplus left, which is being constantly increased by veteran and volunteer enlistments not heretofore credited. The army has, notwithstanding, been largely and gratifyingly augmented, but not, by any means, to the extent of the last call. That call, as we have said, has been largely exhausted by the credits for old enlistments never before counted. Hence, this new call, though succeeding so rapidly to that of February, can and will be promptly met in most of the States, without any hardship whatever. Many localities have a surplus already to be credited on the new quota, while the necessities of the naval service, including the Marine Corps, offer a larger field than heretofore for the choice of the volunteer. Only in those localities which have been habitually behind in every quota, will the new call be considered as a hardship. This quota filled promptly and honestly, and the army will be so strengthened that we think all future calls can be dispensed with.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW CALL FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS.; SAND SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW CALL FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS.; SAND SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21163d69-38b1-5f48-907f-828556877043,432,nyt://article/21163d69-38b1-5f48-907f-828556877043

"-General Army Order No. 98, which we gave in our issue of yesterday, states that ""Major-Gen. HALLECK is, at his own request, relieved from duty as General-in-Chief of the army."" This request of the General may be misunderstood by the public without some explanation. The Act of Congress of April 4, 1862, authorizes the President to assign to commands officers of different rank, but not of different grade. Gen. HALLECK was assigned, under this act, to command as General-in-Chief, although there were other Major-Generals of prior date. Now, however, when the higher grade of Lieutenant-General has been created, Gen. HALLECK could not retain his command as General-in-Chief, because the act does not allow him to command an officer of higher grade, like Lieut.-Gen. GRANT. Gen. HALLECK was the first to point out this difficulty after the higher grade had been conferred on his friend, not, indeed, in the spirit of dissatisfaction, but as a matter of law. HALLECK rejoiced in GRANT's promotion, no one probably more than he did, and at the time that he showed the impossibility of his remaining General-in-Chief, expressed his willingness to serve in any other position which the Government might think proper to assign to him. He did not throw up his appointment in dudgeon. Had Gen. HALLECK lived in those times when popular wit or favor bestowed characteristic titles on public men, he might not inaptly have been called the ""Unambitious.""

The expedition reached Fort Pemberton and returned to Yazoo City, Where he disembarked his command and sent his boats to Vicksburgh loaded with cotton. While awaiting the return of his boats he was attacked in Yazoo City by two brigades of rebel cavalry. A very desperate fight ensued, lasting from ten o'clock in the morning until 4 P.M. on Saturday. At times the fight was hand to hand in the streets. The rebels were finally repulsed, and the boats returned on Tuesday. Col. COATES reembarked with his command and returned to Vicksburgh. Our loss was eighteen killed; that of the enemy much greater. An officer from Admiral PORTER's fleet gives the following particulars of the late expedition up Ouchita River. The expedition consisted of the gunboats Ouchita, Osage, Conestoga, Lexington, Hindman and Cricket. No signs of the enemy were seen until approaching Trinity, which was found strongly fortified. The iron-clad Osage, was in advance and allowed to pass without any demonstration on the part of the rebels. Flagship Hineman, tin-clad, followed, and the rebels supposing her a transport, opened a heavy and destructive fire on her, which she bore for sometime, but was compelled to retire with two men killed and eight wounded, the boat being badly used up. The Ouchita then came up and soon silenced the enemies guns, and drove the rebels from the town.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Expedition to Yazoo City.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Expedition to Yazoo City.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Memphis Bulletin, March 12', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'March', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6566f2ef-ed0b-5ab3-9504-0f73245078d2,355,nyt://article/6566f2ef-ed0b-5ab3-9504-0f73245078d2

He is an intelligent, worthy man and gallant soldier, and the presentation was in acknowledgment, not only of this, but of his faithfulness and efficiency as a patrolman. None better than the merchants of his precinct could appreciate his worth. The sword is a superb one, TIFFANY & CO. the makers, bearing on one side an engraving of the police on drill, on the other the presentation, and for its guard the police shield. The presentation took place at the Broadway Garden, above Springstreet, and PAUL FALK, the proprietor, had prepared for the wants of the assembled guests in the most excellent and the most liberal manner. The table was a model for those who provide for the thirsty and hungry. Inspector CARPENTER made the presentation speech; it was apt, very eloquent and earnest, eliciting the heartiest applause. Lieut.-Col. DOEBKE responded briefly, but with true soldierly warmth of feeling. His acknowledgment of the compliment proved him as worthy of it as did his heroic action in the field.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Presentation of a Sword.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Presentation of a Sword.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5588c35a-baa5-53cd-ae90-94ee51958b9c,532,nyt://article/5588c35a-baa5-53cd-ae90-94ee51958b9c

Why this holding back at the very start of the campaign, when so much depends upon the front displayed? All of Gen.

New-York Legislative Recklessness,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/19/archives/the-granting-of-franchises-to-corporations.html,New-York Legislative Recklessness,"There is a measure before the British House of Commons, just now, for the creation of a tribunal to hear and pass upon all applications for franchises, such as railroads which affect private or corporate rights, instead of leaving them, as now, to be disposed of by ""private bills,"" after a hearing before a committee. The reasons which call for the change there are the exceedingly unsatisfactory nature of the inquiries into the pros and cons of such applications, which are all that can be made by a parliamentary committee. The members are often not used to such investigations; the rules of evidence are not strictly adhered to in the examination of witnesses, and the sense of responsibility felt by each member of a body which changes every session, is of course very slight. The amount of jobbing which attends the passage of all railroad bills is, therefore, as might be expected, very great. If, however, applicants had to make out their cases before a court, composed as courts of justice are, and guided by the same rules, and acting under the same sense of responsibility, it is believed their public would be vastly better protected against injury than they now are, while to the applicants themselves the delay and expense would be greatly diminished.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Granting of Franchises to Corporations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Granting of Franchises to Corporations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49011354-0896-5064-8d1f-c0eeed0a413b,667,nyt://article/49011354-0896-5064-8d1f-c0eeed0a413b

On his way to Port Royal in this vessel he cut loose from the convoy and went right out to sea during a most terrible hurricane.

They have great Interest for American Ethrologists, on account of the remarkable coincidences that occur between the ancient remains of the earliest ages, whether discovered in the Old or New World. One is Prehistoric Annals of Scotland, by Dr. DANIEL WILSON, Professor of History in the University of Toronto. Dr. WILSON was the first to demonstrate from the ancient sepulchral mounds, the existence in the British Isles, of a peculiar race of people, remarkable for their broad or ""boat-shaped"" crania, and of presumed Tartar affinities, who preceded the Celts in their occupation of the country, His ""Prehistoric Annals"" is a perfect encyclopedia of all the known facts bearing on the history of the earliest peoples of Scotland, and is beautifully illustrated with drawings of their various relics. The other work alluded to, is published posthumously, the author, JOHN MITCHELL KEMBLE, the pupil of GRIMM, and the best northern scholar of England, having left it unfinished at his premature death. The title is Horoe Feralis, or Studies in the Archaeology of Northern Nations. It has been completed from the author's papers by Dr. LATHAM and Mr. FRANKS of the British Museum. It forms one volume quarto, and is richly illustrated with plates of bone, stone, bronze and iron implements, enameled horse-trappings, mortuary urns and remarkable sepulchral objects. In this connection it may be noted that the unique collection of primeval American antiquities, originally formed by Dr. DAVIS, from excavations in the mounds of Ohio, and since enriched by kindred articles from Peru, Mexico and Central America, is probably lost to this country. The New-York Historical Society had been for some time negotiating for its purchase, but a gentleman of Liverpool, of marked antiquarian tastes, is about securing it, with the intention of dividing the specimens between a museum he is founding in his native town and the British Museum.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22ce2d7a-b755-55b2-a798-ec45565170d1,1059,nyt://article/22ce2d7a-b755-55b2-a798-ec45565170d1

As these secession gentlemen gave us, of the Northern Democracy, Mr. LINCOLN against our will in 1860. I feel disposed to reciprocate, and give him to them against their willsin 1864, [Laughter and applause,] that they may have the full benefit of his administration, that they may have time to become pacified and reconciled. Those who will not be pacificied or reconciled to the Union upon any terms, out who are determined upon secession and disunion, will realize the propriety of their carrying out their favorite doctrine of disunion, by seceding to some foreign country. In conclusion, the speaker expressed himself in favor of a liberal and conciliatory course toward the friends of all the other candidates of the Union party. He intended to vote for the man that the great Union party should unite upon. There were other speeches made, some good singing, and the meeting adjourned.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7933ed6f-3650-5cba-957c-94bfc7e29a05,450,nyt://article/7933ed6f-3650-5cba-957c-94bfc7e29a05

Already numbers of them have ready and in their parlors a number of articles made and contributed by their lady friends, such as pin cushions, slippers, purses, embroideries, pieces of worsted works, &c., &c., while they have raised in money sums far exceeding their original ideas. Companies which at first were doubtful, but would try to raise $100, now point to their books and show $200 or $300 already subscribed, and many companies will contribute $800 or $1,000, in addition to the goods they will give to ornament their space, and which will, of course, bring in a good fair profit. The general office of the Department, at No. 744 Broadway, near Astorplace, which is under the charge of Assistant Engineer GEORGE ALKER, is doing finely; great numbers of articles, and some very fine and expensive ones, have been contributed by citizens who, though not members, are friends and admirers of the Department, and more are constantly coming in. The ladies, too -- who, until now, have never fairly known or appreciated the brave firemen -- are becoming better acquainted with them, and as their actual knowledge of the department, and the class of men of which it is generally composed, grows better, their interest in it increases, and they are as anxious that the ""Fire Department"" should be the most attractive ""department"" in the Fair as are the firemen themselves.

Upon his removal to New-York about 26 years ago, he was a manufacturer of soap and candles, and entered quite largely into that branch of business, accumulating the foundation for a handsome competence. From his earliest childhood, it may be said Mr. MERIAM exhibited a taste for scientific pursuits, and devoted his attention more particularly to meteorological researches. His records of the latter branch of his studies are intact, end extend even to the day of his death. He originated the idea, founded upon his own private observations, of cycles of atmospherical phenomena, which he advanced in public prints with considerable enthusiasm. He attained extended notoriety in this respect, not only in this country but in Europe, and received many evidences of the correctness of his theory from scientific men abroad. He attained considerable notoriety as a careful compiler of meteorological facts, and was frequently cited before the courts to decides disputed points.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of a Distinguished Citizen.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of a Distinguished Citizen.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f7717ce-6b38-557f-8bcf-be32711f735a,545,nyt://article/6f7717ce-6b38-557f-8bcf-be32711f735a

Ogden H., formerly of Brooklyn","-The remains of the late Sergt-Maj. OGDEN H. WHEELER, of the First Regiment Ohio Volunteers, were yesterday consigned to their last resting place in Greenwood Cemetery. The funeral ceremonies took place at Plymouth Church, and the pastor, Rev. H.W. BEECHER, officiated on the occasion. The deceased was formerly attached to Plymouth Sunday-school, and subsequently became a member of the church. He emigrated to Ohio before the war broke out, and when hostilities commenced he enlisted, and participating in several battles, was promoted to the position of Sergeant-Major for bravery and good conduct. He passed through all the engagements in which he participated without injury, but at the storming of Missionary Ridge he was struck by a bullet and instantly killed. His remains were brought on here for interment. The children of the Sunday-school were present, ranged on both sides of the gallery. They sang ""Shining Shore"" and other songs suitable to the occasion. Mr. BEECHER made a brief but very forcible address, in which he extolled the bravery of the deceased, and advised all young men of the Sunday-school, or of his congregation, who had any idea of joining the army, to do so, and not to forget that they were fighting for their country as well as for the freedom of the poor, the ignorant and the dark hued bondman. Many had gone to the war, and he had never yet had occasion to be ashamed of the boys of Plymouth Church.

The Secretary stated that the Society had greatly prospered during the past year, additional missionaries had been appointed in many of the States, and that these schools and missionaries were permanent. He also said the Union basis is the only basis on which any religious organization can be effected in hundreds of neighborhoods in our land; that this organization must be the Sunday School, for the church cannot be formed to suti the nature of the case; that the Sunday School Missionary service comprehends family visitation, Bible and religious book distribution and forming of the Sunday Schools. He also appealed for larger contributions, and stated that $2,500 had already been promised. Mr. STEPHEN PAXON, of Illinois, for fifteen years Missionary of the Society, addressed the audience, giving his own experience as an introduction. All his education was obtained in a Sunday School after he was thirty years of age. During his service he had organized nearly eleven hundred new schools, and gathered into them nearly 57,000 children. He gave a very interesting history of some of these schools, showing how they had finally developed into churches. His address was a most convincing and instructive one, and was listened to with great attention. Rev. A.A. WILLETS, of Brooklyn, followed in a very eloquent address, commending the Society for its good influence and perfect adaptation to meet the destitution of the land.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Anniversary Meeting in New-York for the American Sunday-School Union.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Anniversary Meeting in New-York for the American Sunday-School Union.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c68f50f7-1273-5b34-9c12-efcb55aacb18,378,nyt://article/c68f50f7-1273-5b34-9c12-efcb55aacb18

Though the latest reduced ""Con- federate"" State, it is yet the first of any to reconstitute itself on a Free State basis. It has been admirably prompt both in deciding and executing. Undoubtedly the chief cause of this superior promptitude over Louisiana and Tennessee is the fact that the slave population of the State has been at no time more than one third as large. On account of the comparative newness of the country, the large slaveholders were comparatively very few, and the great majority of the people had no slaves at all. It was only by the most villainous chicanery that the Secession Convention was elected which professed to take Arkansas out of the Union. Slavery did not supply the same stimulus in that State that it did in some of the others.

The sentence is as follows: ""Madisonville, a small town on Lake Pontchartrain, opposite New-Orleans, has been evacuated;"" and we judge it means that there is no intention now of advancing an army against Mobile, and opening its siege. We remarked the other day that we could not afford to waste a great army and navy in besieging Mobile, although undoubtedly it was a desirable point to seize at an opportune moment. There was an opportune moment a few weeks ago, and that was when Gen. SHERMAN rushed with his army from Vicksburgh to Meridian. There is little doubt now, as is proved by many things that have lately come to light, that Mobile was the point then really aimed at; but the heavy body of troops which had been moved to Madisonville to cooperate with SHERMAN in the assault, did not ""come to time,"" as was also the case with SMITH'S cavalry at the upper end of the State of Mississippi. Gen. SHERMAN'S march had been so extremely rapid to Meridian, that, on reaching that point, Gen. BANKS' column had not even set out for Pearl River; nor, unfortunately, would it have been ready to do so for some weeks subsequently. As a consequence of this SHERMAN could but retrace his steps, damaging the enemy as much as possible.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SIEGE OF MOBILE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SIEGE OF MOBILE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mobile', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/77c63bc2-7587-5861-802a-c15bcb700f98,329,nyt://article/77c63bc2-7587-5861-802a-c15bcb700f98

It was designed to be an argument and an exhortation to the people of North Carolina against the project of a convention which shall withdraw the State from the Confederacy, in order to obtain peace, which, it seems to be admitted, is now the main desire. Gov. VANCE based his appeal upon four or five considerations.

The hall was well filled with a very respectable and intelligent audience, among whom were numbers of the working women. Hon. CHARLES P. DALY presided. He said the members of the committee had submitted to him a constitution, which should attract the attention and admiration of all who were interested in the welfare and success of the 30,000 working women now employed in all branches of business in this great commercial City. They had more to struggle with than those of the so-called stronger sex, and the object of this society was to protect them from the frauds of designing men who would take from them a portion of their small earnings, or treat them in any way that was not right. He was astonished to hear that married women of comfortable means took employment to supply them with additional spending-money, and thought it necessary that they should leave the field for those who actually need it. And when they knew the great harm they were doing, he was satisfied they would do so. During the afternoon, MYNDERT VAN SCHAICK, Esq., had called on him and presented him with a check for $50 for the society. He hoped others would follow the good example.

As a first step in the prevention of this calamity, the last Congress appropriated six hundred thousand dollars to carry our freed negroes to the West Indies or to any other place, so that it was beyond the boundaries of this country. About a year ago, the first ship load of some four hundred, sailed from Fortress Monroe to Hayti, and, after a twelve months' trial of that locality, with its fervid climate, fertile soil and negro government, they arrived in this country again last Sunday morning, and landed a short distance from the spot at which they had embarked -- the expense of their voyage both ways having been borne by the Government.

"The Provost-Marshal-General yesterday issued an important statement, showing the exact account of each State, on the 1st of March, 1864, as regards the filling of the quotas under the several calls for troops. This statement is very conclusive. The credits to the States include everything but the veteran reenlistments, and the ""deficiency"" includes the number for which the States are yet in arrears to the Government on previous calls. From this statement it will be seen that Illinois is the only State whose quota under all calls is full -- and she has, it seems, twelve thousand surplus, not counting veteran enlistments at that. Several other States are nearly full, viz., Indiana, Kansas, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New-Hampshire; counting the veteran reenlistments, their quotas will all be full, and most of them will have a surplus for future demands.

"OLYMPIC THEATRE -- BUCKSTONE's comedy of ""Leap-Year"" was produced here last evening with very decided success. It is familiar to our theatregoers, and on some occasions has been rendered more judiciously and harmoniously than by the members of Mrs. WOOD's company. There were, however, exceptions to this remark. The fair manager is a host in herself, and cannot be surpassed or approached by any other artist on the Metropolitan stage. Her impersonation of the rollicking, good-natured, match-making Miss O'Leary, was hearty and spirited in the highest degree, and was the main element of the evening's success. Miss HENRIETTA IRVING supported Mrs. WOOD in several expensive dresses. Her delivery of the language of the part was not always accurate -- in an elocutionary point of view, seldom. There can be no reason for twisting up the end of each sentence into a vocal query where no question is at issue. The practice is one of the least admirable of MATILDA HERON's many affectations. In its way it is as bad as the extraordinary nasalities and high tragic-twang of Miss WALTERS -- an intelligent and painstaking young artist in other respects, but intolerable from this East-side and Museum vice. How enjoyable is the contrast afforded by Mrs. SEDLEY BROWN! This pleasant and pert interpreter of buxom chambermaids, although by no means blessed with a good speaking voice, contrives, by a quiet adherence to honest nature, to give more significance to her lines than the most vociferous of her companions.

He makes much of the desire of his audience either to return to the Union or remain neutral. He admits that they are in a bad scrape, but asks them jeeringly how they propose to get out of it. He assures them that the provision of the Confederate Constitution permitting secession, on which some of them propose to rely, is a delusion and a snare; that the Confederate Government would certainly permit their withdrawal, but only in order that their assumption of the character of a foreign Power might authorize their being attacked and cut to pieces. He tells them that come what will there can be no peace for them until the whole Confederacy is either victorious or vanquished, and that their complaints, either of the war or of the rebel Government, are but as the idle wind; that willing or not willing, their blood and money must be forthcoming as long as JEFFERSON DAVIS is pleased to call for them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The South and its Ruling Class.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The South and its Ruling Class.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1fe9c96-eb92-5510-8dd7-1d2a2c2e740d,909,nyt://article/e1fe9c96-eb92-5510-8dd7-1d2a2c2e740d

Such a measure would remedy a great defect in our national system of legislation. There is no good reason why our Congress should be the only representative body of any nation that is deprived of personal communication with those to whom is intrusted the administration of the affairs upon which the body legislates. This system, which is peculiar to ourselves, sprang from a jealousy of the Executive power. It was fancied that the personal participation of the cabinet officers in the debates of Congress would give the President undue influence. We do not believe that any such effect would follow. The assumption implies that the representatives of the people either have not understanding, to save them from being cajoled, or have not firmness to save them from being intimidated. If it is indeed true that our representatives must be fools or cravens, who have to be specially guarded, lest they be deceived or daunted, the sooner we give up the representative system altogether, and take an autocrat for a ruler, the better.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/25/archives/emigrant-passengers-robbing-the-dead.html,,"Subsequent to the arrival of the steamship City of Baltimore, from Liverpool, on last Saturday, the 19th inst., JOHN HARVEY, a third-class passenger, who had been ill during the voyage, died just previous to the landing of the passengers at Castle Garden. The Purser of the vessel, as is the practice on the line, on being notified of the death, took possession of the effects, amounting to a silver watch and gold chain, and a purse containing a half-crown. While the passengers were being transferred in a tug to the Emigrant Depot, the officer from Castle Garden was informed by two passengers, JOHN FORTMUN and WM. CARNE, that they had heard HARVEY say, a few days previous to arrival, that he had enough to support him for a year, in case he did not recover his health, and they believed he had money, although they never saw any, and that their suspicions were directedagainst four passengers, THOMAS TREZONA, GEORGE TERMUNE and EDWARD THOMAS and son, who berthed with deceased. The officer, in performance of his duty, brought all the parties before the General Agent, who in reply to inquiries as to the money, could learn nothing, the four stoutly denying any knowledge of it. On being requested to produce what money they had in their possession, TREZONA took out of his pocket 14 1/2 sovereigns, and TERMUNE 17 1/2 sovereigns, each claiming the money as his own, and denying having any more. By examining the parties separately, and finding the parties contradicting each other, it was brought out that TERMUNE and TREZONA had, previous to leaving Liverpool, borrowed from HARVEY 12s., and that they had also borrowed, while there, from THOMAS, a half sovereign, going to prove that these parties could not have had any money before sailing. The General Agent pushed the inquiries further, being satisfied there was more money, and finally induced TERMUNE to give up a bag containing 62 sovereigns, which he admitted belonged to HARVEY. The whole 92 sovereigns were retained and handed over to the Public Administrator, where TREZONA and TERMUNE were advised to go and prove the ownership of the respective amounts claimed by them. TERMUNE, however, did not deem it advisable to push any claim, but left the City early next morning, and TREZONA has since gone also.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Emigrant Passengers Robbing the Dead.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Emigrant Passengers Robbing the Dead.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d92b10e-805c-57be-9abd-f4c84e131272,412,nyt://article/3d92b10e-805c-57be-9abd-f4c84e131272

"AN ENGINE COMPANY DISBANDED. -- The Board of Commissioners of the New-York Fire Department held a special meeting at Firemen's Hall on Tuesday evening last, for the purpose of investigating the charges made by Hose Company No. 19 against Engine Company No. 47. The complaint was that on several occasions Engine Company No. 47 ran Hose Company No. 19 into the sidewalk, thereby breaking up their rope and endangering the lives and limbs of those who were on it. The case was a very important one, and was very thoroughly investigated. Ex-Judge PHILLIPS appeared on behalf of Engine Company No. 47. The board examined over 60 witnesses, and did not adjourn until 2 o'clock in the morning. It is said that after the trial was over the members of Engine Company No. 47 attacked the members of Hose Company No. 19, and that some of them were beaten very badly. On Wednesday the board held a special meeting and announced their decision which is as follows: ""Ordered, That Engine Company No. 47 be disbanded, and that MICHAEL DWYER, Assistant Foreman, be expelled from the Department."" The Board of Commissioners have acted very promptly in this matter, and deserve the thanks of the public as well as of the department.

It was too much trouble to attend primary meetings or to canvass a ward, or to follow up some great public ""job"" in all its intricacies. Most men in business supposed they had not the time for such matters. They would rather lose two per cent. of their incomes yb the peculations and follies of the City authorities than thus exhaust their energy and leisure. Besides, any attempt at reform always seemed Quixotic and useless. The persons who were thus plundering and trampling on the public, had been skilled for years in all the tricks of their trade; they had organization and a great constituency behind them. It was extremely difficult to convict them: still more to displace them. The Reformers never had a permanent organization, or means, or a well-established constituency. There was no regular party in each ward whose object it was truly to reform the City Government. There were no persons who could be constantly employed in tracing out and exposing public jobberies and abuses.

Taking his stand on the platform of the Washington monument, he welcomed the soldiers to their native land. He had often heard of the severe trials to which they had been subjected in their captivity, and his heart had yearned for the brave ""boys"" who had proved true under every trial, and had resisted every offer made to them to desert the fortunes of their country. Though they had passed through so many bitter trials, there were, perhaps, many yet in store for them, but he knew that they would not shrink from them -- that they would all assist in achieving the independence of the country, and in driving away the hated foe now polluting our soil. [Cheers.] After a brief respite, said the President, you will be again called to the battlefield. ""I know you will come.""

The Monitor Wolf-Krabe,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/26/archives/american-ideas.html,The Monitor Wolf-Krabe,"Two of our ""Yankee notions"" have already been tried in the present war of Denmark with the allies. We allude to the monitor ship and the use of artificial light for siege operations by night. It was calcium light that was used by Gen. GILLMORE for illuminating the harbor of Charleston, so that he could carry on artillery operations and watch the enemy's movements at night; and the Danes, in their defence at Sonderborg, experimented with electric light to watch the enemy's night movements, and to enable the artillery of the forts to fire when it was dark. The low iron-clad used by the Danes had also points of variation from ours. The Rolfe Krake, which suffered considerable damage in an attack on the Prussian pontoon bridge, at their position at Egersund, is described as a powerful iron-clad, with two turrets or cupolas, armed each of them with two 64-pounders. She is 120 feet in length by 34 feet broad, is of 250 horse-power, and can run nine knots an hour in smooth water; but her officers think that the attempt to combine sailing power with the efficiency of a monitor, has been crowned with but indifferent success.

Report of Last Winter's Operations,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/26/archives/gen-sherman-right-on-the-record-gen.html,Report of Last Winter's Operations,"W.T. SHERMAN'S late report of his operations oflast Winter furnishes a satisfactory explanation of a portion of his conduct, that was at the time and has continued to be made the subject of considerable censure. We refer to his failure to pursue LONGSTREET, after that General had given up the siege of Knoxville in December last. The object of Gen. SHERMAN's march to Knoxville was to relieve Gen. BURNSIDE, whose position was invested by the rebels, and who, on account of the shortness of supplies, found himself in an extremely critical situation. The day before the arrival of Gen. SHERMAN's column, and doubtless in consequence of having received intelligence of its approach, LONGSTREET withdrew from BURNSIDE's front. In this state of facts Gen. BURNSIDE himself judged best that Gen. SHERMAN, instead of attempting to follow up LONGSTREET, should countermarch to Chattanooga, where, on account of the great diminution of force, Gen. THOMAS' position was not accounted entirely secure. Gen. BURNSIDE simply requested of Gen. SHERMAN that he would leave with him the two divisions under command of Gen. GORDON GRANGER, and this was freely done. Gen. BURNSIDE's opinion is expressed in the following terms:",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN. SHERMAN RIGHT ON THE RECORD.

"-- The approaching Spring New-York Trade Sale of Books, Stereotype Plates, Stationery, &c. commences on March 29, and is an event of general interest to the book trade. Though some firms are, in principle, opposed to the system of these sales, on the ground that it destroys uniformity in prices, &c., the convenience of them is so great, both to buyers and sellers, that there is little doubt they are as firmly rooted as any other part of the trade machinery, whereby the circulation of books through this vast country is effected. Mr. COOLEY'S present catalogue indeed marks the adhesion to the plan of the eminent firm of Messrs. HARPERS. whose names, after five or six years absence, again figure in its pages. This catalogue forms a portly volume of nearly four hundred pages, and embraces probably two hundred thousand dollars' worth of books, all of which will be deposed of by the hammer of the presiding auctioneer. Some well-known and formerly constant buyers at these sales have disappeared since the commencement of the Southern troubles, but the loss has been more than made up by the growing demands of the great West, including California and Canada, which latter county is now generally represented by many considerable purchasers, and in a business point of view is fairly ""annexed"" and tributary to the Empire City of New-York. Some large lots of stereotype plates, including the stock of two Philadelphia houses (WILLIS P. HAZARD and LINDSAY & BLACKISTON,) who are making changes in their business, are in the present catalogue, and come more purely under the head of speculative property than books -- the current value of which is generally understood to within a small fraction by both buyer and seller.

Say","The pressure on our space of other matter has prevented us from recurring to the serious and important topic of ""Miscegenation."" We regret very much, however, having allowed our attention to be even temporarily diverted from it, as we find from the earnest discussion which it is receiving at the hands of our cotemporaries, that it has lost none of its importance. In fact, if we are to believe what we hear, especially from the recognized and authoritative organs of the Democratic party, the rage for marrying black people, which has taken possession of the Republican party, is rather on the increase. It is said, we know not with what truth, that the Union League Club has fitted up a night-bell at its door in Union-square, and keeps a black minister on the premises, who marries all couples of different colors at any hour of the day or night. An effort is said to have been made by the leaders of the party to stave off these alliances until after the meeting of the Convention next July, when the campaign would have fairly commenced; but it was all in vain. The radicals have carried everything before them, and, if things go on at their present rate, it is feared that in three months every white man who is not connected by marriage with a colored family, will be ""read out"" of the party. The gusto with which the young people go into this insane movement is something at once disgusting and alarming. Two duels are said to have been already fought about one middle-aged black washerwomen, the rivals being young men of the best society; and those families whose colored servants have remained with them up to the present, have been compelled to give them notice, owing to the crowds of wealthy but degraded white men who throng the basement for the purpose of soliciting the honor (!) of their hands. We shrink from putting on paper the stories which reach us as to the prevalence amongst young white ladies of a preference for colored men -- pure blacks having the precedence in all cases where there is room for choice. We will only say that there will very soon be hardly a family in the City belonging to the Republican persuasion, which will not be glorying in the possession of a negro son-in-law; and what is most horrible about the matter is, that a fund has been raised by members of the Loyal League for the transportation from the South, of colored beaux and belles, with the truly fiendish design of guarding against the possibility of an exhaustion of the supply in this quarter.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Are We Coming To, and When Shall We Reach It?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Are We Coming To, and When Shall We Reach It?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e015a030-390e-508c-885d-287bc9f427f9,1219,nyt://article/e015a030-390e-508c-885d-287bc9f427f9

SANTA ANA, who only last month returned to Mexico and gave in his adhesion to the French invervention, has been already expelled by Gen. BAZAINE and is now at Havana. The cause of this action on the part of the French authorities was a manifesto which Gen. SANTA ANA had issued to his countrymen explaining why he had accepted without restrictions the new order of affairs. The correspondence between SANTA ANA and BAZAINE shows that the order of exile was entirely unlooked for by the Mexican General. A report from New-Orleans says that the French are on the eve of attacking Matamoras and have nine vessels of war at the mouth of the Rio Grande. A letter was published in the New-Orleans Era from a Mexican source, which puts a brighter aspect on the Liberal cause than we have been able to look upon from the French standpoint. It says that Guadalajara has been captured by the Mexicans, under URAGA, with 24 cannon and 700 prisoners. The traitor MEJIA was at San Luis de Potosi with 3,000 troops, expecting to be attacked. It is also said that Puebla is besieged by the Mexicans and must fall, as the invaders have no reinforcements that can reach there in time to aid the garrison. VIDAURRI is positively said to have declared for the French, and CORTINAS and DOBLABO, with strong forces, are marching to attack him, the former from Matamoras and the latter from Saltillo. CORTINAS is very popular in Tamaulipas. Before leaving he consecrated his battle-flag.

"""A short time since, several ladies connected with the New-York Sanitary Fair called upon Mrs. AUGUSTUS BELMONT, and requested her to hold a concert for the benefit of the Fair, among her friends. She took it under advisement and consented to do so, and made arrangements accordingly. She found her house would accommodate about three hundred guests.

Mr. KINGLAKE, in his singular chronicle of England's last great war, has shown conclusively how much her slow and conservative population are moved to important measures by mere feeling and passion. It is commonly supposed that Democracies alone are plunged into dangerous wars through sympathy and martial instinct. But the impartial and careful records of the Crimean struggle, show that no riotous and impulsive mob ever were urged on to a dangerous crisis more by mere feeling, without regard to interests or wisdom, than were the English nation at that momentous emergency. England, it is true, can sift down her popular passions through the medium of a governing aristocracy; but even they are deeply affected by a prejudice extending through the middle classes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mutterings of War in Europe.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mutterings of War in Europe.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/088fa7a7-2c34-5b48-87cf-20c908bc7439,796,nyt://article/088fa7a7-2c34-5b48-87cf-20c908bc7439

"Roebuck, J. A., M. P.; Abuse of U. S.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/28/archives/an-infuriated-mp.html,"Roebuck, J. A., M. P.; Abuse of U. S.","The discussions on American affairs in the British Parliament, during its present sitting, have been mostly dull and stupid; but we have by yesterday's steamer the report of a debate that took place in the House of Commons a fortnight ago to-day, which must have been as entertaining there as it will be here. Mr. ROEBUCK assailed the Ministry, or at least one member of it, and this country, or at least the Union part of it, with a ferocity worthy of his reputation. It was Earl RUSSELL and his foreign policy that he attacked declaring that the tone used at first by the Foreign Secretary was like the ""scream of a cockatoo,"" but that subsequently he ""crouched before the menace"" of the American Minister. He turned in absolute disgust from the ""hypocrisy of the Northern States of America,"" finding them ""corrupt, base, cowardly and cruel,"" and so forth -- some of which epithets the Southern rebels have now learned too much to be so foolish as to employ. Lord PALMERSTON replied to the assault on his colleague, and defended the foreign policy of the Government. He would not accept of a compliment to himself at the expense of Earl RUSSELL, and declared that he was equally responsible with his colleague for every step taken in the conduct of every diplomatic negotiation. He declared that Her Majesty's Ministers had proclaimed the neutrality of Great Britain, and that they had kept their word and acted on their declaration; and gave his opinion that this neutrality had been of far greater advantage to the North than to the South. Mr. KINGLAKE then arose, and, in referring to the language applied to the United States by the ""honorable and learned gentleman,"" (Mr. ROEBUCK,) ""wished to state that, in his opinion, the charges of the honorable and learned gentleman did not represent the opinion of this House, or of any party or fraction of a party in this House, but simply represented that for which the honorable and learned gentleman had, no doubt, a great respect -- namely, the opinion of the honorable and learned gentleman. If the people of America were rendered indignant by language like this, it would be easy to explain to them by what manner of man it had been used. The honorable and learned gentleman was not consulted, so far as he knew, by any party, any fraction of a party, or any group of men. The American people,"" continued Mr. KINGLAKE, ""should also be reminded that the same speaker who used this language of them applied the language which the House had just heard to Lord RUSSELL, declaring that his utterances were like the screamings of a cockatoo and the anger of a scolding woman. It was to be hoped,"" repeated Mr. KINGLAKE, ""that the Americans would be as indifferent to the language used by the honorable gentleman as he was sure Lord RUSSELL would be when he heard that be had been vilipended by the honorable and learned gentleman."" We can assure the cool-headed Crimean historian that the people of the United States will not get at all excited nor enraged at the language of the ""honorable and learned"" ROEBUCK, but will remain even more indifferent than Lord RUSSELL to such assaults. And much as the character of the American Congress is abused abroad, we do not think there is a member of it who would apply to Mr. ROEBUCK or his country such language in such a spirit as he uses in Parliament upon us.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Infuriated M.P.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Infuriated M.P.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/151e4711-caa9-5f37-85d7-0fd1edc3fcfc,589,nyt://article/151e4711-caa9-5f37-85d7-0fd1edc3fcfc

Ministerial Crisis in,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/28/archives/a-crisis-in-canada.html,Ministerial Crisis in,"The politicians of the adjacent British Provinces are enjoying the periodical relaxation of a crisis in their party arrangements. Two years ago the Parliament of the Colony outvoted the Conservative or Tory party, and there was formed in place of the outgoing Ministry, a Government supposed first of all to represent a liberal policy, and next, to put down its foot upon further advances to the Grand Trunk Railway. The incomers had an easy time of it, during a lengthened parliamentary recess. But they exhibited feebleness of purpose, and incapacity for work when the local Legislature reassembled. The consequence was a premature break-down. To mend matters temporarily, the party leader, Mr. SANDFIELD MACDONALD, retained his own portfolio by consent of the Governor-General, after discarding the unpopular element (so-called) from the Cabinet, and a repaltrage was made up by the introduction of new members of more extreme opinions. The Premier hereupon appealed to the constituencies for their indorsation of his arrangements. A general election resulted in the return of an almost equal number of Ministerialists and Opposition members, and the present parliamentary session, now some six weeks gone, has developed from the opening day, the ministerial disorder which reached a crisis a week ago, when the Premier succumbed to the adverse opinion of the Legislature, threw up his seat, and by constitutional rule, involved his colleagues in the general collapse.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Crisis in Canada.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Crisis in Canada.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c4f4f42-d6ab-57c9-b381-61b900b63865,970,nyt://article/1c4f4f42-d6ab-57c9-b381-61b900b63865

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/30/archives/from-europe.html,,"The steamship City of Manchester, with one day's later news from Europe, arrived at this port yesterday. The Alexandra case was resumed in the House of Lords on the 14th of March, the part of the defendants being argued by Sir HUGH CAIRNS, who contended that the Court of Error was right in refusing to hear the appeal from the Court of Exchequer. The Attorney-General replied in behalf of the Crown, and it was expected that on the 17th inst. the Lord Chancellor would announce when judgment would be delivered. In commenting upon the case, the London Times says that there is a possibility that the House of Lords may decline jurisdiction. Such a disgraceful result would be owing to the slovenly way in which acts of Parliament are drawn and modified in Committee. Six seamen were brought up at the Cork Assizes on the 14th, indicted for an infraction of the Foreign Enlistment Act, in agreeing to enter the United States service as sailors on board the Kearsage. The prisoners pleaded guilty, and were released on promising to appear for judgment when called upon. The bodies of the victims of the Sheffield disaster, to the number of 178, had been recovered, leaving 80 yet missing. Another shocking casualty had occurred from the breaking of a pump at Spittlewell Pits, by which fourteen men were drowned. The Conservatives in the British Parliament had determined upon a strenuous effort to overthrow the Ministry after Easter. Mr. ROEBUCK's diatribe against the North had been editorially denounced by the London Times. There had been a further exchange of shots between the Danes and allied German forces, with unimportant results. The Prussians had occupied the Island of Femein, capturing the garrison of 100 Danes. It is said to be authentically asserted that Denmark is indisposed to accept the armistice and conference propositions in their essential points. A Paris rumor says that Austria and Prussia eventually intend to occupy Copenhagen and dictate terms of peace from that city. The King of Sweden had indicated his intention to assist Denmark in certain emergencies, and had asked for an extraordinary loan. In Rome conflicts between the Papal and French troops continued, the populace siding with the former. The rumor of a revival of the Holy Alliance was refuted by the Journal de St. Petersburg.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3bd81467-b844-5e2a-a327-886934772662,387,nyt://article/3bd81467-b844-5e2a-a327-886934772662

Of course these doings, of whatever character, will be of very little practical consequence, for there can be no consequence without power, or at least a possibility of power. No State in this Union is more immovably loyal, and more inflexibly faithful to the war against the rebellion, than the great State of Ohio. Yet, though it was of no public moment what these Copperheads might do, it was a matter of curious speculation what they would do. How would they treat VALLANDIGHAM, ""the martyr?"" Last year they made common cause with him -- held him out as the immolated embodiment of all the sanctities of the Constitution -- and, with absolute confidence, proclaimed their purpose to avenge him with a sweeping extinction of both LINCOLN and the war. The people settled the matter, when the time of trial came, by striking them to the dust, and piling over them a majority never before heard of -- one hundred thousand clean. It has been a question what would be the effect of this popular visitation. Would it impel these fomenters of faction to desert their great martyred apostle, or not? It all depended upon the quality of their own martyr spirit. If it were genuine, of course they would adhere to his name and faith with a fidelity only made the stauncher by tribulation. If it were spurious, why then there would be faltering and shuffling, and probably an abandonment outright.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ohio Copperhead State Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ohio Copperhead State Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Ohio', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/635d3ae6-093e-55a2-ab12-e1729037bb94,934,nyt://article/635d3ae6-093e-55a2-ab12-e1729037bb94

There will be stories of petty persecutions, of brutal indignities practiced on persons helpless and weak, of cruelties, of hopes deferred month by month, of weariness and sickness, and the lonely death of gallant men, which will make, in the future, that Richmond prison, or the place where it had been, one of the most painful places in the American memory.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Richmond Prisons How Prisoners are Treated on Both Sides.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Richmond Prisons How Prisoners are Treated on Both Sides.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31ce5158-37b7-5580-b1fa-52d629b2cfd0,795,nyt://article/31ce5158-37b7-5580-b1fa-52d629b2cfd0

BELL WHEELOCK, wholesale shoe dealers at No. 69 Worth-street, went to Capt. JOURDAN, of the Sixth Precinct, to whom he stated that for several months past large quantities of their goods had disappeared, in some mysterious manner, from time to time. The gentleman had suspicions that a porter in their employ, named JOHN FARLOW, was in some way connected with the theft, and he therefore desired that Capt. JOURDAN and his men, who have recently been quite successful in similar cases, should take charge of the matter, and, if possible, secure the guilty parties and recover the goods. Capt. JOURDAN and Officer GOLDEN accordingly set to work, and, for two or three nights and mornings they watched the premises very closely. They knew that the porter, FARLOW, not only carried the keys of the store, but he also had charge of the keys to the safe. Suspicion, therefore, rested more strongly on him than upon any other employe of the firm. Moreover, he had, upon several occasions, been seen to leave the premises, after closing the store at night, with packages under his arm. On Tuesday evening last, he closed the store as usual, and started across Broadway with a bulky parcel. Officer GOLDEN, who was watching on the opposite side of the street, followed FARLOW several blocks, until he became satisfied that he had the right man, when he took him into custody. The prisoner and parcel were taken to the station-house. On making an examination of the bundle there, twenty-eight pairs of ladies' shoes, valued at $75, were found therein. FARLOW was questioned by Capt. JOURDAN as to how he had come by them, and the prisoner stated that he had received express permission from the firm to take them away; also that he had never stolen an article from the store. In order to satisfy himself as to the right of the prisoner to take the shoes from the store, Capt. J. sent for one of the firm, when it was ascertained, beyond all question, that FARLOW's design was to steal the goods. He was locked in the station-house during the night, and the next morning he was willing to disclose something of his proceedings. He said that about three times each week, since June last, he had stolen goods from his employers, the great portion of which he had sold to one CONRAD UNDERMACH, a boot and shoe dealer at No. 115 Bowery. A search-warrant was then obtained, and several cases and boxes of ladies' and childrens' shoes and gaiters, all belonging to Messrs. BELL & WHEELOCK were found in the store of UNDERMACH. The value of the goods thus recovered is over $1,200. UNDERMACH stated to the officers that he had purchased them all from FARLOW. He was consequently arrested as a receiver of stolen property.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Way Merchants are Robbed.; ANOTHER PORTER IN CUSTODY FOR THEFT OVER $2,000 WORTH OF THE STOLEN GOODS RECOVERED ARREST OF SEVERAL RECEIVERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Way Merchants are Robbed.; ANOTHER PORTER IN CUSTODY FOR THEFT OVER $2,000 WORTH OF THE STOLEN GOODS RECOVERED ARREST OF SEVERAL RECEIVERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6ef820bb-f283-5aec-b3fb-081282f59c8c,690,nyt://article/6ef820bb-f283-5aec-b3fb-081282f59c8c

He found the intelligent people everywhere candid in expression of sympathy with the Confederates, and of admiration for the dignity and statesmanship of our rulers, and the valor, endurance and fortitude of our soldiers und people, but there were considerations of a political character operating to deter official recognition or intervention by the Governments of Europe.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SENTIMENT OF EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SENTIMENT OF EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Petersburgh Express', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4d1adc0-affc-5552-8e3e-b4d3ee10a79d,220,nyt://article/a4d1adc0-affc-5552-8e3e-b4d3ee10a79d

"Information had been received by the military authorities at Lake City, Fla., on Sunday evening last, that the Yankees had landed a force at Palatka. The force landed at that point is not known, but it was rumored that it was large. Gen. FINNEGAN had dispatched forces to meet them, consisting of cavalry, infantry and artillery. Our pickets in front of Jacksonville confirm previous intelligence that the greatest portion of the enemy's troops had left that place.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. MARETZEK, if not always fortunate in the matter of weather, is at all events happy in the number of lieges who turn out in his honor when the elements are against him. Considering the almost impassible state of the streets, the attendance last night was quite flattering. We are glad to add that the performance was worthy of the sacrifice made to hear it. We have seldom heard the opera (""Martha"") given with more spirit. Miss KELLOGG was in admirable voice, and acted the role of Lady Henrietta with charming ease, grace and spirit. It is and always must remain one of her best efforts. Sig. BRIGNOLI made his rentree as Lionel, and was, of course, the centre of attraction. It was this gentleman's misfortune to sing last season under adverse circumstances of health, that were painful to himself, and the cause of apprehension to his friends. It was rather harshly suggested that he had lost his voice, and a few, who had never, perhaps, enjoyed it, rejoiced at an accident that had apparently deprived the public of a favorite artist. These grumblers were happily silenced last evening. Sigor BRIGNOLI was in capital voice, and sang throughout with unabated. power and sweetness. We hardly remember to have ever heard him to greater advantage. The romansa in the third act was superbly delivered, and more than merited the rapturous encore which Signor BRIGNOLI so reluctantly accepted.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/03/31/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. MARETZEK, if not always fortunate in the matter of weather, is at all events happy in the number of lieges who turn out in his honor when the elements are against him.
