Enfans de Troupe of the French Army,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/01/archives/foreign-items.html,Enfans de Troupe of the French Army,"-- The Belgian journals publish the following curious story: A widow lady, named TILMANNE, recently died at Charleroi, and the family of the deceased were three days back assembled at her residence for the purpose of hearing the will read. The Juge de Paix and a notary had arrived, when suddenly the Canon Raoul, cure of the town, who had not been invited, suddenly entered the room. ""You are no doubt surprised to see me here, gentlemen,"" he said. ""We are,"" replied several voices. ""Well, reassure yourselves; I have not come to put forward any claim, but simply to make restitution."" He then handed to the Juge de Paix a small packet carefully tied up, which, on being opened, was found to contain gold and bank-notes to the amount of 210,000 francs. ""This has been intrusted, to me,"" pursued the cure. ""In consequence of an avowal made at the confessional. I do not know the amount, nor do I wish for a receipt."" The respected ecclesiastic saluted the company and withdrew.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/00e2c5cc-3802-5f8f-8a3f-4c4b3b7cf1ff,3131,nyt://article/00e2c5cc-3802-5f8f-8a3f-4c4b3b7cf1ff

Cars and Goods Delivery,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/01/archives/the-city-cars-and-general-goods-delivery.html,Cars and Goods Delivery,"-- It is doubtless due to an excessive amiability that the more wealthy City Railway Corporations have been in the habit of extending to a class of tradespeople and housekeepers the privilege of stowing away, under and around the seats in the cars, any conceivable amount of outward or homeward bound stuffs. The privilege is probably just in principle, as well as amiable in intent: but is it not possible that with the dog-days all but in sight, and the rushing stream of City travel day by day swelling in volume, the green grocery and general carrying system in combination with the passenger traffic, may be carried to excess? Immediate contact with a huge pile of superannuated Hebrew clothing stock is not desirable at any time: it is most undesirable in overheated and overcrowded cars. The same may be said of packages of partially dried codfish; of suspicious joints of half-cured pork, and of those promiscuous packages which, in the hands of that sad female ""help,"" lately from the other side of the water, are continually dropping loose in fragmentary bits, to the grief of their possessor, and the discomfort of her fellow-travelers. Nor are the stoppages occasioned by the transfer of the goods, in and out, always so convenient to those with whom time is an element to be taken into account. One may overlook the delays caused by accommodating some overburdened waif, whose very look tells you that he can afford no more than a picayune for the transportation of himself and his entire real and personal estate from one end of the island to the other. But is it possible to be equally complaisant towards that stalwart tailor from the suburbs, who is foisted into the car, actually staggering under a load of military uniforms -- sufficient perhaps to clothe half a company -- and all to be liberally paid for on the instant of delivery?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CITY CARS AND GENERAL GOODS DELIVERY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CITY CARS AND GENERAL GOODS DELIVERY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/140e2b6f-ffbb-5991-9a58-b1a3d6324dd9,374,nyt://article/140e2b6f-ffbb-5991-9a58-b1a3d6324dd9

It was a fight between one of his iron-clad vessels and a large body of rebels -- the latter a part of the force which had just gained success over Gen. BANKS. He tells how, flushed with victory, or under the excitement of liquor, they appeared suddenly upon the right bank, and fearlessly opened fire on the Osage, (iron-clad,) she being hard aground at the time, with 2,000 muskets, while the Osage quickly returned a destructive fire upon ""these poor deluded wretches,"" as Admiral PORTER properly calls them. In desperation they strove to capture the gunboat; and force after force seemed to be brought up to the edge of the bank, where they confronted the guns of the iron vessel only to be mowed down by grapeshot and canister. We are told that this drunken and maddened mass of men were led on by their officers, and that their hootings and actions baffled description. In the meantime another gunboat, the Lexington, came up to take part in the fight, and opened a cross fire upon the rebels, which finally decided this curious affair of a fight between infantry and gunboats. The rebels were now mowed down by canister, and finally retreated in as quick haste as they had come to the attack, leaving the space of a mile covered with dead and wounded, and knapsacks. The affair lasted nearly two hours before the rebels fled.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INFANTRY VS. GUNBOATS.

Both France and Europe knew only too well the deplorable state, as far as concerns both her material and moral interests, into which that unfortunate country had fallen, in consequence of the ephemeral and spoliating Governments, scarcely recognized at home and despised abroad. What is less known is that Mexico, already despoiled of half her territory, was the sure and speedy conquest of the United States. The word conquest, however, is too noble; for Mexico was put up to the highest bidder. If the disgraceful contract had been realized, the consequences of it would have seen incalculable, the Latin races would have received a check from which they would with difficulty have recovered. The principles of civilization, which constitute our moral influence in the world, would have been deeply interfered with; that is the idea which the Emperor NAPOLEON III, expressed with extraordinary energy in his letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the French expedition. Mexico, by the re-establishment of the Monarchy, returns into her traditional path, and again finds the true conditions of order and of prosperity, without sacrificing anything of her independence. What a noble mission for the young Prince who accepts it so boldly, and comprehends it so well. France will thus have once more merited well from civilization. Once more short sighted, politicians will have been in the wrong and thanks to the great prudence which presides over our destinies, and to that perseverance which triumphs over obstacles and marches forward to its object with admirable calmness, this regeneration of Mexico which is being prepared will be one of the noblest pages of our civilizing mission in the world.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SPIRIT OF THE FRENCH PRESS.; MEXICO RESCUED FROM THE UNITED STATES.

"London Times, >amp;c., on",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/01/archives/the-mexican-question.html,"London Times, >amp;c., on","-- In another column we give copious extracts from our files of English journals, together with translations of notable passages from our French files, to illustrate the popular feeling abroad regarding the progress of events in Mexico. The supercilious, insulting tone in which reference is made to the disability of our Government to interfere at present with the erection of a monarchy upon the ruins of the Mexican Republic might, and perhaps would, excite our indignation, were it not for the ludicrous perplexity in which both the English and French journalists appear to be regarding what has actually been accomplished by NAPOLEON, and the fears which seem to haunt them unless the would-be Emperor may not after all find his path to the Mexican capital strewn with roses. The London Times, for instance, speaks of the historical significance of the fact that a republic has been superseded by a monarchy in America, and in the next breath congratulates the world that NAPOLEON has instituted a Government where anarchy -- no government at all -- existed. La France announce that the French troops will be withdrawn from the scene of their conquests immediately upon the arrival of the Emperor MAXIMILIAN, and by a curious coincidence its prophecy seems to be anticipated simultaneously with its utterance, for we have a rumor that the French have already left the City of Mexico.

Without their industry she could not pay the interest of her enormous debt, could not meet the current expenses of her Government, could not maintain her present proud position among the nations. Without the support of their strong arms, her resources, her power, her prestige, would vanish as the morning mist. Yet, how are those indefatigable toilers requited for the services they render? Why, by denying them the rights of citizens and of human nature, and by manifesting, on every possible occasion, her distrust of them. Here is a case illustrative of England's mode of dealing with her moiling millions. An intelligent body of the London operatives, having resolved to celebrate SHAKESPEARE's tercentenary by marching in procession to Green Park, and there planting a young oak in honor of the great dramatist, took the liberty of sending a deputation to Downing-street, to ask permission of Mr. COWPER, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, to proceed through Hyde Park to their destination. Their object had no connection whatever with politics; they merely meant to make a public demonstration of their reverence for literature, to plant in the earth the sapling, which, in its upward and outward growth for centuries, should symbolize the increasing fame of the matchless bard, and then to return home the way they came.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and Her Operatives.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and Her Operatives.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc67f8ca-8376-501e-a3e8-0278174e8b66,669,nyt://article/bc67f8ca-8376-501e-a3e8-0278174e8b66

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/01/archives/literary-gossip.html,,"-- Much interest has been felt in the bookselling world of London on the contemplated intention of Mr. HENRY G. BOHN to retire from business. It is about thirty years since he commenced -- in the same locality that he still occupies in York-street, Covent Garden -- in the old book branch of the profession. A few years placed him indisputably at the head of this department, when the accidental purchase of what are called the ""remainders,"" or unsold portions of the octavo editions of EVELYN's and PEPY's Diaries, gave a new direction to his energies, and while still continuing the old book business, he became the largest purchaser of these remainders of editions of recent books that was ever seen in England. His skill in adding to the attraction of the books that thus came into his hands (which seemed to start into new life under his auspices,) and the activity with which he sought out all over the world, in Australia, Canada, India, the United States, &c., new channels for the disposal of them, gave him such success that the trade grew jealous of his achievements, and became indisposed to see him monopolize the market, and consequently were less liberal in their terms and less anxious to sell to him. The result of this was that, in self-defence, he became a manufacturer of books himself, and the world-renowned series of ""Bohn's Libraries"" will give evidenec to the latest times of his tact, enterprise, and literary taste. There is scarcely a volume of the whole set -- nearly six hundred in number -- but what is indebted to his supervision for much of its merits, while several have been edited or translated exclusively by Mr. BOHN. The sale of the series has been very large, both in England and America, and shows no signs of falling off; though in the United States the absence of an international copyright law has allowed much infringement on the publisher's equitable rights in his own property, by which he has been a large loser. Pending negotiations for the transfer of this entire property of the ""Libraries,"" in one lot, for a sum, in our present currency,equal to nearly half a million of dollars, will probably soon be concluded, and will be followed by a more gradual withdrawal from the other branches of his business.

Compared","Those who are fond of drawing instruction from historical parallels, or who seek for political guidance by examining the analogies of different States, may consult, with no little interest at the present time, a comprehensive and learned monogram, by Gen. J. WATTS DEPEYSTER, of New-York, entitled ""Secession in Switzerland and in the United States Compared."" The author does not absolutely confine himself to an analysis of the secession malady which seems almost to be of an endemic character in the Swiss Republic, since it has existed there for more than three hundred years -- but makes discursive references to the three European Republics, Holland, Venice and Genoa, destroyed by the first NAPOLEON; and taking the first named for a text, reads his fellow-countrymen a solemn and pointed admonition on the danger of mistaking the heat of party spirit for the zeal of patriotism, and of seeking for national riches as the end, and not as the means, of national greatness. Along with this admonitory reflection, Gen. DE PEYSTER draws from the fate which followed the admission of foreign interference by the United Provinces, a practical lesson to illustrate the necessity, the imperious necessity, of maintaining the doctrine of MONROE inviolate, ""as an antidote to the poison of foreign intervention in the affairs of this, our continent."" He reasons, too, and reasons well, that the failure of former republics and the occasional license or sporadic excesses of liberal institutions should neither discourage nor disgust thinking men. And quoting the famous passage of MACAULAY on Liberty, he pointedly reminds us of the Fairy of Ariosto: ""Those who injured her during the period of her disguise, when she bore a loathsome aspect, were forever excluded from participation in the blessings which she bestowed, but to those who, in spite of her loathsome aspect, pitied and protected her, she afterward revealed herself in the beautiful and celestial form which was natural to her, accompanied their steps, granted all their wishes, filled their houses with wealth, made them happy in love, and victorious in war. Such is the spirit of liberty. * * Woe to those who in disgust shall venture to crush her! And happy those who having dared to receive her in her degraded shape, shall at length be rewarded by her in the time of her beauty and her glory.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Secession Historical Parallels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Secession Historical Parallels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fea2254a-6016-5a52-87f4-d37822728c8c,1107,nyt://article/fea2254a-6016-5a52-87f4-d37822728c8c

It will not, or certainly ought not to be difficult for an active and vigilant officer such as he is to pick up three hundred and sixty of them, considering that they are all given to drink, and that as they are mostly occupied in plundering, they must scatter and straggle a good deal. Now, if this is the case, does it not furnish a ready solution of our difficulty about retaliation for the Fort Pillow affair? It would certainly be very hard for us either to counsel or to witness the execution in cold blood of this number of Confederate prisoners who have had no share in this bloody deed. The butchery of a large number of men for a crime of which, though technically answerable for it, they are not really guilty, is something which no Christian man at the North likes to face, if it can possibly be avoided. We have not got down to the Confederate level yet, and have no love of bloodshed for its own sake. But we doubt very much if there is anybody amongst us, or in any part of the civilized world, who would not hear with intense satisfaction that three hundred and sixty of FORREST's butchers had been strung up as fast as they were caught. They are the very men who have done the deed, and the only men who, if simple justice was always attainable, ought to be made to suffer for it. We are satisfied, therefore, that if Col. GRIERSON will hang on the nearest tree every prisoner who falls into his hands, who shall be proved to have belonged to FORREST's gang, he will relieve the Government from great embarrassment, set a valuable and striking example, and give satisfaction to the Northern public.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fort Pillow Butchery--How to Deal With the Butchers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fort Pillow Butchery--How to Deal With the Butchers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0c4fa844-918c-5da9-936c-e89e0d786005,339,nyt://article/0c4fa844-918c-5da9-936c-e89e0d786005

BANKS to try the plan of fighting the enemy with his whole army at once, and of trying to be the stronger at the point of attack. A great many of our Generals have, so far, as we remarked the other day, regarded this idea with great disfavor, influenced, we believe, by the example of the Greeks at Marathon and Thermopylae, who are reported to have fought and conquered with vastly inferior forces. As civilians, we of course offer an opinion on a point of this kind with a good deal of diffidence, but the plan of attacking the enemy with superior numbers, or of letting him severely alone until he can be attacked in this way, has in modern times been tried on several occasions with much success; and from this it would seem that there really must be something in it. Then, it is now satisfactorily proved that the Confederates are ""evil beasts,"" and positively will not let themselves be thrashed by half their numbers -- the United States Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding. They began the display of their stiffneckedness on the Peninsula, where they resolutely and wickedly refused to be conquered by detachments detailed from Little MAC's army for that purpose. Their malevolence to ward Gen. BANKS seems equally strong. The manner in which they precipitated their whole force on each of his divisions as it came up, following their refusal to lay down their arms to Gen. A.L. LEE's cavalry, was a stupendous example of malignity. A man named BONAPARTE, who cut some figure in the wars following the French Revolution, was in the habit of so arranging matters that he might fling his whole army on one point of the enemy's line, and he on several occasions did them a good deal of damage in this way, and achieved some reputation among his co-temporaries. We, therefore, respectfully suggest that Gen. BANKS be requested to try this device at Grand Ecore, if it be not too late. We think it extremely doubtful whether the Confederates can be conquered by ""raids"" much before the year 1900, and we fear by that time people at the North would begin to show symptoms of dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the war.

Movements in Tennessee,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/02/archives/the-military-field.html,Movements in Tennessee,"The opinion is universal, both in the North and in the South, that this month of May will be a month of great battles. It was almost impossible, this year, to commence operations earlier. It was impossible for the army in Tennessee to advance, for the simple reason that until within the last few weeks, there was no accumulation of supplies at Chattanooga; and without a very large accumulation, a forward movement was not only impracticable, but if it had been successfully made, we could not have held the new positions we might have won. By this time, we have a considerable stock of supplies at Chattanooga. Our army there, too, has greatly increased in magnitude by the return of the veteran regiments, who went back much enlarged after their furlough. Its objective point is generally believed to be Atlanta, a position second only to Richmond in importance, and, in a strategic point of view, in its bearings upon the whole Southern Confederacy, of still higher value than the rebel capital. Its commanding importance was argued very frequently by military men last Fall and Winter; and though we have heard but little of it lately, its importance has not diminished a whit. Some of the Richmond rebels have lately given expression to the opinion that the Summer campaign will really begin in the West, from Chattanooga, and though this is a subject about which we know nothing, we must confess that the reasons the rebels give for their opinion are not bad. Beside the drawback we have mentioned to an advance on this line, another great impediment has just been removed. We refer to the column in East Tennessee under LONGSTREET, which is now withdrawn to Virginia. As long as LONGSTREET held Bull's Gap with a large force, the advance of our main army under SHERMAN was perilous. The rebels might have fallen upon Knoxville, might have got upon SHERMAN's communications or in his rear, or might have struck into Kentucky, and by one or other of these movements compelled a retrograde movement on the part of SHERMAN before he had consummated his campaign. That danger is now out of the way for the time being; and if our forces seize and properly fortify Bull's Gap, we can secure East Tennessee and guard Kentucky with a small body of troops.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Military Field.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Military Field.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/978f2a97-c695-5303-8ce5-f3a48b88dade,848,nyt://article/978f2a97-c695-5303-8ce5-f3a48b88dade

"Rossiter's Picture, Eve in the Garden",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/02/archives/amusements.html,"Rossiter's Picture, Eve in the Garden","Mr. MARETZEK has come to the conclusion that a Spring season of Italian opera is impossible. The public seemed to be ready for it, and the subscribers presented themselves in encouraging numbers. It was owing to these facts, perhaps that a few German chorus-singers supposed that the right time had arrived for anew exaction, and therefore ""struck."" They were followed, we believe, by some members of the orchestra, and so Mr. MARETZEK found himself in a dilemma. Either he had to acknowledge a new principle in management, namely, paying for rehearsals as well as performances, or to postpone the season. The latter was the judicious course, and Mr. MARETZEK adopted it. Hence we shall have no more opera until October next. By that time the impresario will have arranged the matter -- not, perhaps, to the satisfaction of the disaffected, but judiciously, so far as the public is concerned. The time has certainly come for combating the pretensions of the mechanics of the orchestra and chorus. A decent operatic entertainment will otherwise be impossible. At the present moment they hold, or fancy they hold, the manager completely in their power. He has to accede to their monstrous demands, or be left in the lurch. The latter alternative is rather difficult with a man like Mr. MARETZEK, but he has acceded to their demands too often and too cheerfully, which has encouraged them to make the present trouble. Musicians are, we admit, scarce, but it is possible to add to their number, and this is the only, plan by which the monopoly can be broken down.

The services in the morning opened with a voluntary on the organ, and the reading of a portion of the Scriptures. After singing the 551st hymn, the Pastor announced that to-day the pews were free, but that to-morrow (Monday) and Tuesday evenings the choice seats would be rented to the highest bidder. A collection was then taken up for furnishing the church, when the dedicatory sermon was preached by Rev. Dr. R.D. HITCHCOCK, who took for his text the 22d and 1st clause of the 23d verses, 1st chapter of the Ephesians: -- ""And nath put all things under His feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is His body,"" in which he treated of the church as the revelations of God and as the organ and instrument of His will.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Brooklyn (NYC)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad994da4-cb86-5a42-873e-0bfc829740f3,1005,nyt://article/ad994da4-cb86-5a42-873e-0bfc829740f3

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/03/archives/the-red-river-battles.html,,"The Springfield Republican Publishes a private letter from an officer, written at Grand Ecore, La. shortly after Gen. BANKS' battles. The writer says: [???] Gen. BANKS was advancing with the confidence that he had only to advance, and advanced faster than the rebels retreated. Seeing our exposed position, they brought on an engagement near Mansfield, which resulted in the loss of all the train and artillery which were irregularly distributed in the train. The attack was so sudden that all were panic-stricken; the horses were cut from the wagons, and artillery and infantry precipitately fled to the rear. Then the cavalry became engaged, but only for a moment, when they abandoned their horses and fled. Then the Thirteenth Army Corps was ordered up, a brigade at a time. Thus this corps was fearfully routed, losing some sixteen or eighteen hundred men, and those who did escape, were forced to abandon their arms. Had it not been for the plunder in the captured train, this entire corps would have been taken prisoners, one brigade at a time. I have talked with many of the Thirteenth Corps who were taken prisoners, and escaped while the rebels were plundering the train. The Thirteenth is now almost without arms. It was commanded by Gen. RANSOM and four brigade commanders. Gen. RANSOM was wounded by a ball passing through his leg above the knee, and three of the brigade commanders were killed. The remaining one, Col. RAYMEN, is now in command of the corps. Gen. BANKS is universally condemned by officers and men. The few rebel prisoners we have are very jubilant, and say, ""Well, Gen. BANKS has been the best commissary we have ever had in this department, since he has been in command. We could not get anything from BUTLER."" The next morning after the second day's fight, our exhausted and slightly wounded men, who were too much worn out to get off the field that night, on waking up and finding no one about made up their minds that our army had advanced and so went forward. After going two or three miles, they came upon our captured train and many other wagons. This confused them, but on they went, and after they had passed the train and were within a short distance of Pleasant Hill, they were fired upon by rebel pickets. They then knew their condition and retraced their steps. Thus both armies were running from each other. We lost from twenty to thirty pieces of artillery and some five thousand men in killed, wounded and missing. The army gives Gen. A.J. SMITH great credit for his conduct, and say if it had not been for him all would have been lost. The army seem to be expecting an attack; they have been in line of battle to-day.""",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Red River Battles.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Red River Battles.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2546d73e-7035-5129-8cde-8448286a37e2,468,nyt://article/2546d73e-7035-5129-8cde-8448286a37e2

The Prussians had finally reduced and captured Duppel -- the Danish loss being 400 officers, 2,600 men and 90 guns. The Danes threatened to take the Island of Alsen, and the Allies had already sent forces into the Province of Jutland to occupy it, and lay siege to Fredericia. The Conference met in London, informally, on the 20th, but adjourned until the 25th. The Emperor of the French had created much excitement in financial circles by a brief letter to M. FOULD, his Minister of Finance, in which he announces the encouraging prospect for peace in Europe, and congratulates the nation that the early reimbursement of the Mexican War expenses enables him to recommend a decrease in the tax budget. This news produced a panic in the funds.

Speech on Prasecution of the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/03/archives/a-plea-for-union-among-union-men.html,Speech on Prasecution of the War,"We publish this morning a speech by Senator DOOLITTLE, of Wisconsin, on the paramount importance of avoiding, in the discussions of the day, everything not essential to the prosecution of the war, and which can divide Union men or weaken the active loyalty of the people of the loyal States. It was made upon a proposition brought forward by Senator WILKINSON, of Minnesota, to give negroes the right of suffrage in the Territory of Montana. As there has never been but one negro in that territory, and as he either died or left it some time since, the question had no very great practical importance; but it was pressed by Senator WILKINSON and some of his colleagues with as much zeal as if the fate of the Union, or their own reelection, depended exclusively on the result. Senator DOOLITTLE declined to discuss the question whether negroes should be allowed to vote in Montana -- because it was not of the slightest practical consequence, just now, whether they are or not, and because, furthermore, the discussion is very likely to do harm to the cause of the Union by dividing those who are struggling for its preservation. And the object of his speech is to press upon loyal men everywhere the absolute necessity of union and harmony, and of waiving controversies and discussions which threaten to disturb them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Plea for Union Among Union Men.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Plea for Union Among Union Men.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84ebf295-a070-5538-9680-b93262c21340,1080,nyt://article/84ebf295-a070-5538-9680-b93262c21340

In Philadelphia, a large and liberal plan will it is hoped, afford a better result. Mr. FRY's opera is a new work, and will be played for the first time. There was once a prospect that it would be played here in Italian, but difficulties occurred which rendered it impossible. Mr. FRY has contribute the work to the Sanitary Fair, and the Commissioners have wisely concluded to produce it. The artists engaged for the performance are Mme. BORCHARD, Mrs. JENNY KEMPTON Mr., WM. CASTLE, Mr. J.C. CAMPBELL and Mr. EDWD, SECUIN. The orchestra and chorus will be, of unusual proportions, numbering, in fact, upward of two hundred performers. In addition to this, a grand corps de ballet has been engaged, new scenery painted, new dresses manufactured, &c.

The Danish garrison of twenty-six hundred men, with ninety guns, have fallen into the hands of the Prussians, and the Prussian loss in the assault is set down at six hundred privates and sixty officers. The bombardment of this stronghold has been going on steadily since its investment, without very great loss of life. The Prussians made two assaults upon the works, and the Danish troops made several brave sorties upon the enemy's lines. The fall of the place, under the circumstances of the siege, was inevitable; but it was supposed that the Danes would evacuate it at the last moment, and cross the Sound on their pontoons to the island of Alsen. The assault of the Prussians doubtless prevented this. The Allies have now only to take Alsen to make themselves masters of the whole of Schleswig; and we have a dispatch that this has been effected, but its authenticity is doubtful.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FALL OF DUPPEL.

It has at present over forty-five hundred members, about four thousand of whom, are young, clerks. The library is large, and is constantly being enlarged.

Gold Incomes (Dividends) for the People,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/03/archives/gold-income-for-the-people.html,Gold Incomes (Dividends) for the People,"There was a refreshing sight for the holders of the Public Debt at the Treasury Office in Wall-street yesterday. The holders of the 5-20's were present in force. They were notified fifteen days ago that the Gold was ready and waiting to pay their First of May interest; but hundreds of them waited until yesterday before presenting their coupons. This Loan constitutes about two-thirds the present Funded, Gold-bearing stocks of the United States. The May and November payments are the most important of the year. The immediate instalment is $14,250,000 in Gold. Large as this sounds, we may add that the Customs Revenue, specifically pledged for the Gold interest on the Funded Debt, amounted to over fourteen millions in the month of April alone, at the port of New-York. The previous accumulation of Gold in the Treasury from the same source was double this sum. For the fiscal year the Customs will more than double the Gold interest upon the entire Funded Debt. This Debt, exclusive of the new 10-40 years 5 per cent. Loan, is $768,000,000. The present interest-charge in Gold upon this amount is $47,735,000. This will be reduced next year to $46,000,000 by the conversion of the 7.30 per cent. into the 6 per cent. stocks. It will be reduced after the war to $41,000,000, by the reduction of the 5-20 years 6 per cent. into a 5 per cent. stock; if not $10,000,000, by its reduction into a 4 per cent. stock.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gold Income for the People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Gold Income for the People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Gold', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3f22edb-104f-51e1-88d3-e3f6224870d9,488,nyt://article/c3f22edb-104f-51e1-88d3-e3f6224870d9

Whichever may be right, we can only believe in an inadvertance of the Moniteur.

The Chamber of Representatives at Washington is not the American Government. The President is much more independent of Parliament than the Queen of England.

The Garibaldi excitement in England has culminated in an outburst of indignation from the common people, at what they allege to be an attempt on the part of the nobility to drive GARIBALDI from England because of political influences. The letter of our London correspondent sets forth very clearly the reasons why GARIBALDI's presence in England just now should prove uncomfortable to the Government. Grave and dignified peers were out in cards to the effect that it was certainly the General's health which had so summarily shortened his visit, and Mr. GLADSTONE had announced in the House of Commons that the Government had no connection whatever with the cause of his sudden departure. GARIBALDI would sail for Caprera April 25, in the Duke of SUTHERLAND's yacht. The Conference had not yet done anything, owing to the absence of some of the German representatives, and stood adjourned to the 20th. The French press had received the news of the American resolution on the Mexican question, in various degrees of temper. The Government organs first ignored it, but when compelled to allude to it, affected to treat it as of no moment. The Liberal organs, however, commented freely on it, and pointed to it as an ugly feature for the French Government to contemplate when it guarantees French protection for Mexico for six years. MAXIMILIAN had sailed from Rome, with the blessing of the Pope. There was nothing new in the situation in Denmark. The King of Prussia was visiting his army, and congratulating the troops that stormed the works of Duppel. Preparations were making for pushing into Jutland.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/07f52d73-0e64-5eaa-8263-786dec0a49f3,293,nyt://article/07f52d73-0e64-5eaa-8263-786dec0a49f3

The attendance was very slim, owing, doubtless, to the fact that no public announcement had been made that such a meeting would be held. The chairman explained briefly that the committee, which had been sent to Washington to look after the interests of the commercial brokers, had made an informal report, to the effect that they had been assured that the new Tax Bill was not designed to injure any class in particular, and that the provision relating to commercial brokers had been so modified that they would have only to pay $20 a year each for a license.

According to the wording of the clause of the new tax bill, immediately preceding, that just mentioned, however, all brokers in agricultural or farm products (such as flour, grain, &c., really are) are classed as produce brokers, and as such will be required to pay a tax of $10 on all annual sales under $10,000, and of $1 on every additional $1,000.

The gambling operations in Wall and William streets have been cut down to the ordinary business of the regular Stock Exchange Board. These ways to sudden fortune have been made harder and dearer than of late. Their lines are not so pleasant. Calmer counsels must return not only in this quarter, but to the Produce Exchange and to the Grocery and Dry Goods interests, in which, we are sorry to say, the spirit of inordinate speculation is (or has been for the last few months) as rife as in Stock circles. They are now met, so far as Foreign merchandise is concerned, with an increased Tariff, adding one-half to the previous rates of duty. They expect, of course, to mark up their goods accordingly. It will not be their fault if speculation is not kept up and advanced on this pretext. But it will be the fault of household consumers if they succeed. The speculators in Grain and Flour and Provisions, on the Produce Exchange and the leading markets of the West, who, under the pretext of an inflated currency, have forestalled in a large measure the regular export demand, besides inflating prices to home consumers, are met by the opening of the Canals and by reduced Money facilities for accomplishing these quick fortunes out of the prime necessities of life. They will doubtless persevere, because Gold keeps up. They may possibly succeed, but it will be the fault of household consumers if they do. In like manner the great Coal Corporations, who have recklessly advanced the price of labor upon themselves, because they could pay it by forcing up the price of coal upon the community, will no doubt persevere in their speculations, if only to keep good an extravagant market for their shares; but even here, household consumers may hold a salutary check, and the steam lines and steam ferries work on light stocks throughout the Summer and Fall months.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Now for Household Economy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Now for Household Economy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ECONOMY', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46549ace-207b-57cd-9c22-49ab639023c4,695,nyt://article/46549ace-207b-57cd-9c22-49ab639023c4

The canal-boat was coming down the river from Troy in tow of the tug O.C. Hubbard, which had two barges attached on each side, and the Vanderbilt was bound up the river to Troy. The collision occurred about a mile below the steamer's landing place, and opposite the arsenal on the Westside of the river. Thirteen witnesses were examined in court in the case, with the usual differences of statement as to estimates of the speed of the vessels, their position and signals.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/04/archives/amusements.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- Mr. EDWIN BOOTH commenced a short season of performances here last night. The house was, of course, crowded. It is gratifying to know that it is always so when this fine artist performs. The seats were all filled, and filled with that peculiarly calm, contemplative, intellectual audience that Mr. BOOTH invariably summons to his assistance when he delineates a Shakespearean character -- an audience which we may here add is totally different to any congregation of inanities that a sensation play can or ever will command. The play was ""Hamlet,"" in which Mr. BOOTH is without an equal. It is impossible to witness his fine impersonation of the Prince without perceiving at once how thoroughly the nature as well as the intellect of Mr. BOOTH has yielded to and absorbed the conspicuous manifestations and reticent meanings of this most difficult role. There is no impassable gulf between the settled melancholy of the first act and the unsettled tribulation of the last. They both exhibit a mental condition, acute and sensitive, yet kindly and easily overwhelmed. We know of no actor who presents this temperament with so tender a fidelity, and, in fact, have never seen it preserved intact except by Mr. BOOTH. It is clearly revealed in his grand scene with the ghost, and remains in a shattered and increasingly pathetic form to the end. The fault with most artists is that they elaborate certain conspicuous portions of their parts, and ascend so many mountains of rhetoric that they have naturally to descend to swampy flats of common-place, and so become either exhaustive or dreary. Mr. BOOTH avoids these extremes, and treads the steady elevations of poetry with the conscious calmness of the mountain guide, who sees all that is sublime, yet knows how to avoid that which is fatal.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c9247c19-7a8b-5e6a-9f9b-2e08d675fb94,686,nyt://article/c9247c19-7a8b-5e6a-9f9b-2e08d675fb94

From the little observation I have made since I came here, one thing has struck me more than anything else, and that is the existence of prejudices on both sides of the Atlantic which require for their removal only a little more familiarity between the two peoples. I have seen statements made in public prints here with respect to the acts of my country which I know they would not have believed if they had had any opportunity of knowing the truth from personal experience. [Hear, hear.] So, likewise, on the other side of the Atlantic, there are newspapers which have made statements with respect to Great Britain which would not have been made if the writers had known what the British people really are, and what are their real feelings.

Rebel Ship-building in England,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/05/archives/rebel-shipbuilding-in-england.html,Rebel Ship-building in England,"The cases of the vessels building in England for the rebels seem to be in abeyance just at present. The former case of the Alexandra, which was watched with so much interest on both sides of the Atlantic, came to an ignominious end, resulting only in the determination that the Government officials had made a mistake in the merest point of practice. The judgment in the case, however, resulted as favorably for the builders of the vessel as if it had been decided upon the vital questions which the case was at one time thought to involve. What further proceedings, if any, will be taken about the vessel, we can hardly conjecture. We saw the statement sometime since that the English Government had notified the builders that they were ready to deliver them the vessel. But we find an editorial in the London Law Times which says, though not vouching for the fact, that as soon as the decision of the House of Lords was rendered, ""the Solicitor to the Treasury rushed to the office and filed another information against her -- the object of this hot haste being, of course, to prevent her escape;"" and the editor says:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Shipbuilding in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Shipbuilding in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0153d499-fe90-5abe-9800-77364223e0e6,908,nyt://article/0153d499-fe90-5abe-9800-77364223e0e6

"Both Boards of the Common council met yesterday.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/05/archives/general-news.html,,"Both Boards of the Common council met yesterday. A communication was read in each board from City Inspector BOOLE, calling attention to the fat-boiling establishments in West Thirty-ninth-street and vicinity, which he declares are not only nuisances, but are fraught with danger to the public health. He proposes to banish them from the City limits, and as he has done all in his power for their abatement, that the Common Council request the Mayor to convene the Board of Health, who have the fullest power to remedy such evils. Both boards adopted a resolution embodying such a request to the Mayor. The Aldermen took up the City Tax Law and appropriation ordinance, as previously received from the Comptroller, and referred them to their Finance Committee, to report in half an hour, for which length of time a recess was immediately taken. On reassembling, the committee reported the ordinance, with the special appropriations originated at Albany, with the exception of $15,000 for the Society for the Protection of Destitute Catholic Children, reduced each to $5 -- the Common Council having no power to increase, but it has always been conceded the right to reduce appropriations. With this difference, and the striking out of the words ""by contract"" whenever they occur, the items in the City Tax Law were passed. The report of the committee, necessarily short, is published in the official proceedings. It contains the reasons for the changes voted. The Councilmen received the ordinance and laid it over under the rule. They also laid over the resolution to increase the pay of Corporation laborers to $2 per day, and concurred in the resolution for a joint special committee to report upon the subject of selling franchises of omnibus routes at auction. The Aldermen adopted resolutions, previously reported by a special committee, requesting the Central Park Commissioners to remove obstructions from a certain plot of ground in the Central Park, and directing the Street Commissioner to prepare it for a division parade-ground. The doubtful legality of this movement was pointed out by Messrs. HARDY and JEREMIAH; but Mr. MCMAHON said Gen. SANDFORD would ""take the responsibility,"" if the Common Council would open the way for him, and Mr. JONES said that, under the new feature of law introduced into the City Tax Law for 1864, making the Common Council trustees of the public property of the City, they had the right to take this action -- at any rate, it would be well to know what their rights in the matter are. The Aldermen adjourned to Monday, and the Councilmen to Friday next, at 2 o'clock P.M.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a30fbe06-b9ed-576f-9767-1795a9aa86bc,947,nyt://article/a30fbe06-b9ed-576f-9767-1795a9aa86bc

His ignoble defeat is also a recorded fact. Stonewall Jackson proved himself so good a horse in this trot and the one which ensued -- in which he again defeated the General with ridiculous ease, owing to the extreme nervousness of the latter, and the utter inability of his driver to get him down into a fair and square trot -- that a repetition of the same results in the trot of yesterday was deemed a foregone conclusien. There are, however, no certainties in racing or trotting, even under the most favorable circumstances of public performances, and they are materially reduced when one has something remarkably good -- which has done so much in private -- and kept so entirely ""shady"" as to lead to the belief that both owner and trainer knew what they were about, and the thorough value of the stock they possessed -- the confidence being enhanced by the knowledge that the animal in question was in the reliable hands of Hiram Woodruff, who, although he has driven many bad horses, always drives to win -- and the public are thoroughly acquainted with that fact.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Turf Record.; TROTTING ON THE FASHION COURSE.

All things considered, the show, in point of numbers, is creditable. Artists have been exposed to many and various temptations during the past year. Their pictures have been so often exhibited that this particular exhibition has, to a great extent, lost its savor. Lastly, all -- who could -- have availed themselves of the superior popularity of the Metropolitan Fair. The demand for pictures, too, has been so great that they have not accumulated in the studios. Hence many of our most popular artists -- having sold out or being engaged in the pleasing business of advertising themselves up town -- are not represented in the present collection. On the other hand, there is a powerful delegation from that numerous class that brings more industry than talent to bear in the matter of painting, and whom we should rejoice to see prospering in any other avocation than this. We hear that many pictures were excluded -- notably an important work by Mr. NEHLIG. This is remarkable, considering the number of canvases -- not pictures -- that have been admitted. Among the names that we should have liked to see in the present catalogue are CHURCH, KENSETT, GIGNOUX, LEUTZE, JAMES HART, CASILEAR, EASTMAN JOHNSON, INNES, &c., &c.

Stopping at the yard of the New-York Iron Ship-yard of Mr. J. J.S. UNDERHILL, we found the Modoc approaching the likeness of her beautiful model. She is one of the light-draft monitors, 225 feet long, 45 feet wide and 9 feet deep. One peculiar feature in her form is that her deck is rounded, being 21 inches higher at the crown than at the edge of the deck; and thus, when the vessel is submerged, nothing but the round hump will be visible of the entire hull. This is to remedy an objection in vessels of the same class where the edge or the vessel is visible, and the ball forces its way and rips up the whole length of the deck plates. The water-tight compartments run the whole length of the vessel on each side, bulkheaded off 20 feet, so as to make separate compartments, and are filled to lower the vessel, or emptied to raise her, by engines. This vessel like all light-draft monitors, is intended for steam and inlet navigation. She will be ready for active service in September, at which time she will also be launched, being fitted out complete on the stocks. Another improvement in this vessel is the steering apparatus being double, so that when the one above the turret in the pilot-house becomes disabled, the one forward of the turret and under the deck can be used with equal facility, Mr. UNDERHILL is using his best energies in making this vessel one of the best of her class. She is constructed of the best material, four feet of white pine on each side forms the backing for the armor, which is three inches thick. The bow forms a ram; it goes three feet below the top of the deck and is as sharp as a knife. The deck will be covered with two thicknesses of half-inch iron plates, under which is the oak timber, fifteen inches thick, nearly all of which is laid. There will be one revolving turret in the centre of the vessel, with two guns.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Naval Movements.; PROGRESS OF THE GREENPOINT VESSELS-OF-WAR', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Naval Movements.; PROGRESS OF THE GREENPOINT VESSELS-OF-WAR', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2affa646-0666-5308-971f-c0401592ba2c,799,nyt://article/2affa646-0666-5308-971f-c0401592ba2c

The difficulty between LEWIS and ANDERSON had been of long standing, and a bitter enmity existed between them.

We have had the same rumors at the opening of this campaign that we have had at the opening of every preceding campaign that the rebels were about to abandon Richmond, and that their armies would retreat somewhere south of the James River, if not to North Carolina. Those who believed this have always heretofore been disappointed, and it is altogether unlikely that the event will take place now. It is as necessary for the rebels to hold Richmond as it is for us to take it; and they will never leave it unless overthrown in the field, or unless some masterly strategic movement on the part of GRANT renders the holding of it absolutely impossible. It cannot as yet be told what will be the effect of this apparition of BEAUREGARD upon the movements of BUTLER's army. Its purpose is, of course, to neutralize that army, and from Petersburgh BEAUREGARD can operate quickly against BUTLER whether the latter attempt an advance upon Richmond by the south side of the James, or by the Peninsula. His appearance at this moment, and at that point, is certainly a shrewd thing.

The public has, to a great extent, taken the matter in its own hands. All who visited the Fair left it with some remembrances of its useful existence. Every day we see in the streets a strange horse-shoe device attached to the button-holes or enthusiastic citizens, and it is impossible to visit a home, be it in the western avenues or the eastern purlieus of the City, without observing in the place of honor some prized purchase made in the great caravansaries of charity. But better than these, if less substantial to the soldier, were the genial friendships that were cemented in the common cause. These, if they do not otherwise appeal to the public, show us at least now heartily the rich work when the poor need their services. The labor and self-sacrifice that were involved in the management of the fair will probably never be made known. It was almost incredible. We have heard it stated that some of the young lady volunteers were absolutely killed by the unaccustomed fatigue imposed upon them, and by the necessity it involved of breathing for many hours an atmosphere which a visitor could barely endure during a hasty scamper through the various buldings.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""MR.

It was so at the close of all the great engagements from Shiloh to Antietam. Admitting the vast improvements effected in every detail of the army hospital arrangements within the last two years, and assuming that the supplementary labors of the Sanitary Commission have aided greatly as auxiliaries of the surgical department of the army, it would be well not to forget that at no period of the war have there been such gigantic operations as the present simultaneously in progress. Of the three-quarters of a million men that compose the national army, it is no excessive estimate to reckon that a half million will be either in the very blaze and shock of battle, or marching thither-ward with eager and impatient step, before the few remaining hours of the week have elapsed. For the contingencies of battles in which a host so enormous will be engaged, it is no disparagement to the forethought, judgment and ability, either of the Medical Department or the Sanitary Commission, to suggest that even further volunteer effort may possibly be needed. Whether the pending campaigns shall take the shape of open contests in the field, or of prolonged sieges in front of Richmond in the East and Atlanta in the West, it would be childish to disguise the certainty of bloodier work in prospect than has yet marked the progress of the conflict.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Forethought for the Wounded.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Forethought for the Wounded.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/83699c63-07a8-5d41-8c70-1685639e0f61,423,nyt://article/83699c63-07a8-5d41-8c70-1685639e0f61

The Manhattan is already launched, turret up, gun carriages being lowered, and about 200 hands are busy upon her decks and interior, working from sunrise till dark to get her ready for active service. Steam will be got up to-day to try her engines and boilers; the guns will be set by Friday, and between that time and the 15th, having made her trial trip, she will go to the Navy-yard to be put in commission. The Mahopac and Mohongo are on the stocks. The Mahopac will be launched at full moon, the 21st, when the tide will be very high. She will be ready for launching next week. The Mohongo will be launched about the 1st of June. The following are the dimensions of the vessels: The Mahopac, 235 feet long, 42 feet wide and 14 feet deep; the Manhattan the same; the Mohongo is 255 feet long, 35 feet beam and 14 feet deep. The ram on the Mahopac is 12 feet long and sharp as a knife. She is a counterpart of the Manhattan, with one exception. Capt. ERICSSON has applied an invention in this craft which will be of inestimable value in saving life. It is a sounding-well -- the leadsman standing inside of the turret and dropping his line through a hole in the bottom of the vessel, and thus attaining the same end as when the leadsman has his person exposed, in approaching an enemy's fortification, to ascertain the exact depth of water. The deck of the vessel is fastened from the outside, and the armor is put on top of that, making a solid mass of iron and wood together. The iron armor is nine inches thick, with the usual wood backing. The turret is finished, and will be put on her when launched.

Chaplains and Clergy of the Revolution; Vaux, Gilbert. Villa and Cottage Designs","We believe that the statistics of publication place Mr. HEADLEY, beyond all controversy, in the proud position of the most popular author of America the writer whose works have been most largely bought and most widely circulated among his countrymen during the present century, which, of course, is as much as to say, of any or of all time past. This popularity has not been aided, as often happens, by the reflex wave of European criticism. Half a million volumes of Mr. HEADLEY's books have found a market here, though scarcely one of his works has been honored with foreign critical approval. They have Struck a chord that finds its response in the breasts and heads of the American people, and their author may well be proud of the audience he commands and sways at will. Less vividly attractive in subject than his military historical biographies, ""The Clergy of the Revolution"" yields to none of the author's writings in solid and substantial interest, while it enjoys the advantage over most of them afforded by a subject new, fresh and attractive not only in itself, but by association with the great series of events intimately connected with, and growing out of it. If the war of the American Revolution is honorably distinguished in many importan respects from other contests, for the gravity, the earnestness, the sobriety of feeling, which marked its progress through the most startling vicissitudes of sunshine and gloom, the difference is largely to be attributed, especially in New-England, to the pulpit and the clerical element, there a recognized power in the State, whose aid was formally and earnestly invoked to sanctify the people's cause. The remembrance of CROMWELL and his Ironsides, equally prompt for spiritual or bodily combat, was not totally extinct in those days, nor even of GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS, the Protestant Lion of the North, in whose, armies ""the drums best to prayers, morning and evening, as regularly as for parade."" If examples were needed, these were sufficient to show that praying never hindered fighting in a good cause. Mindful of this truth, Mr. HEADLEY. has taken pains in this work to record the deeds of those faithful teachers who feared not to follow where their doctrines led, and were never found wanting in the hour of difficulty or danger. To give to these men the place they ought to occupy in the history of the Revolution is his object, coupled, indeed, with the view of directing the minds of the generation now rising into manhood, not only to the importance of religious influences, but to the great source of all national blessings, without which battle-fields and strong legions are in vain.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE CHAPLAINS AND CLERGY OF THE REVOLUTION.

They will every way increase their earnestness in its support. They will be better prepared for the always uncertain contingencies of battle. The struggle must go on, in any immediate event, until the rebellion is put down. The Richmond paper may be right, speaking for its own side, in assuming that this is to be the last year of the War. It is wrong, as it has been before, in assuming that our side will give up if defeated in the coming struggle. There has been too much loyal blood and treasure expended in reclaiming one-half the territory originally in revolt, and in our attempts upon Richmond and Charleston, to leave the work half finished. It is not possible to do so, short of the self-destruction of the Government. Our armies may be repeatedly baffled, as they were on the Potomac last Spring and in the gloomy Summer of 1862. But the work, will go on. To this determination the popular mind is fully made up. There is no probability of its reversal, come what may, of the Spring campaign. And this being so, our loyal masses at home are imperiously called upon, by the claims of our gallant armies in the field, and the necessities of a heavily burthened Treasury, to give their best time and thoughts and means to the prosecution of the War.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Duties of the Hour.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Duties of the Hour.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ECONOMY', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b4286ad4-8338-52f9-aaaa-cb7fb4ff61ec,750,nyt://article/b4286ad4-8338-52f9-aaaa-cb7fb4ff61ec

"-- The Singapore correspondent of the Messager du Midi gives the following information relative to the Japanese Embassy, just arrived at Marseilles: ""In 1862 the ambassadors of the Talcoon in Paris had very skillfully demanded that Japan should not be constrained to open all her ports to foreigners so long as there was any cause to fear that security in the interior could not be relied on. They offered every possible facility to commerce at Nagasaki and other points, but at none of those that had been wished for. The Frence Government accepted the demand, but on condition that Japan should reduce the duties on French wines and other articles of Paris manufacture. On returning to Yeddo, and after twenty months' hesitation, that is to say, after having acquired the conviction that nothing could be done by force against the foreigners, a decision was come to, to yield on the question of the tariffs, in order to demand in their turn the fulfillment of the promises made at Paris. They hastened to the French Minister to offer him to take up the customs' question. A discussion took place, and in the end they yielded, as they said, out of sympathy to France.

In the wrestle HAMMEL was thrown, which so incensed him that he drew a knife and attacked O'SHEA, stabbing him so severely in the abdomen that the intestines of the wounded man protruded. He was taken to the New-York Hospitals, where the surgeon in attendance gave but slight hopes for his recovery.

Battle News and Dealers in Conjecture,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/08/archives/giving-the-battlenews.html,Battle News and Dealers in Conjecture,"It would be idle to look for a moderate regard to probability in those bulletins which supply the details of battles several days in advance of their occurrence. But one might expect some revision of the system, which, if it did not relieve the utterers of fabricated news from disgrace, might, at least, redeem their operations from the character of absolute and unpardonable folly. So long as the war continues there will not only be a class of vampires found glutting in the life-blood of the country, but there will be professional pimps to cater to their lust. It is part of the national sacrifice to endure this affliction, in addition to the prime evil of the war itself. And what honest men and faithful citizens have to see to is, that they do not unconsciously aggravate the crime of defaming the army and disheartening its leaders by hasty assumptions, by giving to honest hope and steadfast faith the place which can only belong to actions done and duty fulfilled. While we abate no part of our condemnation against those who eagerly anticipate defeat, let us not forget, if we would be wise, that there is error and danger in the opposite extreme, which blazons forth victory in advance of its achievement, and opens the way for disappointment and chagrin by prefiguring impossible exploits and supernatural successes. In the early stages of the conflict it might have been a pardonable weakness to anticipate uninterrupted victory for the national cause, but the lesson has surely been often enough repeated for some men to learn that there is no miraculous interposition to be looked for in this war -- that feeble generalship, immature plans of operation, occasional unsteadiness of nerve in the ranks, beside the thousand accidents of position, of mistaken orders, of climatic changes, have all to be reckoned with sober care in forming any estimate of value as to the fate of a campaign. And, therefore, wise and clear-headed men, however firmly assured of a steady advancement for the cause they sustain, and of ultimate triumph for the right, will discourage whatever appears a hasty assumption of complete success -- content in the conviction that the best has been aimed at in the Council of War, and that the bravest has been done in the field of battle.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Giving the Battle-News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Giving the Battle-News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a4c09c6-e86f-5914-9e39-834486786b54,902,nyt://article/2a4c09c6-e86f-5914-9e39-834486786b54

No. 6 of Mr. MITCHELL's ""Wet Weather Work"" continues his gossip with the old horticultural writers of England, and, except in its too harsh judgment of HORACE WALPOLE, commands the reader's assent to its critical judgments, as the production of one equally at home in handling the spade or the pen of the belle-lettre essayist. The useful and the enteraining are blended in the remaining articles by Miss PENSCOTT, Mrs. H.B. STOWE, Dr. PALFREY and others, but the Atlantic is sadly in need of the continuous interest afforded by that indispensable attraction in modern magazines, a high class serial story, as all who remember ""Elsie Venner"" will allow. An original poem by ROBERT BROWNING is a thing no American periodical has ever before offered to his readers.

Curious Cor. with Earl Russell,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/08/archives/jeff-davis-vs-earl-russell-curious-diplomatic-correspondence-is-it.html,Curious Cor. with Earl Russell,"A late number of the Columbus (Ga.) Times copies from the Mobile Tribune an article consisting, with a few introductory remarks, of a diplomatic correspondence between Earl RUSSELL, Lord LYONS and JEFFERSON DAVIS. The correspondence begins with a communication from Lord LYONS to Mr. DAVIS, introducing part of a dispatch from Earl RUSSELL to Lord LYONS. The dispatch opens with ""the formal protest and remonstrance of Her Majesty's Government against the effort of the authorities of the so-called Confederate States to build war-vessels within Her Majesty's dominions, to be employed against the Government of the United States."" The dispatch goes on to say that, ""after consulting with the law officers of the Crown, Her Majesty's Government has come to the decision that agents of the authorities of the so-called Confederate States have been engaged in building vessels which would be at least partially equipped for war purposes on leaving the ports of this country; that these war-vessels would undoubtedly be used against the United States, a country with which this Government is at peace; that this would be a violation of the neutrality laws of the realm; and that the Government of the United States would have just ground for serious complaint against her Majesty's Government should they permit such an infraction of the amicable relations now subsisting between the two countries,"" The dispatch proceeds: ""No matter what might be the difficulty of proving in a court of law that the parties procuring the building of these vessels are agents for the so-called Confederate States, it is universally understood throughout the world that they are so, and her Majesty's Government are satisfied that Mr. DAVIS would not deny that they are so. Constructed as rams, as these vessels are, they would certainly be in a condition, on leaving port, to inflict the most serious damage on vessels belonging to the United States, as was shown by the destruction of the Cumberland, a United States sloop-of-war, by the ram Merrimac, merely by the latter having run into collision with the Cumberland."" ""It is clear,"" argues the dispatch, ""that a hundred and twenty gun ship might be equipped for war purposes with any fraction of her armament on board, although she might not be so prompt or so efficient as she would be, if she had the whole of it. A ram would be also equipped for war purposes, although the absence of her ordnance and ammunition might render her less effective than she would be with them."" The concluding paragraph of the dispatch is: ""Under these circumstances, Her Majesty's Government protest and remonstrate against any further efforts being made on the part of the so-called Confederate States, or the authorities or agents thereof, to build, or cause to be built, or to purchase, or cause to be purchased, any such vessels as those styled rams, or any other vessels, to be used for war purposes against the United States, or against any country with which the United Kingdom is at peace or on terms of amity; and Her Majesty's Government further protest and remonstrate against all further acts in violation of the neutrality laws of the realm.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JEFF.

Growth of the American Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/08/archives/growth-of-the-american-nation-the-nationality-of-the-blement.html,Growth of the American Nation,"The other day I saw in one of the worst Copperhead sheets in this country, an extract from the N.Y. Tribune, gloated over as a most precious confession. It think it was precious for the Copperheads and disreputable to Republicans. It was in substance this: That there was a time when Mr. LINCOLN, Gov. MORGAN, and ""most of us"" were willing the South should separate peaceably, if they would go into convention, and have the thing done orderly! I don't know who ""most of us"" are; but, I know something of the people, and I know -- that on the hypothesis that such a thing was possible -- the result would have been, that the Republican party would have been utterly dissolved, the Democratic party become a war party, and the country involved in a worse war than it is now. The great body of the people are for war till the National Flag files over every fort of our territory -- and they would have denounced every leader, (whether in a Convention of States, or not,) who was for separation, as they do BURR and DAVIS. But let that pass. Men have a right to their opinions, and especially in the forming stages of public action. I have never happened to agree with the sort of people who thought this world is to be governed by conventions. But I do agree with the great body of people, who set the unity and grandeur of their country above all the considerations of party, and all the artificialties of convention. The American people are national. Since the commonwealth of Israel, no more people are more so. Why? This involves a view of their origin and growth. Mr. HERBERT SPENCER, (who is not so deep a thinker as his admirers suppose,) lays down the principle that a cause produces more than one effect -- homogenity produces heterogenity -- which is illustrated by many obvious facts. But this is only apparent. Unity can never produce anything but unity. The causes which he assumes contain in reality different elements. Applied to nations, agglommeration of different elements may possibly exist in one empire, (as in Rome, Austria, Great Britain.) But what is the consequence? An inevitable tendency of the different elements to fly off. The empire of ALEXANDER flew to pieces. The empire of Rome flew to pieces; and unless great changes are accomplished, that of Austria and Great Britain will do so also. This antagonism of elements may be very much diminished, and almost destroyed, if, instead of being localized, the adverse elements were socially mixed up in one country. If there was no Ireland, but the Irish were mixed up with the English, the case would be very different, and the great English difficulty removed. But where is that difficulty in American nationality? It does not exist. There is, in fact, a remarkable homogeneousness. Prof. STOWE, of Andover, said in some speech, several years since, that he thought the American people would be an improvement on other nations, because their blood would be mixed by the continual immigration of foreigners. But who were those foreigners? In fact, they are the very same people migrating to this country now who were migrating here a century ago. We do not mix blood, in tact. The English and Germans are first cousins. The Irish are different; but, though many have come to this country, they have produced no sensible impression on either the current of blood or the current of thought. The idea that a people are to be improved by mixing blood must be taken with great allowance. Suppose you have the best blood in the world already, how are you to improve it by mixing with inferior blood? Is the mulatto superior to his white father? Can you improve Durham cattle by mixing them with the scallawags which are often seen in the New-York market? I say, then, the American nation is essentially homogeneous in its origin and progress. The Germanic immigration has not changed it in the least, for it is essentially the ancestral race. Taking the era of the peace of 1783 as a stand-point, we find the American nation at that time almost entirely homogeneous, excepting always the blacks, who then numbered but 650,000. From that era to 1860, the nation increased at nearly an average of 34 per cent in each ten years. Of this growth, 26 per cent was wholly the growth of the native American stock. About eight per cent was the increase by immigration. Of this growth by immigration, less than one-half was Irish. We have then this result, that admitting the Irish to be different blood, the whole increase from that source is but slightly more than one-ninth of the annual growth. But this is not the whole. The Irish produce no writers to influence the public mind, and they scatter over the country and intermix, so that, in the third generation -- as can be readily observed in New-York -- they are no longer Irish. They are thoroughly American. Thus we see that no sensible change is going on by intermixture with the white race. That remains, in substance, Anglo-American.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN NATION.; The Nationality of the Blement Philosophy of National Growth Elementswhich Compose the American Nation Their Homogeneousness Compared withEurope The Irish in America Nationaltiy of the United States most Continue Impossibility of Resisting its Progress.THE BEECHES, Saturday, April 23, 1864.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN NATION.; The Nationality of the Blement Philosophy of National Growth Elementswhich Compose the American Nation Their Homogeneousness Compared withEurope The Irish in America Nationaltiy of the United States most Continue Impossibility of Resisting its Progress.THE BEECHES, Saturday, April 23, 1864.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a064224f-7deb-5ba4-9df5-fa42780a5f85,1619,nyt://article/a064224f-7deb-5ba4-9df5-fa42780a5f85

Grant's Campaign in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/08/archives/the-great-battle.html,Grant's Campaign in Virginia,"That a great battle is going on in Virginia, even if not already concluded, seems to admit of no doubt, but the results are still in abeyance, and the details painfully meagre. Gen. GRANT's sudden passage of the Rapidan was undoubtedly a surprise to LEE; but the latter immediately marched out of his works on Wednesday, and on Thursday he precipitated his columns upon GRANT's veteran host, with an evident design of cutting off or cutting up one of our corps before it could be properly supported. But in this he was foiled. HANCOCK met his old antagonist, LONGSTREET, and held him at bay handsomely until he connected his command with WARREN, and on Thursday evening our troops rested on their arms, a compact, confident army, with the reserves under BURNSIDE, across the Rapidan, and in position for prompt support to the main army. Such heavy cannonading was heard on Friday morning as to leave no doubt but that the battle was renewed on that day. The locality of the battle-ground is in the densest part of that wild tract known as ""the Wilderness,"" and only a short distance from the Chancellorsville battle-ground, even if the conflict does not rage over a portion of that same field.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Battle.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Battle.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7b91654-e930-5fdd-840c-7f10cf99a095,263,nyt://article/c7b91654-e930-5fdd-840c-7f10cf99a095

Brazil Steamship Aid Bill in Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/09/archives/steam-communication-with-brazil.html,Brazil Steamship Aid Bill in Senate,"Although the Brazil Steamship Aid Bill passed the Post-office Committee in the Senate on Thursday, there is an apparent hesitancy, natural enough perhaps, to take decisive action on the measure at once. The reasons attributed to the opponents of the measure for delaying action are, we think, of doubtful validity. The objectors, it is said, consider that the claims of steamship lines to run from New-York to European ports, should have precedence in any scheme of subsidies. So, perhaps, in ordinary cases and in ordinary times they ought to have. But let it first be granted that the trade of Brazil warrants the establishment of such an enterprise, and there are more and better reasons for early action than the opposition can give for delay. In the good years before the war we took from $22,000,000 to $25,000,000 worth of Brazilian products annually, and sent to Brazil sometimes between $6,000,000 and $7,000,000 a year -- running almost neck and neck with Great Britain in the race of competition for the trade. That trade was, we may say, the short growth of thirty odd years. Within that period it had grown in the matter of imports almost forty-fold. Nearly ten years ago the merchants of Hamburg thought the trade of sufficient importance to warrant the establishment of postal communication by steam with Rio. And, under a similar stimulus, the commerce of Great Britain with the Empire, has more than doubled in the last seven years.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Steam Communication with Brazil.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Steam Communication with Brazil.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Brazil', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/163bfe8c-7fb7-5739-86d2-179a0358d7e2,509,nyt://article/163bfe8c-7fb7-5739-86d2-179a0358d7e2

Responsibility of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/09/archives/responsibility-of-telegraph-companies.html,Responsibility of,"A verdict was rendered in our Court of Common Pleas, on Saturday, which establishes, so far as that court is concerned, a principle of marked importance in regard to the liability of Telegraph Companies for the accuracy of their dispatches. It seems that a firm telegraphed to their agents here to sell 500 shares of Southern Michigan stock at the Morning Board, and buy 500 Hudson in the afternoon. The word ""Hudson"" was omitted in the dispatch, and 500 Southern Michigan were bought. The result was a heavy loss to the parties who had given the order and this loss was directly due to the mistake in the transmission of the dispatch. The result was a verdict in favor of the claimants, thus establishing the principle that Telegraphic Companies are responsible, like other common carriers, for the accuracy with which they transmit the messages intrusted to them. These companies have hitherto claimed exemption from this responsibility, but we see no reason in justice, as we are very glad to find there is none in law, for according it. A blunder like the one which led to this suit may involve very serious losses, and there should certainly be responsibility for it somewhere, not only as a matter of justice, but to prevent their occurrence. If Telegraph Companies find that their errors involve no penalty, they will employ operators of inferior capacity on the ground of economy, and, indeed, the extent to which this is now done is one of the most serious defects of the Telegraph system. It this decision is sustained by the higher courts it will improve that system as well as protect the public.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RESPONSIBILITY OF TELEGRAPH COMPANIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RESPONSIBILITY OF TELEGRAPH COMPANIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b67d924-7f03-5f29-a1f8-a1cdc048de56,277,nyt://article/3b67d924-7f03-5f29-a1f8-a1cdc048de56

To a certain degree this is true. The market for securities and exchange is the best possible indication of the public feeling, but not of the wisest public judgment. Capital, in seeking investments, or speculation in trading in them, must of necessity be influenced by fancy and feeling, for these two imponderable elements enter into the very estimates of their value. The stock market is always, and must be, sensitive to every breath of public feeling. There is no place in New-York where the airy sprites of caprice and imagination have such unlimited sway as in Wall and William streets. In such localities, a feeling propagates itself with amazing rapidity, and whether it be fear or hope, the results are constantly far disproportioned to realities.

"A NOBLE ACT -- DR.

In the City of Brooklyn, at No. 171 Jay-street, live two sisters, one of whom is a widow, the other single. Not being blessed with a plethora of this world's goods, but, on the contrary, less than usually fails to the share of individuals in general, they were solely dependent on their hard earnings for their daily support. This was all very good until ill health, caused from catarrh, overtook the elder, compelling her many days to remain at home from work. Physicians in vain were sought, all trying, but none effecting any good. Soon that most loathsome and insidious disease showed that it had also laid its ruthless hand on the younger sister. As a natural consequence, her constitution began to break down, and now came the time when she also was compelled to cease from work many days. In the meantime the elder sister had grown worse, the disease having settled on her lungs. Like her elder sister, the younger, whose name is Miss CLARK, tried every one and everything in vain. So reduced had her constitution become that many weeks she would not be able to work more than one day during the week. When we consider the state in which the other sister's health was, and that they had no friends or relations to help them, their position could have been anything but enviable.

WADSWORTH's death excites feelings of intense regret everywhere. There has been no instance in this war of a more high-toned surrender of comfort, fortune and life itself to principle, than that afforded in his career. Possessed of enormous wealth, occupying the highest social position attainable in this country, accustomed to a life of ease and personal enjoyment, shunning political position, and content always with discharging worthily the duties of a private citizen, he joined the army when the war broke out, because he believed the cause of the Union to be the highest and noblest in which the sword was ever drawn, and because he could not sit at ease, in his own house, while leaving others to fight the battle of his man liberty and republican government. He sought no official position, asked for no command, but attached himself to the Staff of Gen. MCDOWELL, anxious only to make himself useful and to contribute something to the triumph of the Union cause. At the first battle of Bull Run he had a horse shot under him, and behaved with conspicuous and serviceable gallantry. He discharged all the duties afterwards assigned him, with conscientious care and fidelity, -- devoting himself to the comfort of his men, living himself in the humblest and plainest manner, seeking no promotion, and complaining of nothing but the enforced inactivity which seemed to be wasting life and treasure without result.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'General Wadsworth.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'General Wadsworth.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58d546fd-7c00-59ae-b143-c59a2456bc7b,750,nyt://article/58d546fd-7c00-59ae-b143-c59a2456bc7b

John","The death of this gallant soldier will cause a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the country. His fortunes had been so long allied with the Army of the Potomac, and his career so distinguished for gallantry and efficiency, that ""Uncle JOHN,"" as he was universally known among the troops, was almost an essential to the well-being of that army. He was a native of Connecticut, graduated at West Point high in his class, served with distinction and honor for many years in the regular army, and at the outbreak of the war was, we believe, Colonel of the Fourth Regular Cavalry. He was among the early appointments to the position of Brigadier-General, and commanded a brigade, and subsequently a division, of troops, succeeding Gen. STONE on the upper Potomac, in the Fall and Winter of 1861-2. His command joined the Army of the Potomac when MCCLELLAN moved to the Peninsula, and the division was assigned to the corps of Gen. SAMNER. This division he commanded with distinguished success, up to the battle of Antietam, where he was wounded. Upon his recovery he was again assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and commanded the Ninth Army Corps for a short time, in the winter of 1863, and then succeeded Gen. SMITH in the command of the Sixth Corps, which he exercised with great ability up to the day of his death, participating in the second assault upon Fredericksburgh, the battle of Gettysburgh, the advance upon Mine Run, and the late desperate battle in the Wilderness, only to lose his life at the hands of a murderous sharpshooter, instead of falling, as he would have chosen to fall, in the heat of battle, inspiring his men by a brilliant example. To no one will his death come with deeper sorrow than to his command, who loved him, and the avenging arm of the noble Sixth Corps will strike surer and swifter blows upon the tottering rebellion as they remember the fall of their brave leader.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Maj.-Gen.

But the movements of great hostile armies, whether in retreat or in pursuit, are under conditions very different from those which govern a foot-race.

In all classes, it is the wife or daughter who determines the style of the home and the general rate of expenditure. The men are sufficiently extravagant and waste money enough, but it is not generally in social expenses. The furniture, the dress and ornament of women and children, the number of servants, the style of living -- all those little things which make up a great deal of the expense of a household -- are legislated on and settled by the weaker sex.

Now, however, no such distinction is made; and ""foreign Governments,"" without exception, come in for his bitterest maledictions.

The contest was mainly one of endurance. Gen. LEE attempted at once his customary tactics, which must now be perfectly familiar to our Generals, of massing and throwing his forces on the exposed portions of our line, trusting to mere weight of numbers to break through, and thus to force back the whole army. It is a very expensive system for the attacking party, but may be worth the loss of men and the wear and tear of vital force in an army. Gen. LEE tried it, with such a corps-commander as he has not now, Stonewall JACKSON, at Gaines' Mill, and produced the effect he desired. Again, in a battle, in which his army was probably more exposed to destruction than it has ever been since -- Chancellorsville -- he tried it with terrible result. It must be remembered that such grand attacks may break and put hors du combat only a comparatively small portion of a large army.

He died shortly after amputation had been performed -- his last words the request, ""Turn me over that I may die with my face to the enemy.""

Admiral Porter's Report,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/13/archives/the-red-river-fleet.html,Admiral Porter's Report,"The interest which attaches to the late operations -- unfortunate though they were -- on the Red River, will insure for Admiral PORTER's report, which appears in other columns, a general perusal. It will strike most readers, however, that the amount of labor, in the first place, wasted in attempting to recover the steamer Eastport, after her sinking by a torpedo, and the amount of space given in his report to details of the attempted recovery of the vessel, are out of proportion to the importance of the subject. We do not need a column of argument to convince us that such experienced and careful officers as Commander PHELPS and his superior in this ill-starred expedition did everything that was possible, not only to save the Eastport, but also to bring back as many of the smaller fry of vessels as possible. What we are chiefly interested in is to procure additional light on the point of non-cooperation between the naval and land forces, on the apparent absence of any sufficient prearrangement to meet or provide against the obstructions in the river or on its banks, and on the seeming neglect to reckon on a dearth of the water necessary to float such craft as were employed in the expedition. On these points we have some light thrown in this report -- if not exactly all that the public crave for. But we have no explanation intelligible to ordinary readers of naval and military history, of the circumstance that for many days there was no communication between the fleet and the army, or of the fact that the latter was sometimes marching forty miles a day when the Admiral supposed it was marching but twenty. Nor do we see why Admiral PORTER should deem it necessary in this report to deprecate public censure upon the Red River operations, by appealing to Providence not to desert his cause and ""permit the fleet to be sacrificed when it has so well performed its part in what should have been a complete success."" The public have no desire either to prejudge or to condemn the fleet or its brave Commander. They only seek to find a reasonable cause for unanticipated failure.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RED RIVER FLEET.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE RED RIVER FLEET.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5997b117-b8cb-5b68-9992-22cfdb674f01,368,nyt://article/5997b117-b8cb-5b68-9992-22cfdb674f01

The Evacuation of Frederics,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/13/archives/the-danes-and-their-maiden-city.html,The Evacuation of Frederics,"-- There is probably less significance, in a military point of view, than at first sight appears in the report, which comes to us this morning by the Africa, that the stronghold of Fredericia, had been evacuated by the Danes. The place, it is true, has a traditional interest from its successful resistance of hostile attacks in repeated sieges. In the present case, its capacity for defence does not seem to have been put to the test; the Danes probably considering it not only a hopeless task to make another stand within intrenched works after the surrender of the Dannewerke and the fort of Duppel, but an equally needless and unprofitable waste of strength, in view of the conference negotiations in London. After their losses at Duppel, their present fighting force in the field is probably under 30,000. But were it twice as much, no friendly counselor would advise Denmark to prolong the unequal contest, after having taken her seat in the conference. Upon her allied enemies must henceforth rest the responsibility of causing needless bloodshed, if the invasion should be prosecuted beyond the Provincial frontier. Unless the international council in London is to be a mockery alike of reason and of right, the intervening delegates of the three great neutral Powers will see to it, that at this point -- if no formal armistice shall be proclaimed -- at least a truce shall practically be called, while the preliminaries of the proposed arbitration are under consideration.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DANES AND THEIR MAIDEN CITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DANES AND THEIR MAIDEN CITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/75f5f93e-9d1a-594b-a6ba-1e0db0d09b73,334,nyt://article/75f5f93e-9d1a-594b-a6ba-1e0db0d09b73

After some opposition, the message was received and ordered to be printed in the minutes. The Mayor also transmitted the resolution of the commissioners of Health, recommending that the ordinance prohibiting bone-boiling establishments within the City limits be amended to include fat-boiling establishments. The message was referred to the Committee on Board of Health. The Comptroller was directed to furnish the House of the Refuge 3,000 loads of manure. A resolution was adopted directing the Comptroller to set apart rooms in the Police Court-house on fifty-seventh-street, for the use of the Seventh District Justice's Court, now located in Eighty-sixth-street. The Comptroller reported that for the fortnight ending April 30, 13,498 families, comprising 34,099 persons, were relieved from the Volunteer Family Aid Fund, at an expense of $61,174. The fund was then overdrawn $82,810 90. The resolution adopted by the Aldermen, setting apart a portion of the Central Park for a division parade ground for the military, was discussed. The board refused to call upon the Central Park Commissioners for information on the subject, or to ask the opinion of the Corporation Counsel as to the powers of the Common Council in the premises, and finally refused to concur with the Aldermen in adopting the resolution.

"-- But few works on surgery contain a more interesting or remarkable case than the following: MATTHEW PHENIX, Co. B, Eighty-sixth New-York Volunteers, was wounded, by a spent ball, in the left eye, at Mine Run, on the 27th day of November, 1863. He was brought to the Baptist Church hospital, in this City, on the 4th day of December, 1863, where his wound was probed by Dr. C.P. BIGELOW, surgeon in charge, who failed to discover the locality of the ball. He remained in the hospital some time, experiencing occasional pain, but all the time his general health was improving. The wound was frequently probed by Dr. BIGELOW, but without any better result than at the first trial. About the first of March last, his general health being very good, he was granted a furlough for forty days. At the expiration of that time he returned, and soon began to complain quite frequently of severe pain form his wound. The wound was again probed, and some pieces of dead bone taken from his eye and the roof of his mouth. On Saturday last, in examining the wound again with a probe, Dr. BIGELOW discovered the locality of the ball, which seemed to be resting immediately over the pallet of the mouth or throat. Inserting his ball forceps, he found he could not grasp it, and, after repeated efforts, he concluded to wait until Sunday morning, when it was his intention to separate the bone on each side of the eye, by which means it was thought the ball could be easily taken out. Early on Sunday morning a messenger aroused the Doctor, and informed him that PHENIX was choking to death. He at once repaired to the hospital, where he found the patient in the condition stated. He soon discovered that the ball had been moved from its original bed a little lower down, and unless immediately removed must produce suffocation. He inserted his forceps and extracted it without the least difficulty, giving instant relief to his patient. The ball was a grape shot (iron,) one and a half inches in diameter, and about four inches in circumference, and weighs but a fraction less than hall a pound. To any one but a surgeon this story would seem somewhat miraculous, but truth sometimes is even stranger than fiction. PHENIX is still at the above hospital, and from all appearances the carrying of a cannon ball in his head for five months has but slightly impaired his health, and got shortened his days in the least. -- Alexandria Sentinel, May [???].",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/14/archives/a-remarkable-case.html,,"-- But few works on surgery contain a more interesting or remarkable case than the following: MATTHEW PHENIX, Co.

Inserting his ball forceps, he found he could not grasp it, and, after repeated efforts, he concluded to wait until Sunday morning, when it was his intention to separate the bone on each side of the eye, by which means it was thought the ball could be easily taken out. Early on Sunday morning a messenger aroused the Doctor, and informed him that PHENIX was choking to death. He at once repaired to the hospital, where he found the patient in the condition stated. He soon discovered that the ball had been moved from its original bed a little lower down, and unless immediately removed must produce suffocation. He inserted his forceps and extracted it without the least difficulty, giving instant relief to his patient. The ball was a grape shot (iron,) one and a half inches in diameter, and about four inches in circumference, and weighs but a fraction less than hall a pound. To any one but a surgeon this story would seem somewhat miraculous, but truth sometimes is even stranger than fiction. PHENIX is still at the above hospital, and from all appearances the carrying of a cannon ball in his head for five months has but slightly impaired his health, and got shortened his days in the least. -- Alexandria Sentinel, May [???].",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A REMARKABLE CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A REMARKABLE CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cda7977c-88d0-51a3-8fc1-78c0dd3cedb2,431,nyt://article/cda7977c-88d0-51a3-8fc1-78c0dd3cedb2

French Alliance--What it Costs England,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/15/archives/what-the-french-alliance-costs-england.html,French Alliance--What it Costs England,"Unless the alliance of France has become indispensable to the very existence of England, her rulers are paying a rather exorbitant price for it. The arrangement of the differences between the Danes and the Germans may be an extremely important matter, but if British statesmen cannot accomplish it without French aid, and if French aid cannot be obtained save on terms incompatible with British honor and interests, would it not be better for England's Ministers to decline altogether the acceptance of NAPOLEON'S conditions, and to leave Danes and Germans to settle their differences themselves? There can be no more convincing proof of the high tribute which the British Government have to pay for the French Emperor's good will, than the fact that they are ashamed to acknowledge it. Such an admission, on their part, is not necessary, since their deeds proclaim more expressively than could words the disgraceful nature of the contract. There was a time when England respected the laws of hospitality, and the rights of her people -- when the exile was secure within her borders, and thought and speech were free as air. But now these things would almost seem to be changed. To conciliate an imperious ally, if all the evidence does not deceive us, the reigning Ministry of England have recently stooped to drive from her shores, by ungenerous pressure, a man whom they had just received as an honored guest; and still more recently, through anxiety to please this upstart arbiter of European destinies, they have ventured to perpetrate an outrage of deeper dye.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What the French Alliance Costs England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What the French Alliance Costs England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/04439819-17ba-5d76-9c1b-b170e11463b9,602,nyt://article/04439819-17ba-5d76-9c1b-b170e11463b9

Circumstances, independently of his actual merits, have cooperated with them to bring him prominently before the general public and the class who do not usually trouble themselves with linguistic and archaeological discussions. Persecution has operated in his favor with all inhabitants of free countries, and by stimulating curiosity as to his opinions, has increased the number of his readers and widened the circle of his influence. He is known to lie under the Papal anathema, and to be the object of the most bitter and rancorous attacks of its ministers, in numbers exceeding the capacity of the most patient bibliographers to keep count of. While thus exposed as a mark or target for the hostility of every private champion of orthodoxy, the same subtle power that inspires their assaults has been working in high places, and, through the Imperial Government of France, causes the sudden suspension of his official functions as Professor in the College of France, merely for the exercise of a customary freedom of investigation distasteful in its results to the ecclesiastical mind. This arbitrary state of suspension still continues, and the enforced leisure it affords him has been turned to account by M.

Railroads and Cruelty to Animals,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/15/archives/the-city-railroads-and-cruelty-to-animals.html,Railroads and Cruelty to Animals,"There is ample room in New-York for the labors of a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Not infrequently crippled, diseased, and worn-out horses may be seen lashed into service altogether above their strength, by unfeeling drivers, or dragged in the last stage of life, bruised and bleeding, to the side of the public street, to gasp out in needless pain their little remaining breath. One can understand how a class of reckless, greedy, unfeeling cartmen may thus use the faithful brutes that have earned their masters' meat and drink, for there is a class of human beings with whom cruelty to the brute creation seems to be as elaborately cultivated as if it were one of the fine arts. But we may well express astonishment that the same indifference to brute suffering which tempts men to abuse and treat unmercifully the most useful and noble of all domestic animals, should be found to have possession of many whose moral attributes are otherwise acknowledged. Let us leave out of account the crowds of thoughtless, reckless lads who club for a holiday ride, and who may always be met with on Sunday on some suburban road making the most of their carriage experience for the day by a steady pounding of the unconscious brute that drags them along -- regardless alike of his ability or willingness to make a reasonable pace. The owners of the animals thus abused are more to blame than the brainless pleasure-seekers, who are incapable probably by their very constitution of knowing either what cruelty really means, or what treatment is reasonable and just toward a horse or any other living animal. The people we speak of want sensibility, and in too many cases it is with them a native and constitutional want which partakes of the nature of total depravity, and for which there is probably no earthly remedy.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The City Railroads and Cruelty to Animals.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The City Railroads and Cruelty to Animals.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/82665736-fca7-5b6e-9f36-aadd55ef7848,643,nyt://article/82665736-fca7-5b6e-9f36-aadd55ef7848

It was maintained that the crushing of the rebellion did not depend so much upon science as upon promptitude and energy; and the slow progress made was, with considerable plausibility, attributed to the precise and stiff habits of mind that are so apt to be superinduced by book training. It became a sort of popular demand that some, at least, of the leaders should be taken fresh from the people, and should be allowed to operate with all the popular fire and energy. Thus, PATTERSON, BANKS, BUTLER, FREMONT, SICKLES, MCCOOK, LEWIS WALLACE, MCCLERNAND, PRENTISS, SHIELDS, CARL SCHURZ, and other civilians of less note, were made Major-Generals. It is curious to note the result of that popular delusion.

The dispatches from Gen. GRANT come up to Saturday morning at 6 1/2 o'clock. During that day the advance of HANCOCK developed the fact that the rebel army had fallen back four miles. There was no engagement during Friday, and the department has no intelligence of any general officer having been killed in the terrible engagement of Thursday. During Friday night an important manoeuvre was made in sending the Fifth and Sixth Corps to our left, and an attack was to have been made at daylight, but no sound of battle was heard during Saturday at either Belle Plain or Fredericksburgh, and it is therefore supposed that LEE had retreated still further. The movement and attack, had they been successful, would have placed our army is LEE's rear, and compelled his retreat upon Lynchburgh instead of Richmond. Some definite idea of the losses inflicted on the rebels may be gathered from the additional fact, stated in Mr. STANTON's first dispatch, that over 7,000 prisoners, including 400 officers, with Maj.-Gen.

The most singular part of the proceedings is that not only have the Islands, which are a great source of revenue to the Peruvian Government, been seized as a guarantee for the redress sought by Spain for certain grievances, alleged to have been suffered by Spanish citizens of Peru, but the Spanish Admiral, in his abrupt announcement of the seizure, states that he has also retained, as hostages, several officers of the Peruvian Navy, who are to be held answerable for any insult offered to Spanish subjects. One of the immediate difficulties, which preceded this summary action, appears to have arisen from the circumstance, that the Government of Peru refused to enter into negotiations with a Spanish official bearing the title of ""Commissioner,"" which is the rank and designation in Spain of a Colonial Agent of the Home Government. As Peru has never been recognized by Spain as an independent State, it was probably deemed unnecessary to deal with the country on terms different from a colony. But the Peruvians refused to see the matter in this light, and the high-handed act of Admiral PINZON intervened, leaving this question of national dignity unsettled.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17b38c2c-37da-538b-b267-424007b154be,375,nyt://article/17b38c2c-37da-538b-b267-424007b154be

It has been called to discuss a point which has always been supposed to be very dear to the female heart-dress. Yet it has always been said that women dress to please the men; and when we of the sterner sex ask them for the sake of the Union to appear in a simple dress, becoming to an American women at this crisis, they will appear more lovely in our eyes than if they were decked in all the splendor of royalty.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANTI-LUXURY CONVENTION.; Meeting of Ladies at the Cooper Union.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/18/archives/gen-wadsworths-body-particulars-of-the-finding-of-the-remains.html,,"Surgeon W.J. MCDERMOTT, of the Sixty-sixth Regiment New-York Volunteers, who arrived in this City yesterday from Fredericksburgh, gives some interesting particulars concerning the recovery of Gen. WADSWORTH'S body, and the removal of a large number of our wounded from the rebel lines, after the first great battle in the Wilderness. He states that pursuant to an order issued by Gen. HANCOCK before the fight, several Surgeons were detailed to remain with the wounded, in the event of its becoming necessary to leave them behind. After the fight, and on the morning of the eighth instant, this order was complied with, in consequence of Gen. GRANT's ordering Gen. HANCOCK to move his division to the left. This manoeuvre resulted in twelve hundred of our wounded being left in an improvised hospital in the Wilderness, at the Stephen's House, near the plank road running from Fredericksburgh, and within the enemy's lines. On the 9th instant, a portion of Gens. ROSSES and GORDON's rebel cavalry under command of Capt. BORDEN, First Regiment North Carolina, took possession of twelve hundred of our wounded at this hospital, besides a large number of their own, which had fallen into our hands after the first day's battle. The rebels, immediately after taking possession of the hospital, removed six ambulances filled with their wounded to their hospital near LONGSTREET's headquarters. Dr. BROCK, of Richmond, superintended the removal of the rebel wounded, and extended such courtesies to our surgeons as the circumstances would allow. Surgeons GEORGE L. POTTER, One Hundred and forty-fifth Pennsylvania; _____ KILSEY, Sixty-fourth New York; W.J. MCDERMOTT, Sixty-sixth New-York and W. O'MAHEE, Sixty-ninth New-York, were immediately paroled. Capt. CAMPBELL and Lieut. SAVAGE, One Hundred and eighty-third Pennsylvania, were also released on parole. On the 12th inst., while our paroled officers were still within the enemy's lines a flag of truce, accompanied by wagons for our wounded, under command of Capt. WRIGHT, of the Fifty-seventh New-York, acting Provost-Marshal of Fredericksburgh arrived at the hospital. An interview was had between Capt. WRIGHT and the rebel Capt. BORDEN, who consented to the removal of our wounded. In the conversation between these two officers, Capt. BORDEN informed Capt. WRIGHT where Gen. WADSWORTH's body was buried, describing exactly the place of interment. He stated that it was near LONGSTREET's general hospital, on the Fredericksburgh plank road, about five miles distant from the first day's fight; that a man, by the name of STRIKER, whom Gen. WADSWORTH had befriended in Washington since the beginning of the war, asked, permission of Gen. LEE to bury the body, which was granted, and by order of Gen. LEE a coffin was made of doors, in which the body was placed. Our paroled officers accompanied a train of our wounded to Fredericksburgh. On the 13th inst. a flag of truce, under Capt. MIDDLETON, of the Fifty-seventh New-York, returned to the hospital in the Wilderness for the balance of our wounded left in the enemy's hands. Capt. MIDDLETON, guided by the information received from the rebel Capt. BORDEN, proceeded with a wagon to make search for the body. On the 14th he had found the place of interment, encountering but few rebels, none of whom seemed disposed to molest him on his mission. These are the last advices received from Capt. MIDDLETON through Surgeon MCDERMOTT, who states that there is but little doubt that the body of Gen. WADSWORTH is now in Fredericksburgh or en route for Washington.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

In reply to a question in regard to the present military prospect, Mr. LINCOLN, with that peculiar smile which he always puts on when about to tell a good story, said: ""Well, sir, your question reminds me of a little anecdote about the automaton chess-player, which many years ago astonished the world by its skill in that game.

They were over a thousand bayonets strong; and there never marched to the field a thousand men braver, prouder, more intelligent and patriotic. Since that 2d of June, 1861, the Seventy-ninth Regiment have done an amount of soldierly service in varied and distant fields and campaigns that seem almost incredible. In Virginia, in South Carolina, in Maryland, in Mississippi, in Tennessee, in Kentucky, and again in Virginia, it has campaigned. It has served under MCDOWELL, MCCLELLAN, POPE and HUNTER; under BURNSIDE in Virginia, and under BURNSIDE in Tennessee. It has served under Brig.-Gen. GRANT, while he commanded at Vicksburgh; under Major-Gen. GRANT while he commanded in Tennessee; and under Lieut.-Gen. GRANT in his late operations in Virginia. It fought at the first Bull Run, at the second Bull Run, at the bloody battles of James Island, at South Mountain and Antietam, at Fredericksburgh, at Vicksburgh and Jackson, at Knoxville and at the Wilderness.

It not only made war upon its enemies, but set up a procrustean bed for its friends, and smote without mercy every one of them who did not touch its extremist mark. There is a set of Anti-Slavery men who exhibit too much of this same spirit, and are doing quite as much in their way to hurt the cause they mean to support. They are not content to let alone the causes that are fast securing the entire abolition of Slavery, but insist upon clogging them with other questions which have no legitimate connection with them.

"THEODORE ALLEN, against whom a large number of complaints have been made within the last few months, was taken into custody yesterday by Officer S. BURNS, detective in Gen. HAY's office. The arrest was made pursuant to instructions from Gen. DIX, in command of this Department. The charges against him are, that he, in connection with others, is guilty of swindling soldiers who were recruited at Lafayette Hall, in Broadway, out of large portions of their bounty money. Gen. DIX issued orders for his apprehension some time since. ALLEN, in some way learned the fact that officials were in search of him, left the City, went to Philadelphia and thence to Wilmington, where he remained several weeks. Recently he returned and yesterday, it was ascertained that he was stopping with his wife at a house on the corner of Mercer and Spring streets. Officer BURNS went there accompanied of Officer CARROLL of the Twenty-seventh Precinct Police. When BURNS went up to him and told him he was a prisoner by order of Gen. DIX, ALLEN drew a pistol with his left hand, and attempted to shoot. Fortunately the pistol missed fire. Fearing another shot, Officer CARROLL caught the pistol, and the prisoner was taken across Broadway. There a rescue was attempted by some of ALLEN's friends who are well known to the police. When near the corner of Broadway and West Houston-street, they were compelled to put hand-cuffs on the prisoner. While doing so some of ALLEN'S friends stood on the opposite side of the way, with pistols cocked and pointed ready to shoot Officers BURNS and DEPUE, United States Detectives, and Policeman CARROLL. But for the timely appearance of Police Detectives KELSOE and RADFORD, who, seeing the condition of things, drew their own revolvers, and pointed them at ALLEN's friends, thereby holding them at bay until the handcuffs were on, and the prisoner placed in a Broadway omnibus which was chartered for the purpose of conveying him to his destination, the affair might have termination seriously for the officers. He was taken to the office of Gen.

Shakespeare Tercentenary in London; A Political Meeting Stopped by Police,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/19/archives/the-shakespeare-tercentenary-in-england-failure-of-the-celebration.html,Shakespeare Tercentenary in London; A Political Meeting Stopped by Police,"On Saturday, a very feeble, and under almost all its aspects, a most ridiculous attempt was made to celebrate the birthday of our great poet, by what was called in the handbills a ""Working Men's Shakespeare Jubilee and Great National Festival."" To say that it was not a ""jubilee"" nor a ""great national festival"" would not only be to tell the public exactly what they expect, for their recent experiences of SHAKESPEARE Committees has led to a most judicious distrust of their plans over turning out anything but the reverse of what their concocters originally wished or intended. It was not a Working Men's Jubilee, for the precession, all told, did not include 500 members, who were of the usual idle stock of banner-bearers, or the harmless idiots who, in green velvet and feathers and point, will insist -- as on the occasion of GARIBALDI's entry -- on exhibiting their lunacy before the gaze of hundreds. So far from being a national festival, it was not even a local one, and the pathetic entreaties of the handbills inviting the cooperation of ""benefit and trade societies, brass bands, corporate bodies, foreign workmen, and the poet's admirers,"" fell on reluctant and unsympathetic ears, as far as compliance with these adjurations was concerned. So also did the request ""that householders along the line of route would give effect to the scene by the display of flags and by the ringing of the bells in the various parish churches in order that the day might be made as it ought,"" &c. Not a flag was shown except the time-worn and now rather illegible banners brought by the few processionists themselves; not a bell was rung, and the procession was constantly reminded that it was not a national holiday by having to open its thin ranks for the passage of prosaic carts and 'busses, in fact it was a dull and tame affair throughout, and nothing so much redeemed its dullness as its general tone of absurdity. The demonstration ""fell through,"" as our American cousins say, for want of some living principle, some motive power, greater than the mere accident of a tercentenary. Notwithstanding this 200th anniversary, SHAKESPEARE is not a whit more admired this year than he was last year, or will be next year, and though nations may go to war for an idea, and do so, if the truth were known, much more often than is generally admitted, yet a jubilee for an idea, or a procession for an idea, seems, after Saturday's experience, to be out of the question.",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY IN ENGLAND.; Failure of the Celebration in London--Planting of an Oak on Primrose Hill--A Wretched Looking Crowd--Travesty of the Ceremonies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY IN ENGLAND.; Failure of the Celebration in London--Planting of an Oak on Primrose Hill--A Wretched Looking Crowd--Travesty of the Ceremonies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, April 25', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'April', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3f40d017-7407-55c7-b46e-06d8060002e8,2381,nyt://article/3f40d017-7407-55c7-b46e-06d8060002e8

"About 5 o'clock, yesterday morning, while Officer ROBERT THOMPSON, of the Eighteenth Precinct, was patroling his beat, near the corner of Third-avenue and Twenty-second-street, he was accosted by a stranger, who stated to the officer that his hat had just been stolen by a gang of roughs on the next block.

Blackguardism in House,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/20/archives/blackguardism-in-the-house.html,Blackguardism in House,"While our soldiers are bareing their breasts to the storm of war, with a heroism that makes all true men proud to be their countrymen, the representatives of the people are besliming the American name with their unclean tongues. No decent man can read the scurrility bandied in the sitting of yesterday without shame. Though but a meagre outline of it is reported, it excites absolute disgust. It passes comprehension how gentlemen -- and we know there are some in the body -- could sit so quietly, and endure the exhibition in all its foul reality. Talk of purging the House by the expulsion of ALEXANDER LONG! ALEXANDER LONG is Hyperion himself in comparison with the members who, at such a time as this, can indulge in such mutual abuse. Fallacious as were his arguments, disloyal as were his sentiments, LONG in no wise infringed upon the dignity of the House. His words were the words of a gentleman. They were words that could be neutralized by sober reason, and leave no stain. The feeling they aroused was pure and generous indignation, which is a feeling essentially healthful and invigorating. They sickened no man with disgust. Men could listen to what he said and breathe freely -- could sternly rejoice even that it gave truth one more chance to grapple with error. But no such sensation is possible in such a commingling of filthy spite as that of yesterday -- Yahoo with Yahoo. The only effect is unmixed, overpowering loathing. The House ought to have purged itself on the spot. No silencing could have been too summary, no rebuke too severe. If the House has no care for its own dignity, it at least has no moral right to allow such ribaldry to be thrust upon the people, who have a sense of the requirements of civilized society, and whose hearts are now less than ever in a frame to abide the outrage patiently. Black-guards are never so intolerable as when solemnity should rule the hour.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Blackguardism in the House.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Blackguardism in the House.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/044779de-8e51-5b23-9079-d6ea4d65010e,336,nyt://article/044779de-8e51-5b23-9079-d6ea4d65010e

"The fast and famous paddle-wheel steamer Kin Kiang, Capt. TAYLOR, from New-York on the 10th of February, arrived at Table Bay (Cape of Good Hope) on the 26th of March, making the voyage in five weeks. Some interesting incidents of her arrival we gather from the African Advertiser and Mail, of the 26th of March. She came into the anchorage ground in Table Bay and was passing Monille Point with the American flag flying at her mast-head, while the rebel privateer Alabama was starting out. Capt. TAYLOR and his officers at first thought the Alabama was an English gunboat. But they soon found out their mistake when they saw the rebel colors at her peak. The Kin Kiang, however, passed into the anchorage while the Alabama steamed away to sea. It will thus be seen that the Kin Kiang had a narrow escape; for although she would have easily distanced the Alabama in a straight race, she would have had no chance for taking to her heels had the two vessels, on their opposite courses, met a few miles out of the Bay, beyond the boundary-line of British maritime territory.

"Meyerbeer, Giacomo, the Composer",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/22/archives/death-of-meyerbeer.html,"Meyerbeer, Giacomo, the Composer","A telegram from Paris, dated May 2, brings the announcement of the death of MEYERBEER, the eminent German composer. The deceased was born in Berlin on the 5th of September, 1794, and consequently at the time of his death was nearly 70 years of age. As a child, he was extremely precocious' and his musical talent came to him so early that when only seven years old he was celebrated; and at nine, a German critic spoke of him as one of the best pianists of Berlin. Under less favorable circumstances, the lad would doubtless have been prematurely brought before the public as a prodigy, to contradict, perhaps, in manhood, the promises of his youth. But his father, JAMES BEER, a Jew banker, was very wealthy, and GIACOMO MEYERBEER, as the composer afterward called himself, italianizing his name, only appeared occasionally, principally at amateur concerts, and had plenty of opportunities afforded him for study. With what result he availed himself of them, is known throughout the world. MEYERBEER did not however, at once obtain a high position in music. His first opera, ""Jeptha's Daughter,"" was represented at Munich, in 1812, with but indifferent success, but the numerous works he afterward produced, and which extended over nearly the whole range of musical composition, secured for him a wide reputation, and proved that his talents were of no common order. Of these productions the ""Crociato in Egitto,"" produced in Venice, in 1825, may be said to have laid the foundation of his European fame. In 1831 be produced his grand work, ""Robert the Devil,"" and henceforth MEYERBEER was recognized as a master. The ""Huguenots"" followed in 1836, and the ""Prophete"" in 1849, both operas at once taking that commanding position on the lyric stage which they have ever since maintained. ""L'Etoile du Nord,"" a work in a different style, but distinguished by the same charm of genius, followed in 1854, and the ""Pardon de Ploermel"" still more recently. It has long been known that the deceased composer had finished another work, ""I'Africaine,"" and that his scrupulous and perhaps fastidious anxiety to secure for it a satisfactory interpretation has alone kept it from the public. Its production may now, it is to be presumed, he looked for at no distant date.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Meyerbeer.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Meyerbeer.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11ed951f-c0c7-532d-a5d4-b263df379557,378,nyt://article/11ed951f-c0c7-532d-a5d4-b263df379557

MCCLELLAN what he wanted, in order that in case GRANT was defeated, MCCLELLAN might be able ""to certify"" that it was not GRANT's fault, but that of the mud, the rivers, or something. GRANT was to fight the battles, and MCCLELLAN was to invent the excuses. The writer gravely assured us that nothing short of a manifesto, under Little Mac's sign manual, would satisfy the Copperhead public that if GRANT were defeated, he was defeated en regle. Now, we have no doubt whatever, that it would have been very agreeable to Maj.-Gen. GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN to be in a position in which he could again get up a wrangle with Mr. STANTON, and lecture Mr. LINCOLN upon his policy; but we believe Gen. GRANT considers himself as well able to concoct his own excuses as to fight his own battles; so this superb suggestion never bore fruit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Buzfuz and His Friends.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Buzfuz and His Friends.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/71cee1f2-1297-553c-bf72-44caa69f40a1,704,nyt://article/71cee1f2-1297-553c-bf72-44caa69f40a1

If editors go home at three in the morning, leaving power in the hands of printers or other incompetent persons, to insert whatever comes into the office after that hour, they willfully incur a great risk; and if their incurring it results in the momentary conversion of the journal into a machine for attacks on the national credit and the public tranquillity, they must shoulder the responsibility.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Government and the Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Government and the Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/55628218-632b-5b10-aa3f-c54be3e285dc,843,nyt://article/55628218-632b-5b10-aa3f-c54be3e285dc

The news is only in part anticipated in the intelligence received by the Peruvian via Port au Basque. It is of much interest and importance. The London Conference, as was briefly reported by the Peruvian, had succeeded in obtaining an armistice, or rather a suspension of hostilities, to commence from the 12th of May, and to continue for one month. Previous to this arrangement, however, a collision had taken place between the naval squadrons of Austria and Denmark in the North Sea. The Austrians had two frigates and three gunboats engaged, and the Danes two frigates and a corvette. While the House of Commons was in session on the 9th, a telegram was received from the Governor of Heligoland, which reported that the Danes had defeated the Austrians; that one of the frigates of that Power was in flames, and the rest of the Austrian squadron was making for Heligoland. The announcement was received with loud cheers from all parts of the House, the occupants of the Strangers' Gallery joining heartily in the applause. The Daily News says: ""Government officials have been at Southampton inspecting some of the mail packets, to ascertain their fitness for war transports.

The first note of the batch is from the United States Vice-Consul at Havana, intimating that a cargo of negro slaves had been brought to Havana for sale, having been landed secretly from a steamship on some other part of the coast. In the transaction several wealthy persons were implicated. This note is dated Nov. 20, 1863. The next letter is from Mr. SEWARD, informing Lord LYONS of the contents of the Consul's note. This Lord LYONS acknowledges, and promises to inform his Government of the facts. On receiving his Government's reply, Lord LYONS again writes (Feb. 4, 1864,) conveying the thanks of Lord RUSSELL, and urging representations from the United States Government to that of Spain. Following these preliminary notes is a memoradum of the State Department, showing how faithfully the Captain-General of Cuba has executed the treaty agreements with the United States and England for the suppression of the slave trade. Two subsequent notes from Lord LYONS and Mr. SEWARD, respectively show that the Ministers of the two countries at Madrid were instructed to make representations to the Queen's Government as to the slave-trading practices at Cuba: and these instructions were promptly fulfilled. The United States Vice-Consul at Havanna, again writes to the State Department giving fuller particulars of the slaver described in his first note, and these particulars were handed to Lord LYONS. This was in the beginning of March last. On the 27th of March the Vice-Consul again writes to say, that he had an interview with the Captain-General of the island, who wished to ascertain if the United States authorities can return to this island the person of an officer of the Spanish army named Don JOSE AUGUSTIN ARGUELLES, who was believed to be in New-York.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Arguelle's Case.

It is well understood that Gen. SHERMAN began his movement from Chattanooga with a force so imposing and of such excellent fighting quality that nothing in the Southwestern rebel States could be expected to withstand it for a week. The positions held by the different portions of JOHNSTON's army were exceedingly strong, being often mountain passes where every advantage of nature was on their side. But the great superiority of number with SHERMAN enabled him to make flank movements with as heavy force as he kept in front of the enemy, and he has thus succeeded in turning all their positions in the mountains, and has now reached that part of the uplands of Georgia, where the country is open and rolling, and not so easily defended by small bodies of men.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Campaign in Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Campaign in Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d7dc80ff-d084-51ec-9eae-60a085a200fd,754,nyt://article/d7dc80ff-d084-51ec-9eae-60a085a200fd

Of these, the cases of personal injury number seventy-one -- the majority of complaints being registered by discomfited blockade runners. In going over the list we find that the latter class of injured innocents have steadily increased in each successive year. Thus in nine months of 1861 they numbered thirty-one; in 1862, sixty-three; in 1863, ninety-seven; and in the first quarter of 1864, ninety-six -- making in all, within three years, an aggregate loss to the British ""neutrality"" interest of two hundred and eighty-seven vessels, with their entire rig, machinery and cargoes. It is something awful to contemplate the combined and consolidated indignation of the blockade-running community represented in the grievance shelves of the British Foreign Office.

ANDREWS was yesterday tried in the United States Circuit Court before Judge NELSON, and resulted in the conviction of the accused, and his sentence to three years imprisonment in the State Penitentiary, exclusive of the term he has already undergone since his arrest. From the report of the trial it will be seen that the District-Attorney waived the count in the indictment charging ANDREWS with treason, and took up the charge of ""conspiring to levy war against the United States, and resisting the execution of the United States laws."" Of the six witnesses called to establish this charge, two (the Provost-Marshals of the Eighth and Ninth Districts,) gave no evidence whatever respecting ANDREWS; one witness was unable to identify the prisoner, and the remaining three testify exclusively to the fact of having seen and heard ANDREWS inciting the mob to resist the draft, to burn Government property, and to sack certain obnoxious newspaper offices. There is nothing whatever in the evidence relating to conspiracy. He appears on the scene, so far as the witnesses can tell us, while the crime was in course of perpetration, and not while it was being hatched. On the latter part of the count, therefore, the conviction must have been made to turn; and as the law determines that, ""when a felony has been committed in pursuance of a conspiracy, the latter merged in the former,"" we presume that the conviction would be found in any case to bear the strictest judicial revision, as being sufficiently in harmony with the evidence offered. The sentence of the court is lenient; but, we presume it is severe enough to mark the sense of the community on the nature of the crime, and to offer a warning to the heedless or the designing, who, in times of peril like these, venture to resist the laws or defy the Government.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONVICTION OF ANDREWS, THE RIOTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONVICTION OF ANDREWS, THE RIOTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edff2be7-d7b5-5f02-b37f-0b519a9672ce,317,nyt://article/edff2be7-d7b5-5f02-b37f-0b519a9672ce

"Piracy; Georgia, the, Admission to the Mersey, and British Govt.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/26/archives/harboring-privateers.html,"Piracy; Georgia, the, Admission to the Mersey, and British Govt.","-- The opposition offered by the Palmerston Government to Mr. BARING's motion in the House of Commons, relative to the admission of the pirate Georgia into the Mersey, presents no new principle in the policy heretofore pursued by Lord RUSSELL. The bona fides of Mr. BARING in bringing forward the case for Parliamentary discussion, is probably not open to question. But there have been numerous occasions, in the earlier stages of the war, when such a motion might have been offered with more practical effect. The Alabama, for instance, not only provisioning and refitting at the Cape, but actually taking a captured prize there for outfit as a pirate, offered a far more flagrant case for protest than the reappearance of the Georgia in the Mersey. And we must also remind our readers that on all party questions proper in the House of Commons, Mr. BARING's vote goes to sustain those political leaders who defend and applaud the LAIRDS -- the very head and front of the pirate interest in England. It will be cheerfully admitted that Mr. BARING, as a private member of Parliament, has been careful not to follow his party into the slough of rebel intrigue which surrounds the Carleton Club. But were Mr. BARING's party leaders in power, the ""neutrality"" of England, dubious and uncertain as it may sometimes be called now, would be shortly found to relax in favor of the rebels to an extent that would render war with this country all but an assured result. Mr. COBDEN naturally takes ground with Mr. BARING on the side of international equity; but Mr. COBDEN would barely venture to give a vote, however much in accordance with his conviction of what is due to this country, that might lead to an immediate overthrow of the men now in power. Low as may be his estimate of Lord RUSSELL's neutrality views, Mr. COBDEN knows too much to invite a party coup d'etat which would restore MALMESBURY to the Foreign Office and DERBY, to the Treasury. The position, then, as far as American interests are concerned, seems to give no immediate token of a change either in national policy or party leadership.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HARBORING PRIVATEERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HARBORING PRIVATEERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6cd914db-b4ea-5446-8509-d579a3854484,364,nyt://article/6cd914db-b4ea-5446-8509-d579a3854484

The object of the commission, as its name indicates, is to extend aid and comfort to those persons who seek refuge within our lines from the tyranny and distress prevailing in the rebel States. These refugees are counted by hundreds and thousands, and are generally in a condition of pitiable destitution. Many of them were prosperous and even wealthy before their noble and unswerving fidelity to the old flag drew down upon them the merciless vengeance of their rebel neighbors. Stripped of their property, driven from their homes, subjected to every species of persecution which rebel hatred could invent, they have made their way, as best they might, to seek the protection of the flag for which they have sacrificed everything but honor. Many who have been assisted by the Refugee Commission have had an experience of rebel cruelty, the mere recital of which sends a cold shudder to the heart. A lady, who, with her daughter, escaped from Southern Kentucky, said that her little boy, only 14 years old, was tied to a tree by a guerrilla band and shot at as a target, while his mother and sister were compelled to look on. An old man, of more than eighty years, who fought bravely during the last war with England, was taken by rebels, his hands tied behind his back and his feet tied together. He was then placed in a chair in front of the fire-place, with his feet resting on hot embers, which had been raked out upon the hearth. In this position he was left, utterly unable to move; and when, after a lapse of time, he was discovered by a neighbor, the bottoms of his feet were already burned to the bone!",9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Louisville Refugee Commission.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Louisville Refugee Commission.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/744ccc34-3934-5672-96da-6901828108e5,650,nyt://article/744ccc34-3934-5672-96da-6901828108e5

Dallozz's Speech; Dalloz, M., Speech on French Protectorate of Mexico","The spokesmen of the Imperial Government in the French Legislative body, do not even attempt to conceal the fact that Mexico is hereafter to be regarded as a permanent appanage or dependency of France. During the debate on the budget on the 10th inst., this view of the situation was brought out with a directness and force which is really instructive. M. DALLOZ, for instance, speaking for the Emperor's Government, elaborates a lengthy statement of the commercial advantages which will accrue to Europe from the substitution of French influence in Mexico for that of the United States. The effect of the partiality shown for this country by the Liberal party of the Mexican Republic is, he thinks, partly seen in the fact that for eighty French merchant ships touching at the chief Mexican ports, there have been five hundred vessels of the United States. From this day forth, however, he says, ""France will protect European commerce,"" which probably means -- if it means anything -- that the reactionary party, under French direction, will foster commercial intercourse with France, as against the Anti-European commercial policy of the late Juarez Government. M. DALLOZ, too, sees an ample justification for the French protectorate thus far, in the fact that there are in Mexico over 200,000 Frenchmen -- which includes, he might have added, the French army of occupation, and the army of functionaries sent over by the Emperor -- and he finds a recompense for the pecuniary burdens consequent on that protectorate, in the apocryphal statement that ""while California is sending, on an average, 160,000,000 francs in bullion yearly to New-York, and while double this amount may be obtained from Mexico, France and England have allowed the United States to appropriate to themselves that inexhaustible bank.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mexico as a Dependency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mexico as a Dependency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea70859f-ee7e-5c14-b9d2-ccae8e0c557e,661,nyt://article/ea70859f-ee7e-5c14-b9d2-ccae8e0c557e

The proposed amendment, however, does not interfere with the right heretofore extended to drafted persons to furnish substitutes. Viewed from the stand-point of military exigency, the new provision is justified on the theory that the commutation fee is altogether disproportionate to the value of a recruit ready found; and chiefly so, in taking into account the great element of time. For, those who do not choose to serve personally in the field become active and interested recruiting agents; and if the draft fails to bring the required number of men instantaneously into the field, it will bring at once to the aid of the War Department an army of recruiting agents bound (for good and sufficient personal reasons) to make the work go through.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW CONSCRIPTION BILL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW CONSCRIPTION BILL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-05-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3253f89f-493d-56fd-83c9-00ca05c67b37,192,nyt://article/3253f89f-493d-56fd-83c9-00ca05c67b37

We have no objection in the world to having the newsboys taught the Magna Charta, and having it posted on the Capitol in ""Latin, Saxon, English,"" and as many other languages as Mr. BROOKS and his confederates may think desirable, provided it is not done at the expense of the public. If it is considered by the Democratic party desirable that a knowledge of the Magna Charta should be more widely diffused, we would suggest that a ready way of attaining the object would be to circulate copies of it this Summer as a campaign document. This would, doubtless, be very damaging to the Administration, particularly the Latin and Saxon versions of it. Nor would we, were we in the place of the Democratic leaders, stop here. There are a variety of other documents which would, if judiciously distributed, cause Mr. LINCOLN's knees to shake with apprehension. The Saxon Chronicle, the Annals of the Four Masters, the Proclamation of Henry III., the Year Books, the State Trials, the Pragmatic Sanction, and the Edict of Nantes, are not half as well known, either to the newsboys or the rest of the community, as they ought to be; and the Democratic party will render the public an immense service by striking off a million copies or thereabouts of each of them, and selling them cheap or distributing them gratuitously this Summer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'News for the Newsboys.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'News for the Newsboys.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/98acc971-46db-5f6e-bdcc-75c8421a0c87,608,nyt://article/98acc971-46db-5f6e-bdcc-75c8421a0c87

GIDDINGS, Consul-General of the United States at Montreal, died suddenly at that city, at 10 o'clock yeterday evening. He was born at Athens, Penn., Oct. 6, 1795, but removed to Ohio when ten years of age. He served as a soldier in the war of 1812, when but 17 years of age. After the close of the war he studied law with Hon. ELISHA WHITTLESEY, and was admitted to the bar in 1820. He was a member of the Legislature of the State of Ohio in 1826, and in 1838 was elected to Congress as the successor of Mr. WHITTLESEY; here he was distinguished for his steady and determined opposition to Slavery and the Slave-trade. In 1841 an American vessel, the Creole, sailed from Virginia for New-Orleans with a cargo of 130 slaves; during the passage a revolt occurred, in which the slaves killed one man, took possession of the vessel, and entered the British port of Nassau. On the 21st of March, 1843, Mr. GIDDINGS offered in Congress a series of resolutions, declaring that Slavery was an abridgment of natural right, that the slaves in the Creole had violated no law of the United States in regaining their personal liberty, and that they were not legally liable to punishment. These resolutions brought down upon him the displeasure of the House, who, by a vote, severely condemned his conduct. Mr. GIDDINGS then instantly resigned his seat, but was immediately reelected, and resumed his seat, after an absence of only six weeks. His whole period of service in Congress was twenty-one years. He was a strong supporter of Gen. HARRISON and HENRY CLAY, but on Anti-Slavery grounds refused to support Gen. TAYLOR. In 1850 he was conspicuous for his opposition to the enactment of the ""compromise measures,"" especially the Fugitive Slave Law. In 1843 he wrote a series of political essays, signed ""Pacificus,"" and in 1858 ho compiled The Exiles of Florida. A volume of his speeches in Congress has also been published.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.; Death of Hon. Joshua R.

"Allen's, John, Engravings, Books,>amp;c.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/28/archives/literary-gossip.html,"Allen's, John, Engravings, Books,>amp;c.","-- The auction sale of Mr. JOHN ALLAN's library and collection of engravings, coins, &c., has occupied the evenings of the last two weeks, commencing with May 2, at the auction rooms of Messrs. BANGS, MERWIN & CO., Broadway. In respect to the curiosity of the collection, and the prices realized by many of the important articles, it is by far the most noticeable event in the annals of bibliomania that has ever occurred on this continent. So extraordinary was the demand for many of the rarer books, that all the old ideas of value seemed completely subverted, and a perfect recklessness appeared to reign among the buyers as to the sums they might have to expend in securing some cherished memento of this famous sale. We write while yet there are three more evenings' work to be done, so that it is impossible to give the precise amount; but it is certain that the sum total of the sale will be more than forty thousand dollars, a result quite unparalleled as the produce of any private literary collection in America. As was betiting, in this great City, the two highest lots were connected with New-York. One of them -- a letter of Gen. WASHINGTON, in answer to the notification that the Freedom of the City had been presented to him by the Common Council of New-York, in 1785 -- sold for the astounding sum of two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars, after a brisk competition, mostly between two parties, who acted as agents for the real buyers. It was written on a single foolscap sheet of paper, in good preservation, and, a few years since, would have been thought well sold at $50. The other, and next highest lot, was a copy of ""Knickerbocker's History of New-York,"" extended to folio size, and illustrated by the insertion of nearly three hundred plates, mostly of the Dutch and Flemish schools. This sold for twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The odd $250 would be a liberal estimate of its cost and ordinary commercial value. A copy of ELIOT's Indian version of the Bible, printed at Cambridge, Massachusetts, brought $825. It had been so long in the late owner's possession that he had no recollection of its original cost, but it probably was not over $5. The last copy sold here was in Mr. CORWIN's library, 1858; it brought $210. The first edition of ROBERT BURNS' Poems, published at Kilmarnock, in Scotland, and usually worth in England about three guineas, sold for $120. A small vellum manuscript missal, bought from PAYNE & FOSS, the famous London booksellers for fifteen guineas, sold for $400 to one of our most distinguished and enthusiastic young book collectors. A copy of DIBGINS' ""Bibliomania,"" extended to quarto size, bound in two volumes and illustrated with portraits, and prints inserted, brought $700. It came from the library of the late ITHIEL TOWN, the architect, and had cost him thirty pounds sterling. These are only a few samples of the prices realized. Most of the illustrated books, indeed, went in a similar proportion. As is the case in every large sale, many books sold considerably below their cost, and bargains were to be obtained by those familiar with the real value of books; but anything that attracted the untempered zeal without knowledge of our wealthy book buyers, and provoked competition among them, ran up immediately to sums that would formerly have been considered perfectly fabulous.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8d7b9d50-3974-50c0-af5d-2f9a910cdd2d,1692,nyt://article/8d7b9d50-3974-50c0-af5d-2f9a910cdd2d

Under all the various administrations of the City which have taken charge of this important work, no essential progress has been made. Heaps of garbage still fill the gutters in front of the tenement-houses; the refuse left by thousands of families still cumbers the streets and poisons the air; some quarters of the City are noxious with the pestilential stenches and foul odors arising from these heaps of decaying matter. If the lower wards be left long in their present condition, a more fatal pestilence than the typhoid which is now raging, will be inevitable. It will be observed that the more respectable the street, the fewer of these festering piles appear, and the cleaner the drains and alley-ways. Indeed, often in a single street, there will be a distinct boundary-line between filth and cleanliness, where private houses end and tenement houses begin -- so that one part of the City will be comparatively clean and pure and healthy, while the other is fetid with foul odors and desolated with the ravages of disease. The cleanly and respectable part of New-York is probably the healthiest city locality in the world, and were it not for the pestilential winds which sweep over from the neglected portions, it would probably show a higher ratio of births to deaths than any other great city of modern times.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Street-Cleaning--Some Practical Suggestions.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Street-Cleaning--Some Practical Suggestions.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f17c4f1-3d37-56a6-a8de-108b636becb0,1075,nyt://article/4f17c4f1-3d37-56a6-a8de-108b636becb0

GRANT is of a very interesting nature. The intelligence is up to 7 o'clock yesterday morning, at which time he was in the successful execution of another of his remarkable movements upon LEE's flank. On Thursday night our army was all withdrawn from the south bank of the North Anna, and immediately put on the march for Hanover Ferry, on the Pamunkey River, at least twenty miles southeast of his former position, below the confluence of the North and the South Anna, and within twelve miles of Richmond. Our cavalry secured the ferry, capturing seventy-five prisoners, and advancing at once, occupied Hanovertown, a small village, only a short distance from the ferry. Gen. GRANT says the whole army moved with great rapidity and in the highest spirits. The movement was a complete surprise to the enemy, as only a small force of rebels was met. Hanovertown must not be mistaken for Hanover Court-house, which is fully eight miles northwest of the former, and which was, yesterday morning, occupied by BRECKENRIDGE with a force of from three to five thousand infantry and two brigades of cavalry. Hanovertown is about fourteen miles above White House, on the Pamunkey, and not to exceed twelve or fourteen miles from Richmond. By this movement Gen. GRANT has reduced his former distance from Richmond one half, and mast certainly be as near the rebel capital as LEE himself. Our special dispatch announces that LEE has retreated from his strong position at Sexton's Junction which is probably true in view of GRANT's movements.

The course of events, both on the continent and in this country since 1848 has had the effect of almost completelysilencing the agitation for parliamentary reform. Ten years ago it was still so powerful that both Whigs and Tories were compelled to bow to it, by making an extension of the franchise part of their programme. DISRAELI acknowledged its necessity as well as Lord RUSSELL; the only difference between them was about details. But ever since then the movement has been gradually declining, and the apparent break up of our Republic gave it its death-blow. The liberal leaders were all frightened out of their wits by it, and the alacrity with which most of them abandoned both their party and their principles and joined the high Tories in denouncing popular government, will always remain one of the most discreditable incidents in English political history. During the years 1861-62 it would have been hard to find an intelligent man of the middle or upper classes in England who, however warmly he sympathized with the North on general grounds, did not admit that democracy was a failure.

Ten days ago, GRANT having previously tried hard to force the lines of Spottsylynia, began his march on their right flank, and instantly LEE was compelled to retreat. He fell back, however, but a few miles, and again assumed battle-front on the north side of the South Anna, a line which they had long been preparing, and meant to defend to the last. To compel a retreat from this position it is, that the new flanking movement was begun on Thursday night last. The army recrossed the North Anna, whose lines it had forced a few days before, struck a short distance east, and then south for the Pamunky, at the Hanovertown crossing of which it arrived on Friday. The full effect of this march on the army of LEE yet remains to be developed. But that development cannot be long delayed. From GRANT's position on the Pamunky, it is only about fifteen miles to the immediate defences of Richmond, which is a shorter distance than LEE has to travel from the South Anna to reach them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Grant's Flanking Operations."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Grant's Flanking Operations."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9244481f-568a-5bbb-8d4d-d8326e1d87f8,981,nyt://article/9244481f-568a-5bbb-8d4d-d8326e1d87f8

London Economist on U. S. Ability to Bear Taxation; London Saturday Review on U. S. Ability to Bear Taxation; Our Ability to Bear,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/31/archives/our-ability-to-pay-taxes.html,London Economist on U. S. Ability to Bear Taxation; London Saturday Review on U. S. Ability to Bear Taxation; Our Ability to Bear,"The London Economist and the Saturday Review -- neither of them at all partial to this country -- have taken occasion lately to call attention to an important economical fact, developed by this war -- the immense wealth of the population of the Free States. The Economist, in a recent able article on the subject of our ""ability to bear taxation,"" demonstrates, as if against the popular opinion of England, our capacity to bear easily $600,000,000 annual taxation. The writer states that the great peculiarity of American society has not been understood in Europe, -- that is, the large number of people with an income say of $500f. There are not, he admits, a body of men, representing, for instance, such an amount of property as is represented by the British Parliament, but there are a far larger number of small property-holders with taxable incomes than in England. Reckoning the average wage of the American laborers and small farmers at $1 50 a day, which he believes to be a low estimate, and the number of families in the Union at five and a half millions, he thinks the wage-income of America would be equal to the property-income of Great Britain. The income of our middle class he estimates as equal to that of thef British middle class, though the former possesses less accumulated property. Suppose a tax laid corresponding to the English, of three shillings on the pound, he concludes that £120,000,000 could be raised here from direct taxes, without counting the indirect taxes on luxuries. With respect to the willingness of our people to pay, he entertains little doubt that where a debt is so universally held and where a population is so well off, the tax would be paid with but little grumbling. He does not see why an American ""farmer"" or artisan should not be willing to pay for the American nationality or dignity, or safety, or whatever we consider it, as much as the British banker's clerk for the British -- namely, three shillings on the pound. Grumblings there would be, but there are grumblings also from English rate-payers, and yet the poorest pay with little opposition. There might be many difficulties in collecting, but experience and ingenuity would gradually perfect modes of raising the taxes which would be the most effective and the least annoying. And, as he justly argues, it is hard to fix a limit to the amount of indirect taxes on luxuries which might be raised from so rich a people. His final candid conclusion is that the European public have not at all estimated correctly the American ability to bear taxation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Ability to Pay Taxes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Ability to Pay Taxes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-05-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1942e59c-814b-5463-94e6-51334c08b38a,661,nyt://article/1942e59c-814b-5463-94e6-51334c08b38a

The Mayor sent in a message proposing the purchase of the ""Field Notes"" of a surveyor made under the auspices of the Commissioners for laying out the City, and while he was engaged in preparing a map of it, in 1818, with a view of embodying them in a new and enlarged map.

He expresses willingness, however, to approve similar grants to poor and worthy persons, at points where public convenience may not be infringed.

Retreat Before Sherman,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/05/31/archives/johnstons-retreat.html,Retreat Before Sherman,"-- A rebel letter from Atlanta, dated the 17th inst., says that ""JOHNSTON is falling back gradually, drawing the enemy (SHERMAN) along, waiting for _____, and trying to get a good battle-ground."" The blank for whom JOHNSTON was waiting was, most probably, Bishop LEONIDAS POLK and his forces, who, for the last year, have been flitting around Alabama and Mississippi, ready for any work that might turn up -- ready to defend Mobile, to threaten Vicksburgh, to enter Tennessee in the wake of FORREST -- ready for everything, but never accomplishing anything. There is evidence that shortly after the date of the above letter, Blank POLK did actually succeed in joining JOHNSTON, who, however, even after this reinforcement, still continues to ""fall back gradually, drawing SHERMAN along,"" and who, up to the close of last week, was still in search of a ""good battle-ground."" We would like to know what old JOHNSTON considers a good battle-ground. Was he not satisfied with his position on the heights of Ringgold? What could he find equal to Tunnel Hill, Rocky-faced Ridge, and Buzzard Roost? What could be superior to Resaca, or the mountain fastness of Altoona? What better than the line of the Coosa, or the Etowah? He has, in turn, left all these and other equally tremendous and all but impregnable natural strongholds, and our army has now chased him to within a few miles of Atlanta, which, being in a level country, will furnish a ""good battle-ground"" for us, but a very bad one for him.
