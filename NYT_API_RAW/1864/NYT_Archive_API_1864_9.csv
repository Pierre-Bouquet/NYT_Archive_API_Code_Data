It being deemed politic, by the majority, to select a military man as the candidate, in order to abate, with the people, the odious associations of a peace policy, the least warlike of the Generals was the very ""jack-at-a-pinch"" to serve this end. Though the straight-out peace men did not take kindly at first to any such management, they were easily enough reconciled to it by the plea, that, without some such shift, success was impossible; and by the concession of the second place on the ticket to one of their own number, VALLANDIGHAM appropriately, and without hesitation, moved to make the nomination unanimous.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Nomination of McClellan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Nomination of McClellan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/010ab499-59fb-5e6a-a1a2-7be9b98873ad,1077,nyt://article/010ab499-59fb-5e6a-a1a2-7be9b98873ad

MCCLELLAN for the Presidency by the Chicago Convention, caused great jubilation among the Democracy of the City. Tammany Hall having her posters, flags and transparencies all prepared in advance, decorated with dubious portraits of her nominee, spread them to the breeze and saluted them with one hundred guns. The juvenile Democrats, who have their habitat in the Park, expressed their appreciation of the noise, the smoke and the candidate by spasmodic cheers for MCCLELLAN. The flags on the City Hall, Register's Office and other public buildings controlled by Democratic officials, were raised shortly after the news arrived, by what authority is unknown. Impromptu speeches were made at the stands in the Park, on the City Hall steps and in other convenient places, in which the draft was denounced and Gen. MCCLELLAN lauded. Seedy individuals were started on their travels through the City carrying placards calling upon the friends of GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN to meet in the City Hall Park at 5 o'clock, with the promised inducement that eminent speakers would air their eloquence upon the occasion. The tone of little knots and groups that discussed the nomination in the streets and at the bars in public houses was generally confident, and to the majority success seemed certain, but a few old politicians, congregated in the vicinity of Tam many, expressed themselves as unable to see ""a sure thing"" for ""Little Mac,"" in spite of the apparent excitement and enthusiasm. Toward 5 o'clock the Park began to fill up again and the big guns were brought out to call the faithful, the unterrified, the unwashed, who like artillery when blank cartridges are used, to attend the ratification of the nomination. Three stands were erected in front of the City Hall. No. 1 on Park-row, No. 3 on Broadway, No. 2 in front of the City Hall steps. Gunpowder was wasted ad libilum, drums beat to arms, German bands discussed their most seductive strains: rockets, Roman candles, bombs and miscellaneous pyrotechnics illuminated the air. Old Tammany was dressed in flags and ornamented with transpariences, but the fact must be stated that in point of numbers the gathering was not up to the usual standard of a mass ratification meeting. But few eminent speakers were present, and the speeches, abstracts of which are given below, were strictly confined to abuse of Mr. LINCOLN and laudation of Gen. MCCLELLAN. The display and proceedings of the evening were closed by the exhibition of a beautiful piece of fireworks, embracing in many colored scrolls and flourishes, the motto",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NOMINATION OF M'CLELLAN.; The Way the Democracy Received It.

Magazines for September,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/02/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines for September,"-- Harpers' New Monthly Magazine, for September, comes, as usual, full freighted with instruction and entertainment. The opening article is another leaf from the varied experience of Capt. PARKER SNOW, who is already known to the readers of the magazine, by his adventure, in many lands, or rather many waters, as his experiences have been chiefly of a marine character. It details a perilous incident on the coast of Australia, and is illustrated with wood cuts whose fine execution should not be overlooked. The like excellence is visible in the embellishments to Mr. C.F. BALL's account of ""At Home with the Esquimaux,"" a paper full of interesting facts that may be regarded as a foretaste of the volume, relating his Arctic Explorations, at length, now in press by Messrs. HARPERS. ""President MONROE and his Administration,"" is a vindication of what the author regards as ""the golden age of our political history."" It is pitched in rather a high oratorical key, as when we are told that the utterance of the Monroe Doctrine ""fairly stunned by its boldness the Holy Alliance, and took it down from the height of its arrogance,"" &c. It is this sort of writing that gives rise to so much loose thinking and inconsequential reasoning among us. ""Libraries"" is a fruitful subject insufficiently treated. The writer should know that the books of the Beaufort Public Library, (S.C.,) were not sold by auction in New-York. A healthy spontaneous public sentiment was so strongly opposed to the whole proceeding, that the sale was stopped and never took place. ""Presentation Week at Yale"" reads flatly, like all accounts of college festivities, to those who have rejuvenescent interest in them. ""The Cafe Greco"" is an Italian sketch after the manner of Mr. STORY's ""Roba di Roma."" ""Our Mutual Friend,"" by DICKENS, reaches its fourth number, and can scarcely be called up to the average. Far too much space is taken up with heavy satire on respectability, a subject whose inherent dullness seems to overcome even DICKENS when he writes about it. Where DICKENS' true strength lies, and where his weakness, is well exemplified in the powerful sketch of the slouching ruffian who is informing against his quandam partner, and whose every word goes to complete his picture, compared with the tedious and affected nonsense put into the mouths of the two lawyers in the vain hope of catching the prevalent tones of light social persiflage. We see nothing in this number of honest Mr. Boffin, who is worth a dozen of the heavy respectabilities that DICKENS seems to feel bound to make a crusade against. The usual quantity of novellettes, poetry, jokes, &c., go to make up a readable number.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3141463a-6aae-578d-8c25-ccc5d121e4a4,1200,nyt://article/3141463a-6aae-578d-8c25-ccc5d121e4a4

In other words, a permanent, selfconstituted revolutionary body was thus created, to inaugurate civil war at the North in case the action of the Government should not square with its wishes and plans. A casus belli was stated by the convention to be a repetition of military interference in the State elections of Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and Missouri. The object of such interference, as is well known, was to prevent those in open arms against the Government from voting at the polls. So large a proportion of the people of Kentucky, for example was traitorous, that the Union population was literally at the mercy of the former, and could oppose no effectual resistance to wholesale robbery and murder, much less defend themselves from invasion from without. Government simply interposed to prevent cut-throats and rebels from outside its borders from seizing the political power of the State. No man, loyal or disloyal, in fact, that was willing to take the oath of allegiance, was prevented from voting. Such interference, the convention resolved, was revolutionary, ""and its repetition to be resisted with all the means and power under our control."" Hence the necessity of making the convention a permanent body, to raise the standard of revolt, and organize the means of resistance to the action of the National Government. A political assemblage is thus to become the paramount authority of the land, and is to be the judge of the law, as well as of the occasion on which it will exercise its revolutionary power.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Permanent Revolutionary Body.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Permanent Revolutionary Body.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/47a108ee-f25a-5614-b2da-7089be1896a4,302,nyt://article/47a108ee-f25a-5614-b2da-7089be1896a4

And Military Arrests,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/03/archives/the-peace-candidate-and-military-arrests.html,And Military Arrests,"The history of Gen. McCLELLAN'S connection with military arrests in Maryland is given very fully in the speeches of Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland, and Gen. MORGAN, of Ohio, which we publish without abbreviation. It is a history which is best illustrated by comparing it with the oracular utterances which at a later period began to fall from the lips of the peace candidate of the Democracy, and which now form the standing supports of the Chicago platform. When MCCLELLAN, in September, 1861, issued his order to Gen. BANKS to have certain members of the Maryland Legislature arrested and placed secretly on board a steamer at Annapolis, he was in the full flush and glory of his newly won promotion. He evidently felt that his way to permanent distinction lay in the exercise of his military commission to the full bent of the powers it carried with it, whether in issuing unadvised military orders, such as those hat first disgusted Gen. SCOTT with his subordinate,or in seizing suspected civilians with a military posse, under cover of night. The question how far he should go, was simply limited by the length of his official tether. This was made plain enough a month later, when (on the 29th of October, 1861) he directed his subordinate in command in Maryland to post a military force at certain polling places in the State to look after the purity of the ballot-box. There was then no imaginable limit to his theory of military supremacy. It was only when his judgment, his capacity, and his energy had come to be called in question by the great body of the loyal people and by the Executive, that he laid aside the role of the satrap and commenced his career as a political philosopher. It was only when the country generally began to' doubt whether the Young Napoleon was really so remarkable a General, and after a succession of military blunders, delays and losses had reduced him from the position of a warlike hero to that of a very ordinary sort of soldier, that he began those remarkable series of maxims, platitudes and paradoxes on State rights and rebel amenities which now form the legends of his oracles.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Peace Candidate and Military Arrests.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Peace Candidate and Military Arrests.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4baf04e4-a034-5143-bf33-98fae963271f,464,nyt://article/4baf04e4-a034-5143-bf33-98fae963271f
Chicago Platform and Ultimate Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/03/archives/prospects-of-the-ultimate-convention.html,Chicago Platform and Ultimate Convention,"The Chicago platform proposes an ""immediate cessation of hostilities,"" and an ""ultimate convention"" of the States, to change the Constitution, so as to smooth the way for the return of the rebels to its protecting folds. Such convention can be called only by two-thirds of both bodies of Congress, or on application to that body of two-thirds of the States, disloyal as well as loyal. The amendments, to become a part of the Constitution, must be ratified by three-fourths of the States.

JUAREZ was the regular, legitimate and constitutional President of the Mexican Republic, and for two years he has struggled bravely against the large invading army sent by the French usurper to overthrow the Liberal Government. Finally he was compelled to succumb before superior force; and domestic intrigue, dissension and treason have at last completed the overthrow of his Government. But he has borne himself throughout the great trials that have befallen himself and his country with a calm self-possessedness, with a sublime courage, and with a faithful endurance that have extorted the admiration of the world. No offers or bribes of the usurper could corrupt him -- no measures of power could make him yield -- no defection on the part of his friends could shake his faith in liberty.

Her southern frontier has been ""rectified"" by the acquisition of Nice and Savoy; why should not her northern frontier be in like manner ""rectified"" by the annexation of Belgium and the extension of her dominion to the Rhine? The frontiers of ancient Gaul were the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Rhine; why should they not be also the frontiers of modern France? The little kingdom of LEOPOLD, the trans-Rhenish provinces of Prussia, would have to be absorbed by the great Western Power in order to effect this; but Frenchmen would need to have no scruples about their appropriation, since one of the ablest of French Professors has recently published a work, with the title which we have prefixed to this article, to demonstrate to his countrymen the propriety and expediency of seizing territory, the possession of which is indispensable to the integrity and security of the Second Empire. The book of M. LAVALLEE is a curious and instructive volume. In it the learned author traces the history of ""Les Frontieres de la France"" from the time of the Gauls to the settlement made by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and winds up by declaring that, as France has recovered her natural frontier on the side of Switzerland and Italy, she ought to, and will, recover it on the side of Germany and the Rhine.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The ""Frontiers"" of France.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The ""Frontiers"" of France.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1028ba59-fa91-5532-a8ae-d10ab696eef9,544,nyt://article/1028ba59-fa91-5532-a8ae-d10ab696eef9

They are still besieging the Taeping cities of Woo-chow and Nankin, but are making little progress toward the reduction of either. The former, in fact, can hardly be said to be besieged at all, for the rebels have a strong force encamped without the walls, which has hitherto so kept the Imperialists in check, that they have not been able to approach within twenty miles of the city, though supported by the Franco-Chinese Legion. Nor are affairs in Nankin in a much better condition. That capital is invested, but its defences are yet unassailed, either because their strength deters the besiegers from the enterprise or because TRENG-KWOFAN, their Commander, is in no hurry to reduce the place, lest such a feat should lead to the disbanding of his army, and the diminution of his own power and influence. Already the withdrawal of the English leader from the Imperialist service is beginning to produce its effects. The Imperialists are becoming dispirited and timid, while the Taeping rebels are growing so elated at the disappearance of their most formidable foe, that it is commonly apprehended they will presently resume the offensive, and attempt to recover the places they have lost.

"Morality of, and Collie >amp; Co.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/04/archives/the-morality-of-blockaderunners.html,"Morality of, and Collie >amp; Co.","We are assured, by no less an authority than the Richmond Examiner, that the Confederate Government has been engaged in the business of blockade-running. Encouraged by the success of the British in that traffic, the Administration of JEFF. DAVIS determined to embark in it themselves, and commissioned a rebel firm at Bermuda, with whom they agreed to share profits, to order seven new steamers to be built, equipped and manned in England, for the express purpose contemplated. The order was sent to ALEXANDER COLLIE & CO., an English house, prominent among shipbuilders and blockade-runners, who, in due season, executed the order and started the steamers for Bermuda, between which place and Wilmington they were destined to trade. All of them were peculiarly unfortunate, the whole seven being lost in the first or second voyage, though commanded by experienced Captains, who were invariably successful in evading the cruisers and running the blockade, but who, strange to say, almost as invariably contrived to run the vessels ashore, after escaping capture. These successive disasters, which involved the loss of the cargoes as well as the ships, were not, of course, very agreeable to the statesman-contrabandists at Richmond, and, before long, they began to doubt the integrity of the Captains, and to surmise that evil-intent had more to do with the matter than chance or adverse elements. At first it was affirmed that the Captains had been bribed by the Yankees to destroy vessels and cargoes. On second consideration, this idea was abandoned, for had the Yankees been at all concerned in the affair, they would have been more likely to bribe the Captains to let their vessels and cargoes fall into the hands of the blockaders. The Yankees were, therefore, acquitted of the charge, and Confederate suspicion fastened on other parties. All the accused Captains had, it seems, been appointed by Messrs. COLLIE & Co., who, as has been already mentioned, were themselves notorious blockade-runners, and as fortunate as notorious, not one of their ships [???]ing been captured or lost, though several [???] them had made from three to nine voyages each, Here was ground for suspicion certainly, and the treatment which the delinquents invariably received from COLLIE & CO., after every disaster, tended to give confirmation to it; since what would have disqualified them for any office of trust in the estimation of other men, immediately led to their promotion to new commands in the blockade-running fleet of said parties. The fact is, that the agents of the Confederate Government had made a bad choice of a person to see about the building and equipment of the rebel steamers, it being rather too much to expect that COLLIE & CO. would furnish JEFF. DAVIS and his colleagues with the means of driving himself out of the most lucrative trade he has ever been engaged in. The rebel theory is that COLLIE appointed those Captains expressly on condition that they should wreck their respective vessels and destroy their respective cargoes, after running the blockade, and that the new commands which they subsequently got in his own ships were the reward of their perfidy. Were such a charge made against any man of average respectability, it would, doubtless, be at once pronounced far-fetched and false, but who would look for honesty or morality in a blockade-runner? And, therefore, what might be regarded as utterly unfounded, if asserted of the one, may be admitted to be by no means improbable, when predicated of the other.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Morality of Blockade-Runners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Morality of Blockade-Runners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/705b806e-68bb-59f0-b396-223952c83527,696,nyt://article/705b806e-68bb-59f0-b396-223952c83527

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/04/archives/interesting-guano-suit.html,,"-- In the City Circuit Court yesterday, before Judge ALEXANDER, an injunction was granted on the prayer of PRUDENOIO DEMURGUIONDO, restraining EDWARD K. COOPER and WALTER E. LAWTON from proceeding further in the sale of certain guano islands in the Caribbean Sea, known as the ""Navassa Islands."" According to the prayer of the petitioner, it appears that on or before the 1st of June, 1864, EDWARD K. COOPER, of Baltimore, was in full possession of the island of Navassa, in the Caribbean Sea, in the enjoyment of which he was protected by an act of Congress, having been its first discoverer, in 1856. About the 1st of June last, COOPER entered into an agreement with MURGUIONDO to sell to him, and such others as he might associate with him, in a company to be organized agreeably to an act of the General Assembly of Maryland, chartering the ""Navassa Phosphate"" Company, all his privileges, rights, grants, &c., in said islands. COOPER was to receive in payment 5,500 shares of the capital stock of the company, at the par value of $100 per share, and $37,000 in cash, to be derived from the sale of the remaining shares of stock. It was also agreed that COOPER should pay into the treasury of the company $85,000 as working capital, and he, also, the petition alleges, agreed to pay MURGUIONDO, as compensation for organizing the company, 500 shares of the capital stock at its par value of $100 per share. The complainant then went on organizing the new company, interesting his friends and the capitalists generally, to subscribe to the stock; and in order to fully set forth the value of the Islands, Professors LEIBIG and FISK were dispatched thither to make an examination and report thereon. Their report, made a short time ago, declared the property much more valuable than even Capt. COOPER, the discoverer, every dreamed of. Since the report of these scientific gentlemen were made public. Capt. COOPER, the complainant avers, declines carrying out his previous agreement with him, and has sold or is about selling the islands to WALTER E. LAWTON and other capitalists of New-York. It is for the purpose of stopping this latter sale that the injunction is prayed for. The injunction having been granted, a hearing will be had at an early day, when the full merits of the case will come out. It is currently reported that Capt. COOPER has been offered a million and a half of dollars for his rights and interests in the Navassa Islands by capitalists in New-York. -- Baltimore Sun, Thursday.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INTERESTING GUANO SUIT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INTERESTING GUANO SUIT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc110ffe-9f04-53bf-813b-2112c982ab45,430,nyt://article/dc110ffe-9f04-53bf-813b-2112c982ab45

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/04/archives/romance-of-a-ring.html,,"For some time past a fashionable lady named Mrs. DAVIDSON has been stopping at the Pianters' House, where her ladylike deportment and conversational powers attracted a good deal of attention, and induced a number of our most respectable citizens to make her acquaintance. She was quite handsome withal, and certain susceptible young gentlemen were captivated by the charms of the dashing young widow. She was gallanted to the theatre, to ice-cream saloons, and treated to numerous buggy rides by her ardent admirers. Yesterday the veil of mystery which surrounded the fair stranger was rudely lifted by Constable MCBRIDE, who entered the apartments of the charmer with a search warrant for a $200 diamond ring which had been stolen from Mr. DEFRIEZ, the jeweler. The lady was at first indignant at the accusation, and stoutly asserted her innocence. Then she pumped a few pearly tears into the sparkling fountains of her eyes; but such strategic movements could not deceive an old sworder like MCBRIDE, and he coolly informed her that he intended to search her. At the mention of the word search the lady fainted but the marble-hearted constable quietly, waited until she revived, and then proceeded to explore the premises in search of the missing ring. He round in her trunks and boxes a large quantity of jewelry and about $15,000 in greenbacks, but the [???]lag had not yet appeared to view. He then politely requested permission to search her person. Oh, dear! The proposal was too much for her delicate nerves, and over she tumbled in a second fainting fit. MCBRIDE sat down in the rocking chair and watted until the lady recovered her equilibrium, and then continued diving into the mysteries of her toilet for the ring. Before he had proceeded far in the manipulations she keeled over a third time. Coming to her senses once more she thrust her hand into her pocket and pretended to turn it inside out. but MCBRIDE, not being satisfied, crammed his own huge paw into the cavity, and on drawing it form brought up the ring. At the sight of the glittering jewel the lady fainted a fourth time, but the officer having secured the object of his search, told her it was useless to trouble herself in that way, and bade her good bye. The young gentlemen who had loaned her a number of valuable rings and other tokens of love, & c., were so shocked on learning the character of the lady that they declined to prosecute her, and advised the ""waywa[???]d sister"" to ""depart in peace"" -- a piece of advice which she was not slow in adopting, and the same day started for the Chicago Convention. -- Missouri Democrat.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ROMANCE OF A RING.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ROMANCE OF A RING.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd1a53e7-eb0c-5026-811e-de7a5b00bef4,452,nyt://article/dd1a53e7-eb0c-5026-811e-de7a5b00bef4

the Rebel Ram,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/06/archives/a-remarkable-chapter-in-naval-warfare.html,the Rebel Ram,"The story of the capture of the rebel ironclad ram Tennessee in Mobile Bay must form one of the most remarkable chapters in naval warfare. It was no ordinary sort of sea monster that could bear the concentrated attack of thirteen vessels of war, six of them iron-clad, with an armament of two hundred guns, and yet come out of the engagement with but a few splinters detached from her inner casing to mark the damage in her interior. The Tennessee lay in the rear of our fleet after the forts had been passed on the morning of the 5th of August. And of the fourteen vessels at Admiral FARRAGUT's disposal for the attack, all were perfectly sound and uninjured (except the Tecumseh which had been sunk by a torpedo) when the order was given, shortly after eight o'clock, to 'bout ship and give battle to the ram. A signal was given to all the fleet not only to commence the attack with guns, but to run her down at full speed. The Monongahela, a new steam frigate, not iron-clad, was the first to strike the Tennessee, but the shock, tremendous as it must have been to an ordinary craft, had no apparent effect upon the ram. The Lackawanna, a fast sloop-of-war, next struck her, but with no greater effect. The Admiral's flagship, the Hartford, next dashed against her with her bow at full speed, immediately following up the terrific stroke with a whole port broadside of 9-inch shot and thirteen pounds of powder, at a distance of twelve feet; but still the oaken and iron thews and sinews of the monster showed no perceptible loosening or feebleness. The monitors and the remainder of the fleet then closed in upon her; and she surrendered, simply when she had no longer seaway left to move in. The pounding lasted for a full hour and a half, and at the end of that time she was given up by her commander, BUCHANAN, in a condition which enabled the engineers of our fleet to report on the 13th oi August -- eight days after the fight had taken place -- that she was ""in a state to do good service.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Remarkable Chapter in Naval Warfare.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Remarkable Chapter in Naval Warfare.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Tennessee', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db351f90-51af-509c-9f10-388b8402338b,957,nyt://article/db351f90-51af-509c-9f10-388b8402338b

Mr. COOK was no common man, and very prominently connected with some of the most important enterprises of American Christianity and philanthropy. He had a large share in organizing the Colporteur system of the American Tract Society, in promoting the observance of the Lord's day in the City of New York and throughout the country, and in setting in motion the United States Christian Commission. He did an immense amount of good to our foreign, especially the German population, whose spiritual welfare he had deeply at heart. He was a man or commanding person, strong will, indomitable energy, rare executive genius, of extensive knowledge of human nature, and burning zeal in the service of his Master. He has done a great and good work. A considerable number of the leading ministers and Christian laymen of the City paid him their last tribute of honor.

With a man of enterprise and activity (as Mr. GROVER has proved himself to be in other matters of amusement) at the business head of affairs, and with CARL ANSCHUTZ in charge of the music only, there is a far more flattering prospect for German opera than there has been hitherto -- the more so as Mr. GROVER has ample means at his disposal, and expresses his determination to leave no means unapplied or expense spared to achieve success. Mr. BERGFELD has been employed by him for some time in Europe in the engagement of new artists, the selection of fresh operas, and the purchase of new and complete wardrobes, &c. Until the arrival of the fresh singers, the company comprises the majority of last season's favorites, including Madame FREDERICI, Messrs. HIMMER, HABELMANN, HERRMANNS. &c. -- an engagement with CARL FORMES, is also contemplated. The inaugural season will only last two weeks,"" when the company proceeds to Boston, for a like period.

It is equally true, that the British Customs' Order interdicting the sale and refitting of such vessels in British ports was not issued for some weeks subsequent to the registration in question. But Mr. BATES, in spite of all this, was so well informed of the questionable legality of his purchase, that before chartering her to the Portuguese Government for mail service on the coast of Africa, he had her fully insured against capture at the hands of the Federal cruisers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pirate-trade Doing a Sharp Business.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pirate-trade Doing a Sharp Business.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e504feec-da2b-5439-a2d1-01218cfd7c77,715,nyt://article/e504feec-da2b-5439-a2d1-01218cfd7c77

The matter was very simple. The Confederate Treasury had issued enormous quantities of paper, which was in use as the circulating medium, and which kept diminishing in value every day. So the Richmond sages rushed to the conclusion that it was losing its purchasing power solely because there was too much of it; that the confidence, or want of confidence of the people in its ultimate redemption, had nothing to do with its purchasing power, and that all that was needed to make it worth coin was to out down the quantity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Confederate Finances.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Confederate Finances.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/55788f69-ca65-5662-84e3-f979704c59de,810,nyt://article/55788f69-ca65-5662-84e3-f979704c59de

On Monday last the various steamboat offices of the lines from Boston to New-York were profoundly excited. It was announced that a plot had been discovered for the destruction of the steamers running on the Sound. Three emissaries, it was stated, were recently sent North to ascertain the best point and time at which to strike these boats; and after fixing upon that hour of the night (about 10 P.M.) when the steamers going to Stonington, to Norwich, and to Newport are commonly in sight of each other off the Connecticut shore, they were about to make off with their report to the pirate steamer Electric Spark, which, armed and equipped for the business, is hovering about our coast, when one of their number, struck with remorse, or with the hope of reward, appeared at the Custom-house and revealed the nefarious design. All was bustle and alarm. The gunboat lying at New-London got up steam on Monday night, and ran out into the Sound, with orders to warn all boats against paying attention to any signals whatever. Monday being a stormy night, the boats were all detained on the Sound, and great fear consequently fell upon all concerned. Four revenue steamers have been ordered to look after the Electric Spark, and it is hoped that the danger is over. it is asserted that the Tallahassee ran into Newport harbor about three weeks ago, looked at things in general, quietly steamed around theGuerriere, then lying there, and steamed out again unchallenged. As the Electric Spark is the prize and consort of the Tallahassee, it may be that the present scare grew out of this circumstance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/817d779e-f3d5-5984-8b3e-cadf48f62178,837,nyt://article/817d779e-f3d5-5984-8b3e-cadf48f62178

The boasted invasion of the North by the Shenandoah Valley has resolved itself into a mere bluster and parade of offensive strength, which, while serving the purpose of a momentary blind to the opinion of the world, has cost the invaders the loss of their main line of communication south of Richmond, and destroyed the prestige of their chief General alike for caution and for judgment.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Duty of To-Day.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Duty of To-Day.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17e75a40-dc30-51cf-b4c4-c82966e07e8a,652,nyt://article/17e75a40-dc30-51cf-b4c4-c82966e07e8a

Though issued at the ""dead time"" of the publishing season, when every family is scattered about the world from Norway to Switzerland, sixteen thousand copies were sold in two days. This is an extraordinary demand for England, where to buy new books is an exception to the custom that generally prevails of borrowing them, instead. So important a branch of trade has the lending or circulating library system become there, that there are now three joint stock companies engaged in the business, with a full staff of directors, officers, &c. The latter of these companies has grown out of the famous establishment originated by Mr. MUDIE. He has recently given up his interest in it to a joint stock company, established for the purpose, with a capital stock of £100,000, or $000,000, retaining a share in the management which he has hitherto conducted with so much success.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/35200f62-0cf7-5d6a-a36f-c4df8fd44ba6,995,nyt://article/35200f62-0cf7-5d6a-a36f-c4df8fd44ba6

It is customary to say, in reference to the early events of the war, that, with all its terrible train of calamities, the country needed the defeat of Manassas. And, in truth, to a nation, as to an individual, there is something in disastrous fortune of far more worth, if wisely used, than in cheaply earned success, or in a triumph which enervates and intoxicates, while it steals away vigilance and energy. It was the defeat on Lexington Common, which won the American Revolution. It was the victory at Cannae which lost to Hannibal the conquest of Italy. Had we gained Bull Run, we might have patched together a superficial peace, based on profound ignorance of the vital principles at issue, North and South. We never then had evoked the solid and heroic virtues of fortitude, self-denial, fraternal sympathy, glowing patriotism, which now add priceless lustre to the national character. We never then had passed through the purifying furnace, nor tasted the sweet uses of adversity.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gratitude for Victory The Thanksgiving To-Morrow.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Gratitude for Victory The Thanksgiving To-Morrow.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Thanksgiving', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad81dc74-0bd3-5a2c-b8df-05a733145228,757,nyt://article/ad81dc74-0bd3-5a2c-b8df-05a733145228

Annual Celebration and History of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/11/archives/the-annual-turnout-torchlight-procession.html,Annual Celebration and History of,"During the last century the German pedagogues, and after them many public men of other nations, have resumed gymnatics exercises as part of the education of the young, and seeing clearly the truth of the old adage, that in ""a strong body lives a strong soul,"" these exercises have found their way among the grown up; yea, even the old men of Germany. The first step toward this system was taken by the philosopher BASEDOW, who in 1776, in an educational work entitled the ""Philantropin,"" called the attention of the public to this branch of popular education. His ideas were favorably received by the great pedagogue SALZMANN, who introduced the Turner into his educational institute at Schnepfenthal, where JOHN C.F. GUTS MUTHS perfected the plan, and became so enraptured with it that he purchased a country seat, where up to his death in 1839, he had free turn classes for the people. The Turner received its further and most powerful impetus at the hands of FREDRICK LUDWIG JAHN, who well-known as a demagogue all over Germany during the invasion of the French under NAPOLEON, used his political influence for the propagation of this manly art. The popular mind at this time, quite susceptible for anything originally and thoroughly German, gave the new enterprise its support, and in 1830, Mr. JAHN, who had received a tutorship at the Berlin (Kolnischer) College, erected the first public ""Turn Anstalt,"" or gymnasium, and adopted for it the name the exercises now have, ""Turner,"" derived from the old Saxon word, ""turn."" All sorts of apparatus for the development or the human body were introduced, and it cannot be denied that these exercises, which soon found their way all over Germany, had not a little to do with furnishing good soldiers for the Army of Liberation, which vanquished the French in 1813, '14 and '15. At the close of the war the Turn exercises were again resumed, by order of the Prussian Government, but soon the hostility of the Turners to every false social refinement created many enemies for the new art. KOTZEBUC, WADZECK, and other statesmen of those days, and even METTERNICH, soon found too much feeling for liberty among the Turn Vereine, and commenced to persecute them, but the more vehement these persecutions the greater was the love of the people for them, and especially among the students at the universities of Germany. The ""Wartburgfest,"" on the 18th of October, 1817, the Tercentary of the Reformation, furnished a sufficient ground for official interference, and soon alter JAHN, who had received the cognomen ""Vater JAHN,"" was arrested and incarcerated for five years, by order of the King of Prussia. The Turner, thus effectually squelched, remained dormant for several years, but it revived again, and soon reached a greater perfection by more scientific teachings, as in the Old Country no Turn Vereine is permitted to have any political tendency. These Turn Vereine, however, had considerable influence in the agitations of 1848 and 1849, and many of our own political leaders among the Germans, such as CARL SCHURZ, Gen. WILLICH, FRED. CAPP, and others, received their political education in the Turn Vereine, which, though excluding all political discussion, still always gives its influence to the cause of liberty.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Annual Turnout Torchlight Procession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Annual Turnout Torchlight Procession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28470cb2-31f5-5ff7-ab60-910acff3adfe,1168,nyt://article/28470cb2-31f5-5ff7-ab60-910acff3adfe

The reader pauses in vain to discover if the artist contemplates singing in Italian, French, German or English. There is treasonable prospect, to be sure, that the latter tongue will be spared, for the quantity at the command of the director does not appear to be extensive. But why endeavor to confuse people, and what necessity is there to be ashamed of the title of German opera? It is a paltry pride that blushes at its own necessities, and something worse, that by suppression would imply an untruth. Fortunately, however, no one will be deceived by the vagueness of Mr. GROVER's announcement. The ""inaugural season of grand opera"" means twelve nights here and in Brooklyn of German opera. Monsieur FRANK HIMMER, (why not FRANCOIS?) means our old friend Herr HIMMER, and Mademoiselle MARIE FREDERICI means that tenor's charming wife.

Mr. VALLANDIGHAM delivered a speech at Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday last, supporting the Chicago platform and nominee; but two days after, while at Columbus, on his way East to continue his electioneering speeches, he got a copy of Gen. MCCLELLAN's letter of acceptance. Upon reading it, according to a telegram which we are assured is accurate, he at once authorized the withdrawal of his name from the appointments in Ohio, and returned home -- the dispatch adding to this announcement that the ""peace men have determined to maintain their integrity, and will soon call a meeting to determine their course of action."" On Wednesday, he declared that until the great work of the political campaign was accomplished, ""every day, every hour of his existence, every thought, all that was dearest to him, should be yielded up cheerfully and freely, until upon the 8th of November, or the morning of the 9th, when the sun shall rise to record a country about to be redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled."" Thus he faced on Wednesday, but in forty-eight hours after he appeared to be facing in an opposite direction. This from the author and writer of the Chicago platform -- from the member who moved in the convention that MCCLELLAN's nomination be made unanimous -- from the orator who at once took the stump for the nominee, and declared that ""there was not a man in America more fit for the choice -- that there was not a man whose ""personal character, whose morality, whose attachments to the principles, and whose obedience to the precepts of Christianity -- a man whose devotion to his country -- a man who in every sense of the word is a gentleman -- I say there is not a man in any respect above or beyond Gen.

Recruiting of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/12/archives/the-recruiting-of-negroes.html,Recruiting of,"-- When the last call of the President for troops was made, there was a general impression prevalent in many of the States -- and this State among the rest -- that they could fill up their quotas by sending agents off to the Southwest and enlisting negroes. We corrected this notion at the time by means of facts and authentic documents in our possession. It has been pretty effectually corrected by the very small success of the agents that were actually sent out on this work by some of the States. Gen. SHERMAN, who has penetrated further into the slave country than any other of our soldiers, also gave his views to the same purpose, in a letter we published some time ago, and he gave his opinion again a few days since, in a conversation with an agent for the recruitment of negroes, who called upon him. Gen. SHERMAN, according to the report of this agent, said that he had repeatedly written to the Secretary of War that there were no able-bodied men in the Southwest who were not either in his army or the other; that the rebels had swept every able-bodied nigger before them, and taken them down into the corn-growing regions of Georgia; and that he ""would agree to eat every nigger the agent could recruit without salt.""

McCLELLAN's letter of acceptance is essentially a dishonest document, intended to obtain votes on false pretences. The main question at issue before the people of these United States at the coming election is not whether peace is desirable. All agree that it is. It is not whether the ""resources of statesmanship"" should be employed to obtain it. All agree that they should be employed in their proper place. The question at issue is -- What shall be done with the war? shall it be prosecuted with vigor, or checked in its course? The Democratic party at Chicago declared that the latter course was the proper one. They declared that ""Justice, humanity, liberty and the public welfare demand that immedaite efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities."" Perhaps we should hardly admit that Copperheads demand what is demanded by justice, liberty, humanity and the public welfare, but Democrats could not claim that they did not demand what they say is thus demanded. Nor can they deny that they demand a cessation of hostilities when they demand that immediate efforts be made to obtain one. This platform was not approved by many men who have heretofore been called Democrats. They agreed with Gen. DIX, that putting down the rebellion was to be effected ""by a steady and unwavering prosecution of the war.""

Sober second thought will probably teach them that the storm was their best friend on this occasion, and that they would better leave the correction of whatever grievance they may have suffered to the courts. It is understood that the Superintendent had no objection to the performance of the Oratorio itself, but to several pieces of operatic music, and other accessions, which brought the performance under the ban of the statute prohibiting theatrical performances on Sunday; and if it be true, as reported, that discharges of cannon were to form a prominent feature of the performance, this would have been in violation of a statute expressly forbidding the firing of cannon, guns or pistols, in any park or other public grounds within the City limits on Sunday.

New-York and Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/13/archives/houses-for-workingmen-newyork-and-paris-contrasted.html,New-York and Paris,"In one of the most important reforms of the present day -- the improvement of the homes of laboring people -- New-York is very far behind some of the cities of the Old World. In London and Paris especially, movements in behalf of comfortable dwellings for working people have been in progress for years, and have been attended with marked success. On his accession to power the present Emperor of France found the laboring population of his capital living in vile, narrow lanes and alleys, which it were an unconscionable stretch of courtesy to call streets, from which huge piles of buildings, in every stage of ruin and decay, shut out the light and breath of Heaven, and where every form imaginable of uncleanness, vice, disease and wretchedness held carnival. One of his earliest measures of policy was to cut magnificent channels for light and air through the most infected districts. The downfall of the huge, unwholesome piles was immediately decreed. Narrow and tortuous alleys were widened and straightened into handsome streets, adorned by the elegance and convenience of modern structures; and in the course of ten years Paris was transformed from one of the most unsightly into the most beautiful city of modern Europe. The whole population gained by the change; but by far the greatest gainers were the working people. Instead of living in vile rookeries and kennels, breathing an atmosphere laden with poisonous exhalations, the majority of the working classes of Paris can now find pleasant, convenient homes on clean and roomy streets, which leave very little to be desired in the way of light and air. Of course, in so large a city as Paris a complete reformation of this character cannot be accomplished in the short sp[???]ce of ten years; much still remains to be done; but if the work of renovation goes on as rapidly in the future as it has hitherto, we venture to say that ten years from now there will not be an unsightly lane in Paris, or one where a working man cannot find a cheerful and comfortable home. Contrast this rapid progress of improvement with the state of things in the largest, wealthiest and fastest City of the New World. Here in New-York, the condition of the dwellings provided for our laboring population appears to be going on from bad to worse. In another column will be found some facts bearing on the past and present state of the tenement and lodging houses of this City, which prove this to be the case, and which show that nearly, if not quite, two-thirds of our entire population are perhaps the worst-lodged people in the civilized world.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Houses for Workingmen New-York and Paris Contrasted.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Houses for Workingmen New-York and Paris Contrasted.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/666a0f59-5b95-53b2-8d64-1f77a4c23617,1062,nyt://article/666a0f59-5b95-53b2-8d64-1f77a4c23617

MCCLELLAN will resign his commission as Major-General, and rumors are afloat that he has resigned it. We confess, however, that we do not see that he is called upon to do so on public grounds. If he is eligible for election while holding his rank in the army, it is hard to see what injury it can do to the country to hold it until he is elected. If it be, as we believe, an unwise thing to adopt the practice of placing soldiers in the highest office in the State, and the people think so, he will not be elected; if the people do not see it in this light, and do not object to him on other grounds, he will be elected. His resignation would not mend matters, for he would be as much a soldier after it as before. Taking off a man's epaulets does not change his habits, character, training or mode of thinking, and Mr. GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN would possess precisely the same virtues and defects as Maj.-Gen.

and the Charleston Press; Charleston Press and an Armistice,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/14/archives/the-charleston-press-and-an-armistice.html,and the Charleston Press; Charleston Press and an Armistice,"From a file of late Southern journals, received direct from Charleston, we gather not a little of what ought to interest those who have faith in the ameliorating influence which a suspension of hostilities is to exercise on the alienated heart of the South. The Charleston Mercury boasts loudly that ""every paper of the Confederacy, with one accord, advise and urge the instant and emphatic rejection of a proposition for an armistice."" The reasons advanced to support this high-spirited resolution are rather singular, it is true, but such as they are, we do well to make a note of them. The Mercury tells its readers that a pause in the conflict would redound more to the credit of the President of the United States than to the cause of the Confederacy, since ""SHERMAN is at a stand. ""If,"" continues the Mercury, ""he is forced to retreat, there is no doubt before he has proceeded far on the road to Chattanooga his army, pressed by the gallant spirits under HOOD, will be demoralized, routed, cut to pieces, scattered, if not utterly destroyed!"" Putting the case in its own hypothetical way, the Mercury's view is a very logical one. An army ""cut to pieces,"" ""routed"" and ""scattered"" will come very near being ""utterly destroyed."" And the case is further argued with equal pertinence when the Mercury concludes that an army thus demolished might profit by a ninety days' armistice. The only weak point in the whole argument is that it happened to be the army of HOOD that was ""scattered,"" ""demoralized"" and ""routed."" The Mercury's hypothesis was stated two days after Atlanta had been evacuated by HOOD; but it would perhaps have been a reflection on the spirit of Southern journalism to allow such a small matter as the defeat of HOOD to disturb a train of reasoning so perfect in all its parts as that which we have noted.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Charleston Press and an Armistice.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Charleston Press and an Armistice.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Charleston', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28558249-c394-5c8d-b432-8f539bc49bf1,471,nyt://article/28558249-c394-5c8d-b432-8f539bc49bf1

"PARK BENJAMIN, the well-known lecturer and poet, died Monday evening at his residence in this City, after a brief illness. He was of Welsh cescent, and was born at Demerara, British Guiana, on the 14th of August, 1818, and was 55 years old at the time of his death. An illness in childhood improperly treated caused him a permanent lameness, and he was sent to his father's home in New-England for medical advice and to be educated. He studied two years at Harvard College, graduated at Trinity College, Hartford, in 1829, began to practice law in Boston in 1832, and was one of the original editors of the New-England Magazine. In 1837 he removed to New-York, edited, in connection with C.F. HOFFMAN, the American Monthly Magazine, and subsequently was associated with HORACE GREELEY in editing the New-Yorker. He was next engaged, in connection with EPES SARGENT and RUFUS W.

He was of Welsh cescent, and was born at Demerara, British Guiana, on the 14th of August, 1818, and was 55 years old at the time of his death. An illness in childhood improperly treated caused him a permanent lameness, and he was sent to his father's home in New-England for medical advice and to be educated. He studied two years at Harvard College, graduated at Trinity College, Hartford, in 1829, began to practice law in Boston in 1832, and was one of the original editors of the New-England Magazine. In 1837 he removed to New-York, edited, in connection with C.F. HOFFMAN, the American Monthly Magazine, and subsequently was associated with HORACE GREELEY in editing the New-Yorker. He was next engaged, in connection with EPES SARGENT and RUFUS W.

Escape from Drowning at Chicago when young,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/15/archives/general-news.html,Escape from Drowning at Chicago when young,"A careful examination, on a good map, of the position of the Army of the Potomac on James River, will convince any person capable of understanding a military situation, that it is one highly avantageous. We hold the peninsula between the James and Appomattox Rivers, at Bermuda Hundred, elaborately fortified, and made impregnable. On the right we have an important post north of the James River, also well fortified, and connected with Bermuda Hundred by our fleet which rests in James River, over which, when required, a pontoon bridge can be thrown. On the left, Bermuda Hundred is connected with the position in front of Petersburgh by a pontoon bridge which is fully protected by fortifications on either shore and a portion of our fleet. The base of our operations is City Point, just, below the junction of the Appomattox with the James. A railroad runs from this point, on the east side of the Appomattox, up to Petersburgh, and is employed in carrying supplies to our troops. Our lines about Petersburgh now envelop the city so far as to include the Weldon or Great Southern Railroad. Now it will be seen at a glance that GRANT can, without the knowledge of the enemy, or leaving any part of his line insecure, throw the main body of his army either south of Petersburgh, or between Petersburgh and Richmond, or against Richmond, north of the James. Out of this situation it is reasonable to expect the most important and favorable results will be obtained.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/065f9ca4-0641-5e2b-aacb-e0ed5a0841bf,879,nyt://article/065f9ca4-0641-5e2b-aacb-e0ed5a0841bf

"The Passionist Fathers have erected a splendid quilding at West Hoboken, which is to be called St. Michael's Monastery. This building will be used as a monastic institution, and carried on strictly in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down in that clerical order of the Roman Catholic Church designated the Passionist Fathers. The structure has been erected at the cost of thirty thousand dollars. Attached to it are sixteen acres of ground, for which sixteen thousand dollars have been paid. As to the locality in which it is situated, there could scarcely be a more picturesque or healthful one. From it a view can be had of the surrounding country for miles, with New-York City and Brooklyn in front and Jersey City to the right. The tender influences of religious meditation could scarcely have a more agreeable retreat for exercise. The Reverend Fathers have left nothing undone in order to make this institution one of the finest of its class in the country. This monastery is about three miles from the Hoboken Ferry, and accessible by the railroad cars or by the Union Hill line of stages. On Sunday, the 25th inst., it will be solemnly dedicated. In the meanwhile the public are invited to visit the institution, and judge for themselves of its usefulness. A fair for the benefit of the monastery is about being held at Hoboken, and subscriptions are solicited. The following clergymen will be in charge of the institution: Rev.

Mr. GUNTHER was appealed to in his official capacity to lend his encouragement to the practical organization of the scheme of emigration sanctioned by the late act of Congress. And to this appeal the Mayor's reply in brief is, that ""these importations (by which he means the emigrants, like his own immediate ancestors, who arrive here) are to be either food for powder, or to paralyze the laboring population, so as to prevent strikes caused by an inflated currency;"" and to these objects he cannot give his support. The liberal and carefully-prepared act of Congress passed during the last session, he characterizes as ""a bait, under fraudulent pretences, to enlist foreigners.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mayor Gunther on Emigration.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mayor Gunther on Emigration.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abad7f0f-e90c-5014-94ff-a7d9128a716a,462,nyt://article/abad7f0f-e90c-5014-94ff-a7d9128a716a

the New Law on,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/15/archives/the-new-law-of-navigation-and-lights-on-vessels.html,the New Law on,"-- Congress, at the last session, passed an act in reference to collisions upon the water, to which it is very important that the attention of shipping men should be attracted, and which we therefore publish in another column. As will be seen, it has created a new set of rules with relation to lights, to fog-signals and to the navigation of vessels when approaching each other. All vessels, whether steam or sailing vessels, except pilot-boats and open boats, are now required to carry the green and red lights, which have heretofore been confined to steamers. Different lights are provided for steamtugs, for pilot-boats and open fishing-boats. Fog-signals are required to be sounded on all vessels every five minutes during a fog. Some of the common rules of navigation for vessels when approaching each other, have been put into the form of positive regulations of law, but there are variations enough in them to require every navigator to thoroughly familiarize himself with them. The law went into operation on the 1st of this month, and all vessels not complying with these rules, of course run the risk of being held liable for the consequences of any collision which may occur. We understand that these rules are similar to the new rules recently adopted in England. We have not been able to compare them all but those which we have seen are in the same words; and the importance of having the same rules of navigation apply to the vessels of one nation as well as of another is so obvious, that a change could hardly have been made. Both nations should at once exert themselves to have the same rules adopted everywhere, in order that the uniformity of the law of the sea may still be maintained as it has been for so many centuries.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW LAW OF NAVIGATION AND LIGHTS; ON VESSELS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NEW LAW OF NAVIGATION AND LIGHTS; ON VESSELS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2614750-abf2-5bc0-944f-165b10dbcf92,305,nyt://article/e2614750-abf2-5bc0-944f-165b10dbcf92

The vessel was then to be put in order to carry guns, and to be altered as much as possible for a cruise, so that ere long, most likely, she will be prowling along the coast. The Electric Spark also had a very large mail on board, with a considerable sum in greenbacks, all of which was nabbed by the rebels. As there is a prospect ere long of a visit in force from another fleet of fast-sailing cruisers, it would be well for New-York merchants, and particularly the pilots, to run their vessels and boats with 20-pound pivot rifle guns. Any of the pilot-boats can carry one on her bow, and as the range of these guns are over 2 1/2 to 3 miles, it will be the best safeguard for them, and more particularly as the principal portion of these cruisers will be of iron. A good shell out of one of these guns will almost cripple any of these iron blockade-runners, like the Tallahassee.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1aa34402-e27b-5514-8237-d053f51e7ee1,903,nyt://article/1aa34402-e27b-5514-8237-d053f51e7ee1

McCLELLAN. That fact is beyond dispute. He was habitually spoken of by the rebel journals with complaisance and professions of respect. While they exhausted the slang vocabulary for epithets against every other leader of that army, and even then apparently could find nothing abusive enough to satisfy the spite and gall within them, they always used none but gracious language toward Gen. MCCLELLAN. In this simple distinction thus made by them, there was a volume of meaning. Why should it have been made but for a feeling on the part of the rebels that it was a good thing for them that Gen. MCCLELLAN should be at the head of our armies? They rave like demons against GRANT. ""Butcher GRANT"" is their ordinary designation of him, but that is only their childish prattle when compared with some of their billingsgate. No Northern Copperhead dares say that Gen. GRANT is not every whit the equal of Gen. MCCLELLAN in personal respectability. The difference in rebel treatment can be owing to nothing else than to the fact that MCCLELLAN's generalship was of a character to please them, and GRANT's is not.

SHERMAN has issued an order which will save his army a vast deal of needless and most distasteful labor, and relieve the non-combatant people in and around Atlanta, who still consider themselves ""Confederate"" citizens, from many of the necessary hardships of the new military administration. He has effected a ten days' armistice with HOOD to enable the non-combatants to go southward, with all their movable effects, including so much of the negro property as may be disposed to go with the other chattels. He does not force negroes to leave with their masters, nor does he adopt the equally inhumane rule of dragging them away from their dear protectors on a spurious plea of philanthropy. He takes the rational and philosophic, and, we will also add, the philanthropic ground, that, except where military necessity clearly requires a different policy to be followed, the negro may be left some choice in working out his own future destiny. That is, that we are not bound by any law of national benevolence to lay theftuous hands on enslaved persons, even for the high object of ushering them into the domain of freedom.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

The day may dawn in peaceful quiet, and the evening fall upon a field of blood. Operations may seem to have come to a long pause, when suddenly there is the fierce resumption of hostilities. At this moment the general public are quite incapable of forming any opinion as to the chances of speedy activity on the part of either of our two main armies, or what will be the character and direction of the movements which GRANT and SHERMAN will next attempt. It is common to represent SHERMAN's campaign as closed by the capture of Atlanta. That triumph did, in one sense, and the campaign; but in a large sense, SHERMAN's campaign cannot be said to be closed until he destroys the army of HOOD. The geographical objective was Atlanta, and that is ours; the real body at which he struck was HOOD's army, and that has still, in some shape, a vital and substantive existence. It was assuredly fearfully crippled even before the fall of Atlanta, and it staggered back from that place in dismay and panic. But it still waits for the death-blow which will send it reeling into the last ditch, on the verge of which it now stands. That death-blow SHERMAN will, we believe, give it, with energy, before the snows of Winter fall upon the mountains of Upper Georgia.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Military Aspect', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Military Aspect', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MILITARY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aee3d9f4-cc29-5b42-98a7-f5770d1b6853,421,nyt://article/aee3d9f4-cc29-5b42-98a7-f5770d1b6853

The economical and political utterances which he there makes are, however, even more unfounded. We are informed that immigration will add to the number of those 50,000 operatives in this City who are already ""suffering under the oppression of capital."" Mr. GUNTHER is himself a capitalist, and, like thousands of his countrymen, has made a respectable fortune by employing certain of these unfortunate ""operatives"" of whom he speaks. Does he consider the large sums of money which, in the course of years, he has paid out to this ill-treated class as a portion of those ""oppressive"" dealings to which he alludes? Or does his conscience now accuse him of ""oppression,"" because his income has been measured by thousands of dollars, while that of his laborers was only hundreds? is he about to propose an equal division of profits between the ground-down victims of oppression employed in the fur-trade and their wealthy employers? The public feel a natural anxiety to know what exactly the oppression may be to which the 60,000 operatives of New-York are continually subject, and what remedy the Mayor of the City would propose. Our worthy Magistrate seems to connect a portion of the wrongs of this unfortunate class with the ""inflation of the currency."" But when it is remembered that a day laborer gets in the City $2 50 where before he only received 75 cents, and that $3 a day and board will not secure men in the country for the harvest, it is difficult to see what great sufferings these workers can attribute to the currency. In fact, most householders in the City -- who may be considered as belonging to the ranks of. the oppressors -- would in their simplicity have concluded that the oppression was mostly on the other side -- that laborers charged a price far in advance of the rise in values, and did their work indifferently at that. And how increased immigration is to injure this class, as is urged by the Mayor, is certainly a point not easy to make clear to the common mind. Hitherto, our laboring class has welcomed the immigrant, and even aids his coming by money advanced, which, in the aggregate, amounts to millions of dollars per annum. Every one here knew the simple axiom in political economy that labor is one of the sources of wealth, and that the whole country would be the richer for additions to its producers, and therefore each individual be the better off. Our operatives have hitherto understood that our cheap railways and canals, our immense improvements and buildings for the public and individuals, are due to the fact that we have had so much labor supplied us continually from Europe.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mayor Gunther on Political Economy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mayor Gunther on Political Economy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d76053e3-2d0e-59ec-bbbe-327731e81d40,698,nyt://article/d76053e3-2d0e-59ec-bbbe-327731e81d40

Sympathy with of Democratic Party; Sympathy with the Soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/18/archives/sympathy-with-the-soliders-and-sympathy-for-them.html,Sympathy with of Democratic Party; Sympathy with the Soldiers,"The soldier's vote is an element in the present contest which the Chicago Convention felt could not be disregarded, and yet they were animated by no love for those who were to cast that vote. Every man in all the Northern States who voted against allowing the soldier to cast a ballot was represented in that body. The soldiers' vote has always been solid against them, and they dreaded and hated it, and if they had been governed by their feelings they would have openly expressed their hostility. The leaders, however, knew very well that this would not do, but that on the other hand they must do something, if possible, to turn the edge of that hostility which every true soldier must feel for a party which embraces every peace man in the country -- and so they paid some attention to the soldiers. There was very little in the speeches. Gov. SEYMOUR did indeed endeavor to flatter them a little, but made sad work of it. Said he: ""It was a soldier upon whom our Savior bestowed his only commendation when he hung on the cross and Pharisees mocked his sufferings. It was a soldier alone who discerned his divinity when he heard him pour forth a prayer for mercy and forgiveness for the authors of his sufferings."" The last ground of commendation may be allowed, although it was not when our Savior poured forth the prayer of which the Governor speaks, but at His death, that the centurion discerned His divinity; and to say that he was the only one who discerned it, is a severe assault on the Apostles. But as to the first tem of praise, unless the Governor has seen the Wandering Jew, and derived from him the fact not stated in the Scriptures, that the penitent thief was a soldier, it seems to us that he was mistaken about it entirely. Nor should we think that soldiers would feel complimented by proof that a certain thief, though he was penitent, was one of their number.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sympathy With the Soliders and Sympathy For Them.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sympathy With the Soliders and Sympathy For Them.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e711f86-e441-55b4-a021-fbb7f8ff2738,781,nyt://article/4e711f86-e441-55b4-a021-fbb7f8ff2738

"Nearly fifty-two years have elapsed since the first steamboat that ever floated on the Western rivers (the Orleans, built by Messrs. FULTON and LIVINGSTON at Pittsburgh, in 1811.) made her first and only trip from Pittsburgh to New-Orleans. She did it in fourteen days. This was in the Winter of 1812. The Orleans continued to make regular trips between this port and Natchez until July 14, 1814, when she was wrecked near Union Rouge, on her upward-bound passage, by striking a snag. The Orleans was very different in construction from the steamboats in these days. She was furnished with a propelling wheel at the stern, and two masts; for Mr. FULTON believed, at that time, that the occasional use of sails would be indispensable. FULTON then had a very inadequate idea of the wonderful power of steam, properly applied.

Indeed if the Peace party would find as many ball cartridges at the gunnery as they have blank cartridges for the sake of the noise, the war would soon end; or if all the little boys who were obliging enough to carry Chinese lanterns through the streets last night, would enter the army as musicians, the rebels might be drummed into the Gulf of Mexico in less than a month.

Atlanta Campaign--What Next ?,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/19/archives/what-now-for-sherman.html,Atlanta Campaign--What Next ?,"In the congratulatory order issued to his soldiers by Gen. SHERMAN when his army entered Atlanta, he says, after reciting the various steps in the triumphant campaign; the capture of Atlanta ""completed the grand task which had been assigned us by our Government."" What the entire scope and precise limitation of these words may be, it is difficult to say. We suppose the capture of Atlanta was the task assigned to our brave Western army when it set forth from Chattanooga in May last, and beyond that work it was impossible at that time to draw out any fixed line of military action. So far, it was definite, simple and essential; but, Atlanta once attained, our further progress would depend upon the condition of our army, upon the condition of the rebel army, upon its position and line of retreat, and upon the general aspect of the war. East and West. If the campaign had closed with the destruction of HOOD's force, the farther advance of Sherman's army, as a mass into Georgia, would have been unnecessary: if, on the other hand, the rebel force were borne away intact, SHERMAN's plans and movements would still remain to be dictated by great variety of circumstances.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Now for Sherman?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Now for Sherman?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7303bfb5-c010-57bb-8bdb-844e8f3441f0,964,nyt://article/7303bfb5-c010-57bb-8bdb-844e8f3441f0

Public Career and Present Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/19/archives/the-union-candidate-for-governor-of-the-state-of-newyork-hon-reuben.html,Public Career and Present Views,"The Union party of this State having, at its late convention, nominated the Hon. REUBEN E. FENTON as its candidate for Governor, it may not be uninteresting to review briefly his antecedents and past political record. Mr. FENTON is a native of Chautauqua County, where his father was settled, one of the earliest pioneers in the extreme western part of the State. He was born July 4, 1819, and is consequently forty-five years of age, in the prime of his physical and mental manhood. His early years having been spent in agricultural pursuits, with such occasional advantages as could be obtained by attending the District Winter schools, and a few quarters at an academy, Mr. FENTON can be emphatically called a self-made man. in 1838 he commenced the study of law, more for instruction, than with any design of making it a profession, which continued until 1840, when he actively engaged in mercantile pursuits, which, for fifteen years, he followed up with such steady industry and energy as to achieve for himself a successful issue. During all this lime he was engaged in politics, constantly holding some county office, that indicated the confidence and esteem of his fellow-citizens. In 1849, the Democracy of Chautauqua presented him as a candidate for the Assembly from a district hitherto strongly Whig, and, after a severe contest, he lost his election by only 21 votes. In 1852, after another fiercely contested canvass, he was returned as a Representative in Congress, and took his seat in that body, the first Democratic member sent from that District. In 1854 he declined being a candidate for reelection until two days before the election, and although he polled a heavy vote, the time was too short to give sufficient notice throughout the district and he was defeated by the Know-Nothing candidate, Mr. EDWARDS, by a small majority. In 1855 and 1856 Mr. FENTON was actively engaged in the organization of the Republican party, and was President of the first convention of that party in this State. In 1856 he was nominated and elected to Congress on the Republican ticket, by upward of 8,000 majority. From that time to this he has continuously retained his seat by increased majorities, and is now serving his tenth year as a member of the House.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE UNION CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK.; Hon.

Their enterprise has been amply rewarded. In 1850 the entire population of New South Wales and Victoria was but 237,000. To-day the population of the colonies exceeds 1,800,000 -- an increase, in less than a decade and a half, of nearly eight hundred per cent. The venue has increased in the same time even in a greater ratio. Fourteen years ago the exports of Victoria amounted to about $6,000,000; to-day they exceed $90,000,000. The gold discoveries, it is true, contributed largely to this extraordinary growth, but the first impulse given to the settlement and industrial enterprise of the colonies was derived from the results which followed the public provision in aid of emigration.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'National and Private Emigration Enterprises.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'National and Private Emigration Enterprises.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1bc6bd5-9953-5deb-aaeb-b689edb2793c,969,nyt://article/a1bc6bd5-9953-5deb-aaeb-b689edb2793c

It would doubtless be interesting, as well, if we had the particulars in an intelligible form. The salient points, however, would seem to be this: On the 6th inst., the French army advanced from Bagdad to attack the Juarist force under Gen. CORTINAS at Matamoras. At a place called White Ranche, CORTINAS met the enemy and gave him battle. The result, according to the narrator who is a Sergeant of the 91st Illinois Reg't., stationed at Brazos, was a victory for the Juarist force. The French fell back some distance to a more defensible position, and at this point, while CORTINAS was giving them battle a second time, Col. FORD, the rebel commander at Brownsville, crossed the Rio Grande, attacked the Jaurez troops in the rear, but -- as the story goes -- notwithstanding the odds thus gained by him, CORTINAS drove the French behind their entrenchments, turned upon the rebel assailant in his rear, and compelled FORD and his men to retire.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Strange Story from the Rio Grande.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Strange Story from the Rio Grande.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/780ea758-d2c6-5f52-9bb2-f3719182ae1a,826,nyt://article/780ea758-d2c6-5f52-9bb2-f3719182ae1a

Soon afterward the Imperial forces were joined by the rebels under FORD, who was endeavoring to furnish the former with supplies. CORTINAS, however, succeeded in putting both rebels and Imperialists to flight. His artillery being unable to cope with the heavy guns of the French shipping, he crossed a large portion of his men to the American side of the river, took possession of Brownsville, and hoisted the Stars and Stripes where the rebel flag had lately waved.

It is not uncommon to find the young children in the public schools of this City falling asleep in the middle of a lesson, utterly exhausted by the unnatural tax upon their powers, while others are restless, eager for mischief, or anything else that will serve to break the routine of exercises which overstrains their faculties and gives no scope for the muscular activity which nature craves. The evil effects of the common bodily constraints during long hours in school are seriously manifested on girls and especially on those of frail constitutions. The evidence is abundant that the aggravation of children's ailments is due to the forced inactivity and constrained positions of the school, and the best teachers tell us that children between seven and ten years of age do not and cannot retain a bright, voluntary attention on the average longer than two hours in the morning and one in the afternoon, or after dinner.

Victory in the Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/21/archives/the-victory-in-the-shenandoah-valley.html,Victory in the Valley,"The signal victory in the Shenandoah Valley on Monday is one of that class which permits no cavil either as to its scope or its completeness. At the opening of the battle EARLY'S force, which, by Confederate accounts, has been positively put down at 27,000, was posted mainly at Bunker Hill, near Winchester, and at Darkesville. The Upequan creek was between our forces and the rebels and their works extended at some points on the centre and left to within three miles of the river. SHERIDAN's line extended, early in the engagement, over five miles in length, from Berryville towards Bunker Hill. The attack was made by our cavalry under AVERILL by gray daylight on Monday, BRECKINRIDGE's division, posted near Darkesville, having been steadily driven a distance of seven miles, by one o'clock in the afternoon. The attack of our main army also commenced early in the morning at the point where the Opequan Creek is crossed by the Berryville turnpike. From this point our forces, by a series of stubborn and sanguinary engagements which lasted until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, compelled the rebels te fall back, completely defeated EARLY's main army, and drove it from one defended line of works to another, until what remained of the routed force, as Gen. STEVENSON tells us, was ""sent whirling through Winchester;"" all their dead, most of their wounded, and two thousand five hundred prisoners being left on our hands. The wounded in Winchester alone are found to number three thousand, and if the dead are counted in, the rebel loss will be found to exceed six thousand, or about one-fourth of the entire army under EARLY. In trophies and material our gain is also notable; fifteen army flags and five pieces of artillery having fallen into the possession of our army.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Victory in the Shenandoah Valley.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Victory in the Shenandoah Valley.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/77430fb2-1a03-5217-8199-c14d3b511a76,752,nyt://article/77430fb2-1a03-5217-8199-c14d3b511a76

Historically and chronologically speaking, nearly all of our number were born shortly after the foundation of our present National Government. All of us lived in the atmosphere breathed by WASHINGTON. Many of our number first saw the light during the French Revolution, amid the horrors of the Reign of Terror. When the good king, Louis the Sixteenth, the friend of American independence, was beheaded, some of the Class were old enough to hear the widespread groan, coming heavily across the Atlantic. While at school we heard the shouts of the victors at Aboukir and Trafalgar. We followed on our maps, ""the Little Corporal"" from Lodi to Marengo, to Jena and to Austerlitz. In the year 1810, when we entered college, the French Emperor had reached the summit, the very culminating point of his victorious career. He stood pre-eminent and aloft, at once the dominant power and the terror of the world. Europe was ringing with the crash of its ancient thrones, and he was rebuilding on their ruins the Western Roman Empire of Charlemagne, and ambitiously imitating that of Augustus.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTRACTS.; FROM THE SEMI-CENTENNIAL ADDRESS OF MR.

The Richmond theory was, that since the fall of Atlanta, GRANT had set to work bringing troops from SHERMAN's army into Virginia, and that when he got sufficient force concentrated in the latter State, he would open a great course of military operations against Richmond. This idea has taken firm hold of the rebel mind; and their journals continue to write about it with great earnest ness, and with an evident impression that there would be imminent danger to the rebel capital and the rebel Confederacy if the plan which they fear be really adopted. The Examiner of last Friday says that ""an impression prevails, and it is fortified by several concurring considerations and circumstances, that Petersburg and Richmond are to receive the force of the shock;"" and of the circumstances that lead to this conclusion is the information the rebels have that ""Federal troops are hastening up the Mississippi, and that recruits are being sent to GRANT and SHERIDAN as fast as can be brought.""

"Requirements by, and Democratic Party",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/22/archives/the-new-gospel-of-peace.html,"Requirements by, and Democratic Party","The Democratic party having pronounced the war a failure, but being still as determined as ever not to give the Union up, the obvious inference is, that it means, if it gets into power, to restore it by talking to JEFFERSON DAVIS. What they have to say to him is simplyto request him to come back under the Constitution. And their grand resource, in case he neglects or refuses to comply, is to ask him again. Their idea, no doubt, is, that the Confederates can be bored into a resumption of their allegiance. They imagine that if a few of the Democratic orators, such as make night hideous now and then on Union-square, could get a good chance at the rebel Congress, the rascals would cry for mercy, and take the oath before their persecutors had got half through. We are sorry to say, however, that we cannot concur in this view of rebel susceptibility. We are satisfied that the great mass of Southern traitors are tough enough to stand any amount even of Democratic speech-making. The chance of subduing them by dint of rant is infinitessimally small. If the tongue is to bring them back at all, it must be by offering something substantial. And what can our Democrats offer? There's the rub. What they now propose to offer is ""the Constitution as it is -- the old Constitution."" But JEFF. DAVIS has tried the old Constitution, and has not found it to suit him. He had it when he seceded. He knows all about it; just what it can do, and what it can't do. Our Peace party cannot offer to make any changes in it, because their grand cry is, that it cannot be changed; it cannot be improved; that it is perfect; that, as the World says, it is in politics what the Gospels are in religion. Besides, it is the Northern people who are tampering with the Constitution; it is they who have violated, and are violating it; it is they who, by their designs against its integrity, are bringing ruin on the country. It would never do for Democrats to lay violent hands on it. So DAVIS must take ""the Constitution as it is.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Gospel of Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Gospel of Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/962c1199-53ac-57f3-a16f-d30dfd7731ae,1217,nyt://article/962c1199-53ac-57f3-a16f-d30dfd7731ae

Victory in the Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/22/archives/sheridans-victory-in-the-valley.html,Victory in the Valley,"The clear supplementary reports which we publish this morning from our special correspondents and from official sources, so far from detracting from the importance of SHERIDAN'S victory, do but illustrate the carefullyconceived plans, the matured purpose, the resolute action, and the matchless valor by which the national army achieved its triumph.The modest statement of SHERIDAN does scant justice to the brilliancy of the achievement, but in truth the story needs no coloring. In its simplest and baldest form, it supplies a record of skillful generalship, executive energy and decision, such as will well compare with the most brilliant of the war. Even the partial miscarriage (for in every grand engagement there will be some miscarriage) of one part of the commanding General's plan of action only brings into stronger relief the quickness of his perception, the wealth of his resources as a tactician, and, above all, that readiness of decision to which the foremost of English Generals attributed his success. The Nineteenth Corps should have come up with the Sixth at Opequan Creek two hours earlier than it did. To an irresolute or purblind leader those two hoors would have been fatal. To SHERIDAN they brought inspiration. Resigning his first plan of striking out heavily with his left on the extreme right flank of the enemy and getting in his rear at Winchester, he ordered as powerful a diversion as could be made by our cavalry on the enemy's left, between Darkesville and Bunker Hill. By this EARLY was prevented from striking the isolated Sixth with sufficient force to turn those critical hours to account. The three corps, (WRIGHT's, EMORY's and CROOK's,) in spite of all the delay, were concentrated across the Opequan in ample time to hurl back the powerful force now thrown out from EARLY's right, and thenceforward the tide of victory rolled on with uninterrupted success. How perfect in all its details, how far-reaching in its results, this triumph will prove to be, we shall learn anon. SHERIDAN is not to allow the grass to grow under the feet of his army. The battle of Monday ended at near sundown, and weary-worn as his men must have been, they seem to have taken up the line of march with scarce an hour's interval of repose. By 3 o'clock on Tuesday, SHERIDAN had pursued the retreating rebels almost to Strasburgh. In spite of this vigorous pursuit, however, the routed army, shattered and broken as it was, and relieved of most of its many incumbrances, would seem to have made sufficient use of its legs to avoid a second battle. The official report represents it as altogether demoralized -- a fact entirely appreciable when we read in the latest telegrams that seven of EARLY's best Generals are either killed or put out of the field. These Generals include such names as RODES, RAMSEUR, GORDON, TERRY, GODWIN, BRADLEY, JOHNSON and FITZHUGH LEE. And along with these there fell in battle or were captured of the rebel rank and file not fewer than six thousand five hundred.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Sheridan's Victory in the Valley."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Sheridan's Victory in the Valley."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f48e3c1d-c40e-54a6-8dea-df2d94c1debf,568,nyt://article/f48e3c1d-c40e-54a6-8dea-df2d94c1debf

Now, it is unnecessary to remind the country that the Monroe doctrine, the Mexican war, the annexation of Texas and the Cuba question were pet Democratic measures, and Southern measures per se. The animus of the Southern Democratic party, as involved in these policies, was, that any attempt on the part of England to acquire Texas, or Spain to regain Mexico, or France and England to hold Cuba, was a menace to the National security and dignity in which the South then shared. The North backed the doctrine. Cuba, for instance, belonged to Spain, but the South said she had no right to do as she pleased with her own, and the Democratic party stood ready to fight the world on this issue of National dignity, National right, and National security. These Southern leader are now preparing to do on this Continent, that very thing against which they demanded the opposition of the United States Government. They propose to establish a Nation as the rival of American power, and this rival nation is to rest on European alliances for support. When these disunionists formed this so-called Confederacy, they sought to create a nation based upon alliances and complications far more threatening to the United States than the tripartite convention about Cuba, or the French occupation of Mexico, or the English scheme in Texas. The United States Government is not making war upon States. The disunionists formed their so-called nation on the 4th of February, 1864, Mr. LINCOLN was inaugurated on the 4th of March afterwards.

The injuries inflicted on Dr. Z. are of an aggravated nature. The facts and circumstances, so far as we have been able to learn them, are as follows: For some time past, Dr. ZACHARIE and Mr. SAMUEL M. BARNETT, also a chiropodist, had been practicing as partners in the City of Philadelphia. Recently the partnership was dissolved, and BARNETT came on to this City, bringing with him the copartnership books and papers, also other personal property -all of which were temporarily placed in the possession of Dr. ZACHARIE. A little over a week since the latter was called to Washington. Before leaving, he requested BARNETT to take charge of his office, and transact his business until he returned -- all of which BARNETT did. Last Monday morning Dr. Z. reached his home in this City, and BARNETT soon after called on him and paid over to him such moneys as he had received in a professional way during the Doctor's absence. ZACHARIE received the money and offered BARNETT hail of it for his services. BARNETT threw the money back, and in an angry tone of voice said he wanted none of his money. Dr. ZACHARIE then asked him what he did want. An insulting reply was received in answer to this question, whereupon the two became involved in a very angry discussion, curing which BARNETT was ordered by the Doctor to leave his premises, and admonished never to return. BARNETT started to leave the room, and as he was going out, said to the Doctor that if he would go with him to the street, he (BARNETT) would have his revenge. Dr. ZACHARIE followed his opponent down stairs, but nothing further of importance transpired at that time. Yesterday, BARNETT again made his appearance at the Doctor's office and asked the latter for the books and papers which he said belonged to him. As Dr. ZACHARIE was in the act of taking them from a drawer, BARNETT arose from a seat, and deliberately drawing a live barreled revolver, said, ""My time has come."" or words to that effect, and suddenly discharged two shots. One of the balls entered the right cheek of Dr. ZACHARIE just below the eye and close to the nose, going so far into his head as to be beyond the reach of the probe. Dr. PARKER was immediately called in, and he made an examination of the wound. It was his opinion that possibly the ball could be extracted, and the life of the injured man saved. The wound is, however, regarded as a very dangerous one.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Serious Shooting Affray in Broadway.; A DOCTOR DANGEROUSLY INJURED--THE PERPETRATOR SURRENDERS HIMSELF--THE CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY A MYSTERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Serious Shooting Affray in Broadway.; A DOCTOR DANGEROUSLY INJURED--THE PERPETRATOR SURRENDERS HIMSELF--THE CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY A MYSTERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79b064d1-b438-5e00-842d-25fcef6b655c,758,nyt://article/79b064d1-b438-5e00-842d-25fcef6b655c

""If elected,"" said he, ""I am satisfied that he [Gen. MCCLELLAN] will entertain the views and execute the principles of the great party he will represent, without regard to those he may himself possess. He will then be our agent and the creature of our voice."" This is perfectly true and the sequel will show it. How, indeed, can he be anything else? He is nominated solely and exclusively because he is the representative of the party which adopts him. He is made their candidate only because he is to be their agent. Mr. WOOD stated the simplest and most unquestionable maxim of practical politics, when he asserted that the nominee of a party becomes the representative of that party when, with his own consent, he becomes its candidate. When BUCHANAN was nominated, he stated that he was ""no longer JAMES BUCHANAN"" -- he was the representative of the principles and purposes of the party which had put him in nomination. This was true of him -- and it must be true of every man who permits himself to be made the candidate of a political party.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Chicago Nominee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Chicago Nominee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e597893-8fde-574a-97f9-36e2c8626e4c,433,nyt://article/9e597893-8fde-574a-97f9-36e2c8626e4c

Great Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/24/archives/the-great-victory.html,Great Victory,"To-day's bulletins of battle are as brilliant as any we have ever had in the course of the war. SHERIDAN has fought and won another battle, has wrested from the enemy another strong and important position, and, if the reiterated and very decided statements of the official dispatches may be credited, has routed the rebel army of the Shenandoah. It was on Thursday that he came up with the retreating army of the rebels, which, after the disastrous defeat it met with on Monday, had skedaddled some thirty miles and taken up a strong position on FISHER's Hill (or Round Hill), a short distance south of Strasburg. The great strength of the position was well known to all our officers who had campaigned in the Shenandoah valley, and a very desperate struggle was there anticipated. The greater part of Thursday was spent in manoeuvering before the rebel line, and it was not till four o'clock in the afternoon that SHERIDAN could lead forward his whole army in general assault. But the two hours of daylight were put to awfully glorious use by this distinguished soldier. The gallantry and fury of his attack, the skill and of his tactics, and the effectiveness of his work, can best be judged of by his own words. He opens by announcing the ""achievement of a signal victory,"" and closes by proclaiming that the ""victory was very complete."" He says that CROOK, who operated on the enemy's left, ""carried everything before him,"" ""swept down behind their breastworks,"" and ""drove them in the greatest confusion."" He says that the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps assailed the rebel works in front, and though they appeared almost impregnable, we achieved such decided success that the enemy ""fled in the utmost confusion,"" and their ""whole army appeared to be broken up."" It was only darkness, he tells us, that ""saved the whole of EARLY's army from total destruction."" In the manner Gen. STEVENSON telegraphs that and ""affair is complete and overwhelming,"" and ""id in all probability, the finale of Gen. EARLY.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Victory.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Victory.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4577c1c4-a2cf-5345-98bd-ade27ac9e193,573,nyt://article/4577c1c4-a2cf-5345-98bd-ade27ac9e193

The score is exceedingly full, and the mise-in-scene is highly important. There is much for the ear, and much for the eye. When all has been done, it is doubtful if the public will appreciate the effort and labor that have been expended in the cause. For the ""Jewess"" is an opera of reputation rather than of popularity. Musicians speak well of it and justly, for it contains the essence of a dozen of ordinary operas. It exhausted the fancy and imagination, of its composer, and has furnished suggestions for all of his successors. But the general public have never warmed to the work, and hence its place in the repertoire is determined entirely by the energy and liberality of the manager. If we may judge by the perfectly overwhelming attendance that filled the Academy last evening, Mr. GROVER has chosen the right moment for submitting it to his patrons.

The parties to the action are father and son, and plaintiff obtained an injunction to restrain defendant from manufacturing or selling any rejuvenator of declining beauty under the name referred to. On motion to dissolve the injunction the defendant showed that in 1861 the plaintiff had transferred to him all his interest in the sale and manufacture of the cosmetic, and that since that time the business had been entirely in defendant's name. The plaintiff claimed that defendant had only been employed by him as a clerk, but that he had nominally sold the business to him in order to protect his (plaintiff's) property. Family difficulties having arisen, defendant took the business into his own hands. His Honor held that as plaintiff had transferred his right to the Boom of Youth some years ago, and as the business had been carried on in his son's name, with the consent of plaintiff, it was too late now for him to step in and revoke his sale.

Washington Hook & Ladder Co. No. 1, one of the oldest and best companies in the city, that day received and brought home their new Truck. At two o'clock in the afternoon the members of the company assembled at the truck house, formed, and accompanied by Chief Engineer ROBERT A. REED, Asst. Engineer L, KENNEDY; MYERS' excellent band and a number of invited guests, marched to the ferry and embarked on board the ferry boat Newark which Mr. STEVENS had placed at their disposal. The boat was beautifully dressed with flags &c., and after the men were all on board she steamed down the river around the battery, and landed the party in Brooklyn, at the Wall street ferry, they then formed again and marched up to the factory of Mr. J.S. WORTMAN, the maker of the truck. Here they were met by Assistant Engineer SIMPSON and a number of prominent Brooklyn firemen. After the truck had been inspected and admired, the firemen of Brooklyn took charge of the Hoboken boys, and treated them very handsomely, after the good things had all been disposed of they all returned to the factory and the truck company took possession of their truck. They then formed again, and accompanied by more guests from Brooklyn, including Mr. WORTMAN, the maker, and Mr. SPITTLE, one of his principal workmen, who had carefully superintended the building of the truck, re turned to the ferry and again embarked on the Newark. On board the boat a collation was served, to which all did good justice. Arriving at Hoboken, they were received by the entire Fire Department of the city, a number of prominent firemen from New-York. At about 8 o'clock, the procession being formed, commenced to move, and then commenced probably the grandest torchlight procession ever seen in Hoboken. Rockets, Roman candles, and fireworks of nearly every description filled the air. Many houses along the line of march were illuminated, guns were fired, cheers upon cheers given, and the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. After the march was completed, and the apparatus safely housed, the ceremony of christening the new truck was performed. The firemen were formed in a circle, their guests, very many of whom were ladies, filled the rest of the house, and the band was stationed near the door. MISS MINNIE PLOWMANTHE, the beautiful and accomplished relative of Mr. JOHN W. MITCHELL, was then led forward by him to the platform which had been prepared for her, supported on either side by Foreman EDWARD G. JEWETT and Assistant Foreman M.H. REDDING. Mr. MITCHELL then handed her the bottle of wine. When, after naming the truck ""Washington,"" and adding a very beautiful little sentiment, she broke the bottle over the new name plate, completely deluging it with the delicious wine. The band then immediately struck up, and nine hearty cheers were given for the new truck, and the young lady who had christened it.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""HOBOKEN.; Grand Firemen's Parade Reception of a new Truck by Washington Hook & Ladder Co.

Mr. HUNT asked the Convention to declare, ""that in the future, as in the past, we will adhere with unswerving fidelity to the Union and Constitution, and insist on maintaining our national unity,"" &c. The resolution thus accepted in open council, was referred to the Committee on Resolutions, and by that committee it was adopted, with the exception of the words we have italicized. ""To insist on maintaining our national unity,"" was considered too decided an expression of loyal and resolute purpose. The committee, therefore, brought forth their platform with the objectionable passage erased, and the essential resolution of the platform was made into a milk-and-water declaration, ""that in the future as in the past, we adhere,"" &c. This was simply changing the active transitive into the active intransitive. At the first blush, however, no one would notice the difference, Mr. HUNT himself, even if he might have certain vague notions of the duty of making some positive declaration for the Union, would hardly discover, on the spur of the moment, that there was any essential difference between one party adhering to a given compact itself, and compelling another party to adhere to that compact as well. Be this as it may, whatever Mr. HUNT or those who most loudly professed adhesion to the Union at Chicago, thought, they accepted the change made by the VALLANDIGHAMS and other members of the committee on resolutions, at one grand bolt, and made no bones of it.

Of a large proportion of this the government is the direct owner. If instead of this property the Government had the value, even at only sixpence a pound, in gold, who can doubt that the Confederate currency would never have lost a specie basis? Why should not a cotton basis., equally available for present purposes, be adopted? Grant that the precious metals are abstractly immeasurably superior to a perishable commodity as a standard of values. But if one cannot have what one wishes, why not make use of what one has? Suppose the Government, in its future disbursements at home as well as abroad, should give promises to pay cotton, instead of promises to pay gold? it is under any conceivable circumstances better able to keep the former than the latter. An order on the Government store-keeper for $100 of cotton at peace prices would therefore, at worst, be more intrinsically valuable than an order for gold on, the Treasury to the same amount. If the experiment succeeded, the cotton promises might be gradually exchanged for the gold promises already issued. To give these cotton promises a saleable value abroad, it would only be necessary to exempt the holders from certain restrictions, whether present or prospective, on the exportation. Already the Government has undertaken to pay the interest on one description of its domestic funded debt in cotton; why not extend this expedient to the principal of its future unfounded debt? The plan would be condemned by a certain class of shallow political economists, who, when they have learned the formulas of the application of its laws.

Relative to the withdrawal of Mr. HARDINGE from the service of the North, the Morning Post says Mr. H. needs no excuse for the step he has taken in renouncing his allegiance to the Federal cause, and espousing the fair ""rebel,"" whom he has now sworn to love, honor and cherish. Though in obedience to the wishes of his father he served for some time in the Federal Navy, in which service he rose to be Lieutenant, his Southern sympathies were notorious in the North, where it was well known that he had long tendered his resignation,which Mr. Secretary WELLES refused to accept, and thus he was forced to continue in a service which he would gladly have renounced long since. Though more than suspected of Southern sympathies, he kept his word when he promised the executive of the Federal navy that the name he bore -- a name which had descended to him from a long line of ancestors in Great Britain and America -- should not be disgraced, an proved his readiness to perform his duty on many occasions, especially by heading a body of 120 men sent ashore to storm a breach at Wilmington, and capturing the fort, though when the muster-roll was called afterwards only 25 survivors could respond. He did not escape, as he received a severe wound in the chest, and will carry his honorable scar to the grave. Having now finally quitted the service of President LINCOLN's Government, he intends to signalize his devotion to Secessia by entering the ranks of her army, and thus winning his way to confidence and that command which his birth and education gave him a right to expect. The command he might long since have obtained, for, although only twenty-two years of age, a Major's commission in the Federal Army was offered him as the price of the renunciation of his intended wife and his Southern sympathies.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MARRIAGE OF BELLE BOYD.; From the Manchester Examiner.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MARRIAGE OF BELLE BOYD.; From the Manchester Examiner.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5008795-ecfc-5d74-8a6b-3091cb3b0d14,379,nyt://article/b5008795-ecfc-5d74-8a6b-3091cb3b0d14

"Georgia Pirate, the; Mr Bates' Purchase",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/25/archives/the-case-of-the-georgia.html,"Georgia Pirate, the; Mr Bates' Purchase","We fear that Mr. BATES, the purchaser of the Georgia, has made a bad investment of the $80,000 which he paid for the ex-pirate. His attempt to obtain the intervention of the British Government is indeed proof that, whatever may have been his original opinion on the subject, he now entertains grave doubts himself touching the validity of the sale. On the merits of his case, however, be they ever so questionable, the gentleman will have to take his stand, for his application to Earl RUSSELL has been in vain. The British Foreign Secretary will have nothing to do with the matter, but coolly informs the applicant that ""the case of the Georgia must go before the Prize Court in the United States,"" and that he ""must be prepared to defend"" his ""interest therein."" The party to the suit then will be JAMES BATES, ship-broker, of Liverpool, not the British Government. But what will be the nature of the bill of indictment which Mr. BATES will bring against the Republic of the United States? Why, that on a certain day, which, of course, will be specified, the American frigate Niagara seized the British merchantman Georgia off the port of Lisbon, notwithstanding that said vessel was, at the time, sailing under the British flag, possessed of a bona fide British register, the property of a natural-born British subject and engaged in lawful traffic. On which grounds the plaintiff will demand not only the restitution of the vessel, but even compensation for damages sustained. Well, Count BENTINCK, of Kniphausen, advanced similar charges, and made similar claims in the case of the ex-Dutch frigate Minerva, yet Lord STOWELL refused to countenance them, and we suspect that, for similar reasons, the charges and claims of Mr. BATES' quoad the Georgia will fare no better.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Case of the Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Case of the Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf3e2cc1-65d3-53cc-a724-69114df28aa0,624,nyt://article/cf3e2cc1-65d3-53cc-a724-69114df28aa0

The gathering was occasioned by the announcement that a banner, bearing the names of ABRAHAM LINCOLN for President, and ANDREW JOHNSON for Vice-President, would be raised, and that Gen. HOOKER and Gov. NOBLE would address the assemblage. At the hour stated the banner, one of the largest and most costly yet raised in the City, was swung across Washington-street, a few feet from Reade-street, amid the cheers of several hundred people. Mr. E.H. GARBUTT was appointed Chairman, and introduced Mr. H.B. DUTCHER, who spoke in glowing terms of the achievements of Gen. SHERIDAN, and our recent victories in the Shenandoah Valley. C.S. SPENCER, Esq., was the next speaker introduced. He said that no portion of the country was more interested in a speedy attainment of peace than the people of New-York, but they did not think the best way to obtain peace was to pronounce the war a failure. The speaker referred to the Chicago platform, and said that SHERMAN, FARRAGUT and SHERIDAN had, by their noble deeds, pronounced against it. In the glorious tide of victory was it the time to ignominiously lay down our arms? Mr. SPENCER spoke at some length, and was loudly cheered during his remarks. A gentleman, introduced as Adjutant HAGERTY, made a short speech, and was followed by BENJAMIN F. BRUCE, Esq., who was interrupted in his remarks by a drenching rain, which compelled an adjournment of the meeting. The proceedings throughout were of an enthusiastic character.

as a Patriot; Moldo-Wallachia and Prince Couza,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/25/archives/prince-couza-as-a-patriot.html,as a Patriot; Moldo-Wallachia and Prince Couza,"A little while ago the Moldau-Wallachian Hospodar was known only as a turbulent and insubordinate feudatory of the Porte, as a spoliator of Monks and monastic establishment -- now he appears in a new role -- now he figures as patriot, liberator, and champion of the oppressed. The present Czar has acquired immortal fame by the emancipation of twenty millions of Sclavonic serfs. Why should not Prince COUZA imitate, at an humble distance, his great contemporary, and break the bonds of his Roumanian peasants? Well, so he has, and has just issued a proclamation declaratory of their freedom. In this instrument, which is in the form of an address to his people, the Prince assures the Moldau-Wallachian cultivators that forced labor is abolished forever in both provinces. ""From this day,"" says he, ""you are free proprietors in the places you inhabit, within the limit prescribed by existing laws....From this day you are masters of your arms, you have a portion of land which is your own property, and you have a country to love and defend."" The boon is, beyond doubt, of a most precious nature, and will, of course, be duly estimated by its recipients. But though the Hospodar deserves much credit for having carried out this great reform, and may, as the concocter and accomplisher of it, have as fair a claim to the title of patriot as some others who are in the enjoyment thereof, still it is rather questionable whether he was solely moved to undertake the work of amelioration by commiseration for the lot of the peasant. ALEXANDER JOHN was a politician ere he became a philanthropist. The paramount object of his life has been to emancipate himself and his principalities from dependence on the Sultan. The hour for striking the blow has not yet indeed arrived, but in the meantime, what better way could the Hospodar have gone about making, preparation for the contemplated struggle than by conferring privileges on the mass of his subjects, which have led them to regard him as a benefactor and father, and have endeared to them his person and his cause? An insurrection, with the people disaffected, or apathetic, and sustained merely by a hireling force, would overwhelm himself and his adherents with destruction, but an insurrection, supported by a people, ardent, enthusiastic, and ready to shed their blood in vindication of their right to autonomy and liberty, no power, at the disposal of the Moslem, could suppress. Taking into account then the ambitious aspiration of COUZA, and the evident interest that he has in strengthening his influence with the Romaniam Democracy, is it not perfectly allowable to assume that his measure of emancipation was as much the offspring of policy as of philanthropy? Throughout the management of the whole matter, in fact, the Prince has displayed a tact and astuteness which would have done credit to a veteran diplomatist. During his visit to Constantinople, he so wormed himself into the good graces of the Sultan, and so won on his enemies in the conference, that, though he was summoned to the capital as a criminal to answer for his misdeeds, he yet triumphed over his accusers, and obtained, both from his Suzerain and the representatives of the guaranteeing powers, full permission to carry out his project of amelioration. Verily, the Moldau-Wallachian Hospodar is a ""smart man.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prince Couza as a Patriot.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prince Couza as a Patriot.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f471a50e-9933-583e-93e0-9d12c0fbbaa5,559,nyt://article/f471a50e-9933-583e-93e0-9d12c0fbbaa5

MONTGOMERY BLAIR, as our readers already know, has resigned his position as Postmaster-General. We believe it is universally conceded that no one of his predecessors has surpassed him in the energy, ability and fidelity with which he has discharged the duties of his office. His resignation is due wholly to political causes. We do not credit the report that he tendered his resignation immediately after the Baltimore Convention, or at any other time, on the ground of any dissent from the policy pursued by President LINCOLN, and indorsed by that convention. On the contrary, that policy has had no more firm defender than he.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RETIREMENT OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RETIREMENT OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0df098b8-44b2-5592-a66a-1f2502844c3d,297,nyt://article/0df098b8-44b2-5592-a66a-1f2502844c3d

Recommendation for Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/26/archives/a-laudable-movement-in-our-advertising.html,Recommendation for Congress,"In our advertising columns may be found a recommendation signed by many hundreds of the most respectable citizens of the Third Congressional District in Brooklyn, in favor of the nomination of the wellknown merchant, S.B. CHITTENDEN, as the Union candidate for representative to Congress. It is a nomination preeminently fit to be made. It would be hard to name any civilian in this region who has contributed more liberally for the aid of our armies, or has more faithfully served the Union cause. And that we consider to be the very highest of all qualifications for public trust in these critical times. But to this supreme merit, Mr. CHITTENDEN unites financial knowledge, great general intelligence, and excellent speaking abilities. The method of nomination is as good as the nomination itself. Were the intelligent citizens of our great cities to make it their practice to designate in this manner their choice for nominatians, instead of leaving them to the manipulations of a few bargaining politicians, these cities would soon secure a more creditable class of representatives, both in our State and our National halls of legislation -- a representation which should be the most, instead of the least, influential portion of the body.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A LAUDABLE MOVEMENT.

"DEDICATION OF THE PASSIONIST FATHERS AT WEST HOBOKEN -- The ceremony of dedicating the new monastery of the Passionist Fathers at West Hoboken, took place yesterday afternoon in the presence of a large concourse of people. At present the main building (only) is erected, situated on Montgomery-avenue, near West Hoboken, on a high eminence of ground overlooking New-York, Long Island, the bay and far up the North River. The main building is built of granite rock, in the Norman style of architecture 102 feet front by 37 feet deep, four stories a[???]asement in height. The basement is designed for a dining-room, kitchen, carpenter shop, store-room, bath-room, [???] On the first floor are two parlors, porter's room, community room, public chapel, community chapel, tailor's room, &c. On the second floor are sixteen rooms, to be occupied chiefly by the supervisors of the institution and priests. On the third floor are sixteen rooms for the accommodation of the professors and students, and on the fourth floor the same number of rooms, to be occupied by the ""community."" There are also to be erected two wings, one to be 100 feet in length by 60 feet deep for a chapel, and the other 100 feet by 40, for the use of gentlemen wishing to retire for a longer or shorter period.

To insure such improvements, however, would require the active cooperation of the City Government with the association which has taken an interest in the matter. If the Common Council and the heads of the departments would some day take a ride around and visit the different buildings referred to, it can scarce be doubted, but that they would lend themselves earnestly to a work the success of which involves so much life, health and happiness. It is their duty to protect those who have not the means to protect themselves in the matters of choice of dwellings. They can do it by wise and careful legislation, and they can help much now by strict enforcement of the laws at present existing. The subject is a very serious one. Little attention has hitherto been paid to it, and the weekly lists of mortality show the result of the neglect. If owners of tenement houses would look at their own interests, to say nothing of that of humanity, they would find increased incomes from buildings affording the comforts and health sought for. It is well said by those urging the improvements: ""We plead for improved dwellings for our industrial classes. We plead for such dwellings for the sake of the general cause of health, virtue, order and public interest. We plead for them for the sake of the tens of thousands of children and youth now growing up in homes which forbid wholesome and hopeful culture. And we plead for them for the sake of multitudes of worthy wives and mothers, who would, if they had suitable dwellings, make their homes bright and happy centres of refining, elevating influence to all their families.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/39f05171-72cb-50d9-a6f1-e24aed84c5b2,310,nyt://article/39f05171-72cb-50d9-a6f1-e24aed84c5b2

The Dispatch asked, ""Will Georgia abandon Virginia now, after having dragged her into this war?""

Mr. GROVER announces that it has had the benefit of additional rehearsals, and that the costumes will be new being a part of those recently imported for the company. To-morrow night ""Don Giovanni"" will be played, and the German season will positively close. The caste of the opera is unusually strong, embracing the names of nearly all the artists. FORMES appears in his great role of Leporello, and HERMAN is the commandatore. Herr LEEMAN (a new addition to the troupe) is the Don Juan, and FRAULEUR DZINBA (her first appearance) the Zerlina. FREDERICI and JOHANSEN are the Elvira and Anna, and Herr HABLEMAN is the Count. Altogether the performance promises to be an unusually effective one.

"The congregation of this Church having outfit a new and very handsome edifice, on the corner of Thirty-fifth-street and Madison-avenue, and having sold their old edifice, corner of Twenty-eighth-street and Madison-avenue, to Rev. Dr. OSGOOD's congregation, the closing services were held there last evening. Rev. Drs. MONTGOMERY and HOUGHTON officiating. The history of the Church is one of the most interesting of any in the City. It was built some fourteen years ago by the congregation of Grace Church, called the Chapel of Grace, and intended for the many poor of the congregation who could not afford to pay pew-rent. The Rev. Mr. HARWOOD, now Rector of Trinity Church, at New Haven, was its first rector. In March, 1855, Rev. Dr. MONTGOMERY first entered the church as its rector. He commenced the performance of his duties with great zeal and energy, and has never flagged for a moment since, and his efforts have been crowned with the success they so fully deserved. Under his guidance, and through his efforts, the congregation, in about three years from the time he first came among them, purchased the edifice from Grace Church, paying them for it its original cost. Grace Church used the purchase money to build another church for the poor, in a neighborhood where one was much needed, viz: in Thirty-first-street, near Second-avenue, and of which Rev. Mr. DICSON is now Pastor. In March, 1863, Rev. Dr. MONTGOMERY, in his anniversary sermon, proposed to his congregation the building of a new church. The large and growing congregation rendered it almost necessary, and, in accordance with this suggestion, a meeting was sailed, and it was decided to build a new church, with the provision that $50,000 should first be subscribed by responsible parties. This amount was soon obtained, a site secured corner Madison-avenue and Thirty-fifth-street, and the new building commenced. It is now nearly completed. The new church is of the early decorative Gothic order, and is intended to seat about twelve hundred people, without the side galleries. It is built of Newark stone, the dressings and weatherings of Cleveland stone; the Chancel of Apisdal, and lighted from above. By its side is the organ-chamber, in which is to be placed a superb organ, manufactured by STAMBRIDGE, and to cost about $8,000. The organ, and a lot of ground valued at about $2,000, is a gift from one member of the congregation. The wheel of the organ is to be turned by a running stream of water, a new style, and one which it is said will produce a greater evenness of sound. A peculiar feature of the building will be a beautiful series of memorial windows. The Church is to have a spire some 185 or 190 feet high, and its cost, without the spire, will be about $130,000.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/26/archives/local-intelligence-church-of-the-incarnation.html,,"The congregation of this Church having outfit a new and very handsome edifice, on the corner of Thirty-fifth-street and Madison-avenue, and having sold their old edifice, corner of Twenty-eighth-street and Madison-avenue, to Rev.

Under his guidance, and through his efforts, the congregation, in about three years from the time he first came among them, purchased the edifice from Grace Church, paying them for it its original cost. Grace Church used the purchase money to build another church for the poor, in a neighborhood where one was much needed, viz: in Thirty-first-street, near Second-avenue, and of which Rev. Mr. DICSON is now Pastor. In March, 1863, Rev. Dr. MONTGOMERY, in his anniversary sermon, proposed to his congregation the building of a new church. The large and growing congregation rendered it almost necessary, and, in accordance with this suggestion, a meeting was sailed, and it was decided to build a new church, with the provision that $50,000 should first be subscribed by responsible parties. This amount was soon obtained, a site secured corner Madison-avenue and Thirty-fifth-street, and the new building commenced. It is now nearly completed. The new church is of the early decorative Gothic order, and is intended to seat about twelve hundred people, without the side galleries. It is built of Newark stone, the dressings and weatherings of Cleveland stone; the Chancel of Apisdal, and lighted from above. By its side is the organ-chamber, in which is to be placed a superb organ, manufactured by STAMBRIDGE, and to cost about $8,000. The organ, and a lot of ground valued at about $2,000, is a gift from one member of the congregation. The wheel of the organ is to be turned by a running stream of water, a new style, and one which it is said will produce a greater evenness of sound. A peculiar feature of the building will be a beautiful series of memorial windows. The Church is to have a spire some 185 or 190 feet high, and its cost, without the spire, will be about $130,000.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Church of the Incarnation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Church of the Incarnation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3075004-53a6-5a73-8bc3-40f42d46b4f0,1265,nyt://article/c3075004-53a6-5a73-8bc3-40f42d46b4f0

Victories in the Shenandoah,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/26/archives/the-victories-in-the-shenandoah.html,Victories in the Shenandoah,"On Friday Morning SHERIDAN, having pursued the retreating rebels from Fisher's Mountain during the night, found it necessary to rest and issue rations to his men at Woodstock. To that point the commanding general had pressed torward with the whole of the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps; General TORBERT having meanwhile pushed up the Luray Valley with a powerful cavalry force, intended to intercept the panic-stricken remnants of EARLY's men before they could reach Harrisonburgh. Much importance is attached by General SHERIDAN to this cavalry advance by his left. If TORBERT has rightly interpreted his orders great results are confidently promised. But even already SHERIDAN's victory has assumed proportions beyond his reckoning. The rebels, he tells us, after the attack on our position at Fisher's Mountain, threw down their arms and fled in the greatest confusion, abandoning most of their artillery. Gen. SHERIDAN does not believe there ever was an army so badly routed; and as an evidence of how complete is its demoralization, he finds the soldiers EARLY has picked up in the Valley hiding away in great numbers and returning to their homes. What the absolute loss to EARLY in men will ultimately prove is thus made difficult of computation, by the fact that the unwilling conscripts, no longer afraid of the Richmond military despotism finding the means or opportunity hereafter of enforcing its decrees among the farmers of the Valley, are eagerly taking advantage of the rout, either to get back (each in his own way) to their homes, or to get effectually beyond the reach of their rebel taskmasters.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Victories in the Shenandoah.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Victories in the Shenandoah.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8338762-d71c-59da-ac0b-c45b906efeaf,465,nyt://article/d8338762-d71c-59da-ac0b-c45b906efeaf

They have become accustomed to the casualties, of war, and know that unvarying success cannot be expected.

SHERIDAN was six miles South of Newmarket on Saturday evening, or about ninetysix miles South-west of Harper's Ferry. His men probably had ten hours rest at Woodstock. Certainly not more. What rations were served out to them, we apprehend, must have been carried in their knapsacks. It is barely probable the supply train could have come up with them before they left Woodstock. SHERIDAN evidently pushed forward to Newmarket in the sure hope that his parallel column of cavalry under TORBERT, dashing up the Luray Valley, would intercept the retreating army either on the road which crosses the Peaked Mountain Ridge and connects Luray Court House with Newmarket, or head them off where the Shenandoah Valley proper and the Luray join near Harrisonburgh. SHERIDAN's movements were doubtless turned to meet the conjuncture thus pre-ararranged.

We may look continually for a repetition, in every mode, of the Niagara attempt to get the President into a false position, by making him seem an obstacle to a reasonable and honorable reconcillation. This, in fact, is now the only resource of the Copperheads. They dare not charge, as of old, upon the Administration any inefficiency in conducting the war, in the face of the achievements of GRANT, and SHERMAN, and SHERIDAN, and FARRAGUT. On that score they are hopelessly silenced. Their shift now must be, not that the war is prosecuted with weakness, but that it is prosecuted without necessity.

The deserters, however, are said to have numbered but three hundred; the remainder of CORTINA's army having stuck to the fortunes of their chief on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. The original story, moreover, had this further foundation, that the rebels under FORD made an attack upon our small force commanded by Major NOYES, some distance from Brazos, after it had been joined by the Mexican deserters.

Denial of Cheers for Union Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/28/archives/the-cheers-for-president-lincoln.html,Denial of Cheers for Union Victory,"-- The Journal of Commerce takes upon itself to deny our statement that when the news of SHERIDAN's victory was posted on its bulletin, the crowd that gathered round cheered for President LINCOLN. We are not surprised at this, for the fact is a hard one for the Copperheads to get over. Certainly no one in the crowd thought of cheering for MCCLELLAN. But we allege again that the crowd did cheer for President LINCOLN, and if the Journal desires it the fact can easily be established by affidavit. And it is not hard to tell ""what made them do it."" It was because they felt that there was ""an intimate connection,"" as the Charleston Courier says, between Gen. EARLY's forces and the followers of Gen. MCCLELLAN, and that the defeat of the former made surer the defeat of the latter; because they saw the long faces and sour looks of the McClellan men around them, and the rejoicing looks of the Lincoln men, and because they knew that those cheers grated as harshly on the ears of the Journal as did the cheers for the Union which rang around the same office a few days after the fall of Fort Sumter. The Journal says its ""flag was simultaneously given to the breeze."" So it was on that same 17th of April, 1861, and just about as heartily. Instead of the idea of a connection between the victory and the cheers for Mr. LINCOLN being ""preposterous,"" as the Journal says it was, that connection was logically inevitable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHEERS FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHEERS FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'JOURNAL OF COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/491be61c-fed6-547c-b89d-c33700a5cb4a,347,nyt://article/491be61c-fed6-547c-b89d-c33700a5cb4a

Conference Closed,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/28/archives/the-confederation-of-british-america.html,Conference Closed,"The preliminary conferences of the delegates appointed to discuss the question of a Federative Union of the Provinces, have closed. Meetings of a more or less formal character have been held at the capital towns of the three Maritime Colonies, and the leading delegates who have been entertained at a public banquet in Halifax have partially broken the seal of silence heretofore imposed upon their deliberations. The sum of the revelation then is, that the scheme of Union, so far as it has been canvassed, is found to be practicable. The members present at the various conferences are united in their opinion as to the desirability of a Union, which, while it shall leave each Province a certain control in all matters of local concern, shall yet subordinate the whole to a strong central governing body. The general feeling is in favor of a federal system which shall designate the specific powers, functions and responsibilities of the local governing bodies; leaving all else to the absolute control of the central body -- our system inverted, as it were, in this essential feature. The whole scheme, however, is only yet conceived in the crudest form. Another meeting of the delegates will be held at Quebec, to consider something like a common basis of action for reference to the Legislature of each separate Province as they now stand. During the coming sessions of the Colonial Parliaments, the business of Federation will be dealt with in detail; and probably several sessions will be consumed in its discussion, before a final decision is reached.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Confederation of British America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Confederation of British America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad313dad-e878-566c-b789-d05bef3d1a56,778,nyt://article/ad313dad-e878-566c-b789-d05bef3d1a56

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. GROVER's short, but brilliantly successful season, came to an end last evening, when ""Don Giovanni"" was played to an extremely intelligent audience.

Fall in; and Prices of Goods,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/28/archives/the-fall-in-gold-and-the-prices-of-goods.html,Fall in; and Prices of Goods,"The ""crash"" so long predicted in these columns has at length begun. The currency, measuring by gold as its standard, has risen in value forty per cent. within a few days; that is, every person who receives money in wages or salary, or in any form in which paper is used, has nearly half as much income again as he had before. The purchasing power of the dollar ought to have risen forty per cent. So all who had accumulated stores of produce and provisions, or cotton and woollen fabrics, or manufactures, will generally find themselves worth forty per. cent less than they thought themselves. All values must fall which have been affected by the depreciation of the currency. Real estate will go down; stocks are already tumbling. Men that counted their property in certain stocks a few weeks ago, by the hundreds of thousand, must soon count by the fifties and sixties. It is true no one as yet can say, how far the railroad bonds and stocks represent, in their recent values, the immensely improved condition of the roads, and how far they are the result of inflated currency. But at present, people sell on the uncertainty. Government securities themselves go down slightly, though they have so much risen in real value, because people must have money in such times, and will sell anything. Many, no doubt, also sell ""Governments"" to buy into the very cheap railroad securities offered now on the market. Others calculate -- mistakenly we think -- on United States stocks being returned from the other side to be sold, before exchange has become so much in our favor as to make it a profitable transaction.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fall in Gold and the Prices of Goods.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fall in Gold and the Prices of Goods.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Gold', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d0f326e4-bd14-5a21-9a13-95aae7e5e257,777,nyt://article/d0f326e4-bd14-5a21-9a13-95aae7e5e257

Rebel Peace Diversion in,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/28/archives/a-diversion-in-missouri.html,Rebel Peace Diversion in,"-- Gens. KIRBY SMITH and SHELBY, of the rebel army -- if we are to believe a variety of reports which we publish this morning -- have undertaken a diversion in favor of the Peace party in the State of Missouri. The statements of refugees and various nameless authorities from Pilot Knob and elsewhere, supply conjectural estimates of the number of the advancing rebels. These estimates allow a sufficient margin for possible errors. One story is, that the combined force of SHELBY & Co. ""will be from ten thousand to twenty thousand, with sixteen pieces of artillery."" Another ""refugee"" has information from Fort Pillow that KIRBY SMITH is encamped forty miles from that fort, with 15,000 men. This interesting news-dealer believes that SMITH's force is bound for Missouri. The story of the invasion altogether has a marine aspect about it. But such as we find it, it is the best election item the Chicago Copperheads have had since they constructed their platform. If SHELBY and KIRBY SMITH can keep their ""ten or twenty thousand men"" in Missouri till after the election, they will be all that number of votes the stronger when the returns come in. That is, unless Gen. ROSECRANS should meanwhile interfere with the arrangement, as it is not unlikely he may do. The militia of the State are called on to unite with the Commanding General in expelling the raiding force, be it great or small. And the expulsion of the electioneering party, we have reason to believe, will neither be a serious nor a prolonged task.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A DIVERSION IN MISSOURI.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A DIVERSION IN MISSOURI.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de75c67e-e8b9-54d2-97c7-eeda46a0033c,260,nyt://article/de75c67e-e8b9-54d2-97c7-eeda46a0033c

Six stands, including one German stand, were erected for the accommodation of speakers, and all of them were surrounded, from 8 o'clock until 10 with a crowd of eagre listeners, who rent the air with one continual cheer for the Union candidates, and for the sentiments uttered by the speakers. Each of the stands was surrounded by a row of Chinese lanterns, on which were inscribed the names of the National and State candidates, together with appropriate mottos, such as, ""The Union and the Constitution,"" ""The Union and Liberty. ""All men are born equal."" ""SHERMAN and HOOKER,"" ""GRANT and FARRAGUT."" etc. About nine o'clock the ward processions commenced pouring info the square, and soon filled the entire space between the various stands with one compact mass of humanity. First came the ""Sixteenth Ward Union War Eagle,"" bearing in front a large banner with a spread eagle in the centre, around which was the following inscription: -- ""The Old Game-Cock -- No White Feathers in my Tail."" Next came the ""Nineteenth Ward War Eagles,"" headed by three Express wagons, each drawn by six horses and filled with the Union patriots bearing aloft the banners of their candidates. The first wagon mounted a brass cannon which belched forth at intervels its war sentiments in thundering tones, to the great dismay of a mob of Peace Democrats who had spent the fore part of the evening in trying to interrupt the various speakers and quench the general enthusiasm by their feeble groans. So disgusted were they with the demonstration of the Nineteenth Warders, that they retreated to a corner grocery over on the Third-avenue, where, for the remainder of the evening, they entertained a collection of forty or fifty boys with cheers for MCCLELLAN, VALLANDIGHAM, JEFF. DAVIS, and others of that ilk, interspersed with coarse and obscene slang about the Union candidates. Among the other processions which followed the Nineteenth Warders were the ""Eighteenth Ward Lincoln and Johnson Club,"" the ""Twelfth Ward Union Club,"" the ""Twenty-second Ward Lincoln and Johnson Club,"" the ""Twenty-second Ward German Union Club,"" and various other organizations, all bearing significant and appropriate banners.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/29/archives/killing-with-kindness.html,,"If everybody would ""let well enough alone,"" and not officiously or otherwise seek to mend it, everybody would be better off. While not impugning the charitable motives of certain ladies and gentlemen who insist on voluntarily visiting the different United States hospitals hereabouts, and distributing fruit and other luxuries to the sick, their good sense and discretion are open to severe criticism. They do actual injury by a well meant but ignorant application of their charity. There is nothing wanted in any of the United States hospitals, either in the way of comforts, luxuries, or aught else, that the United States Government does not liberally supply; and as to the surgical and medical care, the nursing and the attendance, these are conceded to be of the very best. It is to be presumed that the surgeons in charge know better the condition of their patients and their requirements than occasional philanthropic visitors, who have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to inform themselves of the particulars and condition of individual cases. They visit the hospitals certainly with the best intentions, loaded down with fruit, jams, jellies, &c., etc., and indiscriminately and profusely turn them over to the sick, when in many cases such are of immediate and positive injury. We know of two instances of death caused by this thoughtless philanthropy. The Government, as we have said, furnishes all things in profusion -- fruit, vegetables, preserves, &c., &c., and they are dealt out to the patients with all the liberality their cases will admit of. No more tender care could be taken of the soldiers, nor more solicitude exhibted for them, and it is to be doubted if as much, by these well-meaning but indiscreet and touchey outsiders of either gender, than is evinced and exhibited by the U.S. officers in charge of them. This meddlesome intrusion, well-meaning it is, works no good, but actual harm, and we notice lately has induced a very untruthful and ungenerous reflection on our Government and its officers, in a paper which, were it better posted as to the facts, would better post the public on them.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Killing with Kindness.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Killing with Kindness.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/404f9255-e1dc-56f3-86f4-0c46455cf36b,353,nyt://article/404f9255-e1dc-56f3-86f4-0c46455cf36b

The Chicago platform suits it to a dot, or rather, it lacks about a dot of suiting it. The Chicago declaration, that the war has been a total failure, is totally true. The declaration for an immediate cessation of hostilities, is at once consoling and noble. The proposition for an armistice is the proper thing to propose. The covert disunionism of the platform is admirable, as far as it goes, only it should not have been covert. Had Chicago boldly pronounced for disunion per se, it would have been altogether good; had it pronounced in favor of the next disruption after the present one, it would have been still better; had it pronounced in favor of a division of the great Republic into five, or twenty-five independent ""Governments,"" after the plan drawn up by ""Sir BULWER,"" it would have been as perfect as anything emanating from the Northern States of America.

Capt. WOOD will be found to be a fine specimen of a peace rebel; -- one, moreover, who sets about his business in a truly christian and piratical spirit. It was Sunday, the 7th of August, when he started from Wilmington; and the historian of the Tallahassee tells us at the outset in most unctuous phrase, that it was a ""calm quiet Sabbath day, and Capt. WOOD read service on the quarter deck to all hands."" It seems to have been an occasion, too, for special thanksgiving; for, though half a dozen steamers gave chase to the pirate during the day, he providentially escaped. Prayers were in order also on Wednesday, for during a great portion of that day, if this pious narrator is to be believed, the Tallahasee had, by mistake, given chase to a United States frigate, only discovering that the anticipated prize was an armed man-of-war when the pursuer and the pursued were alongside of each other!

We commend to such a closer consideration than has yet been given, of that article of the Chicago Platform relating to a ""Convention of the States."" They are bound to conclude that the Platform of their party will essentially determine its policy, if it should come into power. The Peace-Democracy, having possession of the Government, will call a Convention of the States. But why do they propose this? Why was the measure made one of the resolutions of Chicago? It manifestly was not offered merely that an amendment of the Constitution could be discussed and passed -- some amendment, for instance, guaranteeing the power of Slavery. There were simpler methods of accomplishing this, laid down in the Constitution. Conventions in each of the States and votes of the Legislatures would have been the more natural and safer mode for attaining this end. Neither could it have been intended as a means of restoring the authority of the Union over the disaffected States. A Convention of the States would not secure this; would rather have brought about the opposite, for it would seem to agree with the very idea of Secession, that the States were everything, and the Union nothing.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Word to Candid Democrats.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Word to Candid Democrats.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'CHICAGO', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5aca1d75-f081-5a85-b723-33ce0c7ab826,703,nyt://article/5aca1d75-f081-5a85-b723-33ce0c7ab826

When all the facts of this case are taken into consideration, it would seem that attempts to murder in this City are (pecuniarily) matters of very small importance. If there be any truth in the statements of impartial witnesses, Dr. ZACHARIE, at the time his life was sought, was seated quietly in his parlor, reading a morning paper, when unannounced the accused suddenly confronted him and demanded the rendition of certain documents which belonged to him, but which had been for sometime in the Doctor's possession. While the Doctor was at his bookcase, and in the act of complying with the demand, the accused, standing scarcely an arm's length from him, exclaimed. ""I'll have my revenge,"" or words to that effect, and deliberately fired twice at the Doctor, the last ball from the pistol taking effect in the face of the assaulted party. The wound was at first thought mortal, but, although the surgeon has not succeeded in finding the ball, the injured man is slowly recovering. The release of the accused on so small bail has occasioned much surprise among those who are cognizant of the facts of the case; for it is argued that if he is guilty of a gross attempt to murder, the bond should have been in a much larger sum; and if, as has been intimated, he is insane, he should not be allowed his liberty either with or without bail.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATE SHOOTING AFFRAY IN BROADWAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LATE SHOOTING AFFRAY IN BROADWAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bff0e2e8-aa39-54f8-abce-6df55c6b3f28,266,nyt://article/bff0e2e8-aa39-54f8-abce-6df55c6b3f28

Dispatches this morning announce his arrival at Harrisonbugh on Monday last, and his intention to follow up EARLY, who was hastening toward Staunton, which point, it was thought, our army would reach on Tuesday evening. In two of Gen. SHERIDAN's dispatches concerning the victory of Thursday last, he stated that the total rout of EARLY's army depended upon Gen. TORBERT, who, with two divisions of cavalry, had been sent up the Luray Valley to strike the rebel flank or rear. But it seems that TORBERT met the rebel cavalry near Luray Court-house, and he was ,delayed until he could defeat them, which he did on Saturday Last; but the delay gave EARLY an opportunity to get out of reach, and, consequently, our cavalry effected a junction on Sunday with SHERIDAN's infantry force, near Newmarket, in the main valley.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Valley Campaign.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Valley Campaign.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de6ca577-4175-5d88-82a4-068113e51131,241,nyt://article/de6ca577-4175-5d88-82a4-068113e51131

It instances the case Of WILLIAM LYON MACKENZIE, in 1837, as one in which the surrender of a political fugitive was refused by the United States; but it conceals from its readers the fact that there is nothing approaching to a parallel in the two cases. MACKENZIE was claimed by the British Government on the ground of his having committed a mail robbery before he had taken refuge here. The refusal to surrender him was based on the fact, that at the time of the alleged robbery he was leading an armed band of insurgents, to whom the possession of the Government mail bags was an essential political gain.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/30/archives/amusements.html,,"WALLACK's THEATRE. -- LOVEL's five-act comedy of ""Look Before You Leap"" was revived here on Wednesday evening with very marked and well-deserved success. Although not free from the usual stiltedness of the school to which it belongs, it is nevertheless a fresh and interesting work. The characters are nicely drawn, the dialogue is well distributed, and the colloquial points are clearly and sharply made. Such a piece can only be well played at one theatre, and that theatre is WALLACK's. The cast last evening was admirable. It had the special merit of introducing all the best ladies of the establishment, and of affording an opportunity for three gentlemen to make their first appearances. Several old members of the company also made their rentree on this occasion; notably, that delightful representative of old ladies, Mrs. VERNON, who, as Miss Brown, was as pleasant and active as ever. Mrs. JENNINGS, as Elenor Mortimer, was admirable. Mrs. FLOYD was received with favor, and her liege lord was a good Charles Rashleigh. These were the old favorites, and they have all good reason to be satisfied with the friendly recognitions bestowed on them. Of the new comers, Mr. NICOL MCINTYRE as the fop, Edward de Vers, made the best impression. His performance was well sustained and strongly marked throughout. Mr. WHITING, of whom we have had occasion to speak in terms of commendation during the early seasons of the Brooklyn Park Theatre, was the Henry Brandon. He is a quiet and gentlemanly young actor, who needs a better opportunity than was afforded to him on this occasion to display his ability. The part is both weak and embarrassing. Mr. WEIGHT, as Hardman, did not impress us favorably. His manner is somewhat too pronounced for the habitues of the theatre, but it is susceptible, we suppose, of modification. Among the regular artists of the company who displayed unusual exce'lence, were Miss MARY GANNON, and Miss HENRIQUES. We do not remember to have ever seen the last-named lady to greater advantage. The part of Clara is a good one. but aside from this it was not difficult to notice in Miss HENRIQUES, performance a very marked improvement on her efforts of last season. Miss GANNON was of course inimitable. Mr. GILBERT was very good as Mr. Coddington, and Mr. CHARLES FISHER deserves the same meed of praise. Indeed the comedy was charmingly rendered and will maintain a prominent place on the bills of the season. Its success warrants this presumption.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/390a51da-d822-5eeb-925a-d2d59d27e654,446,nyt://article/390a51da-d822-5eeb-925a-d2d59d27e654

The Cessationist Candidate,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/09/30/archives/the-cessationist-candidate.html,The Cessationist Candidate,"We are in the constant receipt of communications reviewing the military career of Gen. McCLELLAN. We must decline to publish them, partly because the subject has been exhausted already, but mainly because it has comparatively little to do with the real issue before the country. In the early days of the war, before our people had become accustomed to its character, when ten thousand men seemed an enormous force, and a man with epaulets who could ride a horse on parade was likely to be hailed as a great General, it was natural and excusable to mistake Gen. MCCLELLAN for a new NAPOLEON. But that day of early innocence has passed away. The glitter of regimentals has been tarnished. We have had since then too much experience of the realities of war to be longer deceived by its shams and shows. We have had Generals who could fight the enemy as well as parade their own troops; who could hurl fifty regiments of valiant men, like so many winged thunderbolts, upon the enemy, as well as sit in camp and calculate the chances of defeat or ride to the rear to look out safe resting-places for a beaten army. We have seen Generals who considered it their business to win victories as well as to plan campaigns, -- who deemed it their duty to support their Government instead of denouncing and assailing it, and who did not think that the art of war consisted wholly and exclusively in getting an army twice as large as they knew how to handle, and then whining and howling for more.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Cessationist Candidate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Cessationist Candidate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5824dcad-7036-5656-89cb-f216217c0d07,819,nyt://article/5824dcad-7036-5656-89cb-f216217c0d07

A visit to the rooms yesterday afternoon fully convinced us that the few people in attendance, were enjoying a pleasure which will delight thousands of others, if they will simply take our advice and attend during this the closing day and evening. The exhibition of pears exceeds anything that has been seen here for ten years, while that of grapes was never excelled. No person of a refined and beautiful taste will forego this exhibition; nature is most lavish in her productions and adornments this year, and should not be scorned by the indifference of our people. Three large rooms are devoted to this disply, and the number and quality of the various apples, pears and grapes surprises even professional fruit-growers. We have space to notice but a few of the prominent features of the exibition. A bushel of pears, the Duchesse D'Angouleme variety, exhibited by F.L. DUBOIS, of Brooklyn, are the perfection in size and appearance -- nearly as large as pineapples, and attracting much praise.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Horticultural Exhibition of the American Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Horticultural Exhibition of the American Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e7069d6-fb2b-5d10-8f7d-1fd7eebf9704,628,nyt://article/6e7069d6-fb2b-5d10-8f7d-1fd7eebf9704

SHERIDAN in the Shenandoah Valley. Yesterday morning two of our Army Corps on the James -- the Eighteenth under Gen. ORD, and the Tenth under Gen. BIRNEY -- took up their line of advance for Richmond on the north bank of the river, leaving WARREN firmly planted on the Weldon Road below Petersburgh, and the other corps of the Army of the Potomac located -- we know not where. It is generally known to the country that we have had a small force stationed on the north bank of the James, about ten miles below Richmond, ever since our army reached its present position at Petersburgh; and it will be remembered that about the middle of last month a large body of infantry and cavalry, under HANCOCK and GREGG, was thrown over to Deep Bottom, and forced its way, through heavy fighting, up to within six miles of Richmond -- the real object of the movement, however, being simply to make a diversion while WARREN seized the Weldon Road.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Grant's New Movement The North Bank of the James."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Grant's New Movement The North Bank of the James."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-09-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb4a9472-1d33-533c-a650-8a7e38ebc85c,412,nyt://article/eb4a9472-1d33-533c-a650-8a7e38ebc85c

The Richmond journalist draws from his recital of the facts the conclusion that history is again repeating itself in the case of SHERIDAN, and that it will be his turn to retreat anon. Be this reasoning correct or otherwise, it is worth while to recall the leading events in SHERIDAN's campaign thus far, that we may see by what line of military action he has hitherto been guided. The same day that SHERIDAN entered upon his duties as Commander in the Valley, (Aug. 7,) Gen. AVERILL attacked the rebels at Moorfield, Va., and succeeded in capturing five hundred prisoners.
