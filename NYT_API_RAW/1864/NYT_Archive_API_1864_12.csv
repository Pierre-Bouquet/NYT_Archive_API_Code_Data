The Examiner, of the 26th, very frankly admits that if SHERMAN succeeds in reaching the coast, communication between Richmond and the southwest will be entirely severed, and with still greater Frankness, says when JEFF. DAVIS ordered HOOD's last movement, he sent that army from where it could confront the enemy, and ""stuck it in the mud between Tuscumbia and Florence."" The Savannah Republican of the 24th contains contradictory statements as to SHERMAN's movements, particularly as to crossing the Oconee River. It says that the column operating on the Georgia road, kept the western side and struck off in the direction of Macon, as though contemplating a junction with the forces in that vicinity. It is stated that a strong force of cavalry is following SHERMAN. Some of the recently exchanged prisoners have reached Washington. They say that when they arrived at Savannah from Millen, they were kindly treated and furnished with the best food which could be procured, and that the people intimated that there were forces under BEAUREGARD and JOHNSTON at Macon and Augusta, to oppose SHERMAN; but they did not believe he would encounter them, or that the military authorities would in time decide where to concentrate the forces they had.

Upon the coffin was a laurel wreath and a cross formed of white flowers -- fit emblems of the purity of the life of the deceased. The services were opened by Prof. FITCH, who read the 520th hymn, commencing, ""Forever with the Lord. so Jesus let it be."" Prof. CLARK, Pastor of Yale. then read appropriate portions of Scripture, after which President WOOLSEY, of Yale, delivered the eulogy.

Richmond Rebels Silent About,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/01/archives/the-rebels-on-sherman.html,Richmond Rebels Silent About,"The Richmond rebels are now practicing the austere virtue of silence in reference to the movements of Gen. SHERMAN. They do this for our sake. They are anxious we should not share with them the ""good news"" they claim to be in possession of. They are anxious we should not find out the disasters that have overtaken SHERMAN. What damage it would do the Confederate cause to inform us of our ill fortunes, they do not say. Perhaps they do not wish to let the disastrous news out in dribblets; but may mean to hold the whole back until they can overwhelm and crush us by the revelation of some such awful fate as they have predicted for SHERMAN, in the whole of his army being turned over as prisoners to the keeping of ""Hog WINDER."" It is true, the Examiner has already considerately informed us that ""several dispatches concur in the declaration that SHERMAN's army is ruined;"" but then, SHERMAN's army, as well as our other armies, are so accustomed to being ruined by and in rebel columns, that it could not be expected we would be either greatly depressed or greatly benefited by another repetition of a circumstance of such trifling account -- especially when neither the time, the place, nor any of the details of ruin are given. It might, indeed, have produced a slight effect had the Examiner stopped short in its narration of news with the solitary sentence we have quoted. Had it, say under the dark caption of ""Ruin,"" simply and baldly proclaimed in startling type, ""SHERMAN's army is ruined,"" there would have been a gloomy mystery and a mysterious gloom; there would have been a horror and a hopelessness surrounding the grim sentence, that, it must be supposed, would have had an influence upon the minds of, at least, Wall-street bears. But even this is thoughtlessly prevented by the want of logic and consistency in the Richmond rebel paper; for, in a paragraph following the paragraph of ruin, there is a timidly and dubiously expressed rebel hope, which gets into print, that ""SHERMAN will be brought to grief ere he reaches the sea-coast.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebels on Sherman.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebels on Sherman.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7893869f-567c-5983-ab5b-b763f8378b8c,644,nyt://article/7893869f-567c-5983-ab5b-b763f8378b8c

OGDEN & Co., situated on Hubert-street, and extending through from Washington to West street. The yard was closely stored with mahogany and other valuable lumber and owing to its highly combustible state, the flames spread rapidly. Notwithstanding the prompt and vigorous efforts of the firemen and police to stay them. In a short time lumber and other property, valued at $80,000, was destroyed. The fire thence extended to the buildings Nos. 386, 388, 392, and 396 Washington-street, which were destroyed. Quite a number of families have thereby been rendered houseless. The aggregate loss will exceed $100,000. Messrs. OGDEN & Co. are insured for $69,000 in various city companies, There is no doubt but that the fire was the work of incendiaries.

But, in one particular, we think, he has done scarcely justice to one section of the British aristocracy. There is no doubt that the great body of the privileged land class in Engand strongly sympathize with the slaveowners of the South, and sympathize from a regard to their own order. But there is equally little reason to doubt that several of the very foremost men of rank have been cordial well-wishers of the Union and freedom, from the commencement of the rebellion. We need but instance the Duke of ARGYLE, LORD DALHOUSIE, and the late Sir GEORGE CORNWALL LEWIS. Among the great moneyed men of the United Kingdom, too, it is perhaps well not to forget such friendly names as the late Sir WILLIAM BROWN, of Liverpool, Mr. THOMAS BARING, of London, and the famous BAXTERS, of Dundee.

When DAVIS sent, and [???] the only army apparent in the country off his [???]ders, and carried it through the mountains to stick [???] in the mud between Tuscumbia and Florence, SHERMAN determined to make an attempt on the lines of communication between Virginia, the Carolinas, and the rest of the Confederate States. His work in Northern Georgia was done, and for ulterior operations any point on the sea-coast would be a better base than Chattanooga. He risked much in appearance, but perhaps little in reality, by destroying his communications.

If the reader will glance at the map, he will perceive that when SHERMAN has passed from Chattanooga to Atlanta, and thence to Beaufort he will have severed every railroad between Georgia and Virginia. This severance will be easily repaired; but if he can establish himself permanently at Beaufort; he may be able to operate against those roads repeatedly.

It appears that about 4 o'clock A.M., Officer WILLIAM BROWN, of the Forty-first Precinct Police, observed a man hearing a large bundle walking along Court-street, near the City Hall. He also noticed that he made no noise in walking; in fact, his footsteps could not be heard, so quietly he moved, although going along at a brisk pace, as if in a hurry. The officer at once suspected his real character and conducted him to the Station-house. On searching his person an auger and saw were found secreted under the waist of his coat. His shoes were examined and found to be of cloth, but on over his boots, the object being to make no noise while going about a house. He gave his name as EDWARD FITZGERALD.

And we think we may well felicitate that body on its having reached a rational conclusion at its yesterday's session, in the matter of the communication of the merchants of Bahia respecting the capture of the Florida. To have returned that communication, as some ardent speakers recommended, because it came through the hands of the British Consul at Bahia, would not have well comported with the dignity of the chamber. And even the fact that the communication in question contained positive misstatements, could hardly be said to justify its summary rejection. The merchants of Bahia, doubtless, offered their remonstrance, believing that what they stated was true. And their employment of the agency of the British Consul does not appear to have involved anything beyond getting his official certificate for the genuineness of the signatures appended to the letter. It was, therefore, all things considered, a wise and judicious course to refer the letter to a committee, so that its allegations might be calmly considered, and an answer framed which should not discredit the character of the foremost commercial chamber on the continent. Passionate appeals or petulant decisions are but indications of weakness in any deliberative body. They could not emanate from a chamber of eminent merchants without a serious reflection on their discretion.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE FLORIDA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE FLORIDA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/724e340a-1da8-5a51-8619-e1ec15bf68ec,247,nyt://article/724e340a-1da8-5a51-8619-e1ec15bf68ec

Registration of Southerners Necessary,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/02/archives/the-registration-of-southerners.html,Registration of Southerners Necessary,"-The order issued by Major-Gen. DIX, in October, among other regulations, laid down this: ""All persons from the insurgent States now within the department, or who may come within it on or before the 3d of November, proximo, are hereby required to report themselves for registry on or before that day."" The order of last Saturday, requiring all new comers from the insurgent States to report themselves, does not at all exempt the older sojourners from this duty. We are glad to learn that the duty is to be enforced upon the thousands of the latter who have neglected it. Serious consequences will result to them from its further disregard. The public safety requires that the amount of the Southern population in our city should be known, and also what proportion of it recognize loyal obligations. It is certain that the rebel malice which lately attempted to lay the boat portion of our city in ashes, still exists in all its intensity. Nothing short of the utmost precaution can guard against its further work; and, to that end, it is first of all important to learn who these rebel enemies in our city are, and where they keep themselves. Surely loyal Southerners -- and we cheerfully recognize that there are some such -- must be glad of an opportunity thus publicly to attest their real disposition, and to save themselves from being confounded with our public enemies. So far as concerns the latter, they would have no right to complain were the requirement ten-fold more severe. Nothing but extreme magnanimity tolerates them at at all within the loyal lines. Let them take heed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REGISTRATION OF SOUTHERNERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REGISTRATION OF SOUTHERNERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a43592c4-3262-51c1-aa1c-c4935553b52f,273,nyt://article/a43592c4-3262-51c1-aa1c-c4935553b52f

It is twelve days since SHERMAN'S advance of cavalry reached the Oconee River, and since that time we have had no definite intelligence of the whereabouts of his army, though we have learned of the appearance of small bodies of our troops at various towns east and west of that stream. The enemy have withheld all news from us, and no couriers from SHERMAN have arrived at any point within our lines, either on the seaboard or in Tennessee. The rebel press only made absurd but ineffectual attempts to play upon the fears of the North, by representing that the people of Georgia had risen en masse, and obstructed SHERMAN's advance by felling trees, burning bridges, and destroying supplies; that clouds of their cavalry were hovering around and harrassing his flanks and rear, and heavy bodies of troops were ready to contest the possession of Macon, Augusta and Millen, while a great army was being concentrated in his front upon the lower Savannah, prepared to demolish him utterly when he approached, if he were not utterly demolished long before he got anywhere near the seaboard.

We have no idea, that he will undertake to attack Gen. THOMAS, heavily reinforced by SMITH's corps, and posted in one of the strongest Federal fortresses. Neither do we suppose he will attack Murfreesboro,' which is a most thoroughly-defended stronghold. Probably he will move to the south, cut the railroad to Chattanooga, burn the bridges over the Tennessee, raid through that portion of the State, and then, breaking loose from his base at Florence, turn easterly toward Knoxville. He can easily feed 30,000 men in the country at this season of the year, and when he reaches the region beyond Knoxville, he can have a new base in Virginia and unite with BRECKINRIDGE's victorious corps.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Hood in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Hood in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0fc796c8-76f2-5c5b-8b71-d923f5bb54fe,474,nyt://article/0fc796c8-76f2-5c5b-8b71-d923f5bb54fe

The ship Great Western was detained at Liverpool on suspicion that her passengers had been recruited by Federal agents for the military service of the United States. The Great Western had four or five hundred men on board, and was on the point of sailing when she was detained. The matter was referred to the authorities in London. The Liverpool Post of Nov. 18 says that SEMMES was recruiting men in that city for a privateer, that he had already sent off a number, and was himself to start for Gibraltar in a few days. The Southern correspondent of the London Times, writing September 23, from Columbia, N.C., admits that the drain of the war on men in the South had been terrible, and was daily augmenting. The news of the Presidential election was awaited with the greatest interest in England. The capture of a British Navy officer in command of a blockade runner, has led to the issue of stringent orders from the Admiralty on the subject. The execution of FRANZ MULLER, which took place Nov. 14, was attended by disgraceful scenes of violence about the jail. At least a hundred thousand of the lowest population of London gathered to witness the death of MULLER, and our correspondent writes that every person worth robbing who entered the crowd was immediately lightened of everything valuable. A large number of persons were severely injured by the rabble. Just as the executioner drew the bolt. MULLER uttered a few words which have been taken as a confession of guilt.

She has a sharp eye for social weaknesses and follies, and a keen pen for dissecting them. Her range of vision is not extensive, but she possesses good sense enough to confine herself chiefly to the topics with which she is best acquainted -- the phases of society conspicuous in a New-England village or country town. We do not know whether she is popular, or the reverse, in her own, neighborhood, assured ly the picture of it to be deduced from her writings is not inviting. There is a hard stern realism everywhere apparent in her books that gives one the impression of having ""kept company"" with a highly sensible person whom we are not anxious to see again. The subject of ""A New Atmosphere"" is the endless one of woman's false position, her grievances, sufferings and wrongs, that arise from the errors growing out of our imperfect civilization.

On the 5th of September the fleet appeared off Simonosaki, and immediately commenced an attack on the Prince of NAGATO's forts, two of which were destroyed before evening. Next day, at dawn, the attack was renewed, and a storming party having been landed from the ships, several of the other forts were quickly carried. This so intimidated the Prince that, shortly after the revival of the conflict on the third morning, he dispatched one of the Japanese envoys who had been in England, with a flag of truce to the assailants, tendered his submission, and begged a cessation of hostilities. The request was granted on condition that the Daimio would assent to the terms of the victors, and thus the attack was brought to a close. The loss sustained by the allied fleet did not exceed 100 killed and wounded, but its loss would not have been so trifling, nor its conquest so easy, had NAGATO been supported by his brother Daimio, the Prince of KOKURA, who rules over the country on the southern side of the strait.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Japan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Japan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Japan', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5fd29cbc-eecb-5f9e-9eb2-ea9d16e1313d,596,nyt://article/5fd29cbc-eecb-5f9e-9eb2-ea9d16e1313d

SAMUEL J. CORNEILLE Rector of All Saints' Church, has been published. We extract the following eloquent passage: ""And yet there is something worse than war: national dishonor, cowardice, and selfishness: the decay of manly enthusiasm; the pusillanimity that shrinks from duty, because it is surrounded by peril. These are worse than war. If we must purchase peace at the price of dishonor: if peace means the cowardly relinquishment of every virtue and every right that makes man God-like; if we seek peace on the grounds that national prosperity and wealth consists in silk and cotton, in that thing men that call capital, rather than in noble, generous, high-souled hearts; if we must pay for peace with national virtue; if, to obtain it, we must surrender our manly spirit of heroic endurance, our conscientious convictions of duty and right; if this is the price at which it must be purchased, then give us war -- ""war with a thousand battles, and shaking a hundred thrones.""

History of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/04/archives/the-rebel-gen-cleburne.html,History of,"Major-Gen. PATRICK ROMAGNE CLEBURNE, C.S.A., was the second son of Dr. JOSEPH CLEBURNE, of the ""Grange"" Castle, Bellingham, Ireland. He pursued his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, and before their completion, entered the British army, but not finding a soldier's life congenial to his tastes, he resigned and turned his attention to the law. On the death of his father, CLEBURNE came to the United States and settled at Helena, Ark., where he commenced the practice of law under the auspices of his friend, Judge HANLY, of the Supreme Court of that State, and soon earned for himself quite a reputation at the bar of his adopted State. On the breaking out of the rebellion he volunteered as a private in the First Arkansas Infantry, in which regiment he was soon afterward elected Captain, and subsequently became its Colonel. Col. CLEBURNE commanded the rear guard of the retreating rebel forces at Bowling Green, and was commissioned a Brigadier General at Shiloh. He served with POLK at Perrysville, where he was severely wounded. On his recovery he succeeded to the command of BUCKNER's old division, and after the invasion of Kentucky was made a Major-General. He has held his command in the Army of Tennessee ever since, and was considered by the rebels one of their most accomplished General officers. Gen. CLEBURNE, though an Irishman by birth, was an intense Southerner in feeling, considering the South much oppressed by the North, though, strange to say, his opinions were anti-slavery. A cousin of the General's resides in Philadelphia, and holds a commission as surgeon in the United States Navy. His brother, WM. CLEBURNE, Esq., for some time connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as Civil Engineer, is a man of high moral tone, and of great scientific attainments. He, together with his family, remains true to the flag which his rebel brother had so basely and ungratefully forsaken. It is said that Gen. CLEBURNE has shown great kindness to such of our men as have fallen into his hands.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Gen.

By the pouring forth of life and means in a profusion unknown in history, we have acquired a domain from the rebellion whose importance to us could never be estimated in money, and we have gone far toward crushing an outbreak which, under a different system of attacks, might have lasted a generation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Retrenchment The Duty of Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Retrenchment The Duty of Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/402b4555-9e64-55b7-8057-455f644ba125,921,nyt://article/402b4555-9e64-55b7-8057-455f644ba125

It concedes that they have worked well, but thinks this is because they have little to do, and fears that, with more patronage and responsibility, they would lose their virtue. Possibly this might prove true; but the presumption is at least quite as strong the other way. The reason why our new police works better than the old one, is because it is more removed from party politics, more independent in its tenure of office, more directly responsible, and appointed in a way to secure better men at its head. The result of all these advantages is that it preserves better order than the old one. Would not the same reasons render it probable, at least, that it would also clean the streets better? Possibly it might fail there, but the chances are against failure; and the need of reform is so great as to warrant the risk.

From the testimony it appears that TIBBETTS went into a saloon on Seventh-avenue, between Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth streets, kept by the prisoner JOHNSON. He there called for a drink and paid for it. While he was drinking, he was suddenly struck a powerful blow in the face, and another in the left eye, by one of the accused, but which one TIBBETTS does not know. The result of these blows was to fell TIBBETTS to the floor, and rendering him partially insensible. While he was lying thus, he was robbed of his gold watch and chain, which have not been recovered. As soon as he was able, TIBBETS gave the alarm, and Officers MCGOWEN, KENNEDY, TRAINOR, GAMBLING and CONNER, of the Twenty-ninth Precinct, were promptly on hand, and arrested all of the persons above named.

Foreign squadrons were recalled, new vessels were built, the merchant service was called upon for steamers available as war vessels, the capacity of our navy yards was increased, the foundries and workshops of the country were put in requisition for supplies of ordnance and machinery, the number of seamen was greatly augmented, and the deficiency of officers supplied by judicious selections of experienced shipmasters from the commercial marine. The Secretary dwells upon the results of these labors, as represented by the stringent blockade of the Southern coast, and the victories achieved by STRINGHAM, DUPONT and FARRAGUT. He also refers in terms of eulogy to the exploits of our navy on the Mississippi and other inland waters, which are now patrolled by a fleet of more than one hundred vessels. The Secretary states that it has always been the policy of the department never to permit the efficiency of the blockade to be impaired. Hence no large squadrons have been maintained on foreign stations. Cruisers have been sent out from time to time, to protect American shipping, and to watch the predatory vessels of the rebels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NAVY DEPARTMENT.; Abstract of the Report of the Secretary of the Navy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NAVY DEPARTMENT.; Abstract of the Report of the Secretary of the Navy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'UNITED STATES NAVY DEPARTMENT', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ac79717-91c4-5bd7-a556-d8ff02c2732a,2696,nyt://article/0ac79717-91c4-5bd7-a556-d8ff02c2732a

Postmaster-General Dennison's Report; Report,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/07/archives/the-postmastergenerals-report.html,Postmaster-General Dennison's Report; Report,"-- The report of the Postmaster-General, which we lay before our readers this morning, is, in its most essential features, a satisfactory record of the operations of the department for the year. Its brevity is altogether commendable. The public want the facts, being, usually, able to supply the rhetoric for themselves. Gov. DENNISON has seized manfully on this truth, and the consequence is an admirable compendium of appreciable facts. The department stands well financially. It shows an apparent deficit of only two hundred odd thousand dollars, against seven millions in the times of JAMES BUCHANAN. But even this deficit of two hundred thousand dollars would be wiped out were the department not burdened with the franking system. If Gov. DENNISON took credit for the Congressional vote which is supposed to commute the franks, he would have half a million on hand after paying all his debts. And these financial results have been reached at a crisis when the cost of mail carriage, the price of labor, and all that enters into the outlay of the Department, have enormously increased, -- with no increase whatever in the rates of postage. The extraordinary fact, moreover, is presented in the report, that the department got nearly four millions more money during the year than it had estimated, at the same time that the miles of travel for the year had increased by over eighty thousand.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b0d6e54-8002-5929-bb43-79f096c816d3,232,nyt://article/6b0d6e54-8002-5929-bb43-79f096c816d3

Among the serious duties devolved upon him, the Secretary recognizes a full and clear exposition of that condition as first in importance, in order that the wisdom of Congress may provide a remedy for existing evils, and guard against the recurrence of similar evils in the future. The Secretary's assumption of office was so nearly coincident with the commencement of the present fiscal year, that he would be naturally impelled to begin by stating the exact condition of the Treasury upon that day.

The work of fabricating cannon has steadily progressed during this period of time, and 1,522 guns of the different calibre were added to the grand total. Few guns have been surrendered or abandoned to the enemy; nearly all the losses have been by the inevitable accidents of battle, as in The case of ??? and Commodore Jones. In the grand total should be added seven 10-inch solid-shot guns and three 13-incn Dahlgren gun. Thers are in process of fabrication a new class of 32-pounders and 8-inch smooth-bore guns, for the broad sides at ???: vessels. In regard to the composition of batteries, the general rule in arming our ships of war has been to place on board of them the very heaviest and most effective guns they can bear with safety. Nine-inch guns are generally used for broadside; 10-inch and 11-inch and the Parrou guns in pivot, the 15-inch for the monitor turrets, and the bronze howitzers and rifles for ???oat and deck service in shore. The efficiency of co???nc heavy pivot guns with broadside guns has been fully established. Whether a battery consisting entirely of heavy pivot guns would be more ???ormidable than one of broadside alone, the aggregate weights being equal, has not yet been tried, the only effort of the kind being that of the Niagara, which has a battery of twelve 150-pounder rifles mounted in pivot, and no regular broadside guns. The decisive power of the heavy gun in pivot was strikingly exemplified in the fight between the Kear??? and the Alabama.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NAVY DEPARTMENT.; Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance.

Nearly twelve months ago Lord LYONS, feeling the approach of the disease from which it is feared he is a hopeless sufferer, asked to be relieved. And we learned that he then expressed, informally, the wish that some one who had become familiarized with the existing crisis by a residence here, should be his successor. This suggestion would naturally point to some late or present member of the Legation at Washington as the probable successor. Lord LYONS' personal desire was unquestionably in favor of maintaining the same friendly relations that characterized his own incumbency as British Minister. And it was natural that he should look with special hopefulness on the appointment of some one that had graduated under his own teaching. It has been reported in tolerably well informed circles that the Hon. WILLIAM STUART was indicated in Lord LYONS' suggestions. Mr. STUART is a traveled man.

Lieut, MOWRY is, perhaps, the first living authority on the actual condition and mineral resources California, at the time when the Gadsden purchase was made, which would have brought this region into direct communication with California is much regretted, and has retarded more than any other circumstance the settlement of the Territory. A multitude of facts are adduced to show that the popular impression of the barrenness of Arizona and the neighboring districts are entirely unfounded, and that, though mining industry will always be the first interest, the agircultural resources are very great, and sufficient of themselves to attract the notice of emigrants. From this portion of the United States will undoubtedly be derived a great part of the world's future supply of silver and copper, to say nothing of gold.

"Mr. Geo. W. Vaughan, of Grand Rapids, Wood Co., WIS., writes: ""In the Fall of 1852 I was taken with a severe affection of the kidney and bladder. My strength rapidly gave way to the ravages of my disease, until I was literally nothing but a walking shadow. For the first five years of my disease my water was of a cherry red color. At times substances the size of a bean, resembling clotted blood, would pass off, and at others something resembling coarse sand. My sufferings were well high intolerable. I had taken your medicine only two weeks, when I felt a decided change for the better.

in Southern Georgia,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/10/archives/sherman-in-southern-georgia.html,in Southern Georgia,"We have news of SHERMAN'S army from Richmond papers of as late a date as Wednesday. It confirms the accounts we had yesterday of the march of SHERMAN toward Savannah, along the narrow strip of country that lies between the Ogechee and Savannah Rivers. The formation of this stretch of land is peculiar there being extensive and continuous marshes along the banks of both rivers, with an elevated ridge of land running about equidistant between them. Thus while our troops march along the ridge, both their flanks are protected by the marshes. It was given out, last Saturday, that Lieut.-Gen. GRANT calculated SHERMAN would reach the seaboard by that day; and now the Richmond editors calculate that he will reach Savannah today. GRANT's calculation was not far from accurate, or at least would not have been, had SHERMAN marched without stoppage; but it seems by rebel accounts that he halted his army for four days at Louisville, a little place about 110 miles from the seaboard, in order to gather in such forage and supplies as he required. The rebels still proclaim that he will have a fight before he gets Savannah. We suppose it likely that when, they found he had passed by Augusta without assailing it, they removed the troops which had been hastily gathered there, under Gen. BRAGG, WADE HAMPTON and the local Militia Generals, and hastened them forward by the railroad to Charleston and thence to Savannah, to confront SHERMAN. Beside the officers we have mentioned, there are at Savannah Messrs. HARDEE, DICK TAYLOR and GUSTAVUS W. SMITH. It is not unlikely that the troops under COBB, whom SHERMAN found at MACON, have been running a race to reach Savannah before our forces. They could take railroad from Macon as far as Loyola, and thence march to the Southern Georgia road, which would carry them to Savannah. In the meantime, we have not heard a word lately of BEAUREGARD, who announced to the people of Georgia, twenty-two days ago, that he was hastening to their relief. We should think that with BEAUREGARD, COBB, BRAGG, HARDEE, SMITH, TAYLOR, HAMPTON, WAYNE, WHEELER, and the score of other great Confederate Generals, who are gathered together to stop SHERMAN's march, they would make some strenuous efforts to prevent his getting into Savannah. We hope they will soon let us know what success they meet with.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sherman in Southern Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sherman in Southern Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/958a9f77-34e6-5b39-97e2-123de4c967be,395,nyt://article/958a9f77-34e6-5b39-97e2-123de4c967be

"It affords us pleasure to place before the public the following statement of Mrs. Jennie Duncan, a highly respectable lady residing at Bargettstown, Washington County, Penn. Such a testimonial, emanating from a source so worthy; is deserving of a careful perusal: ""I not only claim it a privilege, but consider it a duty I owe my fellow-mortals, to tell them what the valuable remedies of Dr. HAMILTON have done for me. It is hoped that some doubting, suffering mortal will, through the perusal of this, be led to apply to those who deservedly rank ""honorable as men and scientific as physicians."" For some eight or ten years previous to April, 1862, I suffered severely from a pain in my back, underneath the right shoulder-blade, sometimes extending into the right side. When my side thus ached I could not bear an article of clothing fastened around me. I had headache constantly, palpitation of heart, and was so very nervous that a strange footstep, or an unusual noise, would startle me, and cause me to tremble like a leaf, my heart beating audibly. But the most horrible of all my sufferings was a smothering sensation -- I could not get my breath. Oftentimes I have started from my bed and ran to an open window for relief. Indeed I was often afraid to lay my head upon the pillow lest I should smother. All the temporary relief I could get from this feeling was in being bled, and my blood was so thick and black that it would not run a drop unless placed in hot water. These, with many other allments, rendered me truly a miserable being. During this time I was running up heavy bils with eminent physicians. I had swallowed enough medicine to fill one corner of a drug-store, (at least so it seemed to me.) My back was blistered, plastered, cupped, and cold water applied, until I was heartily tired of it. Yet the pain was there, and there it would stay. About this time I was handed a paper containing the theory of Professor Hamilton's new mode of treatment. It seemed reasonable, and was corroborated by so many ""Testimonials"" that, although discouraged, I was induced to try it. I sent them a statement of my case, and in due time received their terms and diagnosis of my case. I inclosed the requisite fee, and received a course of their treatment. Before I had been under it two weeks I was relieved. No palpitation of heart, no smothering sensation, no headache. Improved appetite, sweet and refreshing sleep. I advise, day entreat, all those afflicted, especially those whose symptoms are similar to those enumerated in my case, to at once apply to Dr. Hamilton and ???e relief.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/10/archives/a-remarkable-case.html,,"It affords us pleasure to place before the public the following statement of Mrs. Jennie Duncan, a highly respectable lady residing at Bargettstown, Washington County, Penn.

Slavery in that great country dies hard.***Mr. LINCOLN has been elected by a party, which declares that slavery shall be extirpated, and they have returned to Congress the requisite two-thirds majority to carry the proposed amendment of the Constitution prohibiting slavery forever on the soil of the United Slates. The war must now continue, as it would have done under the Presidency of MCCLELLAN, but for higher and nobler purposes. It is for no more perpetuation or restoration of the Union, with all the enormities of slave-breeding, Slave-trading, and slave labor which formerly shocked humanity. The rebellion will doubtless be subdued, and in place of the fire and sword which usually follow in the track of conquest, the South will gain the blessings of tree labor, the crack of the slavedrivers whip will cease throughout the land, and under the benign influence of completed emancipation the Southern people will reap a prosperity of which they had scarcely dared to dream. Even, for results so conspicuously great as these the Northern western would not have been justified in ??? the ??? an aggressive war, but since the South chase the weapon and the combat, and sought to trample under foot alike the constitutional lights and to destroy the most cherished privileges of the people of the North, they would have been false to themselves and humanity had they not resolved to smite slavery -- that master spirit of civil discord and social wrong -- to the earth, so that the Republic might never more be subject to its malignant influence. Mr. LINCOLN has undoubtedly deserved well of his country. Few men could have grasped the helm with so firm a grasp during a civil conflict so appalling as that which now rates. He is, it is true, neither distinguished by hereditary descent nor by personal accomplishments; he was a bargeman and a day-laborer, and slowly rose to be a provincial lawyer by dint of those qualities of perseverance and clearness of intellect which have been conspicuously displayed during the last four years. He has been caricatured in this country by pen and pencil in a style reflecting disgrace upon the caricaturists, but which has failed to shake the popular belled in the thorough honesty of his character, the sincerity of his love of freedom, and the humanity of his disposition. His policy toward this country has been characterized by the utmost frankness and the strongest desire for peace, and no statesman worthy of conducting the affairs of this country but must be convinced that our best allies on the American continent are men professing the principles which ABRAHAM LINCOLN avows, and in consonance with which he has auther to directed the foreign policy of the Republic.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""AMERICAN AFFAIRS ABROAD.; The Re-election of President Lincoln in England Comments on the Florida Case The Great Western Detention Case Jeff.

Maximilian and the Mexicans,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/11/archives/maximilian-and-the-mexicans.html,Maximilian and the Mexicans,"MAXIMILIAN has completed his tour through the provinces of his Empire, and has once more established himself in its Capital. The reception which he met with during his travels, has inspired him with confidence and audacity. While away, his Majesty became cognizant of two important facts, of which, we presume, he would have remained ignorant had he not gone. The first is, that ""the Empire is firmly based on the firm will of the immense majority of the nation:"" the second, that ""that immense majority is desirous of peace, tranquillity and justice. ""These discoveries have convinced MAXIMILIAN not only that he is securely seated on his throne, but that it is his duty to confer on the Mexicans those blessings which they so ardently yearn for. Yet how can ""peace, tranquillity and justice"" be reestablished in his dominions, if those wretched incendiaries who still persist in standing up for republicanism, liberty and autonomy, are not put down? Hitherto the Emperor has shown that forbearance toward them that honorable adversaries are entitled, to, but now the Emperor declares that he will keep terms with them no longer, and that henceforward all bands of armed men infesting the country shall be regarded and treated as banitti; which means that they are to be tried by court-martial and shot, or hung, within twenty-four hours after sentence. This mode of dealing with gangs of robbers is, of course, well enough; but it seems rather premature for: a sovereign that owes his throne to violence and intervention, to doom to the gallows all men found in arms against his authority.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Maximilian and the Mexicans.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Maximilian and the Mexicans.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d80bc41-9871-5768-98f0-df76a15b16d8,540,nyt://article/1d80bc41-9871-5768-98f0-df76a15b16d8

La Marmoras' Speech on Franco-Italian Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/11/archives/the-italian-premier-on-the-recent-convention.html,La Marmoras' Speech on Franco-Italian Convention,"The most important and interesting speech made in the Italian Parliament during the debate on the Franco-Italian Convention, was that of Gen. LA MARMORA, the chief of the new Government. The candid, honest tone of the Premier's address, has inspired the nation with confidence in himself, and in the treaty under consideration. The terms of that treaty were not originally approved by the Minister; he was conscientiously opposed to them from an apprehension that they might tend to mar the work of Italian unity; but when he assumed office, and found the obnoxious instrument already completed and signed, he determined, after mature deliberation, and weighing of the arguments for and against it, to give the provisions thereof his cordial support. However repugnant the said convention may be to ardent patriots, there can be no doubt, argues the General, that it will prove, on the whole, beneficial to Italy. It will remove the French garrison from the Subalpine peninsula, and ultimately leave the solution of the Roman question to the inhabitants of the ""Eternal City."" The Italian Government and people will faithfully abide by the terms of the convention, and, in the opinion of the Premier, the party in the chamber who suspected that the Emperor NAPOLEON would not do likewise, did his French Majesty great injustice. LA MARMORA assured the House that the Emperor was at heart well disposed toward Italy. True, that personage once entertained doubt, touching the possibility of Italian unity, but now he is convinced that that unity is irrevocable, and accepts it as a virtually accomplished fact. Nor does it become Italians to be unmindful of the important services which NAPOLEON has rendered to their cause. Let it not be forgotten that it was he who promoted the discussion of the Italian question at the Congress of Paris -- that it was he who drove the Austrians out of Lombardy -- that it was he who initiated that great movement which resulted in the expulsion of those petty despots that formerly oppressed them. And, after such evidences of his friendship, is it generous, is it prudent, asks the Premier, to harbor undue distrust of his Majesty's designs? If Italians honestly discharge the obligations which the treaty imposes on them, the French Emperor, continues the Minister, will withdraw his troops from Rome within the period specified, and not only do so, but aid Italy, perhaps with all his moral and diplomatic influence, to recover Venice.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Italian Premier on the Recent Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Italian Premier on the Recent Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8941175c-f0a3-5a6c-80b9-ab7e3ee73761,576,nyt://article/8941175c-f0a3-5a6c-80b9-ab7e3ee73761

Whatever may be the exact point at which SHERMAN is aiming, there is no doubt that by this time his army is very near to the seaboard, and if it is going to have a serious action with the enemy at all, the event must be close at hand. In Middle Tennessee, again, it would seem as if matters could not remain long in their present state. HOOD is closely menacing the defences of Nashville, while he has planted batteries on the Cumberland River, northwest of the city, and his forces have also been found to the eastward. If he proposes to assault, his opportunity has come, and if he proposes to march into Kentucky, he could not find a better moment, though events may prove he could not have chosen a worse one. Beside the assault on the city, and a movement north of it, there is but one other operation in which he can have any hope -- a march into East Tennessee. If he accomplish neither of these, the rebel campaign will stand confessed a terrible failure and no hope for HOOD in the future. In Virginia, as well as in the far South and Southwest, our columns, this morning, bear witness that activity is again to be the order. The object of the movement begun by Gen. WARREN on our left rear on Wednesday last, has not yet been fully developed, but we shall presently learn its magnitude, bearings and issue.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Three Armies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Three Armies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-12-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8a171540-9e92-501a-9349-94f249814d4a,286,nyt://article/8a171540-9e92-501a-9349-94f249814d4a

But, what with the absorption of the time of Congress in settling the questions of taxation, conscription, the currency, and debating an endless variety of speculative measures, from the amendment of the Constitution to the girdling of the globe with telegraphic wires, the loud and all but universal demand for a bankrupt law was left practically unanswered when the dog-days had arrived. It was into June before the Select Committee had made their report. And, then, the measure, except by a small minority of practical men, was taken up in a half-hearted manner.

The fire, it is supposed, originated by spontaneous combustion on Tuesday last, and efforts have since been made to suppress it. There being no more evidence of fire yesterday, all was thought to be safe, but last night it burst forth anew in different places, proving that the entire pile was ablaze. The firemen have been engaged upon it from the time it broke out until noon to-day (Saturday.) The works were saved, but the supply of gas was cut off for three hours. Operations have since been resumed, and the supply will no more be suspended. The quantity of coal inclosed in the shed -- which covers three-fourths of an acre -- was 20,000 tons. It was imported from Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, being peculiarly adapted for gas making. It is bituminous, soft, and highly inflammable. Much of the coal will be saved.

But we are accustomed in this country -- strange as it seems -- even in healthy times, to much higher rentals, having regard to income. There are various reasons for the difference. But we may sum them up under two heads. In almost every city of Continental Europe and the British Islands, the landlord is content to get a smaller return for his capital than would satisfy him here.

"Mr. MARETZEK's second season is drawing rapidly to a close. It will end, so far as the subscribers are concerned, with the present week, but it is Mr. MARETZEK's intention to give a few extra performances in order that he may produce AUBER's celebrated opera of ""Fra Diavolo."" We anticipate for the work an unmistakeable success. It has always been a favorite in its clumsy English dress, and certainly must gain in popularity by the caste, scenery and costumes that will be bestowed upon it at the Academy. The past week was not a good one for amusements. The weather has been too much unsettled. Nevertheless the Fourteenth-street house has been well attended, and the performances have given very general satisfaction. On Saturday the ""Daughter of Regiment"" was repeated at the Matinee, and attracted a good audience, notwithstanding the snow-storm. Miss KELLOGG sang admirably, so much so that the Herald has taken back all that it said against her in a recent editorial. Nothing can exceed the variety of that journal's opinions, except their wildness. Signor SUSINI's Sergeant Sulpics is a very amusing and somewhat vociferous performance. Signor LOTTI was in good voice, and prudently avoided those upper regions, where disaster not unfrequently is encountered. Tonight ""H Trovatore"" will be repeated for the last time.

The Louisville Journal is pressing the slaveholders of the State to give it their attention. Under the existing state of things labor is rapidly leaving the Slate and will continue to do so as long as slavery exists by law. The State Constitution prohibits the emancipation of slaves without the consent of their owners, or without paying their value in money and removing them from the State. The Journal therefore urges the owners to consent to their emancipation, and to their retention in the State until labor shall become more abundant. Kentucky will speedily be compelled, by her industrial necessities, to follow the example of Maryland, and so will every other slave-holding State, even if slavery should not be abolished by an amendment of the National Constitution.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LABOR QUESTION IN KENTUCKY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LABOR QUESTION IN KENTUCKY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Kentucky', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd6ecb94-410a-5c00-843b-3055bdb2026c,155,nyt://article/fd6ecb94-410a-5c00-843b-3055bdb2026c

A man, who subsequently gave his name as THOS.

While he had him in that position, the robber slipped his hand into the pocket of the other took his pocketbook and ran down the street, shouting the familiar words of ""Stop thief! stop thief!"" Several persons witnessed the whole proceeding, but it was so startling in its nature, and so speedy in its execution, that for the moment every one seemed unable to render the gentleman any assistance. Senator BRADLEY and others, who were eye-witnesses, pursued the outlaw, had him arrested, taken to the Tombs and locked up for examination.

Operations in progress,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/13/archives/our-armies.html,Operations in progress,"-- There are a number of military and naval movements in progress at present -- of some of which the public are partially informed, and of others they are in ignorance -- which seem greatly involved and totally disconnected; but which, we think, will soon be found to be parts of one great and comprehensive plan. Four extensive operations, ranging across four great rebel States of the Atlantic slope, each operation having a bearing upon the others, and all looking to results of magnitude, are pretty sure to meet their consummation before Christmas. Of the object of Gen. WARREN's movement in Virginia, the public are as ignorant as they are of the whereabouts of Gen. SHERMAN in Georgia; but WARREN's movement is as assuredly connected with other great operations, which will in due time be developed, as FOSTER's movement on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad was connected with the great march of Gen. SHERMAN. By the way, we may remark that it now appears that FOSTER's late movement was not as entire a failure as it seemed at first sight. He was repulsed at Grahamville, but he destroyed the bridge ouer the Pocotaligo, which was one of the main objects he had in view.

And as little can any one doubt the consummate ability which marks his public utterances on international questions generally.-- No one doubts the perfect good faith with which Mr. COBDEN argues the question of non-intervention in presence of his countrymen. And as little can any one doubt the consummate ability which marks his public utterances on international questions generally. Mr. COBDEN has been addressing his constituents at Rochdale, on American as well as other affairs; and we shall all gather instruction from his arguments. But the mere intimation of the delivery of such a speech clearly suggests one pertinent fact as to non-intervention here. It is this -- and many of our friends abroad are apt to overlook it -- that the loyal people of the American Republic would as cordially resent an intervention in their favor, as they would an open or a secret alliance of the rebellious States against the Union. The strong and stout arm of the North can be upheld only by the brave hearts which cling with true faith and unshaken courage to the cause of a free Republican Government. When the freemen of these States begin even to whisper a desire for intervention in their own behalf, the cause of the Republic is gone hopelessly. The sentiment was well put in Mr. SEWARD's note on the Wharncliffe charity fund. Americans North and South, be they loyalists or rebels, the Secretary hoped, had too much self-respect to invite the commiseration of Europe. If this was giving too much credit to the rebel leaders, it was certainly no incorrect interpretation of the universal feeling among the masses of the population of this Continent, from Labrador to the Southern Cape, to be let alone by Europe, no matter under what guise intervention is proffered.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ADVOCATES OF NON-INTERVENTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ADVOCATES OF NON-INTERVENTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ae5cc832-d33a-5626-8f31-66dfa7159a6b,318,nyt://article/ae5cc832-d33a-5626-8f31-66dfa7159a6b

The attendance from an early hour became overwhelming, and by nine o'clock the majority of those present gave up the hope of examining the pictures, and resorted to the congenial occupation of flirting with the pretty girls -- for which timely diversion the body of the house seemed to be providentially reserved, and a band of music especially engaged. Nearly all the best artists of this City and Brooklyn were represented on the walls, the number of pictures exhibited being 162. Many of these were of large size and of true artistic importance. Indeed, from the largest to the smallest, we have rarely seen a collection that possessed such an average of merit. Landscapes and marines were in abundance -- for it is in these branches that our artists most excel. There were also many genre pieces -- most of them betraying a leaning to the French school -- of which, by the way, there was a superb specimen in the room by MERLE. In addition to the pictures, an extremely interesting series of designs for illustrations to LONGFELLOW's poem of ""Miles Standish"" was exhibited. They were executed by pupils (male and female) of the Graham Art School -- an institution which, judged by its results, is certainly fulfilling its mission in an exceedingly satisfactory way.

The total receipts for the week are, 6,245 beeves, 1,393 calves, 18,165 sheep and lambs, and 24,267 swine. This is a good supply, but all kinds show a marked advance in price, and more stock could readily be sold. The recent snow-storm doubtless reminds butchers that the supply is liable to be cut off by a blockade of the railroad, while the severe cold creates a greater consumption of meat. Under this stimulus the demand is such that holders easily obtain much higher rates. Beef has advanced a full cent. lb. on all but the fancy, which were at the topmost before, and on inferior grades the rise was still greater. Whole droves are reported sold at 17c.@18c. lb., estimated net weight, and one lot of 25 at 20c., with single bullocks in several droves at the same figures. Sheep and lambs are selling quickly at an advance of more than $1 head. Fat lots are worth 10c.@10 1/2c. lb., live weight, with a scant supply.

"The action of the House on the Bankruptcy Bill deserves emphatic commendation. The measure was brought over from last session for action on Monday.

United States House Vote to Terminate,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/14/archives/the-reciprocity-treaty.html,United States House Vote to Terminate,"-By our Washington news report, it will be seen that the House, by a vote of eighty-five to fifty-seven, have adopted a resolution giving notice of an intention to terminate the Reciprocity Treaty. It is, of course, competent for the House to pass such a resolution; but, if we mistake not, the time and mode of giving the notice indicated in the House resolution are matters of purely Executive action, in which -- as in relation to the invasion of Mexico, and kindred questions -- the House may properly suggest, but does not necessarily assume to dictate, a policy for the guidance of the Executive. The character, moreover, of the vote taken on this question, will show it to have been a vote of an almost entirely sectional character.

The announcement is rendered necessary by the forthcoming production of AUBER's ""Fra Diavolo,"" and not by any lack of interest in the work first named. Of the many productions that have taken place in New-York -- and nearly all have been at the expense and under the direction of Mr. MARETZEK -- few have been more creditable than this. Considering the uncertain duration of our operatic seasons, and the fact that there is no kind of reliable support extended to the impressario, it is really remarkable to find that one can be found who is willing to incur the risk of bringing out first-class artists from Europe -- who may fail, and yet have to be engaged for a stated period -- and of expending many thousands of dollars in the mise-in-scene of a single opera, which, after all, may not be acceptable. No man has done so much in this way as Mr. MARETZEK, and rarely with better tact taste than this season. The scenery, costumes and appointments of ""Don Sebastian"" are of unparalleled splendor. This fact alone will cause the opera to take a prominent place in the repertoire; and the music will not quickly be forgotten by those who have other tastes to gratify than that of mere spectacle. ""Don Sebastian"" is not likely to be again played for many months, for, after next week, Mr. MARETZEK goes to Boston. To-night, then, is, for a large class of people, the last chance. ""Fra Diavalo"" has undergone the tedious process of rehearsal for many weeks, and will probably be produced on Monday.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-12-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ddc8a506-17d0-5533-b2b1-863c9b68930e,951,nyt://article/ddc8a506-17d0-5533-b2b1-863c9b68930e

"By the arrival of the barkentine Teresa, Caps. AVERY, from Maracaibo, we have intelligence from that place to the 20th ult. Gen.

The plaintiff having closed his case on the first day, Judge Pierpont opened for the defence, saying that he felt, like Hamlet, that there was a special providence even in the fall of a sparrow. He had never struggled before to avoid the trial of a cause. He had sought to avoid the public scandal, the disgraceful exhibition of the immorality of public men which this trial must show. Mr. Weed had said that it was his duty, and he shrank not from it. There came a time in the history of all nations when the misdeeds of men in high offices had to be exhibited to the world. It would have been impossible to prevent the trial of this cause. It was one of those things that must come to pass. We had reached a degree of vileness and corruption in public offices, which made it necessary that something must come to pass to bring it to the light, and this trial was to be the means of uncovering the corruption of public men. He should exhibit there to-day a state of corruption in our public officers in this city that would be the beginning of a revolution here. God grant that it might be bloodless; but they would see there such a state of public morals that the necessity of a change would be apparent. Judge Pierrepont then read the libels, and stated that Mr. Weed had not made these statements without carefully considering the matter; that if he did not this day substantiate the statements, his witnesses would fail far short of their written testimony, sworn to before the trial.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Weed-Opdyke Libel Suit Second Day.; SUPREME COURT TRIAL TERM.

As a general thing, these salaries are now precisely what they were three years ago, while house-rent, clothing, food, and all other necessaries of life, have doubled in price. Either their salaries were too high originally, or they are too low now; as nobody has ever held the first of these positions, the second must be true. Thesalaries of our Government functionaries have always been small, not only compared with the scale adopted in other countries, but in view of the labor performed and the qualifications required. But, under the present exceptional and temporary state of things, it is absolute injustice to require them to live on what barely sufficed to support them three years ago. It is an injustice, moreover, which neither governments nor individuals permit themselves to commit in other cases. The wages of labor have increased, mechanics in all departments receive higher pay, officers and soldiers in the army have had their pay enhanced, and in every department of active labor prices have been advanced to meet the increased cost of living.

Let us here repeat in a word or two,the essential points of the order as given in our Washington dispatches. Col. MULFORD, who has been acting as the Union agent for the exchange of prisoners, and whose address is Fortress Monroe, is named for the special duty of forwarding supplies. And the list of articles which the agent is authorized to forward the loyal sufferers, include almost everything that can be supposed to minister to their material comforts. We are sure that we need not urge the importance of seeing to the immediate performance of the duty which this order makes at once practicable. There are thousands of households among us to respond with alacrity at the bare suggestion of an opportunity of communicating with the absent loved ones. And it is unnecessary for us, we feel assured, to do more than indicate the agency through which supplies can be sent to the military prisons and camps of the South.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SUPPLIES FOR OUR PRISONERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SUPPLIES FOR OUR PRISONERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c959349-f1b8-5174-8c76-3ea0c8be5cbf,198,nyt://article/6c959349-f1b8-5174-8c76-3ea0c8be5cbf

SHERMAN is thundering at the defences of Savannah, and has just captured Fort McAllister; and GRANT is busy with LEE, and has just, through WARREN, brought to completion an extensive expedition. As regards our lesser military bodies, we read of brisk movements on the seaboard of North Carolina; Gen. FOSTER is distracting the rebels on the coast of the other Carolina, and aiding SHERMAN; while the vast sweep and gigantic scale of our military operations is seen in the fact that we have this morning an official dispatch from Gen. CANBY, at New-Orleans, mentioning that he had sent out two expeditions, cooperative with Gen. SHERMAN, from Vicksburgh and Baton Rouge -- these points being over six hundred miles distant from the point at which FOSTER's small column is also cooperating. Beside all these movements, the official bulletin quotes from Thursday's Richmond papers an account of a very elegant operation undertaken by our troops in East Tennessee, in the rear of BRECKINRIDGE, in which movement, it seems, we have cut through Tennessee into Southwestern Virginia, and have penetrated beyond Abingdon, which the rebels ""presume"" has fallen into our hands.

"Your readers will remember, as I have stated the fact in previous letters, the mortality among the thirty thousand prisoners confined at Andersonville, Geo, became so frightful -- averaging one hundred a day during the month of August -- that the rebel authorities were compelled, in their efforts to defend the neighborhood from a pestilence, to break up that dreadful prison. Part of the captives were temporarily transferred to Savannah, where they were treated with comparative kindness by the women or the city, who are spoken of as having contributed generously to the comfort of the sick. From Savannah, after a sojourn at that place of about a month, these prisoners were transferred to a pen at Millen, which had been stockaded for their reception. The other portion of the Andersonville prisoners -- about 15,000 -- were sent to Florence, S.C., where their sufferings were only alleviated so far as this, that the prison-grounds were healthier, and there was more room to move about. The deaths at Florence from scurvy and diarrhoea, during the three months since the camp was established at that place, are estimated to have reached the aggregate of sixteen hundred. Here, as at Andersonville, there appears to have been no pretence on the part of the prison authorities of keeping a correct list of the deceased, and probably hundreds have been buried in unknown graves. Indeed corpses are said to have sometimes remained for as long a period as two days in the stockade before the small detail of negroes appointed for the purpose by the rebels found time to remove them for burial, uncoffined, in the pits they had carelessly prepared.

Part of the captives were temporarily transferred to Savannah, where they were treated with comparative kindness by the women or the city, who are spoken of as having contributed generously to the comfort of the sick. From Savannah, after a sojourn at that place of about a month, these prisoners were transferred to a pen at Millen, which had been stockaded for their reception. The other portion of the Andersonville prisoners -- about 15,000 -- were sent to Florence, S.C., where their sufferings were only alleviated so far as this, that the prison-grounds were healthier, and there was more room to move about. The deaths at Florence from scurvy and diarrhoea, during the three months since the camp was established at that place, are estimated to have reached the aggregate of sixteen hundred. Here, as at Andersonville, there appears to have been no pretence on the part of the prison authorities of keeping a correct list of the deceased, and probably hundreds have been buried in unknown graves. Indeed corpses are said to have sometimes remained for as long a period as two days in the stockade before the small detail of negroes appointed for the purpose by the rebels found time to remove them for burial, uncoffined, in the pits they had carelessly prepared. An appeal was then made by Sergt. M. HILEMAN, Company H, Ninety-sixth Illinois Regiment, to Col. IVERSON, of Georgia, who had charge of the prison, for permission to superintend the interment of the dead. This was granted, and from that time the burials were conducted with some decency.

This part of the coast of Georgia is of that amphibious character which marks so much of the Southern coastin general -- the raveled and unfinished ends of nature's web, where sea and land keep up a mutual warfare. The ocean breaks in between Great Wassaw and Ossabaw Islands, forming Ossabaw Sound, and into this estuary flow the Great and Little Ogeechee and the Vernon Rivers. The land or rather the march on each side of the Ogeechee, is almost a fleur d' eau, certainly hardly rising a foot above the level of the river, while at times it is entirely submerged. For miles and miles on every hand there is nothing to be seen but these low and level islands and islets, covered with reeds and rank grasses, save where a lustier vegetation has pushed up in occasional clumps of trees called ""hummocks.""",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fort McAllister.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fort McAllister.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ed8e64a-f028-5f6b-ac16-d445ed81f4ca,441,nyt://article/8ed8e64a-f028-5f6b-ac16-d445ed81f4ca

To meet the interest on this, a large sum is annually swallowed up, which it is desirable should be appropriated to the enlargement of the intellectual treasures of the Association. The library, which is open, at the smallest conceivable charge, to business people, from the humblest salaried clerk up to the leading merchant, is one of the most valuable in the city, alike for general reading and for special reference. It has conferred no common benefits on the so ber and thoughtful class of our young men, whether of the commercial or professional class.

We have a report brought by the steamer Varuna, from Charleston Harbor, to annapolis, yesterday, to the effect that Savannah had already been captured, with 1,100 prisoners, after eight hours' fighting, but this is not confirmed from any other source. Richmond papers report the capture of Fort McAllister on Wednesday, and if Savannah had then been taken, as it must have been in order for the news to reach Charleston so soon, it would also have been known in Richmond.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da5cb815-9a77-5e4e-a799-27c7a84d530c,859,nyt://article/da5cb815-9a77-5e4e-a799-27c7a84d530c

Municipal Privileges,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/18/archives/french-municipal-privileges.html,Municipal Privileges,"The municipal liberty which every American village enjoys, which every considerable English town possesses, is forbidden, under the empire, to the greatest cities of France. From Belgium to the Pyrenees, from the ocean to the Rhine, there does not exist, in the dominion of LOUIS NAPOLEON, a single community that has the right of local self-government. In all, the Mayors and provincial magistrates, instead of being chosen by the people, are the mere nominees and tools of the central Administration.

The plot is too slight to lead the spectator to a strong denouement, and it speedily becomes from mere thinness hopelessly knotted and tangled, so that midway one has already lost all concern for it. The interest thereafter depends entirely on the characters. These are pleasantly sketched, and more original than we are apt to expect in Mr. BOUCICAULT's jater productions. Not a jot of their freshness is wasted on the members of WALLACK's excellent company. Had the parts been tailored for the separate artists, they could not have fitted more exactly.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/19/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"We need not epitomise in this place the War Department bulletin of this morning, for it is in itself an epitome of victorious results that could not be condensed, and will assuredly be read in full by every man, woman and eligible child in the country. The bulletin comprises dispatches from both SHERMAN and THOMAS; and in both cases and in every detail, they are all that the most sanguine and hopeful patriot could desire. The fact that SHERMAN himself announces his trip to have been an ""agreeable"" one, unmolested by guerrillas, that he found abundant supplies and that his army was in splendid condition, disposes of the whole of the abominable rebel trash about him which we have been compelled to lay before our readers for the last four weeks. While the fact that he announces the capture of Fort McAllister and its garrison, and the complete investment of Savannah with its garrison of 15,000 men, and its population of 25,000 gives ground for his assurance that it is already as good as captured. It is impossible for the rebels to feed this population of 40,000 for any length of time. Gen. THOMAS dispatch is also itself an epitome. His victory of Thursday at Nashville he followed up on Friday, continued to follow op on Saturday, and probably kept on following up yesterday. He has now got the rebels below Franklin; and from all the dispatches we calculate he has taken full ten thousand prisoners. If this be so, he cannot have destroyed, in the three days, less than half of HOOD's invading army. Gen. THOMAS gives the outlines of several of the actions. The most important action, apart from those of the main army, is that of Gen. ROUSSEAU at Murfreesboro, in which the rebel Gen. FORREST is reported killed, and 1,500 of his men captured.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ff78f9d-07ad-5024-8081-5f541ed255bb,805,nyt://article/1ff78f9d-07ad-5024-8081-5f541ed255bb

There is internal evidence in the article that the writer has been more or less officially inspired. The argument is, that when the South has already come down so far from its independent stand-point as to supplicate foreign nations for help, it must be prepared to receive such help on the conditions on which alone it will be given, viz.; the abolition of slavery. If the Confederacy, moreover, agree to abolish slavery, the writer contends, it will not be necessary to go to European nations for protection; they will at once accord recognition to the South, and follow it up, if necessary, with forcible intervention. Minor arguments, based on the special military exigencies of the crisis, are advanced to show that arming and emancipating the slaves are not only measures of possible expediency, but that they are measures absolutely necessary to the continued existence of the Southern conspiracy.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/19/archives/van-amburghs-menagerie.html,,"-If we have not referred to Signor Victor (educated in Italy) in a preliminary way, it has been from motives of prudence. With every disposition to be valiant, there seemed, in this instance, a chance of becoming foolhardy. Since the advent of Signor Victor, the newspapers, the brick piles, the fences, the vacant lots, have bristled with fierce annunciations of his undaunted spirit; with galloptious rhapsodies on his own genius; with withering expressions of contempt for other people's infirmities, and with rather disturbing allusions to his skill in the use of small arms. Not having been educated in Italy ourselves, we have -- as a mere matter of honest pride -- longed for an opportunity of calling Signor Victor a humbug. What, indeed, could be more conclusive on the subject than the fact of his being educated in a country whose chief industry is organ-grinding, and principal export maccaroni. But we would have fallen into a grave error if we had given way to our patriotic feelings. Signor Victor is no humbug. He is an artist of rare parts, and is the civilest creature we have ever met. It does pot detract from the Signor's merits [that] he possesses a tall. As a tall, it is remarkably well proportioned, and curls gracefully at the end. In a word, Signor Victor is a monkey, and having been educated in Italy, is a credit to the Mother of Arts. He possesses all the natural graces of his kind, and many of the accomplishments of the two-legged animal. He is never tedious, however. Go and see him by all means.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""VAN AMBURGH'S MENAGERIE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""VAN AMBURGH'S MENAGERIE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ffe3d3b-f23e-562d-aa58-e376961fed54,267,nyt://article/3ffe3d3b-f23e-562d-aa58-e376961fed54

The news by the Hibernian is five days' later than that previously reported. A brief summary of the Hibernian's report was published in our yesterday's issue. Additional details appear in other columns this morning. The passage is reported to have been exceedingly stormy. Earl RUSSEL's reply to the manifesto of the Richmond Congress, which had been communicated to him in a dispatch from the rebel commissioners, is published at length. The sum of it is that the British Government think they best consult the interests of peace, and respect the rights of all parties by observing a strict neutrality. Such neutrality Lord RUSSELL declares has been, and will continue to be maintained. There are some new outcroppings of difficulty in the Dano-German matter, Prussia demanding that the troops of Hanover and Saxony shall be withdrawn from Holstein, leaving the protection of that recently-alienated State to the Prussian army alone. The Franco-Italian Convention for the evacuation of Rome was under discussion in the Senate, and Gen DE LA MARMORA is reported to have said that the Venetian question was merely one of vanity so far as Austria was concerned. He also protested against the supposition that France coveted any portion of Italian territory. A riot had occurred at a meeting at Bristol, England, on the occasion of an intended celebration of President LINCOLN's reelection. A crowd of rebel sympathizers attempted to break up the meeting, but they were ultimately over powered by the aid of the police, and expelled from the room. The ship Great Western, with a large number of supposed recruits for the United States army, has finally sailed from Liverpool. The law officers of the Crown did not see sufficient reason for adopting legal proceedings. The death of DAVID ROBERTS, the artist, is announced. The destruction of a great Liverpool warehouse, valued with its contents at £200,000 sterling, is announced. The British export returns for October show a great falling off. The French press (of opposite politics) are discussing the possibility of President JUAREZ commissioning Mexican privateers to attack the commerce of France on the high seas. Dr. WINSLOW, the American missionary, is reported to have died at the Cape of Good Hope. The case of the Rappahannock had been fixed for the 5th of December, to come before the Court of Queen's Bench.

Christmas and Holiday Literature,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/20/archives/the-holidays-christmas-and-holiday-literature.html,Christmas and Holiday Literature,"Did we not, each of us, possess in our own instincts inward monitors of the course of the changing seasons and the waning year, the booksellers' shops alone, would, in their present dazzling aspect, be sufficient to remind us of the near approaching festival of Christendom the holy season when the reconciliation of heaven and earth is symbolized by the extension of kindly sympathies and the increased glow of family affections. These emotions naturally seek expression through the interchange of gifts of whatever is rare, curious, and valuable in itself, or precious from its association with the giver, and to the gratification of tastes so laudable our storekeepers are only too happy to minister. The gauzy flutter of light Summer reading that marked the traveling season of the year at our book depots, has given place to the solid Morocco or Russia covered volumes, ""rich with burnished gold,"" that, ranged in tempting array, appeal mutely to those who love the best literature in the best possible garb, and can imagine no present of more sterling value for the one beloved object than the book over which they have hung enamored. There is something so consonant to the physical aspect of nature and the current of human feelings in the Calendar of the Church, that it is not surprising that its holidays and festivals should be gradually working their way into the general sense of communities but partially loyal to its doctrines and ritual. Thus, ""Christmas Day"" -- treated fifty years ago with comparative indifference and small respect -- now stands between the Puritan ""Thanksgiving"" and the Knickerbocker ""New-Year's Day,"" not detracting from their special observance, but tacitly felt by all to be the chief festive season of the year, and as such, the cynosure of the booksellers, jewelers and fancy goods' dealers -- the subject of their cherished plans and enterprises for months past, now culminating to the light of day. Our business at present is with the book trade, and, not to be deterred from our purpose of giving a few serviceable hints to the purchasing public, we must turn an unappreciative eye to the less intellectual splendor of Broadway, that require the poet's pen and the painter's colors to do them the justice they require.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HOLIDAYS.; CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY LITERATURE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE HOLIDAYS.; CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY LITERATURE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a430def-771a-54ea-a325-cd4bdb54d61e,3640,nyt://article/5a430def-771a-54ea-a325-cd4bdb54d61e

The Union and rebel armies have confronted each other for three years and eight months, and during that time the intervals have been brief when the Confederates have not had in hand, immediately or prospectively, some scheme for invading the loyal States, for removing the war from their own homes to those of the North. With more or less of force to back it, this threat has always taken a shape sufficiently definite and formidable to compel us to regard it in our offensive operations. Moving against Richmond we have had to look out for Washington, and in one instance the field of battle was suddenly transferred from the banks of the Chickahominy to the Potomac. After the captures of Fort Donelson and Nashville on the Cumberland, and while we were meditating a further advance Southward, we had to retrace our steps in order to cover the line of the Ohio against BRAGG. We defeated armies in the field, we captured armies in their strongholds, but new armies took their places. We flanked them out of their cities, and then they took their turn and flanked us, and we were forced to fight new battles on old fields. The vast extent of territory open to maneuver, facilitated this sort of military operations, which were repeated so frequently, that it soon appeared inevitable that an advance into the enemy's territory must be followed by a retreat. This led near-sighted military critics here and in Europe to pronounce the war hopeless. Where was to be the end of this alternation perpetually going on, of advance and retrogression? Evidently, cried they, in the exhaustion of both parties.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Latest and Last Aspect of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Latest and Last Aspect of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ced2877-c274-5db1-ba24-20f1f0709d45,780,nyt://article/5ced2877-c274-5db1-ba24-20f1f0709d45

Died in Southern Prisons; Necrology of Southern Prison Pens,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/20/archives/necrology-of-the-southern-prison-pens.html,Died in Southern Prisons; Necrology of Southern Prison Pens,"In our supplement, this morning, we print another long list of Union soldiers who have perished miserably in the Southern prisons. The record is a dismal one, but thousands today will refer to it eagerly, yet timidly, in the hope of assuring themselves beyond a peradventure, of the fate of those dear to them, and as to whom their minds have been harassed by conflicting hopes and fears. Alas! to many of our readers this list will bring the confirmation of their worst surmises, and others will turn from its perusal with a sense of relief on finding that the single name for which they have been searching in the long, black roll of the martyrs, is unrecorded. But for this class, although there is yet room for hope, there must still be torturing suspense. Our list is but partial, being transcribed, in the main, from the dingy scraps, uncertain notes and fragmentary records of the comrades of the dead, whose humane desire to keep the roster of the victims was frustrated for lack of the means. It seems to be a part of the rebel policy in the treatment of our captured soldiers, that the dead shall rot in unmarked graves -- that their names shall be blotted out with their lives. As far as we can learn, the rebels kept no record themselves of the deaths in the prison-pens, and supplied no writing materials to the hospital attendants, selected from our own men, thus putting it beyond their power to pay this poor tribute of respect to the memories of their comrades. Such meanness as this is characteristic of the Southern ""chivalry."" It could only be practiced by men who are utterly lost to decency -- by men who are so far oblivious of the instincts of gentlemen as to rob their newly-captured prisoners of hats, shoes or meerschaum pipes, or to steal the likeness of a wife and destroy it before the eyes of her husband, accompanying the ruthless act with the indignity of ribald remarks.

German Picture Gallery,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/20/archives/fine-arts.html,German Picture Gallery,"A GERMAN PICTURE GALLERY. -- As the holidays approach it is natural that our picture galleries and art emporiums should display unusual signs of animation. Paintings have long since taken their place as a favorite means of exchange between friends who desire to be remembered with the season. And in truth there is something both practical and poetic in this giving of genuine works of art instead of a trumpery exchange of mere articles of vertu. Almost any one would prefer to have a specimen of a painter who tinges the imagination with a sense of truth obtained in the contemplation of nature, rather than possess a thing of patchwork and mere mechanical skill, tawdry to-day and useless to-morrow. The desire for pictures, owing to this or some other cause, is undoubtedly on the increase. At the present moment, three extensive galleries are open to the public, and in each instance without the exaction of an admission fee. The first is GOUPIL's well-known establishment, at the corner of Ninth-street and Broadway. The collection is both varied and extensive. Without being limited to the French school, it is yet a better exponent of it than any other, and, in fact, contains many charming specimens by its ablest masters. A recent addition is from the easel of GEROME -- one of the few paintings from his brush in this country. It is of small size, and the subject does not appeal to the popular fancy, but it is a marvelous specimen of minute work. Every line is essential to the truth, and not a superfluous speck is inserted for mere effect. The drawing is faultless, and the harmony of colors perfect. Mr. KNOEDLER selected the picture while he was in Europe last year; also many others, by well-known names, notably by FICHEL, ED. FRERE, WILLEMS, MERLE, LAMDINET, and others. They are mostly of small size, and eminently suitable for presents. A few doors below GOUPIL's is another picture gallery, owned by Mr. SNEDECOR, and recently redecorated in handsome style. Mr. SNEDECOR possesses a good collection of paintings, many of them by American artists, but the majority belong, like those at GOUPIL's, to the modern French school. There is a slight admixture of German pictures -- none of them of any particular importance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FINE ARTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FINE ARTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a95c713a-833a-58fa-8434-1e0f0c2b488f,1371,nyt://article/a95c713a-833a-58fa-8434-1e0f0c2b488f

LAYARD, M.P., Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, made a speech to his constituents on Dec. 1, in the course of which he referred to American topics as follows: He did not believe it possible that any liberal government would now engage in foreign intervention or enter into another Holy Alliance. But to abstain altogether from foreign politics was quite another matter. We could not hold aloof from Europe -- remaining apart from all that occurred on the continent -- refusing to mediate when our mediation might lead to peace. If that was what was intended by the advocates of non-intervention, then it was that intervention would be most dangerous to this country. We must, hovever, always exercise that intervention with caution, and due consideration for others as well as ourselves. We should not interfere unless agreeable to the parties concerned. The United States had been quoted as an example of non intervention, but a more unfortunate example could not be produced. The United States did not interfere with European politics, because they were not part of the European family, but on their own continent they carried the principle further than we did, and claimed the right to prevent any combination of other States that might possibly interfere with their form of Government or liberties. He denied that the debate of last session had changed the foreign policy of this country. That debate was a great party struggle. The opposition had began to think that there was a great conservative reaction, but in the division they found out their mistake, and that there was an enormous majority of the constituencies of England and Wales in favor of the Government.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

Whenever, in fact, it seems certain that the ""house"" will be of a sort to cheer the heart of the Treasurer, the unpitying heavens unbosom themselves, and slush prevails. Such a day as yesterday, was, indeed, calculated to try men's soles. The ancient Egyptians, it is well known, were in the habit, on all festive occasions, of passing round a small coffin containing a perfect representation of a dead body. The attendant who performed this cheerful office, exclaimed, ""Cast your eyes on this figure; after death you will be like it; drink then and be happy."" Mr. MARETZEK, we are informed, preserves the custom, adapting it to the necessities of the time. In the roseate moments of managerial exaltation, an official approaches him with the effigies of an umbrella and a pair of over-thoes.

These gentlemen have discharged that duty in a manner which enlists the assent of both parties: the details of their proposition will be found set forth in our advertising columns. Both the Darling and Draper Committees, and all the local committees connected with them, are to be dissolved: and a new Central Committee is to be elected, consisting of seven members from each Assembly District. At the election, those persons only will be allowed to vote who shall have previously been enrolled in their respective districts: and all who may desire it will be enrolled upon their affirmation that they voted for LINCOLN and JOHNSON at the late election. Inspectors to superintend this enrollment have been appointed in each district. This evening is the last evening for the enrollment.

It is true that the splendid condition and morale of that army at this day, and at the close of its long march, alone furnishes sufficient evidence that the rebel stories about their having behaved in a reckless manner were all false. Had our men acted in the way the rebels alleged, they would have reached Savannah a huge demoralized, unbridled, uncontrollable mob, instead of the compact, solid, harmonious, well-ordered army that they were. The rebels tried to fire the Southern heart by accusing our troops of every conceivable and inconceivable outrage -- pillaging, ravaging, ravishing, murdering, insulting the living and despoiling the dead. The Richmond Sentinel, however, is now kind enough to begin by taking back one of the worst of these charges, and one which the rebel leaders evidently thought would have a tremendous effect in stirring up the Georgians -- the charge that the tombs of their fathers were being desecrated by our soldiers. The Sentinel now says it has the information that the ""dwelling-houses in Atlanta are in a much better condition than was anticipated -- that the city park was not converted into a cemetery, as had been reported, nor were the vaults in the cemetery desecrated."" We are glad that even at this late hour the rebels are beginning to tell the truth; by-and-bye they will doubtless be willing to concede what is the fact -- that there never was a military march conducted more purely on strictly military principles, or one in which as great regard was had to the principles of civilization and order, or one in which as great kindness or as true chivalry was exhibited for the population amid which the march was made.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REBELS GETTING AT THE TRUTH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REBELS GETTING AT THE TRUTH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/70be9062-db18-52a0-880c-dff827c711a9,324,nyt://article/70be9062-db18-52a0-880c-dff827c711a9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/24/archives/christmas-the-holiday-season-in-newyork-the-festivities-and.html,,"To-morrow is Christmas, the merriest of all holidays, the peculiar festival of Knickerbocker New-York, sacred to our patron saint, St. Nicholas, and to the beneficient deity of all good children, jolly old Santa Claus. To most of our readers the the stocking in the chimney corner may be a vision of childhood, and the mythical saint with his sleigh full of toys, a scarce remembered legand; yet, none the less welcome now to both old and young, is the pleasant Christmas festival which commences on morrow, for the holly bough and the evergreens that decorate the hall are not fresher than the delights of the time-honored day. Nature has donned her proper Christmas robes of white and ""The sledges with the bells; Sliver bell,"" furnish the merry music so appropriate to the season; the considerate kindness of Jack Frost has covered our lakes and ponds with a firm glassy flooring, very inviting to the lovers of good skating, and the enterprise of the metropolis has given to sleighers and skaters the Central Park, where both can indulge in their favorite sport. A walk through Broadway or the Bowery at this time would not convey to a stranger the idea that we were a people impoverished by an exhausted war, overburdened with taxes and oppressed with woe. Gaily decorated shops, filled with articles of convenience and luxury, crowded with eager customers, attest the prosperity of the people. Never before has there been such a display on the part of the storekeepers, never so much lavishness on the part of purchasers. The inventive genius of two continents has been called upon to provide novelties for our citizens. The dry goods establishments offer the most costly laces, embroideries, shawls and fancy goods, and notwithstanding the high prices asked, their stores are overcrowded with customers. The great jewelry firm of TIFFANY & CO. and BALL, BLACK & CO. are now disposing of their large stock of beautiful and expensive wares with unexampled rapidity. The confectioners and fruiterers are reaping a harvest, and display an unusual variety of tempting sweets. A few years ago, the business of selling out flowers and bouquets was confined to one or two peripatetic venders of cheap trash; now we mention it as an evidence of growing taste. The florists have nearly thirty-five shops on Broadway, between the Fifth-avenue Hotel and Canal-street, and their show-windows are filled with a profusion of costly exotics. So far, then, from showing any symptoms of economy in their holiday expenditures, people seem bent on luxury and enjoyment at any price. The theatres this year have not provided any of the customary fairy spectacles, which are the delight of young folk, but content themselves with their usual bills. The toy-shops, however, make it up to the little ones, and furnish them with a ""fairy spectacle."" It is really worth the while of a child of the largest growth to look through these toy-shores. Dolls that babble papa and mamma are common, but hens that cackle and roosters that crow are among the novelties, and are only a specimen of the curious attractions in the toy-line.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHRISTMAS.; The Holiday Season in New-York The Festivities and Ceremonies of the Day.

"-- A MOTHER MURDERS HER CHILD. -- On Friday morning last, the wife of H.H. BABCOCK, Esq., of Plainfield, in a fit of mental derangement, cut the throat of her child, five months old, and then cut her own throat, Killing both. As we are informed, she had, since the birth of her child, been afflicted, with severe nervousness, which, it seems, culminated in insanity. On the morning of the sad event she arose as usual, and her husband awoke soon after, arose, asked her how she had rested, and being answered satisfactorily, went out, leaving her brother in the room with her. When Mr. B. returned a few minutes afterward, he called to his wife to accompany him to breakfast. Receiving no answer, he opened the door of her bedroom, where she had gone, and found her, with her feet against the door, weltering in her own blood. A bottle of laudanum was found in a drawer, and also a note to her husband, in which she regretted that she must leave him, and saying that it was her intention to take the little boy with her also, but that it was inconvenient. The little boy being questioned, said his mother had attempted to make him take some very bitter medicine a short time before, on the pretence that he was sick, but he ran away from her, and thus, doubtless, saved his life. Mr. BABCOCK is a merchant at Unadilla Forks, has represented his town in the Board of Supervisors, and, we believe, has been the Democratic nominee for Assembly in this district. Mrs. B. was a very amiable, kind-hearted, loving wife and mother, and her death is sadly lamented by hosts of friends. -- Cooperstown Republican, Dec. 24.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/25/archives/a-sad-affair.html,,"-- A MOTHER MURDERS HER CHILD. -- On Friday morning last, the wife of H.H.

Vital Forces of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/25/archives/the-vital-forces-north-and-south.html,Vital Forces of,"-- The problem to be solved in this war is the same which offers in all vital struggles -- the relative strength of the combatants. At first the disparity in this respect between the rebel and the national Governments did not clearly appear. Our armies were confronted by armies equal in number and in courage; and the waste of war on either side appeared to be remedied with equal ease. Indeed, at the first, if there was any advantage in this respect, it rested with the rebels. The institution of slavery, the simplicity of Southern life, and the despotic hold which wealth and social position gave the few over the lives of the many, invested the rebel authorities in the first stage of the war with greater military capabilities than apparently belonged to the National Government. They stood the test put upon them with unwavering stedfastness and confidence, hoping that we might tire in our efforts because of their bold front so long and tirelessly maintained. They might have been wiser in their military conduct; they might have husbanded their strength with greater care, but they could not have shown a firmer determination to meet all of our strength with all of theirs. Greater modesty in their undertakings would have served their purpose better than their restless audacity has done. It is true, that their lavish and spendthrift habit of waging war has given them so formidable a seeming, that it has fostered a peace party at the North, and fomented schemes of foreign interference; but failing to gain from these any substantial results, it has failed of everything, and only hastens the final collapse and ruin.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE VITAL FORCES NORTH AND SOUTH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE VITAL FORCES NORTH AND SOUTH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19d15946-ecc7-53f6-a4ce-fe21d1d34f62,277,nyt://article/19d15946-ecc7-53f6-a4ce-fe21d1d34f62

"An establishment which has been oddly, though aptly, christened by its managers, ""The Sheltering arms."" having for its object the care of all children, irrespective of age, whose parents may desire to avail themselves of its advantages, is now in successful operation at Manhattanville. It was opened on the 6th of October last, and an idea of its practical working may be best obtained by presenting a brief statement of the cases of the children now in the house. One is a blind girl of four years, hence, not old enough, under the rules, to be entered at the Blind Asylum. Four are chronic invalids, or permanent cripples, not likely to live to the age of maturity. Seven are orphans or half-orphans of a year old, therefore younger than are admitted to Orphan Asylums. Thirteen are children whom their friends were willing to place only here, because this institution alone, under its rules, could receive every member of the family, and thus avoid separation. Seven have both parents living, but the mothers, owing to sickness or other causes, are incapacited or unfit to take care of them. Three are children deserted by fathers, and put to board here by mothers who go out to work, or are at service. Probably, none of the inmates of this asylum would have entered any of the other institutions of the city devoted to the good of unfortunate children. Some would have been excluded by the rules governing these institutions as to the age and other disqualifications of the applicants, while quite as many more would have been kept out on account of the natural pride of the parents, and their unwillingness to lose control of their offspring. In most cases, therefore, the welfare, temporal and spiritual, of the little ones was being sacrificed. In one instance, a father, going out at early morning to his work, and returning late and weary, left each day in unavoidable filth and neglect, four little ones, the eldest a cripple of eight years. Sending them now to ""The Sheltering Arms"" he willingly pays more than one half his wages for their support. By this house, therefore, provision is made for children, who, although neither orphans not friendless, are as much in need of a home as though they were both.

"vs. Corsairs; Juarez, Boniface, Mexico; on Juarez' Proposed Corsairs",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/25/archives/pirates-vs-corsairs.html,"vs. Corsairs; Juarez, Boniface, Mexico; on Juarez' Proposed Corsairs","The rumor that JUAREZ, the Mexican President, intended to fit out privateers to harass French shipping, has alarmed and shocked M. BONIFACE, the editor of the Paris Constitutionnel. M. BONIFACE assumes to be an authority on questions appertaining to maritime law, and has repeatedly taken a prominent part in defending the character of the rebel pirates; but now that he is apprehensive lest the commercial, interests of the empire should suffer from his persistent advocacy of a bad cause, he deems it prudent to modify his views on the subject. In accordance with this determination, M. BONIFACE has inserted a note in his journal, in which he marks the distinction between a corsair and a pirate. ""The former,"" says he, ""is an armed ship, furnished with letters-of-marque by a regularly constituted and recognized Government; but a pirate has no legal character, and its acts call for prompt retribution from all Powers interested in maintaining the law of nations."" This is sound doctrine, yet what becomes of the editor's argument in defence of the Southern privateers, when tried by such a test? Of course, the object of Mr. BONIFACE was not to prove the rebel ships pirates, and to upset his own logic. His design was rather to demonstrate that the expected privateers of JUAREZ would belong to the latter category. He has been much more successful, however, in assailing his former clients, and exposing his past sophistry, than in making out his case against the Mexican privateers. Whether said privateers will ever have more than an ideal existence, seems somewhat problematical, but if they should at any time make their appearance, M. BONIFACE insists that they must be treated as pirates, and that all Powers must exact prompt retribution for their acts. This is a very different conclusion from that which the gentleman arrived at when he had the case of the Alabama and Florida under consideration. The Jeff. Davis vessels were regularly commissioned to capture; plunder and destroy; they were engaged in honorable warfare; their outrages were justifiable; they were not to be treated as hostes human generis, but were to be hospitably entertained by the nations as often as they entered their ports. And yet, these vessels had been furnished with letters-of-marque by a traitor, in rebellion against the legitimate Government of his country, and whose authority had never been recognized by a single foreign State, whereas JUAREZ, whose right to send forth ships to prey upon French commerce, is denied, was constitutionally raised to the Presidential Chair of the Mexican Republic by the votes of the people, was but lately recognized, over the civilized world, as the legal head of the Commonwealth, and still continues, despite the usurpation of MAXIMILIAN, to be recognized as such by all the States of the Western hemisphere. Now, whether, is the constitutionally elected President of the Mexican Republic, who has been universally recognized, or the pseudo-President of Rebeldom, who has never been recognized at all, the better entitled to grant letters-of-marque, and to commission privateers?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pirates vs. Corsairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Pirates vs. Corsairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/533686b0-1f1c-5b09-b886-c3edcc91c1ba,579,nyt://article/533686b0-1f1c-5b09-b886-c3edcc91c1ba

We do not question, for a moment, that landlords of the class to which CARL BENSON belongs, are content with the reasonable returns from house property which he presents, and which unquestionably apply in many instances, aside from his own experience, as he shows. What we have urged is, that the rage for mere speculation in up-town lots, the inferior class of tenements -- many of them without cellarage, and a still greater number mere shells as to their exterior and interior fittings, combined with the inadequate means of speedy conveyance to and from the suburban portions of the island, constitute a material item in our social disabilities as Islanders.

Though brief, it contains not a few words of considerable significance. Lord RUSSELL probably did not mean to be specially offensive to the Government of the United States. And yet we think common international courtesy might have taught him something more gracious toward a friendly Power, than to declare inferentially that the division of this Republic is an accomplished fact. Nor do we think Lord RUSSELL was correct, either as to a matter of history or taste, in speaking of the friendly relations existing between the British Government and the Northern and the Southern States before this war commenced. The British Government sustained no relations of a political nature toward any section of the United States, Northern or Southern, before the war broke out. Her relations were with the Federal Government of the Republic. And Mr. SEWARD might with equal propriety address himself on any frivolous pretext to the question of the friendly relations which his Government has always maintained toward Ireland as well as Great Britain. It would be deemed offensive in England were Mr. SEWARD to say such a thing as this. But the peculiar practice of British neutrality which we witness all around us on the ocean, at British Colonial ports, and on the Provincial frontiers, probably ought to accustom us even to a less gracious style of diplomatic observation than Lord RUSSELL's.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LORD RUSSELL ON NEUTRALITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LORD RUSSELL ON NEUTRALITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6c19cb3-47d8-5869-8f56-e6161ca4564c,241,nyt://article/d6c19cb3-47d8-5869-8f56-e6161ca4564c

"This favorite skating resort enters upon its third year under the most favorable auspices, and will, undoubtedly, be the principle pond in the Western District. It will continue under the able management of Messrs. WEED & DECKER. The skating superficies at this pond is larger by, perhaps, an acre, than any other pond in the city, all of it being fit for use. The improvements this year are both numerous and important. The sides of the dock or walk in front of the Club-house had been extended and closely boarded up, so that the embankment cannot possibly give way or the earth fall in upon the ice, which is a most important improvement. Several more bridges, too, have been provided, and a railing run all along the above-mentioned gallery. A shed, or rather a pavillion, has been erected on the north bank of the pond (on the site of the engine house,) as a resting place for the skaters.

The improvements this year are both numerous and important.

Several more bridges, too, have been provided, and a railing run all along the above-mentioned gallery.

HARDEE, anticipating an assault, had escaped with the main body of his infantry and light artillery, by crossing the river to Union Causeway, opposite the city. The rebel ironclads were blown up, and the navy-yard burned. All the rest of the city remains intact, and contains twenty thousand citizens, who are quiet and well disposed. The captures include, according to Gen. FOSTER, eight hundred prisoners, one hundred and fifty guns, thirteen locomotives, one hundred and ninety cars, a large supply of ammunition, and other material of war, three steamers, and thirty-three thousand bales of cotton, (Gen. SHERMAN says 25,000.) The fleet was in communication with the city, and arrangements were making to clear the channel of all obstructions.

At these establishments ""Fra Diavolo"" and ""Hamlet"" are repeated to-night.

The music is light, graceful and melodious. The mise-en-scene and costumes are alike admirable. Mr. BOOTHS Hamlet has fairly electrified the town. He has given it twenty-four times, and the tragedy, with its beautiful scenery, seems destined to run for several weeks to come. Those who would enjoy an intellectual treat should by all means patronize the Winter Garden. At Wallack's Theatre to-night, TOM TAYLOR's comedy of ""Masks and Faces"" will be performed. It is an excellent piece and is admirably rendered by the company at this house. At Niblo's Garden the popular favorites, Mr. and Mrs. BARNEY WILLIAMS, will present three of their amusing pieces, the ""Fairy Circle,"" ""In and Out of Place,"" and ""Barney the Baron."" A night of merriment can certainly be enjoyed here. At the Olympic theatre the drama of the ""Streets of New-York"" has proved so eminently successful that it remains on the bills for another week. A new holiday piece is in preparation. At the Broadway Theatre Mr. J.E. OWENS repeats his inimitable personation of ""Solon Shingle,"" and for the first time appears in a comicality called the ""Live Indian."" At Barnum's Museum a new fairy spectacle, long in preparation, will to-day be brought out in a style of great splendor. It is called the ""Ring of Fate, or Fire, Air, Earth, and Water,"" and is described as being in three parts and four elements. It will be played many times to-day, and during the week, every afternoon at 3 and evening at 7. Mr. BARNUM has made several important additions to the Museum -- among others are WOODRAFE's Bohemian Glass Blowers, heretofore at Hope Chapel. At the French Theatre there will be performance to-day at popular prices. The pieces are ""La Poudre aux Yeux"" and ""Les Deux Timides."" At the Hippotheatron, in Fourteenth-street, extensive arrangements have been made for the holidays. A new Christmas pantomime, on the old-fashioned plan, has been prepared, and will be brought out for the first time this afternoon. The introduction has been written by Mr. JOHN DARCIE, and the entire work has been many weeks in preparation. It enjoys the name of ""Harlequin Blue Beard; or the Good Fairy Preciosa and the Bad Demon Rustifusti."" The usual attractions of this well-conducted establishment are in addition to the pantomime. At HELLER's ""Salle Diabolique"" Programme No. 4, and the great Ravel panomime of ""Harlequin Santa Claus,"" are the sufficient inducements.

The vessel was chartered for the Medical Department while she was yet on the stocks and before the usual state-rooms, saloons and other accommodations for passenger-vessels were commenced. She has been finished, therefore, with a single aim for convenience in the special service for which she is designed. The work has been done under the immediate supervision of Col. MCDOUGAL, Medical Director of this Department, aided by Dr. HOFF, Gen. VAN VLIET's Chief Quartermaster, and the owners. The ship is 1,400 tons burden, draws 12 feet of water, will make 12 miles an hour at sea, and can reach City Point, Va., or any other of the principal landings on the Southern coast. The accommodations for the officers and crew are entirely separated from those for the sick. They are upon the upper deck, and all the remaining space is used for hospital purposes. Accommodations for the Chief Surgeon and his Staff, for nurses, cooks and other employes, are arranged also with special reference to economy, as well as the rooms for the dispensary, clothing, commissary stores, kitchen and dining-room for the patients, beside bath-rooms, ice-room, water-closets, with wards for 650 sick and wounded, containing well-filled bed-sacks, linen sheets, pillows, &c., &c., with every facility for lighting and ventilation. The entire vessel is heated by steam-pipes. The berths are arranged to slide up and down, so that the patients can be placed in them without difficulty or danger, and they are supported in their positions by iron pins. The J.H. Barnes is under the charge of Assistant Surgeon THOS. MCMILLEN, U.S.A., who is an eminently kind, humane and efficient officer, assisted by a full corps of medical officers, cadets, stewards and nurses.

Remarkable Narrative,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/26/archives/a-remarkable-narrative-experiences-of-southern-union-lady.html,Remarkable Narrative,"There arrived in this city last week, from Charleston, S.C., which place she left Nov. 6, a lady named Mrs. THOMAS PIERCE, whose experiences form one of the most remarkable narratives that this remarkable war has yet given rise to. In March, 1861, her husband, THOMAS PIERCE, who was a Northern man, born in New-Hampshire, but residing in South Carolina for fourteen years previously, was compelled, in consequence of his strong Union sentiments, to leave his wife and plantation, near Charleston, and come North. So strong was his hatred of the originators of the rebellion who had thus exiled him, that he enlisted in one of the West Virginia regiments as a private, and participated in the battle of Winchester, under Gen. SHIELDS, and subsequently in all the battles of the Army of the Potomac, from Harrison's Landing to the battle of the Wilderness, in May last, and, as a reward for faithful service, had been promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant. At this battle he was taken prisoner, and confined at Richmond until August last when the rebel authorities discovered that he was a citizen of South Carolina, and he was taken out of prison and deliberately shot. This information was communicated to Mrs. PIERCE by a rebel soldier from Charleston, who knew her husband and was cognizant of the murder. About a year after her husband's departure, Mrs. PIERCE endeavored to reach our lines at Newbern. N.C., with her horses, mules and slaves; but, when almost within our lines, she was apprehended by the enemy and sent back to Charleston. After this manifestation of Union feeling, she was regarded with much suspicion by the rebels, and her crops, buildings and property of all kinds unceremoniously appropriated, without even a shadow of compensation. Her male slaves, forty-three in number, were impressed for labor upon the Charleston fortifications, and their monthly wages, which all who were rebels regularly received, were confiscated by the rebel Government; and this was the general course of the rebels toward this lady throughout her residence there. When Union prisoners began to be confined at Charleston, she improved the opportunity to supply the sick and wounded with nourishment and bandages, which the rebels permitted in case such favors were equally distributed between rebel and Union patients. She dressed the wounds of many Union soldiers, who will, undoubtedly, remember her with gratitude, and whom she would gladly meet now, if it were possible. One young man in particular, Orderly-Sergeant CHARLES MULLEN, of a New-York regiment, she would be glad to see now. His life was saved through this lady's kindness. Another soldier, whose name she has forgotten, but who may recollect her, she would like to inform of the location of $35 in gold which he begged her to take and secrete to prevent the rebels from robbing him of it. But, at last, the rebels charged her with being too partial, and refused her permission to visit the hospitals. She soon afterward resolved to reach the North, if possible. Provided with a rebel passport to pass the lines, she proceeded by way of Branchville, S.C., Little Washington, N.C., and Weldon, to Staunton, Va.; at the latter place, ambulances were taken for the Union lines in the Valley, but soon afterward the party was captured by a party of guerrillas, and completely robbed of everything they possessed. These thieves respected no appeals. Trunks, wearing apparel, $500 in gold, a gold watch, a quantity of silver ware, and even ear-rings and the deeds of her property in the South, were all taken from Mrs. PIERCE, and appropriated by the robbers. Then, mounted on mules, without saddles, the party were taken through the mountains a long distance, and finally set down at Beverley, Western Virginia, where they got into the Union lines.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Remarkable Narrative Experiences of Southern Union Lady.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Remarkable Narrative Experiences of Southern Union Lady.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ab79b0e-c928-5f59-90a9-dc42854c9311,959,nyt://article/7ab79b0e-c928-5f59-90a9-dc42854c9311

Two Months of War and their Significance,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/26/archives/two-months-of-war-and-their-significance.html,Two Months of War and their Significance,"The past two months' campaigning has taught the rebels a hard lesson. Each isolated event has an important lesson of its own, but taken together they open up startling revelations. It must be sufficiently distasteful to the rebels that an army of fifty thousand men can cut itself off from its base at Atlanta and at leisure establish another three hundred miles distant, on the Atlantic coast. This fact alone proves the helplessness of the Confederacy outside of its intrenched strongholds. The rebels may agree with DAVIS that Richmond, or any other fortified point, may be forced from them without their suffering vital loss, but this will not make them relish being pummeled everywhere else. Then, again, HOOD's defeat, taken by itself alone, conveys a scathing comment on DAVIS' policy of waging war. The same may be said of PRICE's defeat in Missouri, or of EARLY's in the Shenandoah. But in the summary, and considering the total result, there is conveyed to the minds of the rebels a still more disagreeable suggestion than is involved in simple defeat or indiscretion, and that is, that as their relative strength is diminished, the proportion of the waste attendant upon the war on their part is greatly increased.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Two Months of War and their Significance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Two Months of War and their Significance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/843c0b38-59f1-59be-bf02-56c514e30ac4,687,nyt://article/843c0b38-59f1-59be-bf02-56c514e30ac4

The London Times, it will be seen from our European news report, has at last come to the conclusion that, if the rebels still persist in carrying on the war, the South will be made ""a howling wilderness."" It reasons likewise, of course, that the North will be seriously injured in its financial and industrial concerns, unless peace can be brought about by negotiation. But this makes the admission of the hopeless condition of the Confederates not a whit less significant. Hitherto the London Times has defiantly proclaimed, in the face of the liberal intelligence of Europe, the absolute invincibility of the Confederated rebels. Through its agents at Richmond and at New-York, and by every species of partisan argument in its editorial columns, it has labored for years to convince the political and financial circles to which it finds access, that the permanent subjection of the South is an utter impossibility; that the North would itself be ruined before the task was well begun, and that it is for the interest of Europe that the ""belligerents"" should be regarded as entitled in every sense to a perfect equality in the consideration of foreign Governments.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Despairing Howl from the Anglo-Rebel Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Despairing Howl from the Anglo-Rebel Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/915ecc76-d9de-5bd6-9a31-c03cf8aa8917,681,nyt://article/915ecc76-d9de-5bd6-9a31-c03cf8aa8917

This paying of the pew rents to the uttermost farthing, continued Mr. BEECHER, was not an exceptional case, either, with the Plymouth congregation, but merely their ordinary mode of doing business. He was gratified in being able to say that in financial matters, at least, his people had proved themselves a model church.

Testimonials to public men for services rendered to the public, are often both useful and graceful; but to have any value, and not to be abused, they should be very rare, and the power of bestowing them should be lodged in the hands of a body of eminent and indisputable tact, honesty, and discretion. We have no such body in this city, and therefore the practice of making appropriations out of the taxes for such purposes had better be abolished altogether, and the duty of bestowing special marks of gratitude on public benefactors be left to individual munificence. If the public takes the same view of the value of Mr. BLUNT's services that he does himself, nothing will be easier than to raise the sum of $50,000 for him by voluntary subscription; but we deny the right of any body to hand him over that sum out of the pockets of the tax-payers without their consent.

The falling of Christmas day upon the Sabbath was most appropriate for the religious observance of the sacred anniversary, but our people were not willing to forego their customary secular enjoyments of the annual jubilee, and accordingly yesterday was set apart for the more gay and festive celebration of the holiday. The Mayor's office and the various city departments were closed. The courts adjourned, and there was a general suspension of business throughout the citp. The weather alone was inauspicious, and manifested its usual fickleness and uncertainty. A drizzling rain commenced early in the morning and continued without intermission through the day, thus belying the goodly promise with which it ushered in the Christmas festival, and blasting the hopes and anticipations of skaters, and those who delight in the jingle of the merry sleigh-bells. The outward gloom and drizzle, however, only gave additional zest to the indoor pleasures, and the parlors and drawing-rooms of the metropolis never rang with more joyous mirth and gleeful merrymaking than throughout the day and evening of yesterday. The announcement in the morning papers of the splendid ""Christmas gift"" which Gen. SHERMAN and his brave army had prepared for the loyal people of the country, put everybody in the best of humor, and all felt like extending a cordial greeting and welcome to their brethren of the goodly City of Savannah, who had at last escaped the tyranny of rebel rule and were brought once more into the Union fold.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL; Secular Observance of the Day.

"Arrested at Concord, N H",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/28/archives/a-new-feature-in-the-border-burglars-case.html,"Arrested at Concord, N H","We learn by a telegram from Concord, N. H., that three of the St. Alban's burglars, in attempting to escape a second trial in Canada under the new order of arrest, have turned up at Lebanon, in New-Hampshire. At that point they enlisted in the United States Army, but the detectives were ""too many"" for them. They are now in jail at Concord. There will thus be raised a question of non-concurrent jurisdiction, in a novel form. At Montreal, six of the burglars are again on trial before a Superior Court Judge, for the purpose of testing their liability to surrender under the Extradition Treaty. The decision at Montreal, whatever it may be, may possibly precede -- as it cannot help, in a great measure, influencing -- the disposition of the prisoners in custody on this side of the line. On the other hand, the fact of JEFF. DAVIS' commissioned belligerents enlisting in the United States Army will place the prisoners in Montreal in a singular position as to the line of defence they have chosen to adopt. The three ruffians caught at Lebanon have now to choose between confessing themselves burglars or spies. If they confess themselves burglars, they become witnesses against their confederates now in durance in the Province; but they save their necks and merely incur the penalty of robbery in the most aggravated form -- involving possibly ten or fifteen years in the penitentiary. If on the other hand, they make the plea of ""belligerents,"" they render themselves liable to be hung as spies, merely by virtue of their enlistment in the army of the United States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Feature in the Border Burglars Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Feature in the Border Burglars Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2edd2340-1714-5456-a4c8-a282d898e7c2,518,nyt://article/2edd2340-1714-5456-a4c8-a282d898e7c2

It is the terminus of the Wilmington and Weldon, and Wilmington and Manchester railroads, the former of which is threatened by the cooperating expedition up the Neuse. Before the war Wilmington contained about 9,500 inhabitants. The principal exports were timber, turpentine, resin, tar, pitch, shingles, and cotton. Ever since the outbreak of the rebellion, and more especially since the ports of Charleston, Savannah and Mobile were closed against blockade-runners, or so strictly guarded by our blockading squadrons as to render the operations of these enterprising gentry both difficult and dangerous, Wilmington has been the grand entrepot of the contraband foreign trade of the Southern Confederacy; and all the vigilance of a powerful blockading squadron was insufficient to put an end to it. The approaches to the city are admirably adapted to blockade-running, and the rebels, fully alive to the importance of the foreign trade in arms, munitions of war and other supplies of every variety, have increased their natural advantages by the erection of forts and batteries on the shore of the channels at the mouth of the river. A glance at the map will show that a long narrow island stretches directly across the mouth of the river, leaving two narrow inlets at either end. These are denominated Eastern and Western Bar, or Old and New Inlet.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Wilmington and its Defences.; OLD OR WESTERN INLET. NEW OR EASTERN INLET.

The States reclaimed from the rebellion must have some regular civil government, with a settled basis internally, and also settled relations to the national authority. The President has not yet committed himself to any definite scheme, further than is involved in his recommendation that Louisiana be admitted as she stands, and also that the Federal Constitution, be so amended as to prohibit slavery throughout the land. But these points, we take it, are a sufficient index of his general policy.

This first dispatch was soon followed by another from Washington, saying that ""it would seem to be a mistake that the naval and military fleet had returned;"" that the ""Navy Department had no such intelligence,"" and giving some details of movements. In the course of the night, Secretary STANTON's official bulletin came to hand; but all it contained regarding the Wilmington expedition was an extract from the Richmond papers of yesterday, which averred that Admiral PORTER's naval bombardment had done very little damage to Fort Fisher, and that BUTLER's troops had reembarked on Monday night.

He died in a few minutes after having fired the shot. The ball entered immediately over me right eye, and penetrated the brain. The motives that induced the man to commit the deed, are, as we learn them, briefly as follows; About two years ago. TUTTLE was married to a Miss SMITH in the city of Boston. At the time the marriage ceremony was performed she knew that he had been previously married, but believed, as she says, that a legal divorce had been granted by a competent Court. For a time they lived happily together, but quite recently the wile was advised by a respectable lawyer of this city, to whom she presented the divorce papers, that the same were forgeries. Hence she gave notice to her husband that she would not longer cohabit with him. On Sunday last she had an interview with him in Twenty-sixth-street, when he asked her the question if she intended to live with him? Her reply was, ""No, you have another wife who has a higher claim on you than I have."" He then said. ""I shall immediately do something which you will regret."" When he took his leave, she accompanied him to the door, and when he was on the front steps he drew a revolver and shot himself as above stated. When the wife saw what he was about to do she used every effort to prevent the suicide, but without effect. The coroner's jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the above facts.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Shocking Suicide.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Shocking Suicide.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4946e39-c6f7-50ad-9b89-c0016e2e284c,281,nyt://article/c4946e39-c6f7-50ad-9b89-c0016e2e284c

JOHN EYNON, of the steamship City of Dublin, arrived yesterday, reports: Dec. 17, in lat. 49° 41′, lon. 31° 14′, fell in with a wreck, on approaching which the steamer's wheels were stopped, and one of the ship's life-boats manned and lowered immediately, in charge of the second officer, Mr. PETER FLETCHER, who in the most daring manner, in the face of a high sea, succeeded in rescuing from the wreck three survivors, named GEORGE SMITH, steward, of Liverpool; GILBERT DUNCAN, a seaman, of Shetland; and JOHN JOHNSTON, a seaman, of Guttenbergh, Norway. The remaining ten, whose names we have not learned, had perished. The wreck was the British bark Burnside, of Greenwich, and when first seen had her fore lower mast standing, and part of the rigging; also the lower mizzen-mast. The extreme fore-and-aft part of her seemed to be occasionally above water, but the whole main deck was immersed, and the sea making a clean breach over tax. Upon approaching her, the three men were seen standing by the rudder-post, and occasionally immersed in the water. Their condition was most deplorable, having scarcely any clothing about them, except some pieces of old sail, tied with bits of spun yarn, their flesh, and particularly their arms, feet and legs, were swelled, and of a putrid appearance, in some places broken out in bolls, and they were so weak and exhausted that it was with great exertion and the excitement of their being rescued that enabled them to stand. Having been got on board the steamer in safety, they were finally cared for by Dr. BLACK, and on their arrival in this port were convalescent and able to walk about.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISASTER AT SEA.; Wreck of the Bark Burnside--Three Survivors Rescued by the Steamship City of Dublin--Loss of Life and Great Suffering.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISASTER AT SEA.; Wreck of the Bark Burnside--Three Survivors Rescued by the Steamship City of Dublin--Loss of Life and Great Suffering.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc5eaced-ee67-511c-a83a-565305907b52,881,nyt://article/cc5eaced-ee67-511c-a83a-565305907b52

The principal features of the machine are first, sharp cutters by which ice is removed; second, a grooving drill for roughening the pavement; third, a broom, which is so arranged as to sweep from each side of the street the thickest deposit of mud; fourth, a large sprinkler to wet the streets when necessary; and fifth, an arrangement for collecting the dirt and ""dumping"" it in heaps. The Professor has been authorized by the Croton Board to groove the Russ Pavement in Broadway, between Fulton and Ann streets, and if he is successful in his experiment he will undoubtedly find a more extensive field for his operations.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN INGENIOUS INVENTION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AN INGENIOUS INVENTION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Hamilton College', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1596174e-3fe7-5cf0-a291-90f31e3c9369,136,nyt://article/1596174e-3fe7-5cf0-a291-90f31e3c9369

UNDERHILL, against net nephew, GEORGE OLCOTT, and her sister, Mrs. OLCOTT, returned with a verdict awarding six cents damages. This suit was brought, on Thursday of last week, before City Judge GEORGE G. REYNOLDS, of Brooklyn, upon an allegation that the plaintiff's relatives were striving to defraud her of certain property which her father had willed to the children and mother jointly. This property consisted of a house in Brooklyn, wherein the testator directed that the plaintiff should have a home so long as she should remain a maid, and the income thereof is $1.000 annually. The plaintiff, moreover, alleged that her sister and nephew, conspiring to deprive her of the home which her father, Mr. STEPHEN UNDERHILL, gave her, trumped up a charge of lunacy, and thereupon thrust her into the Bloomingdale Asylum for the Insane. That Miss UNDERHILL had been consigned to Bloomingdale, neither her sister nor her nephew for a moment sought to deny. On the contrary, throughout the tedious trial, their counsel held that they did but their duty in sending the plaintiff thither for treatment, there being, in the judgment of trustworthy physicians, clear evidence that she was of unsound mind' On this point the defence based their case; and, to sustain their theory, they introduced testimon syhowing that Miss UNDERHILL had indulged in hallucinations that could not have been harbored by any sane unmarried woman.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE UNDERHILL LUNACY TRIAL.; A Brooklyn Sensation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE UNDERHILL LUNACY TRIAL.; A Brooklyn Sensation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49622ee1-681d-5288-9162-5c4d2b72a780,937,nyt://article/49622ee1-681d-5288-9162-5c4d2b72a780

In the existing state of American society and of public affairs, it would be difficult to mention a more important theme. The absence among us of a large class of men of leisure and cultivation, such as is found in nearly every European country, leaves to the clergy and the bar all but a monopoly of our mental training, and the lawyers may be said to be the only men in the community who bring disciplined intellects to the discharge of public duties. The natural consequence is, that the management of our political affairs, at least at the North, has always fallen, and will probably always fall largely into their hands; and this fact alone, to say nothing of their being administrators of the law, render, and will always render, their character and aims as men, of the last importance to the country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LEGAL PROFESSION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LEGAL PROFESSION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0dbd83f1-824c-5f9c-bb82-3cdf2c54a58d,192,nyt://article/0dbd83f1-824c-5f9c-bb82-3cdf2c54a58d

The furious declamations of the rebel leaders and newspapers did not at all represent the spirit of the people. They had suffered for years in every conceivable way, from the terrible tyranny of the rebel leaders; and Gen. SHERMAN at once removed some of the most odious restrictions which they had long groaned under; and this was duly appreciated by the citizens. They have been treated with kindness and in a conciliatory manner; and our army have exhibited toward them that demeanor which is the result of discipline, and that chivalry which is characteristic of the American soldier. Gen. SHERMAN has appropriated none of their houses or private property for military purposes, and in all respects has interfered with them as little as possible. On Sunday last, the churches were opened as usual, service being conducted by the resident clergymen; and our soldiers mingled freely at service with the citizens of both sexes, and mutual courtesy and respect were shown. Gen. GEARY is Post-Commandant, and he has established an excellent provost system, under which citizens are not required to have military passes to move about the city, such as were previously required from every one, black and white, male and female. Gen. SHERMAN himself was temporarily staying, by invitation, at the house of an old resident of Savannah.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MORAL ASPECT IN GEORGIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MORAL ASPECT IN GEORGIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Georgia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21877479-c426-5ea5-9491-9651df7efbf4,411,nyt://article/21877479-c426-5ea5-9491-9651df7efbf4

This amount was generally claimed at the time to be entirely inadequate, on the ground of increased price for labor. Street-sweepers, who received $1 and $1 25 per diem two years since, and were satisfied with their wages, have refused to touch a broom or handle a shovel during the past year for less than $2 per day, and the dirt-cartmen during the same period have obtained so cents a load for removing the sweepings, instead of 25 cents, which was the price from time immemorial before the war. To override this little difficulty of the $300,000 restriction, an arrangement was made on the part of the city authorities with Mr. FRANCIS PALMER, President of the Broadway Bank, to advance sufficient money to pay the laborers and cartmen, on receiving from them an assignment of their claims, coupled with a note for the amount, having attached to it the signatures of the Comptroller and the Mayor -- it being understood that Mr. PALMER should get his funds back by suing the city and obtaining judgments. In this manner about $800,000 or $900,000 have been expended, and judgments against the city to that amount have been placed in Mr. PALMER's hands. At the eleventh hour, however, Mayor GUNTHER has discovered this course to be altogether illegal, and has determined to sign no more requisitions for these claims. He contends that City Inspector BOOLE has no right to employ street-sweepers, and that in appending his signature to any note indorsing their claims, he becomes personally responsible. He is also advised that the judgments obtained by Mr. PALMER against the city for $800,000 odd can be set aside. Therefore, yesterday morning, when a deputation of the street-sweepers waited upon him, to get his official autograph to a note for $108,500 to the Broadway Bank, being the amount of their wages for the past nine weeks, he refused to put his name to it, asserting that his signature should not be written to any such note, ""though the ashes were to lie in the streets as high as the second-story windows."" Meanwhile, the street-cleaning is entirely suspended, the laborers are in a distressed state for want of their wages, and unless the matter is settled soon, the city is likely to meet the fate of the ancient towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. It is proper to add that the City Inspector and Comptroller have no conscientious scruples, like the Mayor's, respecting the propriety of placing their names to the note for $108,500 before alluded to; and, indeed, their signatures were already affixed to the rolls before His Honor interposed his objection.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Street-Sweepers on a Strike.; A FAIR PROSPECT THAT THE CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ASHES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Street-Sweepers on a Strike.; A FAIR PROSPECT THAT THE CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ASHES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bab4dfaf-734b-58cb-acca-c5bd74c8bbf0,485,nyt://article/bab4dfaf-734b-58cb-acca-c5bd74c8bbf0

He, therefore, took only her into custody, and immediately reported to Sergt. SMITH, at the Police Station.

the Loss of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/12/31/archives/the-loss-of-the-transport-north-america.html,the Loss of,"-- The facts connected with the loss of the transport North America are painful enough, even in their baldest aspect. The loss of one hundred and ninety-four lives, out of a crew and passenger list of two hundred and fifty-nine, is, by its mere magnitude, an appalling disaster. But, when we find in the details of the terrible story that out of the entire number on board the North America, two hundred and three were sick soldiers -- a large majority of them, probably, unable to help themselves in the extreme crisis, we have to leave to imagination to picture the horrors of the catastrophe. The scene becomes yet more heart-sickening, as we read the statement of the chief officer of the ill-fated vessel. We have no doubt that statement presents the main facts of the situation, from the time when the condition of the vessel had begun to be appreciated. But we have seldom perused a record so little satisfactory, as to the actual means employed to prevent the sacrifice of life. We do not wish to go into details. But we ask attention to the fact that, between the time when it was found (22d Dec, 1 P.M.) that water was rapidly gaining in the hold of the vessel, until the last boat left her -- six full hours had elapsed, and that for five of these hours a vessel, perfectly prepared to render relief, was near by.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LOSS OF THE TRANSPORT NORTH AMERICA', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LOSS OF THE TRANSPORT NORTH AMERICA', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4e6a395-25c8-54c2-8b05-6effe9ee5297,281,nyt://article/f4e6a395-25c8-54c2-8b05-6effe9ee5297
