"The Senate of the United States once enjoyed the reputation of filling in the Government of this country the practical and conservative part which is theoretically performed by the House of Lords in the Parliament of England. It is a tradition still cherished in certain remote sections of the country that a Senator sits and speaks and acts for the permanent and national side of our politics, while a Representative, elected directly by the people, and for a brief term of two years, utters the current and changeful opinions of the moment. A good deal of new and strange, and not altogether pleasant light, has been thrown of late years upon the actual working of various departments of our model system; but we doubt whether, on the whole, any one branch of the Federal power has suffered so much in the general esteem of Americans, from its recent developments, as this particular body of the Senate. All our preconceived ideas of its dignity, its capacity, its value to the commonwealth, have of late been sadly shaken. The intellectual reputation of the Chamber has flagrantly fallen away. The nation no longer looks to it for those displays of sagacious patriotism and thoughtful statesmanship which made it a light in the land, when the permanent policy of the North, the South, the East and the West used to be uttered in clear and commanding accents from that floor by a CALHOUN and a WEBSTER, a MANGUM and a CLAY. Under the influences of the Administration, which at present controls a majority of the Senatorial voices, the Senate has gradually come to be regarded as a sort of Executive Council, the mouth-piece of the White House, recording the wishes and echoing the prejudices of the President. Here, for instance, within a few weeks, the whole country has been scandalized by the conversion of the Senate into a kind of passionate and vulgar caucus, in which one after another of the supposed leaders of the Democracy has aired his personal spite or his sectional indignation against one particular statesman of the Democratic Party. Of what possible importance is it to the people of the United States whether Mr. SLIDELL or Mr. GREEN, or Mr. BENJAMIN approves or disapproves of the political doctrines of Mr. DOUGLAS? These are matters to be settled by the parties interested in the proper assemblies of their own factions. To introduce them to the National Senate, to embody them in resolutions, to consume the time sacred to public business of no partisan character, in these contemptible squabbles, is such a dereliction from the lofty uses to which the Senatoria1 office was set apart by the founders of our institutions, as cannot fail to consign its abettors to general contempt.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/01/archives/mexico-and-the-senate.html,,"The Senate of the United States once enjoyed the reputation of filling in the Government of this country the practical and conservative part which is theoretically performed by the House of Lords in the Parliament of England.

On the former gentleman being introduced to the meeting, he was received with prolonged and continued bursts of applause. Silence being restored, he said that he had come to render an account of his stewardship. No one was more surprised than himself at his having been selected as their delegate to Chicago. So honored he had accepted the trust and went to consult for the good of their common country. However hopeful I might have been, he continued, I assure you I was not prepared for the scenes that awaited me; for although I have seen much of politics, and witnessed many public conventions, I am constrained to say that there never was a gathering like that at Chicago. It at least commands the respect of the people and the world. All were intelligent, educated, earnest, sincere men; all enlisted in one purpose, and that purpose to rescue our Government from the deep degradation into which it has fallen. And during all those days, I desire to give my testimony that in the Convention or out of it, before the assembling and after it, there was not one word of unbrotherly feeling. There was an earnest purpose to do a great work, and a determination to do it in the best manner; and in that spirit the Convention consulted and decided. And although some hearts were grieved, there was a burst of approbation and applause that gave an unmistaken verdict of the people in favor of our decision.

"EXPERIMENTS WITH A LONDON FIRE ESCAPE. -- Last evening some initiatory and very successful experiments were made with a fire escape just brought here from London. The fire escape is the invention of a Mr. WEVILL, and has been for years in use in the English capital, where it forms, in fact, a part of the fire apparatus. The experiments took place in East Thirteenth-street, under the direction of Mr. A.J. GARVEY, foreman of Hook and Ladder Company No. 12. Mr. DECKER, Chief Engineer, several assistant engineers, two or three Presidents of Insurance Companies and foremen of various fire companies were present. In a state of repose the apparatus has much the appearance of a Hook and Ladder apparatus, excepting that the wheels are at one end instead of in the centre. On wheeling it into the street for use, the main body, or ladder part, is placed in a vertical position, the height of the present apparatus being thirty-five feet. If introduced in this City, however, an additional set of wheels will have to be added to prevent its coming in contact with the telegraph wires. The ladder part is got up on the extension table principle, being capable of elongation to any extent. Underneath the ladder is attached a canvas bag with a wire gauze covering, the latter serving to protect the canvas from taking fire. Through the canvas invalids and children are slid to the pavement. At the end are two small wheels to facilitate adjusting the ladder. By ropes and iron braces the machine is in a moment brought into play. The weight of the present machine is 950 pounds, and its cost about $1,000. The first experiment was made upon the Thirteenth-street Medical College. The apparatus was adjusted in its place in less than a minute. Men leaped out of the upper-story windows, and came down the ladder lengthened to 64 feet with perfect ease and safety. Sundry boys were slid down the canvas, and came securely and joyously bouncing upon the pavement. Similar experiments, with like satisfactory results, were made upon different dwellings in the neighborhood. Further experiments will be made in a few days in the City Hall Park.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/01/archives/city-intelligence-police-reports-still-another-new-counterfeit.html,,"EXPERIMENTS WITH A LONDON FIRE ESCAPE. -- Last evening some initiatory and very successful experiments were made with a fire escape just brought here from London.

"-- It appears that the unsophisticated strangers from Niphon have allowed themselves to be swindled by the very institutions of whose existence we affectionately advised them. Little TOMMY, the wag of the Embassy, and the especial pet of Washington ladies, has been inveigled into a mock-auction shop, where some Peter Funk, not having the fear of the Mikado before his eyes, sold him a pinchbeck watch for $120, the intrinsic value of which might be expressed by a single numeral. It seems a little singular that of all our loose-trowsered guests, this TOMMY should have allowed himself to be victimized. He was the astute Pagan who first mistrusted that the amplitude of the dresses worn by our ladies was not based upon necessity, and demonstrated this fact by actual experiment, collapsing the hoops of a Washington belle with his irreverent Pagan hands, greatly to the discomfiture of the wearer.

Little TOMMY, the wag of the Embassy, and the especial pet of Washington ladies, has been inveigled into a mock-auction shop, where some Peter Funk, not having the fear of the Mikado before his eyes, sold him a pinchbeck watch for $120, the intrinsic value of which might be expressed by a single numeral. It seems a little singular that of all our loose-trowsered guests, this TOMMY should have allowed himself to be victimized. He was the astute Pagan who first mistrusted that the amplitude of the dresses worn by our ladies was not based upon necessity, and demonstrated this fact by actual experiment, collapsing the hoops of a Washington belle with his irreverent Pagan hands, greatly to the discomfiture of the wearer.

"The rapidity with which HICKS has been tried and convicted in the United States Court, furnishes an instructive contrast to the dilatoriness of criminal proceedings in those of the State.

This report was committed to a special Committee, consisting of Profs. ALLEN and HUNTINGTON, and Revs. J.M. SHERWOOD and G.

This report was earnestly and thoroughly discussed for several days, Drs. Brainard, Allen, Walter Clarke, Mills and Huntington, and Rev. Messrs. Dowling, Sherwood and Seely being the leading speakers. It was finally resolved to recommit the whole subject to a special Committee to adjust, if possible, existing difficulties, and report to the next Assembly.

In making up the foreign mails, this letter, by an inadvertence of the distributor, was sent to Virginia instead of to Japan. As there was something very mysterious about the exterior of the document, it was forwarded by the Richmond Postmaster to Gov. WISE. Gov. WISE could not read tire letter but with that astuteness for which he is so justly celebrated, he instantly divined that anything beyond his comprehension must be well worth knowing and of importance to the State. A special session of the Legislature was immediately ordered, and this document was laid before the body. The Speaker of the Assembly, who had lately been carrying on a correspondence with the Tribune as to the best and speediest way of dissolving the Union, after a careful examination of the handwriting, declared it to be that of HOBACE GREELEY. Gov. WISH at once surmised that there was an Ethiopian in the wood-pile, and that this letter had something to do with another invasion of that State which he has sworn to protect, and will die to defend. But as no one was able to decipher the cabalistic characters, the document was forwarded to the foreman of the TIMES establishment; it being well known throughout the country that this gentleman, from a long experience in the Tribune office, can read GREELEY's manuscript quite fluently. Our foreman, however, after a careful examination of the writing, decided that it was too bad even for GREELEY, or that, if emanating from him, it could only have been written during the excitement of the Chicago Convention. From a casual word here and there, he rather inferred that the latter was the case, and that the mysterious document contained a detail of the way in which he defeated SEWARD. But PERRY, who happened just then to come into the composing-rooms to sell a box of his Japan blacking, instantly set the matter at rest by declaring that it was simply a letter from Prince MOORAGARE to his cousin, the armor-bearer, and to ease the anxiety of Gov.

Considering the awful hints and surmises which were thrown out when the inquiry was commenced, and the dreadful nature of the revelations in which it was expected to result, it must be confessed that it would be hard to conceive of a lamer or more impotent conclusion than that to which the whole affair has come. Senator MASON, who has had special charge of the investigation from the commencement, has our sincerest sympathy. His zeal and industry deserved very much more startling discoveries than any that have so far come to light. The conflict between the Deputy Sergeant-at Arms and Mr. SANBORN and Miss SANBORN and the ladies at Concord, was sufficiently desperate to be the harbinger of awful disclosures, and that nothing more should have come of it is almost distressing.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The John Brown Inquiry.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The John Brown Inquiry.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ae7bbf1-2ef1-52db-a15d-8c19880b6269,561,nyt://article/5ae7bbf1-2ef1-52db-a15d-8c19880b6269

BOKER -- prominently known to the public by his ownership of the Art Union Gallery, and disowning his daughter MARY ANN, who married JOHN DEAN' his coachman -- situated a short distance above Tarrytown, on the Hudson River, was yesterday sold at auction, From Commodore PERRY, who formerly resided there, Mr. BOKER purchased the place. It comprises 94 acres of land, well wooded and diversified with meadows, lawns, gardens and fishing ponds. The mansion is built of stone, in the gothic style, with tower, porticoes, and bay windows. The Hudson River Railroad cars were loaded with leading Metropolitan merchants and capitalists, who attended the sale, the former anxious to secure a splendid rural residence for their families, and the latter moved thither by the spirit of speculation. A good number of metropolitan Mrs. Toodles were likewise on the ground, the seductive fascinations of a possible good bargain drawing them as surely there as the needle is attracted to the magnet. The magnet in their case was the cataloguing for sale of the entire household furniture, from the carpets, statuettes and carved rosewood sofas of the parlor to the straw mattress in the ""coachman's room."" The house and land were sold first, Mr. HENRY H. LEEDS being the auctioneer. The bidding was spirited, jumping at first several thousand dollars a bid, and gradually lessening, till the two were knocked down for $91,000. For the furniture there prevailed strong competition, many articles selling for twice their value. Altogether the sale resulted much better than was anticipated, and, with the jokes of Mr. LEEDS and a collation given to purchasers, afforded a pleasant visit to the hosts who went there.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/61bca090-df03-5011-886a-1ed396cae7c6,1741,nyt://article/61bca090-df03-5011-886a-1ed396cae7c6

Among the Wildfire's cargo there is a young mother, with a babe about six weeks old. She soon became an object of interest among visitors, and in a very short time both mother and child were suitably and comfortably clad. The babe soon sickened and died -- and as we saw the mother bending and weeping, and kissing its inanimate form -- wailing in plaintive song, and responded to by numerous mourners around the corpse -- we felt that love was beyond all conditions of pride or place, and that many might rejoice and be flattered in their self love, if they would be missed as much as the dead babe was by its mother. It was laid in a handsome coffin, and a procession of seventeen went with it to its last abode. Low chauntings and loud wails of grief would break forth, and when at last the spot was reached, they became as silent as the narrow house which would contain all the heart prized so much.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/02/archives/minor-topics.html,,"-- Even the London Times will sometimes blunder egregiously. It permitted its Paris correspondent, not long since, to announce that the Emperor NAPOLEON had interested himself in a hot-air invention for the propulsion of gun-boats; whereby it was calculated a yearly saving in the cost of fuel for the French navy would be effected to the extent of about 80,000,000 of francs. The calculator of this marvelous result would beat the mathematical gentleman at Barnum's. Now, let us sift the calculation. Two hundred war-steamers, each of 3,000 tons burden, running night and day without interruption for 300 days in the year. furnished with steam-engines consuming three tons of coal every hour, would consume in that time 4,320,000 tons of coal. We dare say that many fortunes might be made by supplying such a customer with coal at $5 a ton -- say 19 francs -- and at this rate his annual coal bill would be only about 80,000,000 francs. But the Emperor NAPOLEON and all the naval powers of the earth together do not perform one-half the amount of work above indicated. How shockingly, then, poor NAPOLEON must be cheated by his coalmen, if, by merely employing more economical engines in his twenty ships-of-war in commission, he can save yearly eighty millions of francs! We do not wonder that he has ordered such a marvel of an engine into the Reine Hortense; and, if what the Times correspondent says should turn out to be true, the new invention will probably pave the way for some device that will abolish the use of coal altogether, when the Bears can have it their own way with the Reading Railroad.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6373be6-8c12-5348-b232-5e433bcdf2f2,612,nyt://article/a6373be6-8c12-5348-b232-5e433bcdf2f2

The bill amending the act relative to private land claims in California was taken up and passed. The Post-office Deficiency bill being under discussion, Mr. COLLAMER moved an amendment, leaving the Postmaster-General discretion to judge of the propriety of restoring suspended routes. Mr. PEARCE, of Maryland, read a letter from Mr. HOLT urging the necessity of this policy. The amendment was, however, rejected. The amendment of the Finance Committee striking out the clause which restores suspended routes was agreed to. A lively conversation ensued in consequence of the South Carolina Senators urging that the Charleston and Havana mail contract should be given to the Isabel, instead of being submitted to competition. The latter course was adopted, and the bill passed. After an Executive session, the Senate adjourned. The bill, adjudging penalties to Marshals and their Deputies, for permitting prisoners to escape, was passed by the House. Mr. WINSLOW, from the Covode Investigating Committee; upon a question of privilege, made a statement in regard to certain witnesses, which the majority of the Committee refused to have called. He believed that with the aid of the Speaker's subpoena he could prove that large sums of money had been spent in securing the election of Col. SCRANTON, a member from Pennsylvania. Mr. COVODE, from the majority, explained that the House, in refusing to compel Mr. SCHELL to testify in regard to the disposition of a private electioneering fund, had established a precedent which the Committee could not disregard. Hence the refusal to act on the Pennsylvania case. Mr. TRAIN, of Massachusetts, rising to speak on the subject, was interrupted by Mr. HOUSTON, of Alabama, who persisted in speaking, notwithstanding a universal call to order: whereupon Mr. TRAIN remarked that he should consider himself guilty of gross impropriety, both as a member and as a gentleman, were he to continue speaking when he had no right to the floor."" Mr. HOUSTON inquired whether the remark was intended to apply to him. Mr. TRAIN replied that it did, and then Mr. HOUSTON pronounced him a ""disgraceful liar and scoundrel."" A scene of great violence ensued, in the midst of which Mr. SHERMAN demanded that Mr. HOUSTON should be censured for this language.

To keen the matter as quiet as possible only half-a-dozen carriage loads of ""friends"" were to be informed of these suddenly arranged details. But, somehow or other, at least four hundred persons must have been let into the secret, and by ten o'clock in the evening the matter was canvassed in the detective's office, and the information had already been telegraphed to Inspector FOLK, of Brooklyn. In ignorance of this fact, however, the friends and backers of the principals, with a large crowd of amateur ""sports,"" and one or two carriage-loads of reporters, made their way a little after midnight toward East New-York. Here the initiated were first informed that the rendezvous was at Centreville Course. The track was reached a little after dawn. Here it was rumored that the police were on the alert, as, indeed, they were -- for in the sequel it was ascertained that some forty were present in citizens' clothes, prepared for any emergency, each armed with mace and revolver. On account of rumors, it was judged best to go a few fields further on. This was done, a ring was made, and then the fact became very evident that the field was full of policemen. Inspector FOLK was present himself, and avowed his determination to put a stop to the fight. WOODS and KING were near at hand, but not on the ground. Many of the crowd thought that the police were either too few to interfere or were beyond the limits of their authority, and so arranged a little ""test fight"" between ""feather weights"" for the purpose of seeing what the police would do. Two young sports made themselves conspicuous in collecting a subscription for the best man. They collected about forty dollars from the crowd, and the feather weights, after some discussion, agreed to fight for that sum. They entered the ring -- their names, BILLY DONNELLY and TOMMY THOMPSON. They were about peeling, when the police exhibited their staves, made a rush, secured the ring rope and ended the ""test fight"" in a quiet and summary manner. The collector of the purse disappeared with marvellous rapidity when the Police made their appearance and has not since been heard from.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PRIZE RING.; Another Unsuccessful Attempt of Woods and King to ""have it out""--Police Interruption--Revolvers drawn, and no Money won.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PRIZE RING.; Another Unsuccessful Attempt of Woods and King to ""have it out""--Police Interruption--Revolvers drawn, and no Money won.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/315a2166-9416-5a2d-bcfb-808985e5371a,1258,nyt://article/315a2166-9416-5a2d-bcfb-808985e5371a

The Neapolitan troops had been defeated by GARIBALDI, on the 16th ult. The position of Monreale, which commands Palermo, had been invested by his troops, and a rumor was current that Palermo, or, at least, a portion of it, was in the hands of the populace. The royalists everywhere were much discouraged; the people were universally jubilant. A band of 500 volunteers had reentered Tuscany. On the 19th ult. sixty Pontifical gendarmes and said to have encountered three hundred and fifty Garibaldians in a grotto near Montefiascone. A contest ensued, in which the latter were defeated, the brother of ORSINI being killed, but owing to the darkness of the night the Papal troops fired upon each other in error, killing five of the soldiers and two officers. Papal troops, with a supply of artillery, were leaving Rome for the frontier. England had not yet given her consent to the assembling of a Conference for the settlement of the Eastern question, but she is understood to agree with Austria and Prussia as to the maintenance of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The House of Lords had rejected the bill for the repeal of the paper duty, by a majority of 89, Lord LYNDHURST asserting the constitutional right of the House to reject it.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/04/archives/city-intelligence-commencement-of-sales-for-unpaid-taxes.html,,"-- Parties who own real estate in this City, who have been so neglectful as to fail to call ""at the captain's office"" and settle for taxes during the year 1855, are reminded that the annual sale of property for unpaid taxes commences at the City Hall to-day, under the direction of the Comptroller, and will be continued from day to day until completed. The same warning applies to house-owners, whose water rents for 1854 remain unpaid, as both are included in the same sale. To the uninitiated it may not be amiss to state, that at such sales the fee of property is no sold, but it is bid off to the party who will take it for the shortest term of years, the owner having, however, the equity of redemption within twelve months, by paying the arrears and all expenses, with 14 per cent. added. Many fortunes have been made at these sales in old times, when books were kept in such a blundering manner that it was not uncommon for a party to have his house sold over his head, without his knowledge, as no notice of sale or of arrears is given, except such as is published in the papers selected for the job, and these are generally such as have the smallest circulation. Another feature, eminently deserving attention, is that a house or lot is not sold by its Street number, but by the number designated on the Ward Map, so that an owner who does not know the Ward number of his house or lot, is in danger of being incontinenlly sold out, his only relief, in case he has paid his taxes, &c., being the tedious process of appeal to the Supervisors.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; COMMENCEMENT OF SALES FOR UNPAID TAXES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; COMMENCEMENT OF SALES FOR UNPAID TAXES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/520feb18-7775-5ace-8c4d-d771e944fdd4,757,nyt://article/520feb18-7775-5ace-8c4d-d771e944fdd4

There was not a place to be found for a public building which was not held by some private individual, under a grant from the Mexican Government, or a conveyance from the original grantee, at an enormous price. When the parties were finally put to their proofs before the United States District Court, documents were produced bearing every appearance of authenticity; they were sworn to by hosts of witnesses; and even Mexicans in a high political and social position, members of the Government, and others, came on to San Francisco, to vouch for them under oath.

It now appears that on the 15th and 16th of May the volunteers under command of GARIBALDI met and defeated the royal Neapolitan army in two successive combats, drove them back upon Palermo, followed them in their retreat, and succeeded in seizing upon and occupying the position of Morreale, a lofty semi-circle of heights which completely commands the City of Palermo itself. Terrified, as they well might be, by this rapid and decisive advance of their enemy, the royal commanders were making their preparations for abandoning an untenable attitude. Gen. LANZA had issued proclamations offering an ""amnesty"" to the people whose homes have been so infamously invaded, and whose rights have been so insolently trampled upon by the agents of his King; and establishing a vice-royalty in the island in favor of the Count DE TRANI, the son of a sovereign who never kept his word, and the brother of a sovereign whose brief reign has already taken its place in history with the most disgraceful despotisms of ancient or of modern times. Meanwhile, as if foreseeing the angry scorn with which the Sicilians must receive these concessions wrung from a falling tyranny, the Governor of Palermo was hastily throwing up intrenchments between the city and the seaport, in order that the troops might be able to retreat to their vessels, and escape from the island without being overtaken by the rising and indignant populace.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Garibaldi in Sicily.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Garibaldi in Sicily.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-06-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd38175b-6ff7-5028-9907-c3765b879b82,913,nyt://article/dd38175b-6ff7-5028-9907-c3765b879b82

The Houmas Claim bill was taken up, discussed briefly, slightly amended, and postponed. The Kansas bill being the order of the day, Mr. SUMNER delivered an oration on the ""Barbarism of Slavery."" As an exordium, he referred to the four years which had elapsed since the utterance of his latest speech on the subject; and disclaimed any sentiment of hostility or desire for vengeance, as the result of occurrences at that time. He had then spoken of the crime against Kansas. He had now to combat the doctrine recently asserted that Slavery is a form of civilization, by pointing out its essential barbarism and antagonism to all active forms of social development. He proceeded to prove the barbarity of slavery in itself, and the barbarism of the masters, citing freely from the speeches and writings of prominent Southern statesmen, and conspicuously from those of distinguished South Carolinians. The remarks of Mr. SUMNER were full of acerbity, abounding in unqualified invective, and well calculated to offend grossly the susceptibilities of Southern members. He was replied to by Mr. CHESNUT, of South Carolina, in a few bitter remarks, to which Mr. SUMNER rejoined by characterizing them as an apt illustration of the text of his discourse.

"If a stranger, in endeavoring to delineate the idiosyncrasies of the Anglo-Saxon race, asserted, among other singular facts, that, next to the pleasure of seeing a man hung, they delighted in hearing him sentenced to death, the statement would excite universal execration, and yet he would state nothing more than the truth.

One would imagine that there would be little music in the words which fall upon a man's life like the executioner's axe, and make him virtually dead while he yet moves and breathes; yet more crowd to hear the sentence of death drop from the Judge's lips than go to receive a benediction from BEECHER.

Although advising the Committee of Reception in anything which savors of aesthetics may seem as much a work of supererogation as though we attempted to teach them to chew tobacco, we have a plan of ornamentation to offer which would astonish and please the natives as well as the foreigners. Let several of the Aldermen be suspended by the neck from each of the larger trees in the vicinity of the City Hall, with a large weight attached to their heels, and we venture to say that the exhibition would be pleasant to all, dissatisfactory to none. It is true that the Japanese might think that the trees of this country bore interior fruit to those of Niphon, but this fact could be accounted for by the sterility of the soil of the Park, and the little cultivation that is deemed necessary in raising Aldermen. If any one can devise a better plan for ornamenting the City Hall grounds, or a better use to which our Aldermen can be put, we should like to hear from him before the arrival of the strangers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-06-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d12ad51-785a-59ba-af49-1cbcedb9377a,958,nyt://article/0d12ad51-785a-59ba-af49-1cbcedb9377a

Supposing that the brandy which he was to take was all like the sample, he took a large quantity of it, but soon found that the bulk of the purchase was not the same as the sample.

The straggling character of the present meeting was the best proof of the necessity of meeting; he had seen a great many meetings in Westchester, but never a large one -- a general turn out; it was the worst place possible to get the people together; it was all circumference and no centre; they had always fought in a straggling, half-organized manner, and never had any notion of the character of the vote they were going to poll until after election. Four years ago they cast eight thousand votes in this County, and by proper effort that number could be considerably increased this Fall. Of that large number of Democratic voters at that election, not one in ten now approve of the manner in which the administration of this Government has been conducted, whether it were the attempt to force Slavery upon Kansas -- the wasteful, extravagant and dishonest squandering of the public money -- or any other of the many obnoxious measures which have distinguished it. On the contrary, many men who then voted for the Democratic Party are dissatisfied with the course affairs have taken, and are ready to cooperate with the Republicans to place the Government on a new track. Mr. HASKIN declared he went to Congress to do all he fairly and honestly could to bring in Kansas as a Free State. He had done worthily and well, because he had done what he promised to do. He could not say as much for Mr. BUCHANAN. He came into power by a large majority of the electoral votes of the Southern States, and little could be expected of him. The horse must know his master, and he knew him. JOHN A. DIX, an old resident, and well-known here, went around the country four years ago, saying this matter of Kansas was very bad, but Mr. BUCHANAN, when he came into power, would give us a very different state of things. Mr. PIERCE was charged with doing very badly, put we were now to see all these affairs set right. But what had been the sequel? Were we to have another JOHN A. DIX this time? He firmly believed that this County, if fairly organized, would give a handsome Republican majority this Fall. In this large, prosperous and wealthy County, there ought to be found no man to approve of the present profligate Administration. It might be said ""all these things are settled now."" But they were not settled, though, and there was no intention of having them settled. They do not mean to let Kansas come in as long as they can prevent it; she has three electoral votes to cast against them. This is the policy at the White House. There never was a Territory with the same number of population as Kansas, or anything like it, which has applied for admission and has been denied. He knew there were one hundred thousand people there: on a cold and wintry day last Fall, when the people were tired out by one election after another, they cast 15,000 votes. Even Oregon, with nothing like tee fitness which Kansas has, came into the Union, and she now turns round and votes to keep Kansas out. The Republicans were compelled to sustain themselves against unreasoning and unreasonable prejudices as to what they wish to do. If every man in the country could have the Republican platform placed fairly before him, or pick it up in the street without knowing whether one or another party had made it, he would say, ""I do not see what is wrong here,"" and would be ready to indorse it heartily. Mr. GREELEY urged the importance of a thorough organization of the county, in which every Republican should have some work to do. One vote lost in a school district was twelve thousand votes lost in the State. In referring to the Chicago nomination, he said he believed they could not have selected two men who would have received so many votes outside of the Republican ranks; so that if they were defeated, it would be on account of their own apathy and coolness. After referring to the demands of the South for protection to slave property in the Territories; to the project of annex in Cuba in order to extend the slave power; to the probable acquiescence in these demands by the Baltimore Convention, and to the position of Mr. DOUGLAS, Mr. GREELEY closed his remarks.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLITICAL.; THE WESTCHESTER REPUBLICANS.

"It is almost to be deplored as a misfortune for Congress to manifest, as it occasionally does, stray gleams of common sense and public spirit, so unhappy is its way of exhibiting them. Yesterday and the day before the House of Representatives afforded a striking example of this fact. Commencing its deliberations on Wednesday at 11 o'clock, it remained in continuous session until Thursday at 11 1/2 o'clock, -- vindicating the doctrine that the time of the House should not be wasted, by wasting two days of its time. It has grown, as the world too thoroughly knows, into a habit for members, who have no conceivable hope of influencing the action of others by what they say, and who have no thought of promoting the public good by sound or practicable suggestions, to speak for hours upon questions wholly irrelevant to the topic under consideration. These speeches, which seldom have a larger audience than a score of persevering representatives who lack other means of killing the hour, the reporters, and a few spectators straggling in or out of the gallery, appear next day in the Globe, and next week in a pamphlet, with which the country at large, and especially that portion of it represented by the drowsy orator, is presently deluged. Very frequently, we are assured, gentlemen are prompted by political committees outside to make and utter set speeches, that may serve for dissemination as partisan campaign documents, and that invaluable commodity, the time of the House, is drawn upon to initiate the circulation of these missives. So transparent, indeed, is the absurdity, that some of the more wise and modest refuse to visit the vacant House with their wisdom, contenting themselves with obtaining an imprimatur, authorizing the printing of the unuttered speech in the official record.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/08/archives/stump-oratory-in-congress.html,,"It is almost to be deplored as a misfortune for Congress to manifest, as it occasionally does, stray gleams of common sense and public spirit, so unhappy is its way of exhibiting them.

"In response to a call to meet and ratify the nomination of LINCOLN and HAMLIN for the office of President and Vice-President of the United States, an exceedingly large number of Republicans congregated in and around Cooper Institute last evening. Nearly an hour before the time for organizing the meeting in the main hall, a cannon, placed in front of the Institute, and an excellent band of musicians on the balcony, kept the attention of those who had gathered outside until the doors were opened.

STOUT, City Chamberlain, to the Comptroller, after presenting in detail the manner in which the business of his office is transacted, and how the accounts are kept, refers to the fact that several of the Trust Funds are largely overdrawn, and explains how the overdraft occurred. He says the accounts in the Comptroller's office were in such a confused state at the beginning of the year, that it was impossible to learn the condition of the various funds without much time and labor. Meanwhile, it being indispensable that payments should be made, there was no alternative but to go on and make them, while the investigations in the Comptroller's office were progressing, and as soon as the actual state of affairs should be ascertained, to make the proper adjustment. Accordingly a new set of books were opened. On completing the investigation of the old books in the Comptroller's Office, it was found that the ""Assessment Fund"" and ""Street Improvement Fund"" were each overdrawn for a large amount at the beginning of the year, and measures were immediately taken to replenish and supply the defic???encies. In relation to payments he says, it frequently happens that persons whose names are on the rolls are not found by the paying clerk, and do not call for their money, which prevents an early return of the rolls to the Comptroller's Office. As an improvement upon the present method, he recommends a return of the rolls with the names unpaid to the Comptroller's Office, and that the amounts due be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of ""Unclaimed Warrants;"" or, if preferred, the names unpaid to be transferred to new rolls for ""back pay,"" and the amount left in the hands of the Paymasters, to be paid when called for. He complains that owing to the want of sufficient help and office-room, the present plan of making payments is very expensive to the Corporation. The laborers employed by the Croton Aqueduct Department are assembled every fortnight in the Park to receive their pay, an arrangement which results in the loss of from a quarter to a half a day's labor from each man to the City, as their pay goes on while they are waiting; and the same is true of the laborers employed in the City Inspector's Department. As there is a very large number of men employed, as named, the loss is considerable. He recommends that a suitable office be provided for the purpose, and authority given for the employment of a sufficient number of clerks, with proper sureties for the faithful performance of their duties. The cashier of the Shoe and Leather Bank certifies that there was on deposit in that Bank, Dec, 31, 1859, the sum of $4,030,504 15, belonging to the Corporation of the City of New-York; and that by order of the Chamberlain and County Treasurer, there was transferred from the account of the ""County Treasury"" to the credit of the ""City Treasury,"" as on Dec. 31, 1859, the further sum of $273,863 72, making the total amount $4,304,367 87, which amount was standing to the credit of the following accounts, viz.:",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CITY GOVERNMENT.; THE ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE CITY CHAMBERLAIN.

Regret was expressed at the embarrassed position regarding the Society which the denomination occupied, as well as at the determined opposition made by the leading Congregational associations of New-England to the course which, the Assembly has deemed it its duty to pursue. This policy is reaffirmed, although a desire is expressed to effect a good understanding with Congregationalists, and all disposition to take advantage of them in the cooperation, or to assent to any right which is not freely accorded to them, is deprecated.

The first shot only grazed the side of his head, and, as if determined to murder him, the assailant thereupon fired another, which passed through his neck, luckily only inflicting a flesh wound. To this charge the fellow pleaded guilty, relying, doubtless, upon his standing as a Ward politician to come off harmless.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Politicians and our Judges.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Politicians and our Judges.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4abfe4da-3983-5f45-9379-4e5d5396842b,987,nyt://article/4abfe4da-3983-5f45-9379-4e5d5396842b

The particulars of the failure of the house of J.B. JRCKER & Co., the Government bankers, are thus received. The event, it appears, was not wholly unexpected, as it was understood that the Liberal Government would, upon its advent to power, repudiate all the transactions of JECKER with the Miramon usurpation. The recent advantages obtained by the Liberals had precipitated the result; the impression that the actual status must shortly terminate gaining ground, and on the 17th of May, the run upon the banker commenced. One million dollars were paid that day; but as six hundred thousand dollars were necessary to meet the requirements of the ensuing day, and were not on hand or procurable, the Bank failed to open on the 18th. A meeting of creditors was at once held, where it was learned that the foreign obligations of the house amounted to $1,300,000, while its home debt was $3,200,000, a total of $4,500,000. The assets were represented by mining property, $1,100,000; Government loans, $2,300,000; miscellaneous credits $3,600,000. JECKEP. desired four years’ extension in which to pay principal and interest, which his creditors are disposed to concede. The political news is of further disasters sustained by the Church Party in Durango, the leaders, RAMIREZ and CAJEN, having been utterly routed. URAGA continues to retain his superiority over the Reactionists. Should no reverse obstruct his advance, the reestablishment of the Liberal Government in the capital is looked for during the current month. By telegraph from New-Orleans we have advices to the 4th from Tampico, stating that URAGA had captured Guadalajara, but it had been regained by Gen. WOLL.

REVERDY JOHNSON, the distinguished Baltimore lawyer, Ex-Attorney-General of the United States, quondam Henry Clay Whig, but more recently Douglas Democrat, arrived in this City Saturday afternoon, and took rooms at the Fifth-avenue Hotel, where, at a late hour in the evening, he received the compliment of a serenade, given by the Douglas Committee of this City, representing, among other prominent citizens, the names of Wm. F. Havemeyer, Francis B. Cutting, A.V. Stout, Auguste Belmont, Moses Taylor, Edward C. West, John E Devlin and John Clancy. Dodworth's Band was engaged for the occasion, and at about 10 o'clock it appeared in front of the Hotel, and commenced playing some of its favorite airs. A crowd of five hundred or more persons soon collected about the Hotel, the balconies and windows of which were filled with ladies, and the band had scarcely finished the first air before calls began to be made for ""JOHNSON."" These constantly increased in frequency and force, until at length Mr. JOHNSON made his appearance on the balcony, and was introduced to the audience by Mr. ANDREW V. STOUT. He began by expressing his indebtedness to his visitors for the honor of their call -- an honor which he prized the more highly, as it conveyed an assurance to his mind that the views he entertained of the political condition of the country, and the policy best adapted to restore it to peace and harmony, met with the concurrence of his follow-citizens. There was no concealing the fact that sectional stride was last endangering the peace and security, it not the very existence, of the Republic, and??? this strife could be adjusted upon some fair and permanent basis, there was reason to apprehend the worse results. Was there no such basis? He believed there was. It was to leave the subject of that strife to be disposed of ay each politically organized community as it, might think best, Slavery in the States was universally admitted, except by a few fanatics, to be exclusively within the control of the people of??? state, and entirely beyond the jurisdiction of other States, or of the General Government. The results of this policy had been good; under it, no State had been agitated by its own management of the Slavery question. Why should not this right of managing their own concerns, and directing their own policy, be entrusted to every people having governmental power legally obtained? It was a matter that concerned themselves alone; their infancy as a Territory would soon ripen into manhood as a State, and then, it was conceded on all bands, this power would rest with them. Why deny the power while the people are preparing for manhood? Whatever disposition they might make of the question, they were the better and the sooner prepared for entire State sovereignty. At any late he??? was done. Unlike Congressional Interference which had always been??? to the South, and as they believed contrary to their Congressional rights, this principle of non-intervene??? made it an their??? own. Slavery was defended as a local Scale institution. It was the??? and properly claimed, to he a domestic concern, over which the people of other states had no control, and with which they bad no??? This was the ground which the South had always occupied, and it was the true ground. It was the ground held by Judge DOUGLAS, whose policy upon this whole subject was the true policy. He was in favor of the nomination of Mr. DOUGLAS for the Presidency, because he was confident of his satiny to??? it, and of his firmness and honesty to stand by it; because not only in this had he been just to the South, but he believed that in the future, as in the past, he would be faithful to all her rights.[Applause] Because he had at my national heart, and a mind to comprehend the interests of all sections of the Confederacy; because, not being instance with one idea, and imbued with mistaken??? fanaticism, he was true to the rights of all, he guaranteed by the Constitution.

If a man is disposed to complain of his own superfluous flesh, and lament that he cannot scrape it off and enjoy the luxury of sitting in his bones, a sight of the ""fat boy"" does much to remove his discontent.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/12/archives/minor-topics.html,,"-- A stroll through BARNUM'S is good in warm weather. If a man is disposed to complain of his own superfluous flesh, and lament that he cannot scrape it off and enjoy the luxury of sitting in his bones, a sight of the ""fat boy"" does much to remove his discontent. This interesting individual is seven years of age, and weighs 250 pounds. He is about 2 feet 3 inches tall one way, and 3 feet 2 inches tall the other. In his more extreme youth he must have been what Solomon has laid to the charge of the foolish son, “the heaviness of his mother.” His face looks very much like the full moon rising from a flesh-colored mountain, while for purposes of locomotion his legs seem about as useful to him as they would be to a wagon-wheel. It is good to be fat, but not too fat! And then there is the Angel-fish. This is not, as one at first thought would imagine, a mere-maid, but a mere fish, -- yet most beautifully colored withal. Imagine to yourself a rainbow with fins, and you have already seen the Angel-fish. Of the boa-constrictors, with their interesting family, it is not necessary to speak; the? must be seen to be appreciated. In regard to the “What is it,” we have a shrewd suspicion that BAENUM has at length discovered the connecting link between humanity and Common Councilmen, although, as old nurses say, “it favors” the latter more than the former.

Since the last trot between Flora and Patchen, much speculation has been going on, in the minds of the betting men, whether Flora could compete with the big horse in a two-mile race, and repeat. But when it was recollected that she had previously performed the task in 4 minutes 50 1/2 seconds, and that in her previous trot with Patchen she had done a mile in. 2:21 and 2.21 1/2, all doubt seemed to vanish, and she had the call up to the morning of the race at 2 to 1, while yesterday morning the betting had gone up to 100 to 40 on her, and just after she had passed in front of the stands it stood at 106 to 35, at which figure considerable business was done with the Patchen men. While the betters were laying out the money, and sporting men generally, hazarding their opinions, the Flora crowd were all alive for the event. The early trains of the Long Island Railroad dropped passengers at East New-York or Wood haven, and two mammoth trains were taken cat by Superintendent PALMER, at 2 o'clock, which carried 2,550 persons of all conditions to the Union Course. These were brought back in safety to New-York, notwithstanding the immense rush which generally occurs on these special trains. All the horse railroad cars which converge at East New-York did a big business and the track of the line of carriages and vehicles of all kinds which passed over the dusty roads was as distinctly marked by the cloud of dust as the line of fire on a prairie is traced by the smoke. The usual mixture of humanity and inhumanity met together, for an immense crowd of nearly 15,000 people were on the Course and stands, occupying-every available point of observation. The gamblers abounded on all the approaches to the Course, and many a poor simpleton, who was green enough to suppose that he could tell under which thimble the pea was placed, or which of the three cards was the one he had bet upon lost his money. But these are everyday occurrences, almost everywhere, and of course they are to be met in all their glory at the racecourse. Upon the arrival of the first train of cars some of the ""soughs"" made a dash for the back part of the inclosure, a few knowing ones having spotted a weak point in a twinkling. A couple of boards were wrenclied off, and about three hundred bilked the gate keeper out of a dollar a piece by getting through the fence. Those in authority, however, rushed to the breach, and stopped the inroad a great deal quicker than they usually do. A set to took place between a couple of the fancy men who occasionally ""go in"" on the Course as the best means of settling an account with some credit, both to themselves and the proprietors of the Course. Upon the arrival of the second train a party of half grown boys were seen at the outside opening of the Grand Stand, hauling up by means of a rope a number of others; the modus operandi pursued was as follows: the party of the first part in possession, lowered the bight of a rope in which, the parties outside seated themselves, and upon being drawn up to the sill of the opening were incontinently seized by the collar and seat of the breeches and shoved head-first into the opening, amidst the laughter of the outsiders. The refreshment stands outside were well patronized the lager at-sixpence a glass, bringing large returns to the owners of the kegs of that non-intoxicating beverage, and washing down the dust in the throats of the crowds who partook of it. Inside the course the arrangements were complete, various concoctions of chowder being the dish which was most called for, and sandwiches and oysters came and went with a rush.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TURF.; Great Trottiny, Match at the Union Course, between George M.

Mr. HENRY is, or has been up to the present, entirely unknown, both in the political and literary world; and the only ground on which attention is now claimed for his speeches and example is the fact that he is a grandson of PATRICK HENRY. This circumstance, whatever importance it may have for Mr. HENRY himself, in a social point of view, can possess none whatever in a political one, unless it indicates either that he inherits the eloquence of his ancestor, or that if the grandfather were now living, he would follow the same political course as the grandson is now pursuing. That PATRICK HENRY, however, did not bequeath his oratorical power along with his name, was made painfully apparent at the very first meeting at which Mr. GUSTAVUS HENRY appeared. He furnishes another illustration of the failure of the received laws’ of hereditary transmission, in the matter of intellectual power. Physical peculiarities, and even moral ones, are known to pass from father to son with a frequency and regularity which almost reach the rank of a rule; but as regards mind, naturalists are all at fault. In spite of a few brilliant exceptions, the history of great names is but a sorrowful record of their transmission in a single generation from great soldiers, statesmen and orators, to very common-place or very silly sons. Mr. GUSTAVUS HENRY may console himself for his present failure by looking over the list.

"A GIRL TIED TO A COW's TAIL AND DRAGGED TO DEATH. -- A terrible accident occurred in the town of Delhi. Delaware County, a week ago, which resulted in the death of a little girl seven years old. The parties to the sad occurrence were WM. SCOTT, a lad 17 years old, and his half-sister, ELIZABETH DOBY, the victim. The boy had been sent to take the cows to pasture, the little girl accompanying him. He had with him a piece of rope, with which he was to bring back some hay. On his way he playfully tied one end of the rope around the body of his sister, and the other end to the cow&#8217;s tail. When the cow had proceeded a short distance in this way, followed by the girl, the latter stumbled and fell, which so frightened the cow that she ran off at a furious rate, dragging the poor girl after her. After running some distance the girl&#8217;s head struck a solid rock, crushing in the skull, and at the same time the cow&#8217;s tail pulled out, so great was the force of the resistance. The girl was also badly cut around the face, neck and head. She was taken, up by the boy and carried home. Where she breached but two or three times before expiring.

Recent discoveries...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/14/archives/scientific-bulletin-a-new-atlantic-telegraph-ehrenberg-the.html,,"-- Since the failure of the Atlantic Telegraph, the confidence not only of tho public but even of scientific electricians has been considerably shaken in the ultimate practicability of a long direct line between England and America. Recent discoveries show that it is almost impracticable to work through an unbroken submarine circuit of nearly 3,000 miles, at any such speed as would insure a commercial profit on the capital invested in the line. A new solution of the problem, however, is now engaging the attention of scientific men in England, namely, the North Atlantic Telegraph. At a late meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, Col. SHAFFNER read a paper on the subject, from which we learn that the proposition is to submerge the cable from some point on the north of Scotland, in the first instance to the Faroe Islands, thence to Iceland, Greenland and Labrador. The length of the submarine lines would be 250, 350, 550 and 600 miles, making a length of submerged cable of 1,500 miles. Col. SHAFFNER, who has explored the east coast of Greenland, stated that the laying down of these cables would not be attended with much more difficulty than in other cases, for as far as he had examined the route he had found it unobstructed by ice, excepting on the coast of Labrador, where some special caution would be required in bringing the cable to land. The depths, so far as they had been sounded, did not exceed 2,500 fathoms, at which point there was a deep deposit of mud. The Colonel alluded to the great advantage which would attend having several short submarine circuits instead of an interrupted one. Through so comparatively short a circuit as 600 miles, which was the longest length of the submerged cables, as many as twenty words per minute might be transmitted, whilst the retardation of the electricity by the submerged wire of the former Atlantic Telegraph did not permit of more than three words per minute being transmitted. It is, however, intended, before bringing the enterprise definitely before the world, to undertake, under Government auspices, a careful surrey of the whole line.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN.; A NEW ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH EHRENBERG, THE MICROSCOPIST PHOTOGRAPHING COLOR CAPHBENES' PALACE BROUGHT TO LIGHT METTERNICH ON INSANITY SOLAR FEEDERS ARSENICIN THE DEAD GEOLOGIC TERMS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN.; A NEW ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH EHRENBERG, THE MICROSCOPIST PHOTOGRAPHING COLOR CAPHBENES' PALACE BROUGHT TO LIGHT METTERNICH ON INSANITY SOLAR FEEDERS ARSENICIN THE DEAD GEOLOGIC TERMS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7b9cd141-f847-5273-ac11-a8934028b5ba,1862,nyt://article/7b9cd141-f847-5273-ac11-a8934028b5ba

It is said that on the 6th inst. he called at the stable in question, having a set of harness on his arm and leading a. horse which he had borrowed, and told John McKevin, the hostler, to hitch the animal to a light wagon. His right to take the vehicle was questioned, but he replied so speciously and plausibly that he was allowed to go away with it, promising to return it in the evening. From that time until yesterday, however, nothing was seen of turn or the property, although a diligent search had been made, the only clue to his identity being the description that the hostler gave of his appearance, his representations when he procured the wagon having been false, and Mr. Harmon knowing nothing about him. He was finally apprehended at No. -- Pearl-street, where he was engaged as Treasurer to the Columbian Wine Company, and after an examination before Justice WELSH, he was held in $1,000 bail to answer the complaint, Mr. Edward A. Hearne, counsellor-at-law, becoming his surety. It subsequently transpired that he had exchanged Mr. Harmon’s wagon for an inferior one at the stables of Carll & Duryea, near the Fulton ferry, Brooklyn, and his last acquisition had attended the races at the Union Course. Officer Lee in the afternoon went to Brooklyn and found the vehicle, whereupon another complaint for larceny was lodged against Furness, by the Brooklyn stable-keepers, and last night he was rearrested upon a warrant issued by Justice CORNWELL. The second wagon was recovered from a stable in State-street, this City, where it had been left by the prisoner.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; A NOTORIOUS PERSON BECOMING MORE SO.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/14/archives/minor-topics.html,,"-- Capt. HENRY, of Washington, thought it could not be possible that he had insulted Senator SUMNER, as he had ""in his veins three hundred years of the blood of a gentleman,"" and, therefore, could not be guilty of an ungentlemanly act. We are not disposed to recognize the Captain’s logic. To assume that gentle descent renders a man incapable of ruffianly actions, is to make an assumption not warranted by precedent. In history there are, unfortunately, too many instances in which long family lines have terminated very suddenly in a noose; gentility has not unfrequently been brought to the gallows for exceedingly vulgar crimes. It is a very mistaken notion to think that blood improves with age. Wine gathers goodness with years; but the converse of this is generally true of blood and bone: -- both are apt to degenerate. When a man, in his own person, cannot display the fruits of manhood, it is very unwise for him to grub about the roots of his genealogical tree and deck himself with fossil respectability. In a live world, where men are judged not by what their fathers were, but by what themselves are, the logic of Capt. HENRY sounds very ridiculous. The blood of yesterday is recognized in this country as being quite as good as that which has been corked in veins for twice three hundred years; it is certainly nobler to found a family than to represent one. Capt. HENRY showed more manliness in apologizing for his rudeness than in boasting of his blood.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce146879-6ccd-5e9d-b5b2-4cda3193272c,1153,nyt://article/ce146879-6ccd-5e9d-b5b2-4cda3193272c

It was not an effort calculated to promote any of the practical national objects for which Mr. SUMNER was sent to Washington. It had no direct bearing upon any question awaiting the Senate's action, nor did it enlighten that body upon any subject over which it had control. It was an elaborate essay upon the character of Slavery; and if it had been delivered as a lecture, or an oration, before a popular audience, it would only been open to such criticism as its intrinsic character might invite.

About two thousand persons assembled, who testified their approval of the proceedings by a respectful attention to the speeches, and by frequent applause of the sentiments uttered. The stand was erected on the south side of Bowling Green. Shortly after 8 o'clock the meeting was organized by the election of ROBERT S. GOULD, President; AMOR J. WILLIAMSON, and a large list of others for Vice-Presidents; and EVERARDO WARREN, and six others as secretaries of the meeting. Mr. WARREN then read a series of resolutions, cheerfully and heartily indorsing the nominations made at Chicago for President and Vice-President of the United States, and eulogizing the candidates as the best that could have been selected to rescue the country from its present corrupt and imbecile Government; approving of the platform of principles laid down in the platform, and pledging their unanimous and earnest support of the same. JOSEPH HOXIE, Esq., was introduced. He came forward amid a shower of fire-works, and proceeded to address the audience in his usual earnest and humorous manner, upon the prospects of the campaign. He was frequently interrupted by applause. CYRUS B. DUTCHER followed Mr. HOXIE, and Mr. ANGEL from the western part of the State, STEWART L. WOODFORD and others spoke.

A very large congregation was in attendance, including many clergymen of different denominations. After the singing of an anthem by the choir, the services of the occasion were opened by the reading of passages of Scripture, followed by prayer from Rev. Dr. HAGUE Rev. Dr. DE WITT, President of the American and Foreign Christian Union, under whose auspices the American Chapel in Paris was erected, and by whose invitation Dr. MCCLINTOCK is to assume its pastorate, then addressed the audience in a few remarks explanatory of the objects and aims of the Paris Chapel, and the interest felt at the present time among Evangelical Christians of all denominations in its prosperity. He closed by introducing Rev. Dr. FAIRCHILD, the Secretary of the Union, who, he said, would read the instructions which had been drawn by the Society for the guidance of Dr. MCCLINTOCK in the discharge of his duties. These instructions were embodied in a very lengthy document, which was read to Dr. MCCLINTOCK, and which laid out for him an amount of labor in connection with his duties as pastor of the American Chapel in Paris, which must have convinced him, as it certainly did the audience, that the place was no sinecure. He was to do his part towards overcoming that great obstacle to the evangelization of the heathen world -- the Romish Church; he was to preach the gospel every Sunday without sectarian bias; he was to spend the week days in hunting up the American visitors in Paris, making their acquaintance, and reminding them of their Christian duties; he was to seek out particularly that portion of Young America which visits the gay French Capital for the purpose of spending their time in dissipation and riotous living, and to impress them with the error of their ways; and last, not least, he was to write a letter at least once a month to the American and Foreign Christian Union, giving a full account of his stewardship.

"The real question at issue appears to be whether we shall continue our intercourse with China on our terms or on hers. Our terms are those on which we communicate with all the nations of the world -- simplicity, frankness, hospitality, high principle and equality, as between gentlemen. The Chinese, on the contrary, insist on keeping up the illusion of an unapproachable sovereign, an irresponsible Central Government, and the not less startling illusion of an infinitely superior morality and sense of decorum. So long as we permit this illusion, and endure its natural consequences, we must be liable to continual insult and degradation, to frequent interruption of intercourse, to the cost and trouble of reinstating ourselves, and the odium of waging war with a people who know the proprieties neither of peace nor of war, and over whom victory itself is a scandal. This is best understood by the analogies of private life. It may be necessary to have intercourse with inferior people, but it is for us to choose whether we will associate with them on their terms or our own. We may, if we please, condescend to their insulated ideas, listen to their petty quarrels, their invidious estimate of all classes above them, their perpetual tone of depreciation, their immensely exaggerated opinion of themselves, and the substitution of one or two distorted ideas and inflated sentiments for the recognized maxims and common sense of well-bred and well-educated people. If we do this we inevitably sink to their level, and wallow with them in the same Stygian pool of malignity and folly. The only escape is to dictate our own terms; to maintain truth, kindliness, and mutual respect; and to consider ourselves, not as conspiring against society for some paltry game of our own, but cooperating with it for our common good. Some such account may be given of the terms on which we may demand, and do demand, to communicate with China. The time has gone by when she could impose her conditions; they are condemned by the result; we have tried them and failed; we must now impose our conditions with such gentle force as may be found necessary. All policies are judged by the result, -- not our private advantage, but the final development. The result of ovr former weak and temporizing policy in China is that we are outcasts, and at war, at the very time that our trade is greater than ever, and some hundred thousand Chinese are settled in the British dominions. The result on China herself is that she is torn to pieces and her population decimated by a wide-spread rebellion, and she is driven to immense cost in the idle defenc of her barbarous system.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/16/archives/the-state-of-affaris-in-chinathe-war-inevitable.html,,"The real question at issue appears to be whether we shall continue our intercourse with China on our terms or on hers.

"On Wednesday morning a black canvas traveling bag was found on the Paterson dock, which had been cut open -- the articles it contained and the bag itself being stained with blood. The supposition then was that it had been stolen from the railroad cars, and that the blood was from a cut on the hand of the thief, made in the haste to get at the contents. From papers found in the bag, it was judged to belong to a Mr. W.S. BROWN, who, it would seem, was transacting business for or with Messrs. NORTHUP & MARTIN, Newark. Yesterday morning the bag was fully identified as Mr. BUNN's by Mr. MARTIN, one of the firm in Newark above mentioned.

The supposition then was that it had been stolen from the railroad cars, and that the blood was from a cut on the hand of the thief, made in the haste to get at the contents. From papers found in the bag, it was judged to belong to a Mr. W.S. BROWN, who, it would seem, was transacting business for or with Messrs. NORTHUP & MARTIN, Newark.

"The appointment of Capt. HALL, and his assumption of the command of the Great Eastern, has already produced a great improvement in her external appearance.

While at P[???]atka, for instance, he was called upon by a Judge whose slumbers had been disturbed the night before by a serenade, and asked if he was one of the party. He said ""No."" The Judge replied that he was glad of it, for he meant to shoot on sight the first participant he could find. Our friend said he was glad he had not been present, as he did not like to travel 600 miles to be shot. A companion hinted that it was 1,200 miles, whereupon the Judge turned upon him, and said if he was disposed to take the matter up he would shoot him also. At another Southern town, while sitting upon the piazza of the hotel, our friend was amused by the sight of a dog running, yelping and howling, with a tin pail tied to his tail. Before he had done laughing the owner of the dog came along, declaring that he would shoot the man that tied the pail to his dog's tail, and being more than half disposed to shoot our Democratic friend for laughing at it!

"Under the head of ""Impressions of the Old School Assembly,"" the Evangel st replies to some remarks made by the Observer last week regarding the spirit of the New School Assembly.

It says, among other things, that ""An impression has been made on some minds during the sessions of the Assembly, that New-School men in the vicinity were seized with a longing to return to the old hive. This is a grave error. The fact that they were hospitable and fraternal warranted no such interpretation as this.

The writer claims that the position of the New School Assembly on the subject of Slavery is much more satisfactory to Presbyterians in Western New-York than that of the Old School. While the differences between the two Presbyterian branches will become less, the great point of distinction in years to come will be that of virtually Pro-Slavery and conservatively Anti-Slavery influence.

"For some days we have been obliged to look upon the result of the Sicilian insurrection as doubtful. The confident dispatches, claiming victory after victory, which were issued by the Neapolitan Government, together with the absence of any definite news from GARIBALDI himself, gave some ground for alarm. Happily these fears are dissipated by the intelligence which we are able to publish to-day. GARIBALDI entered Palermo on the 27th. The capital of Sicily is in his hands. In spite of every deficiency the levies commanded by the heroic Italian drove the troops from their positions. Henceforth GARIBALDI has all the moral and material strength derived from the possession of the chief place in the island. Timely supplies of men and materials will be the fruits of victory. Its moral effecte will be the discouragement of the army, and perhaps a large desertion to the ranks of the patriots. The whole interior of the country, together with its most important city, have now been wrested from the Royal authority. From one end to the other the island has been cleared of the Royal troops. It is now evident that the encounter at Calata Fimi was a victory for GARIBALDI. Instead of the troops attacking him, it is probable that he drove them from their positions, and then harried them on before him to Palermo. The troops have been driven out from their lines before the town, and probably only command the spot on which they are encamped. Far different is the position of the national party. From the beginning it seems that the Sicilians have had confidence in their leader, for they have joined him in crowds, quitting the towns held by the Neapolitan garrisons, and coming to swell the adventurous bands of GARIBALDI in the open country. We may therefore now consider that he has achieved almost certain success. He has the country at his back, and can obtain obtain supplies of all kinds from the interior; he can communicate with his adherents in any part of the island, while the royal garrisons are all divided from each other, and intelligence can only pass between them by sea.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/16/archives/garibaldi-and-italy.html,,"""Italia fara de' se!"" Italy is indeed deciding her own destiny. Every day which passed under the blue sky of Sicily and over the heroic march of GARIBALDI and his liberating army, bequeaths a new proof that the blow which prostrated Austria at Solferino sent down with the foreign tyrant every buttress of that hideous system miscalled a Government, under which the people of Italy have for forty years been writhing in a fierce but never in an apathetic misery. Though called by a dozen different names, and vested in as many different rulers, this system has been virtually one and the same in Venice and in Sicily, in Modena and in the States of the Church. Force and fraud have been the very conditions of its existence; cruelty and rapine its familiar machinery of control. All the rest of the world had gradually grown away from the ideas of the Congress of Vienna; and it was hard, not for Americans only, but for Englishmen, for Frenchmen, even for Germans to conceive how fully and blindly and passionately Austria and the Austro-Italian sovereigns clung to these ideas still. The Pope and his Cardinals, the King of Naples arid his Councillors, the Northern Dukes and their favorites, believed in 1858, and lived up to the belief, as their predecessors had done in 1815, that the waves of the revolution of 1789 had been forever stayed on the shores of Italy and the Apostolic Empire. The mad and misguided Democracies of 1848 followed, and chastised by the reaction of 1840, had only confirmed this conviction. The King-craft of the Hapsburgs and their Italian dependents was of the simplest and most antique pattern. To cringe and lie in the moment of danger; to scourge and silence in the hour of victory, was the creed alike of FRANCIS JOSEPH and his crowned satellites beyond the Alps. For ten long years the Austrian Emperor had reigned in this creed of practice; for ten years, each one of which in its passage had, insensibly to him, been wearing away the very ground-walls of his throne, -- for each in its passage had been extending the relations of his people with the rest of the world, and making them more clearly recognize at once the depth of their own degradation, and the questionable reality of the power which towered above them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Garibaldi and Italy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Garibaldi and Italy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-06-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5c293d7-a2a4-59a0-8083-7f2234153960,1427,nyt://article/c5c293d7-a2a4-59a0-8083-7f2234153960

"Selection of a proper location for mooring the Great Eastern, after her arrival at this port, has been a subject of some difficulty, on account of her immense length, her heavy draft of water, and the necessity of having her lie afloat at all times of tide. The first suggestion to have her ancored and moored head and stern in the North River opposite the Battery, was open to grave objections on account of the large number of sailing-vessels and steamers which are constantly passing, and the liability of collisions and accidents. The difficulty and increased expense of boarding her while at anchor was another objection which the public, at least, would be likely to make the ground of serious complaint. It was finally determined to have her placed alongside of the dock, and near the Hammond-street pier, North River, was selected for that purpose. The wharf is nearly 1,200 feet long, so that she will have plety of room, lying with head or stern in the dock, and be clear of passing vessels. To give the required depth it has been found necessary to dredge out a portion of the slip which the monster ship will occupy. A gate across the head of the wharf will enable the managers to control the multitude which will flock on board by issuing tickets of admission. There are various conjectures as to the time she will occupy in coming across; the majority of nautical men being disposed to give her full ten days for the trip. Large numbers will go to Staten Island on Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of her arrival, and to obtain a full-length view of the great ship as she passes through the Narrows. As soon as she is announced in the offing steamers will also start to meet her, which no doubt will carry crowds of passengers to Sandy Hook or the Southwest Spit. Should she arrive off the bar at a low stage of the tide, she will be obliged to wait for high water, which will give sufficient time for parties to go down and escort her up.

Mr. SEWARD spoke at length on the subject, and strongly advocated the bill and its immediate consideration. To postpone it to the next session, he said, would be to postpone it indefinitely. The arguments for postponing it were so weak as to show a manifest disposition to avoid the whole subject. By a vote of 25 against 23, further consideration of the bill was postponed. The Army Appropriation bill was taken up, and some of the House amendments agreed to. The Overland Telegraph bill, already passed by the House, was concurred in by the Senate.

It is intended to put them on their guard against a deputation which is about to visit this country to collect funds for the erection of a hospital in Mount Lebanon. The writer characterizes the whole scheme as a down-right swindle -- as an attempt to raise money for private use by false pretences; and he cited the experience of the past as a proof of this statement. It seems that some nine years ago a very large sum of money was collected, in this country, to build schools in Lebanon. Not a single dollar has been thus expended -- the whole amount has been embezzled by the enterprising monk by whom it was collected.

"The proceedings in the Senate yesterday were interesting and important. Mr. WILSON's amendment to the Navy Appropriation bill, proposing to provide three steamers for the suppression of the African slave trade, was debated. Mr. COLLMER, of Vermont, said that the time had come to have some understanding with ourselves and the British Government in relation to the slave trade. The British Government, finding that emancipation had not worked well in her West Indian Colonies, captures Africans and sends them to Sierra Leone or St. Helena, where they are induced to become voluntary laborers for the West India Islands. The British Government gives $25 a head for them, and the effect was that both British and American coasters have an inducement to ship as many slaves as they can, to get the Rritish prize-money, while we, on our srde of the treaty, have to furnish our ships, hire our men, and pay $100 each for every African captured, and $100 each to send them back. So long as this was the case, so long would the Slave-trade continue. After some remarks by Mr. MASON, Mr. WILSON said he would not defend Great Britain. She might be false and hypocritical in relation to the Slave-trade, but assailing her did not justify us. He knew of nine vessels which had sailed within the last six months from New-York, and one at least from New-Orleans, to engage in that trade. We wanted for its suppression small steamers that could enter the bays and rivers of Africa, and sail swiftly, and not the large 80-gun vessels we have Mr. MALLORY denounced the conduct of Great Britain, in reference to the treaty, as a fraud practiced under the name of philanthropy. She could stop the Slave-trade with Cuba any day if she chose to do it. He said that no prominent man in the South was in favor of the Slave-trade. Mr. SEWARD said that a year ago he had introduced a proposition to increase the naval force and police to prevent the escape of slavers, and Southern Senators, opposed to the Slave-trade, had approved his bill. He was not prepared to abrogate the treaty with Great Britain, which required us to keep a squadron on the African coast, but he preferred that we should not make Great Britain a police for us. England had enough to do to take care of herself. The Slave-trade that we should abolish was our own trade. We should prevent our own merchants from fitting out ships, and our citizens from buying Africans. After further debate a vote was taken on the amendment, and it was lost by a vote of 18 against 25. The Navy Appropriation bill was passed. The business in the House yesterday was not of much importance.

"One of the closest and most spirited matches of the season was played between the above clubs on Saturday last, at Hamilton-square, and after some excellent play on either side, resulted in the victory of the Manhattans by one run. The small totals show that the fielding was superior to the batting, and in no single innings was there sufficient ""let up"" in the former to permit many runs to be scored. In fielding the champions showed a marked superiority, but two or three miss-plays having occurred, while their batting, on the other hand, was much below its usual degree of excellence -- GOLDIE, E.D. KELLEY and HENRY, being the only ones who did at all well. W. KELLEY made a good home run, as did HUDSON for the Manhattan. The pitching of GOLDIE was effective, but he is not fully at home except on the first base, his proper position. The play of W. KELLEY as catcher, and H. KELLEY on the second base, was fine, more than half the Manhattans falling victims to these two. The play of HENRY on the third base was without a flaw, and E.D. KELLEY in the right field played well. On the side of the Manhattans, the batting of JONES was undoubtedly superior to that of any other on either side, and his play on the third base was also deserving of great praise. The batting and catching of HUDSON were also commendable, though his batting was not up to his standard. Capt. TUOMEY's play on the first and second bases left nothing to be desired, and SPRAGUE and DUNPHY, though unfortunate at the bat, were very efficient in their respective positions.

The interior of Castle Garden presented an aspect much more suggestive of the Tower of Babel than of the historic scenes that transpired when the infant liberties of America were cradled there. The commingling of every dialect that prevails in Europe, from the Land's End to the Bosphorus, poured through throats of every age, from the babbling of infancy to the hoarseness of old age. Nor was the variety of tongues greater or more characteristic than that of garbs and manners. Thoughtful Germans from the banks of the Rhine withdrew to retired corners to study maps and books for information of the region through which their journey led them.

The Messrs. LELAND and the Naval Commission were besieged with applications to visit the Japanese quarters, to see Tommy, to have a look at the Princes, to examine the new Japanese dining-room, to exhibit specimens of American industry, to procure just one more card written by a Japanese, to get for a very particular friend only a few Japanese curiosities, to secure a Japanese visit to certain stores, and, in short, to do a multitude of other things more easily asked than granted. But firmness and patience prevailed, and the Japanese were allowed to keep comparatively quiet. It was determined on Monday that a number of the officials should be taken yesterday to view the charming scenery and gorgeous mausoleums of Greenwood Cemetery, but the state of the weather at the hour named -- 2 P.M. -- prevented their carrying out that design. Between the drops, however, a number of the under officials succeeded in doing considerable shopping among our Broadway stores. Two of the Secretaries, a physician and two officers were much interested at one of the book-stores, and purchased two dozen copies of a work on the United States coinage. They expressed much pleasure with their examination of illustrated and other books. A large assortment of jewelry and watches was exhibited during the day to the Embassy and members of their suite, and a number of purchases were made. The Japanese seem indeed to have exhibited an unusual taste for these things, although it is said they are, as a nation, rather opposed to ornamenting the person. The subaltern officers of the Embassy were much interested in a description of the process of making and galvanizing chains, and a valuable present of firearms sent in during the morning. A number of the Japanese, during their stay in this country, have adopted the American shoes altogether, finding them much easier than their own loose sandals, which enforce such an ungraceful walk. The slip-shod style, most usual among the Japanese, is somewhat illustrative of the minstrel style of representing a Virginia ""darkey's"" circular ""walks before commencing a breakdown.

The preparation, the departure, the landing, the quick succession of decisive battles, and the surrender of the Royal army have followed each other almost as rapidly as telegraphs could tell them. We sit and see it all pass rapidly on, and clap our hands, growing impatient if the curtain should be let down between the acts. This guerilla chief, although now a great General, and the supreme leader of two millions of people, still makes war like a guerilla chief. That promptitude which success stamps as wisdom and which failure brands as rashness is, in his circumstances, the only chance of victory. With guns and forts, and trained armies, and regular Generals versed in the regular strategy of modern warfare as his enemies, with brave, ardent fellows, destitute of everything but stout hearts and strong limbs as his supporters, GARIBALDI had to do all by dash, or not at all. He has done it. He has forced his way into Palermo, he has beaten the King's army, he has driven them into their forts, and he has obliged them to admit their inferiority by consenting to capitulate. Fast upon the intelligence that the capitulation had been completed, and that the 25,000 soldiers of the King's army were going forth under the pressure of the patriotic bands which had beaten and surrounded them, comes the news that the capitulation had been broken, that the forts and vessels have again opened fire upon the city, that the insurgents have resumed their arms and are swarming round the army, that the city is barricaded, and that amid the devastation which is going on the troops are deserting, and even a Neapolitan General has gone over to the popular cause. The procession of great events is rapid enough, but unhappily we have them as yet only in outline. GARIBALDI is the hero for the present age, when steam and electricity have so spoilt us for enduring the tardiness of old tidings that we should, perhaps, if we got CAESAR's celebrated dispatch, quarrel with the comma which separates the vidi from the vici.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/20/archives/the-african-slavetrade-the-debate-in-the-senate.html,,"We published yesterday a very interesting debate in the Senate on the proposition of Mr. WILSON to fit out five small steam-vessels for service on the Coast of Africa, in the suppression of the Slave-trade. It is not to be disguised that this question is surrounded with practical difficulties, many of which were very clearly stated by Mr. COLLAMER, of Vermont, as well as by two or three Southern Senators, who concurred, nevertheless, in denouncing the traffic and desiring its suppression. There is, indeed, no question in any quarter as to the activity with which the traffic is at this moment carried on, or the impunity with which it is attended. Not one of the hideous facts which were set forth in the letters of our correspondents on the coast of Africa, during the past Winter, in the TIMES, is denied. It is not disputed that nearly all the ships engaged in it are American ships, fitted out in American ports, and sailing under the American flag, or that a large portion of the cargoes are brought to market over our own waters, and under the noses of our cruisers. Nor is there any dispute as to the weight of the obligation which is imposed on us by religion, as well as by honor and sound policy, to do our utmost to suppress it. But in spite of all this, when we come to practical measures for suppressing the traffic, we encounter very formidable difficulties. The prize money offered tempts cruisers to permit the trade, in order that they may capture the traders. Sending the captured slaves to the English colonies supplies them with labor which they greatly need -- while our Government is compelled, at very heavy expense, to do them the very questionable service of returning them to the shores from which they were stolen. It is easy to multiply objections of this kind, and to make them pretexts for neglecting our plain and obvious duty in regard to the traffic.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The African Slave-trade The Debate in the Senate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The African Slave-trade The Debate in the Senate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f3ad330e-0203-5b41-9826-4f3c96f3f1f9,1248,nyt://article/f3ad330e-0203-5b41-9826-4f3c96f3f1f9

He was knocked senseless, and it required the free use of cold water and other restoratives for nearly an hour to revive him. A young man inside the building received so severe a shock as to need medical assistance, and a young lady who was near an open window, had a hole burned in her dress.

"Yesterday, as the Express train which leaves Chambers-street at 11 A.M. on the Hudson River Railroad, was within a quarter of a mile of the Peekskill depot, it ran over and killed three men, two of whom were fighting upon the track. The following are the particulars of the accident. The three men in question -- GEORGE RAWCLIFFE, HENRY W. HALL and THOMAS GRANGER -- were walking on the track near Peekskill, when HALL and GRANGER got into a quarrel, clinched and fell. This occurred just as the train appeared in sight, but it was impossible for the engineer to observe them at that distance. As the train approached, he gave the usual signal of danger, and continued to blow the whistle up to the time of the accident. The warning was unheeded by the two men who were fighting, but the other, GEORGE RAWCLIFFE, went to them as soon as he saw their danger, and attempted to separate them, when HALL seized him by his arm, and held him on the track. The engineer perceiving that it was almost impossible to prevent running over them, reversed his engine, and applied the patent brakes, but to no purpose, as before the train stopped, it had passed over them, instantly killing two, and fatally injuring the third. RAWCLIFFE, the young man who attempted to separate the others, was struck upon the head by the cowcatcher and thrown over on the other track. He struggled hard to free himself from the grasp of HALL, but the latter held him so closely that his head alone projected over the track upon which the train was. He was instantly killed. THOMAS GRANGER, who was underneath HALL, was mangled in a horrible manner, and instantly killed. His remains were carefully collected, and placed in a box. The other, HENRY W. HALL, was struck upon the head by the cow-catcher, and thrown to the side of the track. He lived nearly half an hour, but was speechless and insensible. On examination, it was found that his skull and ribs were broken. The accident was witnessed by several persons. The men were recognized by Mr. DAVID YATE, who keeps a brickyard Peekskill. They were all Intoxicated at the time. The bodies were taken up and conveyed to the engine-house. Coroner GRIFFIN, of Sing Sing, was notified; and an inquest was probably held last evening. No blame can be attached to the engineer or fireman. HALL was an American, and for several years a member of Engine Company No. 40, of this City. He is about 35 years of age, and lived at Oyster Bay, L.I. GRANGER was an American, 28 years old. RAWCLIFFE was an Englishman. Some three or four days since, he received a letter from his mother, and yesterday morning he bought some writing paper and envelopes, with the intention, doubtless, of answering his mother's letter. Unfortunately he met HALL and GRANGER, and the trio went round to several drinking-places, and got intoxicated. RAWCLIFFE was 22 years of age.

The peril of being hunted, and the pain of being shown up as social lions, are penalties which all distinguished foreigners in London must pay for their distinction. The Siamese Envoys who wore gold coats and never washed their faces; the Nepaulese, JUNG BAHADOOR, who shot twelve nobles of Nepaul to secure the Premiership and put himself on good terms with his sovereign; the Persian princes, who thought it hard they could not bring their harems to St. James', were all alike pounced upon by ladies who either led, or wished to lead, some circle of London ""society,"" and turned volentes nolentes into lions. It is not of the least consequence to the true lion-hunter whether his lions enjoy themselves or not. In the case of other human beings, nobody ever thinks of inviting them into companies with which they cannot converse, or to banquets of which they cannot partake. The lion receives no such consideration. He may be deaf and dumb, but that is no reason for hesitating to drag him to a concert. He may be a Catholic anchorite, but his hunter will clap him down on a Friday to a dinner-table a la Soyer as calmly as BOOLE: would ask the Grand Turk to a breakfast of sausages. The lion, indeed, is to ""society"" what the lamentable persons who parade Broadway in red oil-skin coats, inscribed with large white letters, are to commerce. He announces the existence and enhances the importance of his hunter.

"The leading feature of the foreign news which the Asia brings us to-day, is the brilliant story of GARIBALDI in Sicily. We transfer to our columns in full, the graphic and glowing Sicilian correspondence of the London Times, in which this story is told with equal breadth of descriptive power and accuracy of detail by the same accomplished pen to which the leading English journal was indebted for its best accounts of the last year's campaign of Italy. The conduct of the Neapolitan commanders and Government throughout this insurrection, now by their own recognition elevated to the rank of a war, would appear to have been unspeakably contemptible. It is established that the Neapolitan General at Palermo availed himself of the armistice to take up positions more threatening to the Liberal forces than those he had previously occupied, and that the cruel and cowardly bombardment of the city was only stayed by a menace of reprisals on royal prisoners from GARIBALDI. The attitude of the English Government confirms the position taken by NAPOLEON, and makes it certain that the conflict between Sicily and Naples must be settled without the intervention of any foreign power. The heir of FERDINAND has indeed been virtually notified that the existence of his dynasty is no longer considered necessary to the ""order of Europe."" It is rumored that the Queen Dowager, to whose evil counsels the mad policy of FRANCIS II is largely attributed, was on the point of quitting the Kingdom, and that the King, resigning Sicily as hopelessly lost, was about to attempt to save his continental crown by inaugurating a constitutional system. Great dissatisfaction begins to show itself at Rome between the Government and the crusaders under LAMORICIERE, who are ill-paid, worse-lodged and worst-treated. From the North of Italy we learn that a strong ""outside pressure"" is put upon the piedmontese Government, to force it into a declaration of war against Naples. The official transfer of Savoy and Nice to France was accomplished on June 1. After that date the government of those provinces would be administered in the name of the Emperor NAPOLEON, and the Domnie salvum fac imperatorem would be chanted in the churches. France and Russia, as a proof of their moderation, had promised to aid England and Prussia in helping the Sultan to carry out his proposed inquiry into the state of the Turkish Christians.

"We are at last definitely assured, by official authority, that the Emperor of China has declined to comply with the demands of the French and English Governments; and that the long-expected collision of those Powers with the Central Flowery Kingdom has become inevitable. It is probable, indeed, that active operations on the part of the allies must have begun long before this time. About the middle of April the allied land forces in China, in number more than twenty thousand men, were on their way towards the scene of operations in the north, and the French had established themselves in the important post of Chusan, which they were fortifying as a part of their base of operations. It will be noted as a curious feature of the Chinese official reply to the ultimatum of the Allied Governments, that the Peking Cabinet seek to distinguish between the part played by the English and that sustained by the French, in the negotiations which were brought so rudely to a close at the mouth of the Pei-ho. It is evident that the Mandarin Court is kept much more clearly informed of the political and diplomatic movements of Europe than might be expected of so dignified and self-centred a body. The ""great Emperor, always full of compassion for strangers,"" would gladly see France imitate towards her ally in the East the course pursued towards herself by England in the affairs of Italy and of Europe. But any hopes of such a result, if any were ever seriously cherished even at Peking, were simply puerile. The action of Baron GROS, and the conduct of the French force, which, although comparately insignificant in numbers, yet led in the attack on the forts of the Pei-ho, bound France to the quarrel of England in China. However ill-advised the diplomacy of Mr. BRUCE may have been judged by the Cabinet of the Tuileries to have been, NAPOLEON could not in honor, nor perhaps in policy, decline to accept its consequences. France must join England in forcing compliance with the treaties of Tien-tsin, as England understands them, from the Celestial authorities. Perhaps some compensation for this necessary expenditure of French blood and treasure may be found in the restraints which a concert of action with France in the East must impose upon the conduct of England in Europe. It will not be easy for any British Government to throw difficulties in the way of the Napoleonic policy in Italy or Turkey while the armies of VICTORIA are contending side by side with the armies of NAPOLEON in China.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/22/archives/the-anglofrench-alliance-in-the-east.html,,"We are at last definitely assured, by official authority, that the Emperor of China has declined to comply with the demands of the French and English Governments; and that the long-expected collision of those Powers with the Central Flowery Kingdom has become inevitable.

About the middle of April the allied land forces in China, in number more than twenty thousand men, were on their way towards the scene of operations in the north, and the French had established themselves in the important post of Chusan, which they were fortifying as a part of their base of operations. It will be noted as a curious feature of the Chinese official reply to the ultimatum of the Allied Governments, that the Peking Cabinet seek to distinguish between the part played by the English and that sustained by the French, in the negotiations which were brought so rudely to a close at the mouth of the Pei-ho. It is evident that the Mandarin Court is kept much more clearly informed of the political and diplomatic movements of Europe than might be expected of so dignified and self-centred a body. The ""great Emperor, always full of compassion for strangers,"" would gladly see France imitate towards her ally in the East the course pursued towards herself by England in the affairs of Italy and of Europe. But any hopes of such a result, if any were ever seriously cherished even at Peking, were simply puerile. The action of Baron GROS, and the conduct of the French force, which, although comparately insignificant in numbers, yet led in the attack on the forts of the Pei-ho, bound France to the quarrel of England in China. However ill-advised the diplomacy of Mr. BRUCE may have been judged by the Cabinet of the Tuileries to have been, NAPOLEON could not in honor, nor perhaps in policy, decline to accept its consequences. France must join England in forcing compliance with the treaties of Tien-tsin, as England understands them, from the Celestial authorities. Perhaps some compensation for this necessary expenditure of French blood and treasure may be found in the restraints which a concert of action with France in the East must impose upon the conduct of England in Europe. It will not be easy for any British Government to throw difficulties in the way of the Napoleonic policy in Italy or Turkey while the armies of VICTORIA are contending side by side with the armies of NAPOLEON in China.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-French Alliance in the East.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-French Alliance in the East.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-06-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/febdac6c-8670-586b-a412-7d11ca8b3cde,1362,nyt://article/febdac6c-8670-586b-a412-7d11ca8b3cde

"The younger BULWER -- for he is the author who is generally understood to have adopted the pseudonym of ""Owen Meredith"" -- has essayed, in this volume, the difficult task of producing a novel in rhyme. Lucile is a new book, reissued in ""blue and gold,"" like TENNYSON's, LONGFELLOW's and LOWELL's poems, and must occupy the same shelf with these latter, whenever it shall find its way to a library; but its coat is better than its body.

A confession like this, indicating the dubiety of an author, almost disarms criticism; yet it behoves us to say that the book contains a great deal that is bad, much that is passable, and a little that is good. It is bad in one respect, at the outset. The straining after jingling rhymes is so repulsive in the first twenty pages that one is tempted to throw the book away. Blank verse would have been better than a set of forced rhymes that have no rhythm, and serious prose would be better than either. The story is one of disappointed love, jealousy, intrigue, war, self-sacrifice, passion and remorse. Lucile, discarded by a fickle lover, bids us farewell, after a series of sharp personal experiences in the character of a FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE, whose office it is ""through suffering to soothe and through sickness to nurse.""

"In the House of Commons on the 8th inst., Mr. CAVE rose to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether his attention had been directed to the Message of the President of the United States to Congress, on the 19th day of May, respecting the slave trade, and whether her Majesty's government had received any recent communications from the government of the United States, or intended making any fresh proposals to that government on this subject? The honorable gentleman had no doubt at all that the government of the United States was sincerely desirous to assist us in the suppression of the slave trade, but unfortunately there was a large portion of American capital invested in that trade, although the citizens of the United States generally were opposed to it. The employment of steam gunboats on the coast of Cuba had fallen like a thunderbolt upon the people engaged in the slave traffic, and they therefore determined to procure the recall of those gunboats if possible. The American people became excited on the subject of the right of search, and the American government became uneasy, and at length the service was so arduous to the officers employed in consquence of the difficulties thrown in their way, that we were compelled to do one of two things either to recall the vessels or to prevent their interfering at all with any ship hoisting the American flag. He thought from a passage in the President's message to Congress, that there were signs of an intention on the part of the American government to act more cordially with her Majesty's government in suppressing the slave trade on the coast of Cuba. It seemed monstrous that, year after year, in defiance of the most solemn treaty obligations and directly in the teeth of America and England, that Spain should persist in carrying on this iniquitous traffic. There were at present in Cuba 400,000 slaves, who died at the rate of ten per cent annually. Forty thousand were annually imported, and it there was any further deficiency it was supplied by introductions from China and Yucatan. The Americans were bound by the Ashburton treaty to employ eighty guns in the suppression of the Cuban slave trade, but he thought their efforts would be much more efficacious if they employed a smaller and lighter class of vessels. If America would fairly unite with her Majesty's government in suppressing the trade, the squadrons of the two countries might cruise together, and what a slaver attempted to escape by hoisting the American colors, an American vessel could be immediately signalled to overhaul her.

Their baggage already increases to such huge proportions that even the capacious Niagara bids fair to be well filled, and still they shop -- not to the credit of our Aldermen and Councilmen be it said, in the shops of friends of the Committee who have them in charge, but at their own volition, in Broadway or Bowery, as pleases them best, despite the experiences of our variable climate that they have been called upon to endure.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/23/archives/religious-notice-of-religious-movements.html,,"The contest between the Independent and Evangelist, the organs of the Congregationalists and New School Presbyterians respectively, relative to the Home Missionary Society, loses none of its vigor. The Evangelist surrenders nearly the whole of its editorial space to this topic. First, it grapples with the Congregationalist of Boston and the Congregational Journal of Concord, N.H. It does not wonder that the proposition for a conference should meet with dislike on the part of these journals, for ""it might chance that some judicious and fair-minded friends of peace would get upon the Committee. The idea that the Association would not appoint representatives as thoroughly acquainted with the subject matter of the issues involved, as is the Committee which would act for the Assembly, is ridiculed. Neither is the objection that the New-York Associations are not invited to the Conference of any weight, for it is not designed that its results shall be authoritative upon the denominations as such, or upon the Home Missionary Society. The only end proposed is mutual counsel. The Evangelist abjures the idea that it is solicitous for the Conference. The acceptance or rejection of the proposition rests with those to whom it has been made. The Assembly surrenders none of its rights by making it, and shall be estopped from no ulterior measure which, in such a juncture, duty may seem to require. A strong point is made of the action recently taken by the State Association of Illinois, which indorses the course taken by the Home Missionary Society heretofore, and yet, at the same time, through its Missionary Association, keeps in commission in the Stare nineteen missionaries, besides its general missionary. Why, it is asked, does not the Home Missionary Society pursue the same course toward this Association which it does toward the other Presbytery, in refusing to extend it, and because it supports missionaries of its own? In another place the Evangelist, looking forward to a cessation of cooperation between these two denominations, so far as this Society is concerned, discusses the disposition which shall be made of the funds. It calls attention to the fact that large legacies have been left to the Society by Presbyterians. The late ANSON G. PHELPS bequeathed it $100,000. For Congregationalists to claim these legacies the Evangelist thinks would look like stealing from dead men's graves, and it is authorized to say that the Executive Committee of the Society recognizes ""the obvious rule of equity in the case, that what came from Presbyterians should go to Presbyterians.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RELIGIOUS.; Notice of Religious Movements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RELIGIOUS.; Notice of Religious Movements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d550db52-d4ef-56b6-9325-869678f346b3,1990,nyt://article/d550db52-d4ef-56b6-9325-869678f346b3
"In the Senate, yesterday, a supplementary resolution, providing that the Secretary of the Interior shall contract for the erection or purchase of a Government Printing Bureau, was reported, and caused some debate. The bill authorizing a loan of $20,000,000 was received from the House and passed. The Legislative Appropriation bill was also passed. The Post Route bill was then taken up, and an amendment offered, allowing the Postmaster-General to provide for the overland transportation of the Californian mails. This gave rise to considerable debate, the majority of the speakers, however, still favoring the amendment, although the opposition in favor of the steamship lines was very strong. The bill provides for three overland routes; a Northern weekly route, at a cost of $200,000; a tri-weekly middle route, via Salt Lake, at a cost of $600,000, or daily at $800,000; and a tri-weekly from New-Orleans, via San Antonio, to connect with the Butterfield route at El Paso, for $200,000.

The bill authorizing a loan of $20,000,000 was received from the House and passed. The Legislative Appropriation bill was also passed. The Post Route bill was then taken up, and an amendment offered, allowing the Postmaster-General to provide for the overland transportation of the Californian mails. This gave rise to considerable debate, the majority of the speakers, however, still favoring the amendment, although the opposition in favor of the steamship lines was very strong. The bill provides for three overland routes; a Northern weekly route, at a cost of $200,000; a tri-weekly middle route, via Salt Lake, at a cost of $600,000, or daily at $800,000; and a tri-weekly from New-Orleans, via San Antonio, to connect with the Butterfield route at El Paso, for $200,000.

"A telegraphic dispatch, received late on Thursday, from Cape Island, New Jersey, announced the loss of the United States Coast Survey Steamer Walker by collision with an unknown schooner off Absecom, early on Monday morning of that day, and stated that twenty of her crew were supposed to be lost, while the survivors, some forty in number, had been saved in the boats. By the arrival, yesterday, of the steamer Kennebec, Capt. JOHNSON, from Cape May, with forty of the crew of the unfortunate steamer, we have been enabled to gather full particulars of the disaster, and a complete list of the saved and lost. The Walker, Lieut. J.J. GUTHRIE commanding, which has been absent for several months, engaged in the work of the coast survey, at the South, was returning to New-York for repairs. She left Norfolk on Tuesday, the 19th inst., and, at the time of the collision, had passed Cape May, and was within about ten hours sail of New-York. The wind had been blowing fresh from Northeast, and there was a heavy head-sea, which considerably retarded the progress of the steamer. She was, however, making about seven knots an hour under steam. At about 2 1/4 o'clock A.M., the man on the look-out saw a schooner approaching under full sail, and steering head on. He notified the man at the wheel, and gave the usual order to port the helm. The order was obeyed, the helm being put hard a-port; but at the same time the schooner was observed to put her helm a-starboard thus rendering a collision inevitable. As both vessels were under full headway, there was no time for either to alter his course, and the shock was instantaneous and terrible. The schooner struck the steamer on the port-bow, near the forward chains, her head-rail taking under the steamer's plankshear, staving in the iron plates, and opening her down to the water-line. The vessels then swung clear of each other, and the schooner was obsdrved to round to and remain with her sails shaking for four or five minutes. She then filled away and kept on her course. An effort was made to hail her from the steamer, but it failed. The shock of the collision immediately brought all that were below on deck and word was passed that the steamer was sinking. Captain GUTHRIE ordered the vessel headed in shore, and sent men below to stop the leak if possible. Hammocks and mattresses were stuffed into the opening, but the hole was so large and the force of the water so great that it was found impossible to stop it. In fifteen minutes the water had risen to the furnaces and extinguished the fires, causing the engines to stop. Orders were now given to clear away the two boats, (one having been destroyed by the collision,) and to drop them astern, that they might be ready for use. There was no time to be lost, however, as she was fast sinking. The mainmast was ordered to be cut away, and the booms and spare spars cut loose to afford the crew the means of sustaining themselves in the water. The boats were now hauled up, and one of the crew who was sick, and the only lady passenger on board, first put into one of them. Implicitly obeying the commands of Capt. GUTHRIE and his officers the boats were then filled with as many as they could safely sustain, and, at the word of command, pulled away from the sinking ship. The next moment she went down, carrying with her all who were on her decks. The crew were now seen clutching at the floating spars and loose materials of the wreck, or clambering up the rigging to save themselves by clinging to the topmost head. The boats were very deeply loaded, there was a heavy sea running, and their crowded condition left little or no room to pull at the oars. They were some ten miles from the land, and, even if they were able to reach it, the heavy surf which broke upon the beach would render it impossible to land without swamping the boats, and probably losing many lives. In this extremity a vessel was seen bearing down for them. She was hailed, and immediately answered by rounding to and giving them a line. All the crew were put on board, excepting men enough to man each boat, both of which then returned to search for those who were still clinging to the wreck or floating spars. All who could be found were picked up. At this time another schooner was seen, apparently engaged in the same work, but she soon kept away, and how many she may have picked up, if any at all, is not known. It is hoped that, of the twenty persons missing, some at least are on board of this unknown vessel, which has probably carried them to some Southern port.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/23/archives/loss-of-the-us-steamer-walker-twenty-persons-missing-particulars-of.html,,"A telegraphic dispatch, received late on Thursday, from Cape Island, New Jersey, announced the loss of the United States Coast Survey Steamer Walker by collision with an unknown schooner off Absecom, early on Monday morning of that day, and stated that twenty of her crew were supposed to be lost, while the survivors, some forty in number, had been saved in the boats.

"The Legislative Committee of Investigation into the management of the Central Park, met at the Astor House yesterday morning Mr. J. MCLEOD MURPHY in the Chair, and entered upon the investigation of the charges of Mr. JAMES HOGG, formerly one of the Central Park Commissioners. ROBERTS, WARBURTON and BLUNDELL were sworn as official reporters of the Committee. Mr. HOGG was called to the stand, and interrogated at length upon the written charges made by him against the Park Commissioners, each of which, with the specifications attached, was read over to him, and he was called upon to substantiate them. This, for the most part, he was unable to do of his own personal knowledge, but he reiterated the truth of each charge, and avowed his ability to substantiate them all at the proper time. He was not aware that he was to be called to the stand yesterday or he would have had his witnesses with him. The charges relate principally to the manner in which the work on the Park has been done, to the competency of the Commissioners and of the men in their employ, including the Chief Engineer and his subordinates, to the departure from the original plan adopted by the Commissioners, and the increased and unnecessary cost entailed thereby, and finally to the whole management of the Park under its present administration. Some of the specifications are extremely frivolous, as for instance he mentions that at a certain place in the Park is a pile of flag-stones which cost a great deal of money, and were originally intended for Summer-houses, but which are now ""lying entirely useless"" -- a charge which was readily disposed of by Mr. GREEN, one of the Commissioners, who said that the stones were not only ""originally"" intended for Summer-houses, but were still so intended, and in due time would be used for that purpose. Mr. HOGG complained that the Commissioners had already expended a million and a quarter of dollars, and that the Park was not yet one quarter finished; that by departing from the original plan they had deceived the public as well as those who were invited to compete for plans, and who were required to confine their plans within certain cost limits; that certain employes of the Commissioners had been allowed to occupy themselves in other employments while drawing pay from the Park Fund; that the book-keeper of the Commissioners kept a porter-house at the corner of Seventy-eighth-street and Third-avenue, which was the resort of bad characters; that the accounts of the Engineers were not kept so as to enable them to tell the cost of any particular work; and, finally, that the Park would ultimately cost four times the amount originally contemplated. In addition to these general charges, Mr. HOGG accused some Commissioners of collusion between themselves, as against others of their colleagues, by which great injustice was done, but declined giving any names, or bringing forward any proof until the next session, when he said he would have the documents with him to substantiate the charge. He also stated in the course of his examination, that Mr. BLATCHFORD, the President of the Central Park Commissioners, attempted to bribe him not to go to Albany last Winter to oppose the Central Park bill before the Legislature, offering him $500 in money, and promising to discount his note ""for any reasonable amount."" In answer to a question as to what reply he made to this offer, he said he told Mr. BLATCHFORD that ""he couldn't be bought for any such price.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/23/archives/city-intelligence-central-park-investigation-mr-hogg-and-mr.html,,"The Legislative Committee of Investigation into the management of the Central Park, met at the Astor House yesterday morning Mr. J.

"The steamer Melita, from Liverpool 14th inst., or Quebec, which passed Father Point yesterday, brings us four days later news from Europe.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/25/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The steamer Melita, from Liverpool 14th inst., or Quebec, which passed Father Point yesterday, brings us four days later news from Europe. The Sicilian Revolution was steadily making progress. The capitulation of the Neapolitans at Palermo took place on the 6th. The royal troops retiring with the honors of war from the city committed the most disgraceful and characteristic excesses on their retreat. Great efforts were making by the Neapolitan Government to secure Naples from the contagion of revolt by promises of a liberal Constitution; and it was rumored that the Emperor NAPOLEON had accepted a mediation on the basis of Neapolitan reforms and of a separate Government for Sicily under a Bourbon Prince; the latter clause ""subject to the will of the Sicilian people."" The experience of Central Italy after Villafranca would seem to make this clause, with the condition annexed, rather a mockery of the ""Bourbon prince"" aforesaid, and his royal family MAZZINI had sailed, it was said, for Sicily; and GARIBALDI, after establishing a Provisional Government, had ordered a levy en masse of the people, and was negotiating loans. The King's army had been concentrated in the two points of Messina and Syracuse. In the British Parliament Lord JOHN RUSSELL's Reform bill had died of inanition. His lordship had announced that the Government would postpone the measure till the next session, and the announcement had been received with general apparent gratification. Moderate and unpretending as the proposed bill undoubtedly was, the recent agitation of the whole ground, and working of representative institutions in England, has seriously weakened the faith of most intelligent Englishmen in the existence of any necessity for further progress in the extension of the suffrage at this time; and there can be little doubt that all parties were delighted to be rid of the question. Even Mr. BRIGHT acquiesced in the action of the Ministry on this subject, and took occasion in doing so to say a strong word in behalf of the Commercial Treaty with France. A remarkable speech was delivered on the 12th in the House of Commons by Lord PALMERSTON in which he openly denounced the conduct of the Neapolitan Government in Sicily, and declared that Governments like those of ""Rome and Naples were themselves the authors and instigators of revolution."" He also announced that Austria had peremptorily refused to interfere between Naples and Sicily. The Great Eastern had returned from a trial trip, in which she seems to have excited the admiration of her New-York pilot, although she did not succeed in equaling her own speed of last year. She was finally advertised to leave Southampton for New-York on the 16th, and to make the passage in about ten days. In this case we may expect to see the monster in our harbor in the course of the next forty-eight hours. A meeting was to take place at Baden on the 15th, between the Emperor NAPOLEON and the Prince-Regent of Prussia, from which grave political results were to be expected. It is to be hoped that the interview may have the good effect of calming the excited German mind, and banishing for the present the fear that France is upon the point of devouring her Teutonic neighbors along the Rhine. The commercial news by this arrival is not of special importance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-06-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6d3b17d5-d1d7-53f6-9b5b-4557e4d93f9b,1641,nyt://article/6d3b17d5-d1d7-53f6-9b5b-4557e4d93f9b

"The Boston Traveller, of the 20th June, gives full particulars of the murder perpetrated in Lowell, on the 19th, by BRYANT MOORE, a shoemaker. About a year ago MOORE married Mrs. SISSON, widow of a well-known druggist in Lowell, and a lady highly respected in the community. Soon his jealous disposition began to manifest itself by unfounded suspicions of one or two of the boarders, who had rooms in the house, and more particularly of a milkman who supplied the family with milk. This jealousy went so far that in the early part of last May, MOORE, as is supposed, wounded himself with a knife, and then entered a complaint against one PERLEY E. WATSON for stabbing him. This matter was adjusted between the parties without its coming to trial. Mrs. Moore determined to endure these annoyances no longer, and a separation occurred. A fortnight since her husband came to her, begged her forgiveness, and entreated a reconciliation. She finally consented, and he returned to live with her. Soon his jealous conduct was renewed. One night Mrs. MOORE was awakened by her husband's choking her. When he found that she was awake, he remarked that her sleep was broken more easily than he thought it would be. Another time Mrs. MOORE found a dull hatchet behind her husband's trunk. She asked him whether he intended to kill her and her daughter with it. He replied No, that he would use something sharper than that. This conduct determined Mrs. MOORE to again leave her husband. On Tuesday, after dinner, when there was no one in the house but himself and wife, with her little granddaughter and his idiot son, a young man 20 years of age, he came down from the attic to the kitchen, where his wife was busy at work, and asked her to go up stairs and help him pack his things, preparatory to going to Somerville. She complied, and went up with him. After they had been gone some minutes, the little girl heard two sharp reports of a pistol, and in a few moments Mr. MOORE came rushing down, with his head covered with blood, crying that he was murdered.

About a year ago MOORE married Mrs. SISSON, widow of a well-known druggist in Lowell, and a lady highly respected in the community. Soon his jealous disposition began to manifest itself by unfounded suspicions of one or two of the boarders, who had rooms in the house, and more particularly of a milkman who supplied the family with milk. This jealousy went so far that in the early part of last May, MOORE, as is supposed, wounded himself with a knife, and then entered a complaint against one PERLEY E. WATSON for stabbing him. This matter was adjusted between the parties without its coming to trial. Mrs. Moore determined to endure these annoyances no longer, and a separation occurred. A fortnight since her husband came to her, begged her forgiveness, and entreated a reconciliation. She finally consented, and he returned to live with her. Soon his jealous conduct was renewed. One night Mrs. MOORE was awakened by her husband's choking her. When he found that she was awake, he remarked that her sleep was broken more easily than he thought it would be. Another time Mrs. MOORE found a dull hatchet behind her husband's trunk. She asked him whether he intended to kill her and her daughter with it. He replied No, that he would use something sharper than that. This conduct determined Mrs. MOORE to again leave her husband.

When completed and furnished it will cost about $22,000 $12,000 of which sum has been proviced for. The interior is divided two rooms. The basement, which is 13 feet in the clear and on a level with the street, is for Sabbath School purposes, and will accommodate about 700 children. The main auditorium is on the floor above. It is 36 feet in the clear, and will have sittings for about 1,200 persons. This portion of the building is not yet ready for use. This Society was organized eight years ago as a Hedding Mission and was located in Butler-street. Subsequently the Society hired the old church, corner of Court and Butler streets, where it remained for some time, until the building was sold, when a hall at the corner of Court and Sackett streets was secured. Here the Society remained, under the immediate care of the Ladies' Missionary Society, until four years ago, when the ladies abandoned it, and the managers secured a private room on Warren, near Hoyt-street. Through the agency of several active members a sufficient subscription was obtained to warrant the commencement of the present edifice last Spring. At that time the Society had only 20 members and about 25 Sabbath school scholars. There are now 75 members of the Church, and a congregation of about 400 persons; and there are 175 children in the Sabbath school, under the charge of Mr. HUNT, as Superintendent. The Church is in a locality where a Protestant society is much needed, and in a position to do much good. Yesterday, Rev. JOSEPH LAW, pastor, Rev. Mr. Foss, of the Fleet-street Church, and Rev. Dr. DUNBAR took part in the dedication services..... The Washington-avenue Baptist Church, located at the corner of Greene and Washington avenues, was dedicated yesterday, Rev. C.W. ANABLE, pastor, Rev. JAMES L. HODGE, and Rev. Dr. LATHROP taking part in the exercises. The Church is a neat Gothic building, constructed of brick, at a cost of about $30,000, about two-thirds of which has been provided for. The interior is neatly arranged, and has about 1,200 sittings.

A few hundreds may be accounted for as having been distributed to members of the City Government; but, at the rate of distribution generally admitted, it is difficult to account for a tithe of the whole number known to be printed -- and yet they are publicly advertised for sale in one of the daily papers, and command prices varying from $25 down. Only fifty tickets were given to the Naval Committee in charge of the Embassy, and these with the request that Capt. DUPONT would ""Supply the Naval officers on the Station."" All the Naval officers who apply to the Committee are referred to Capt. DUPONT, and the result is, the Captain is considerably perplexed. He is now engaged in solving the mathematical problem of how to supply one hundred applicants with half that number of tickets. The Common Council Committee is in the same fix, or pretends to be, so that since six hundred thousand are anxious to go, and only six thousand cards are issued, five hundred and ninety-four thousand must be disappointed. Meanwhile the question, ""Who sells the tickets?"" remains to be answered by the members of the Common Council who had the control of them, and through whom alone they must have been procured. The idea of supplying the heaviest tax-payers, who really have to ""pay the piper,"" seems never to have suggested itself to the City Solons, and some of the largest property-owners have in vain endeavored to procure admissions.

The fate to which these people are consigned by being sent back to their native shores is only one degree better than that from which we rescued them in the first instance. We know that the population along the African Coast, for some, hundreds of miles into the interior, have been so demoralized by the Slave-trade, that the native chiefs look on their subjects simply as so many head of cattle, and are always ready to supply as many as can be caught to the first trader that comes in the way. We know, consequently, that to send a cargo of slaves back to the place from whence they came, even if we could restore each one of them to his home, would be simply to expose them to a repetition of the horrors from which they have once been rescued. But, with the best intentions in the world, their return to their former places of abode, and to their families, is impossible. They are collected from various places, at various distances from the coast, and the same raid which consignes them to the slaver, in many instances consigns their villages to destructions.

The principal portion of the session was occupied in the consideration of subjects possessing no general interest. Alderman MANGER, of the Fifteenth Ward, offered a resolution appointing a special Committee of five to as�certain whether the late city of Williamsburgh and the town of Bushwick did not get cheated under the consolidation act by the valuation placed upon Washington Park and City Hall Park. The former, he said, was valued at $300,000 and the latter at $120,000 -- a sum much larger, he contended, than the property would bring to-day if placed in the market, Aldermen DAYTON and JENKINS exposed the fallacy of this statement, and, after an amendment offered by Mr, DAYTON to direct the Committee to inquire also whether the Eleventh Ward had not been taxed too much for the Washington Park, had been incorpo�rated into the resolution, the whole subject was laid on the table. The Farmers' and Citizens' Bank, by resolution, was made a bank of deposit for the city funds, and after the transaction of some routine busi�ness, the Board adjourned for one week.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bd03d807-c24e-5638-bdcf-65394f4485c3,635,nyt://article/bd03d807-c24e-5638-bdcf-65394f4485c3

On the assembling of the Senate, Mr. SUMNER presented a petition of citizens of Massachusetts, praying for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law, the a[???]olition of Slavery in the District of Columbia, and the prohibition of the inter-State Slave-trade. At his request it was laid on the table. The p[???]route bill was then taken up, and after considerable debate and the adoption of various ame[???]nts, it was passed and sent to the House. The House bill to amend the Consular act was reported from the Committee on Commerce, but laid over. Various other measures were proposed, but they were laid over. A message was received from the House notifying the Senate that they receded from their amendments to the Post-office Deficiency bill -- therefore it stands passed. The customary Committee was appointed to act in conjunction with one from the House, to notify the President that Congress was ready to adjourn, and after a vote of thanks to the presiding officer, and a short Executive session, the Senate was declared adjourned. In the House, another protest was received from the President against the proceedings of the Covode Investigating Committee, in which he characterized the action of the House as violative of the lights of a coordinate branch of the Government, and asserts that, should the proceedings of the Committee be sanctioned, the Constitution will have been violated. The message was referred, to a select Committee, and its consideration was postponed until the next session. The House refused to agree to the Senate's amendments to the Post Route bill, and it was consequently lost.

The next morning a paragraph appeared in the Republican denouncing C.W. BUTTON, proprietor of the Virgiman, as a coward,&c.

The following morning, another card appeared in the Virginian in witch JOSEPH BUTTON expressed regret for having invaded the sanctuary of the dead, but affirmed that he had no retraction to make in relation to what he had said about G.w. HARDWICKE. The parties met on the afternoon of the same day in the streets of Lynchburgh, when they at once drew their revolvers and began firing at each other.

HARD. WICKE. of the Republican, and C.W, JOSEPH, ROBERT and GEORGE BUTTON, of the Virginian. The difficulty grew out of an article which appeared in the editorial columns of the Virginian,charging Mr. GLASS, political Editor of the Republican, and postmaster of Lynchburg, with dereliction of duty in attending the Democratic Convention. The next morning a paragraph appeared in the Republican denouncing C.W. BUTTON, proprietor of the Virgiman, as a coward,&c. This Brought out a card from JOSEPH BUTTON, local Editor of the Virginan, charging G.W.HARDWICKE with cowardice, reflecting on him as being the son of a vagrant, whose father, now dead, was sold in the streets of Lynchburgh for fifty cents. The following morning, another card appeared in the Virginian in witch JOSEPH BUTTON expressed regret for having invaded the sanctuary of the dead, but affirmed that he had no retraction to make in relation to what he had said about G.w. HARDWICKE. The parties met on the afternoon of the same day in the streets of Lynchburgh, when they at once drew their revolvers and began firing at each other. Fifteen or twenty shots were exchanged. The HARDWICKES escaped uninjured. JOSEPH BUTTON was shot in the abdomen -- the ball passing entirely through his body. He died soon after. ROBERT BUTTON was shot in the side -- the ball lodging in the spin alregion.

TOLLES, Esq., of Newark. His subject was Orthodoxy. The theological tenets usually termed "" orthodox "" he claimed, had no obligatory force upon men, ner could they command their consciences and judgments to recognize the bible as the only source of religious truth. Man had bestowed upon him the power and ability to investigate and arrive at religious truth in the same manner as at scientific or other truth. The original intuitions of men were the primary revelations implanted by God, and were tie true criterion for determining the nature and value of all other revelations. Hence it was argued that the system of religious truth was not completed by the instructions of Christ and his Apostles but is always progressively developing, and is capable of being rendered more perfect in this age, than ever before. The arbitrary adoption of creeds of abstract dogmas, and the imposition of them on men as tests of religious or moral rectitude, were reprobated, and declared to be inconsonant with the will of God, with the freedom of man, and with the progress of truth. Entire independence of thought should be allowed every man, since God regarded action, and not opinion, and had placed in the heart of man laws for determining what is right and wrong.

The facts of the case, as stated by the Assistant District Attorney, Mr. Sedgwick, in his opening address to the jury, are these: The defendant kept a lager bier saloon at the corner of Centre-street and Park: and had girls boarding in the establishment. These stairs were narrow and circuitous, and did not permit a person to go up and down quickly. At the time of the fire there was only one person in the house besides the prisoner, and that was a female named Jane Ennis. Shortly before the fire occurred, two other girls bad been sent away by the prisoner, who said he was going to give up business and go to California. He was insured for $800 in an Insurance Company, and it was claimed that there was but a few dollars in value in the house at the time of the fire. The day before the fire, Jane Eanis was told to sleep up stairs, as the defendant wanted to do some carpente[???]ing. About 1 A. M., Jane Ennis was told to go to bed, and a little while after she heard the prisoner going up and down stairs. About mat time there was a smell of campbene in the room, which became so strong that she hid her bead under the bed clothes. About 5 A. M. she was woke up by the prisoner, who was fully dressed, and who told her to get up, there was fire. He then made his escape by preparations already mane, and went [???]hrough the scuttle on to the roof of another house. When the police broke in, they found the traces of camphene all over the house. There was nothing in the house at all except the girl's clothes. Testimony on the part of the people in support of these facts was commenced.

The question of cost is entirely a relative one. Such a park as the Central Park promises to be is certainly not dear at the price it will cost. The money is acknowledged to have been judiciously expended, and what still remains, in doubt, is, whether New-York can afford to acquire such a luxury, and enjoy it. To discuss this question fairly, it must be remembered that the New-York for which the Park is being made is not alone the New-York either of 1857 or of 1860, but the New-York of the next hundred or two hundred years; and this is just the thing which the enemies of the work obstinately shut their eyes upon.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Completion of the Central Park The Future of New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Completion of the Central Park The Future of New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/69b4e311-2b90-5354-94d1-ab04be96f7d5,1403,nyt://article/69b4e311-2b90-5354-94d1-ab04be96f7d5

He was tried and convicted in the Court of Sessions; he appealed to the Supreme Court for a new trial, -- and when that was refused he was duly sentenced to confinement in the State Prison. His application for a new trial is to be carried to the Court of Appeals, by way of appeal from the Supreme Court: and until this is decided we presume the execution of the sentence will be suspended.

The charge is, that he required deposits of money from persons whom he promised to employ as agents,-- and that he afterwards refused to employ them, or to refund the money they had deposited as security, -- the inference being that the promise of employment was merely a pretext in order to obtain their money. If the offence was clearly proved it deserved severe punishment. If there was any doubt about the fact, Mr. RANNEY is entitled to the benefit of it.

The action recently taken by the French Government on the subject of the French codfisheries significantly illustrates the determination with which NAPOLEON III. is following up his purpose of raising the French navy to the highest possible point of efficiency.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/28/archives/france-and-her-seamen.html,,"The action recently taken by the French Government on the subject of the French codfisheries significantly illustrates the determination with which NAPOLEON III. is following up his purpose of raising the French navy to the highest possible point of efficiency. Ten years ago, July 22, 1851, a law was passed offering certain premiums for the equipment of fishing vessels in the northern seas of Europe and America. This law was to be in force for ten years, and the Corps Legislatif is now invited to extend the term indefinitely. Its provisions offer various premiums ranging from 15 to 50 francs per seaman, for the employment of sailors in fishing vessels on the Dogger-Bank, the seas of Iceland, the Grand Banks, and the Coasts of St. Pierre, Miquclon, and Newfoundland in America. The peculiarity of these premiums is that they are applied to the numbers of the crews engaged, and are, therefore, plainly intended to encourage the increase of sailors for the service of the navy rather than to foster the fishing-trade itself. The commercial problem of this trade is, of course, to secure the greatest results with the smallest crews. But France needs sailors for the State as well as codfish for the people, and the Government accordingly makes it an object to every fishing-captain to take as many men with him as possible, all of these men being immediately put on the books of that formidable Inscription Maritime, by means of which France already keeps well in hand a larger body of trained seamen ready to man her national vessels than any other Power can assemble at short notice.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and her Seamen.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and her Seamen.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ac5b026d-0fc6-5be6-b6b7-6e9b67b1d259,342,nyt://article/ac5b026d-0fc6-5be6-b6b7-6e9b67b1d259

Pushee, of Massachusetts, came to this City on the 19th inst., for the purpose of procuring second-class cabin passages by the California steamer for his sister, Mrs. Elmira F. Choate, and her little boy. He did not take proper measures to inform, himself as to the locality of the genuine ticket-office, and having met James Enright, (the notorious brother of the more notorious Deputy Health Warden John Enright,) was beguiled by that individual into the swindling-office No. 109 West-street. There he was introduced to Stephen Gordon, whose name is quite familiar to the readers of the police reports, to whom he paid, after his apprehensions with regard to the fairness of the transaction had been set at rest, the sum of $208 for what he was told were two second cabin tickets, but which he subsequently learned only entitled his relatives to the privileges of the steerage, and the regular price of which was $45 50 less than the amount which had been given. Yesterday he lodged complaints against both Gordon and Enright for false pretences and violation of the law relating to the sale of passenger tickets. The accused having bean arrested by Capt. Hartt, of the 26th precinct, were taken before Justice WELSH, who held them to answer -- fixing their bail at $1,000 each. Enright furnished his bail, but Gordon could not obtain a surety and consequently was sent to prison. In view of the fact that these parties have invariably been bought off by the defendants when they found the case proven against them, it has been deemed advisable to commit the complainants to the House of Detention. It is a hard case, but is the only sure way to reach these rascals. Capt. Hartt and Mr. Dickinson have been unremitting in their endeavors to bring them to punishment. The papers will go before the Grand Jury to-morrow morning and under the new law these ticket cases take the precedence over all others. Mr. Dickinson, the Calfornia Commissioner for the protection of emigrants, will exert himself to assist the prosecution.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; ANOTHER VICTIM SWINDLED BY ENRIGHT AND GORDON.

The grove, which is well fited for such occasions, was divided into play-grounds, strolling places, places for the tents, in which were the refreshments, and for the performances of the children. The platform was plentifully decorated with flags and wreaths of flowers, and in front of it seats were placed for 2,000 persons. The ceremony of crowning the queen took place at midday, and was very prettily done. The performance of a piece called ""Our Benevolent Society"" was also a very interesting feature of the occasion. With the exception of the time when the performances were going on on the platform, the strawberry ladies, the ice-cream men and the soda water pop, lemonade, sandwich and pickled-oyster men were exercised without the slightest consideration of the heat of the day, and everybody seemed to enjoy everything provided for them.

"The steamer Great Eastern arrived in the Lower Bay yesterday morning at about 7 o'clock, and came up to the City as soon as the tide would permit her crossing the bar, at a little after 2, and reached her dock, at the foot of Hammond-street, at about 6 in the evening. We surrender a large part of our space this morning to a very full account of her voyage, which will long be memorable in the history of steam navigation. So many novelties are involved in her structure and mode of working, that the most ample professional details will be found valuable to those who desire to form a reliable judgment as to her capabilites. The letter of our Correspondent, we are confident, will leave nothing to be desired on this score. We are compelled from lack of space to omit much matter of interest connected with the great ship; but we shall publish this in the TIMES of to-morrow morning, together with a very full description of the vessel, illustrated by diagrams and engravings. The voyage of the Great Eastern, as will be seen by our report, has been a substantial success. The theory of her size is simply this: she can carry twice as much cargo as the Adriatic or the Persia, with the same horse-power and cost, simply on account of her size, the engines being the same. Her first trip has demonstrated the mechanical correctness of this theory, by proving that the ship not only equals, but exceeds smaller vessels in seaworthiness and manageability. More than this -- it demonstrates the equally important fact that the comfort and safety of passengers are increased in proportion to the size of the vessel. The moderate speed attained by the Great Eastern on this trip is fully accounted for by her purposely but not necessarily low steam pressure, by a considerable deviation from the shortest course to avoid ice, by a foul bottom, and by other abnormal circumstances. The positive facts developed are the perfection of the hull and the excellence and reliability of the machinery. The engines were not stopped for adjustment during the entire passage, Mr. SCOTT RUSSELL's wave-line, more beautifully developed on this vessel than ever before, is such that, at her highest speed, the vessel does not raise a perceptible wave, except by the action of her propellers. The commercial question -- Can large ships be filled? -- has not yet been reached. The interval between the announcement of the Great Eastern's arrival off the Hook, and her passage of the Bar was long enough to rouse all our sea-going, yachting and pleasure-loving population to give a welcome to the monster. Tugs of all sorts and sizes, steamers and sail-boats, crowded down the Bay towards 3 o'clock, and rarely has so animated a scene been presented as unrolled itself before the eyes of the passengers on board the great ship, when she fairly opened the harbor of New-York from the Narrows. The skill with which her New-York pilot, Mr. MURPHY, carried her over the bar, navigated her through the crowded bay, and brought her to her moorings at the foot of Hammond-street, was the theme of general comment and admiration. Salutes, public and private, attended her approach -- the Harriet Lane and the Cunard steamers at Jersey City particularly distinguishing themselves in this contest of politeness. The yacht squadron was handsomely represented, and nothing could have been more cordial and festive than the reception which was extended on all sides to the one long-looked for visitor. The wharves of the North River from the Battery to Canal-street, were packed closely with an eager and enthusiastic crowd, which cheered the ship heartily as she slowly and majestically moved along. No accident occurred to mar the satisfactions of the day, although the great ship, on running alongside the dock carried away some ten feet of planking at her first touch of the wharf.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/29/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The steamer Great Eastern arrived in the Lower Bay yesterday morning at about 7 o'clock, and came up to the City as soon as the tide would permit her crossing the bar, at a little after 2, and reached her dock, at the foot of Hammond-street, at about 6 in the evening.

The Metropolitan Record for the present week discusses at much length the merits of the controversy between Archbishop HUGHES and City Inspector DELAVAN regarding the registry of marriages.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/30/archives/religious-notices-of-religious-movements.html,,"The Metropolitan Record for the present week discusses at much length the merits of the controversy between Archbishop HUGHES and City Inspector DELAVAN regarding the registry of marriages. Its Statements must be accorded a certain weight, from the fact that it is the official organ of the Archbishop. First of all the Record states in emphatic terms that Mr. DELAVAN has suppressed a portion of the correspondence. This he can publish for his satisfaction as soon as he desires. In giving to the newspapers the correspondence the Record claims that he has violated the sanctities of private correspondence, and of this the Archbishop complains. But although ""he may have spoken incautiously or imprudently in the confidence that he was answering a private communication from a gentleman, albeit, the City Inspector of New-York, still as regards the substance of that answer he has nothing to retract. He is prepared to do his duty, and to refuse doing what his conscience will not approve."" After this explicit statement of the position which the Archbishop at present occupies, the Record says that the comments made by the public Press on this lacerated but official statement have inflicted such an injury as he never before experienced. It hints further that, if brought to trial, he might seek for a change of venue, as the case has been prejudged here, but urges Mr. DELAVAN to do his duty, nevertheless. Archbishop HUGHES can save his conscience by refusing to obey the law and paying the fines, and at such passive resistance the people of New-York need not be surprised. The Record then discusses the merits of the law itself, citing instances in which it would be improper and injudicious to register the names of parties married, and quotes letters which Archbishop HUGHES has received on the subject from Protestant clergyrmen. One of them describes the enactment as ""foolish and useless,"" another writer says that ""he would have his arm cut off before revealing secrets which have come to his knowledge in the relation of matrimony,"" and another still thanks the Archbishop for the stand which he has taken. The Record acknowledges, in conclusion, that a Catholic member procured the passage of the act, but charges that it was concocted not far from the City Inspector's office, and that it had in view the creation of a new clerkship or the increase of the emoluments of the City Inspector's office, without the expense of a penny to the State. The other religious journals look at the subject from a different standpoint. The Observer, for instance, dismisses it in a brief paragraph.

After denouncing some bill that had passed the Senate at its last sesaion, he said that it had ""by some means or other, got through the Court of Claims."" A more severe impeachment of the integrity or ability of a Judicial' tribunal can hardly be Imagined. There is no way in which any case can pass this Court, except upon such testimony and upon the application of such legal principles as would establish it in any other Court in the land, that might be clothed with the same jurisdiction. Mr. HALE, therefore, could only have intended to insinuate that the Judges were bribed, or captured by the button-hole and lobbied with, or befooled, and the interests of the United States sacrificed, in spite of the able solicitors who have them in especial charge. This was a grave charge against the Court and against the solicitors. It was followed up by remarks in the same vein, touching the facility with which the Treasury was plundered -- conveying the idea that while the Court of Claims and other Senators might unite in the robbery of the Treasury, yet the Senator from New Hampshire formed a splondid exception in this era of venality, and was ready to denounce all public robbers, whether they appeared as Senators or Judges.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Arthur Edwards Claim and the Veto.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Arthur Edwards Claim and the Veto.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4cfc3b6f-5c4f-5f62-855b-446a5a3849fa,1140,nyt://article/4cfc3b6f-5c4f-5f62-855b-446a5a3849fa

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/06/30/archives/scientific-memoranda.html,,"-- Foreign scientists do not rush into print so precipitately as those on this side the water. We are too apt to record a phenomenon and then forget it, or allow our attention to be distracted by the advent of some new wonder. Thus, just as we are abandoning further research into the circumstances attending the great aurora of August and September, 1859, to look for the source of meteoric stones or the cause of tornadoes, maturer observations are coming to us from quarters where we hardly knew that there had been an aurora. The Comptes Rendues furnish those who may be investigatigating the causes of these brilliant displays with many important data. A fact which Prof. OLMSTEAD, of Yale College, was in the habit of urging as establishing the cosmical origin of the aurora, was repeated last August. France, England, Norway, Australia and the United States were favored with this celestial illumination on the same evenings, so that it must have originated where more than one side of the earth could be illuminated at once. At Paris, a few cirrus clouds were noticed during the exhibition, but they were all black, without any reflection from the light of the aurora, so that it must have emanated from a region much above them. Its effects upon telegraphic wires have been noted in general in this country, but in France the observations were more scientific in their character. On lines running north and south, the effects wore much more evident than on those running east and west, and the longer the lines the more perceptible was the electric action. M. HIPP calculated the power of the current at Berne, by means of a magnetic needle. The regular current employed in telegraphing should have sufficient power to deflect the needle 30""°;;"", but when the aurora was the brightest, it reached 58""°"", and in one instance 64""°"".",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SCIENTIFIC MEMORANDA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SCIENTIFIC MEMORANDA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-06-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ddc116d-b242-59bf-8eb4-8506fc964bc9,941,nyt://article/8ddc116d-b242-59bf-8eb4-8506fc964bc9

When the planters were compelled to receive an inadequate compensation for their slaves, they did so with the understanding that their staple should be protected in the British market. The wrong, if wrong it was, lay with the Government that held out such a promise � not with the Government that, by the bill of 1846, abolished the heavy tax paid by the English people for the support of a West Indian aristocracy. The planters could not be expected to take an abstract view of a measure that consummated their, own ruin.

Beginning at an early hour in the morning, and continuing throughout the day people of all classes thronged to the pier at the foot of Hammond-street, to obtain a view of the mammoth ship, and the number who thus visited the neighborhood throughout the day was estimated at many thousands. Nobody was admitted on board, by the rigid orders of Capt. HALL, who has put her Under a cleansing and painting process, to prepare her for the reception of visitors, who it is understood will not be admitted until about the middle of next week. The class of small speculators and keepers of lager beer, fruit and eating stands, with ""a single eye"" to the public convenience, have monopolized all the vacant places in the vicinity for the purpose of plying their respective tradeS. Considerable sums, in the shape of temporary licences, have been paid by these persons, who evidently expect to reap a handsome harvest while the excitement lasts. The approach to the dock is being covered with coarse gravel, to lay the dust, and workmen are removing the material and rubbish which has accumulated on the piers. The excitement attendant upon the arrival of this ocean monster has already communicated itself to our neighbors in other States, We notice that excursion parties to visit her, are forming in Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
