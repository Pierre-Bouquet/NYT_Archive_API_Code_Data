"DEPARTURE OF AN ALLEGED MURDERER FOR NEW-ORLEANS. -- DOMINIQUE MERA, an Italian boatman, who has been in confinement at the City Prison since the month of June last, awaiting identification by the authorities of New-Orleans, yesterday departed for that city in custody of Sheriff MARTIN, of Plaquemines Parish, La.

"-Among our foreign advices is the brief announcement of the advance of forty thousand Russian troops upon Peking, with a comment implying the improbability of the rumor. Nothing, however, is more probable. Russia has never permitted any European intervention in Chinese affairs without seizing the occasion to grasp a principal share of the advantages; insomuch, that the successive missions of the British Envoys, Lords MACARTNEY and AMHERST, are well known to have had no other effect than to draw the Court of Peking into closer alliance with that of St. Petersburg. At the approach of the Anglo-French expedition of 1858, two treaties, embodying valuable concessions, were obtained by Russian diplomacy; concessions so valuable, as not only to admit a Muscovite embassy to Peking, but to enlarge the Asiatic Empire of the Czar by the long-desired acquisition of the Amoor region, embracing the larger portion of the Province of Manchootia, where the actual Chinese dynasty had its origin, and where the bones of its Emperors are always entombed. With the short-sighted politics of an Oriental Power, the present Emperor confided in the favor thus secured with the Russians to strengthen him in his ignominious treatment of the allies; and when the backs of these were turned, and danger from that quarter was no longer imminent, the Russians received a taste of Tartar perfidy, in a practical refusal to surrender the Amoor valley. The Russian settlements along the river have been infested by Chinese war-parties; Chinese officers have exacted tolls and collected customs; and so great have been the vexations and molestations of the settlers, that the progress of Muscovite energy in that direction has been entirely suspended.

The Russian college in Peking is little else than a jail. The imposts upon traffic through Kiachta have experienced no ameliorations. In these circumstances, possessing so many valid grounds of complaint, and distrusting further employment of diplomacy, even if the channels of negotiation were open, Russia can hardly be expected to refrain from recourse to arms as the only practicable means of enforcing the repudiated treaties. An opportunity such as is promised by the formidable armada of the French and English is not to be neglected; and there need be no surprise if the triumph of first capturing and occupying the capital of the Chinese Empire should fall to the Muscovite.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/01/archives/the-russians-in-china.html,,"-Among our foreign advices is the brief announcement of the advance of forty thousand Russian troops upon Peking, with a comment implying the improbability of the rumor. Nothing, however, is more probable. Russia has never permitted any European intervention in Chinese affairs without seizing the occasion to grasp a principal share of the advantages; insomuch, that the successive missions of the British Envoys, Lords MACARTNEY and AMHERST, are well known to have had no other effect than to draw the Court of Peking into closer alliance with that of St. Petersburg. At the approach of the Anglo-French expedition of 1858, two treaties, embodying valuable concessions, were obtained by Russian diplomacy; concessions so valuable, as not only to admit a Muscovite embassy to Peking, but to enlarge the Asiatic Empire of the Czar by the long-desired acquisition of the Amoor region, embracing the larger portion of the Province of Manchootia, where the actual Chinese dynasty had its origin, and where the bones of its Emperors are always entombed. With the short-sighted politics of an Oriental Power, the present Emperor confided in the favor thus secured with the Russians to strengthen him in his ignominious treatment of the allies; and when the backs of these were turned, and danger from that quarter was no longer imminent, the Russians received a taste of Tartar perfidy, in a practical refusal to surrender the Amoor valley. The Russian settlements along the river have been infested by Chinese war-parties; Chinese officers have exacted tolls and collected customs; and so great have been the vexations and molestations of the settlers, that the progress of Muscovite energy in that direction has been entirely suspended. Nor have the treaties been in other respects better regarded. Diplomatic intercourse between the two Powers has been surrounded with augmented difficulties. The Russian college in Peking is little else than a jail. The imposts upon traffic through Kiachta have experienced no ameliorations. In these circumstances, possessing so many valid grounds of complaint, and distrusting further employment of diplomacy, even if the channels of negotiation were open, Russia can hardly be expected to refrain from recourse to arms as the only practicable means of enforcing the repudiated treaties.

"The recovery of the country from the financial depression growing out of the crisis of 1857, has hitherto been checked, if not embarrassed, by bad crops in one portion of the land or the other. The grain failure, season before last, was almost general. Last year, the West produced a partial wheat crop and a fair average of Indian corn. A general good harvest throughout the agricultural States was reserved for the present season. While the yield is now conceded to be large and well distributed in the great staple of wheat, and the season produces abundance, later in the year, in the not less important product of corn, we hear some complaints coming from the planting districts of the South. There has been too little rain for cotton, and the drouth and extreme heat have been damaging, in a large degree, to the auxiliary crops of corn and potatoes. The absence of rain was also injurious to the wheat yield in Georgia, Alabama and some portions of Tennessee. These facts qualify in a measure the otherwise general congratulations through the middle and Northwestern States in regard to the harvest. Their surplus will undoubtedly be large, and there is little danger of famine prices in the less favored sections in the lower Mississippi Valley and on the Southern Atlantic seaboard; the less so, as the export demand for grain and flour from France and England is likely from present appearances to be at moderate rather than at extravagant rates. That this demand is already here, and is to continue within a moderate scale of prices, there is little or no question, notwithstanding the favorable turn in the harvest weather in the west of Europe. The very latest accounts are significant of a continued good demand for foreign grain in London and Liverpool, without reference to the precise extent of the English yield. The active and profitable employment of manufacturing labor throughout the Kingdom has an important bearing, of course, on the consumption of cheap bread, and as the old supplies of English-grown wheat are conceded to be moderate and the new yield not likely to be above, if equal to, a fair average, the question of demand on this country, with its liberal supplies nearly or quite ready for market, would seem to be already decided.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/01/archives/our-material-prospects.html,,"The recovery of the country from the financial depression growing out of the crisis of 1857, has hitherto been checked, if not embarrassed, by bad crops in one portion of the land or the other.

"ARREST OF FOUR BOYS FOR BURGLARY AND ATTEMPTED ARSON. -- Detectives FROST and DENTON, of the Inspector of Police office, yesterday arrested four boys, named JACK POWERS, THOMAS QUIRK, JAMES MORRIS and WILLIAM JOHNSON, for the double crime of burglary and attempted arson. The oldest of these boys is 19 years of age, and the youngest about 15 years. They were arrested, at first, on suspicion of having robbed the house of NATHANIEL MILLS, on Gold-street, last Saturday night. Upon being locked up, one of them confessed not only to this, but also to various other offences, committed during the last two weeks, the most important of which are the following. They broke into St. Peter's Church, on State-street, where, finding no plate, as they had anticipated they would, they took possession of a contribution-box containing a few coppers, and then attempted to set the church on fire. The fact that the building was not burned down was owing more to the want of skill than of any good will on their part. While looking about for something to steal, they espied a surplice, which one of the party, in pure wantonness, commenced to tear into pieces; but another, apparently having more respect for the clerical robe than for the place, interfered to prevent this sacrilege, and the result was a fight over the ecclesiastical garment. Their next exploit was in an unoccupied house on Duffield-street, which they robbed of several hundred weight of lead pipe, and also of a quantity of brass cocks. Some time last Saturday night they entered the house of Mr. MILLS. The family being in the country, they had everything pretty much their own way, and were probably in the house nearly all night, but towards morning they became alarmed at the vigilance of a policeman in the vicinity, and made a precipitate retreat, taking with them but a small portion of the clothing they had selected and packed ready to carry away. This house, too, they attempted to set on fire, in one of the closets, but the flame which they had kindled went out of its own accord. The boy POWERS, who has manifested a desire to become a witness for the people, was formerly in the employ of GEORGE LAMBERTSON, in the Montague Hall Billiard Saloon, and is well known in that connection. He says that the party was organized only a few weeks ago, for the purpose of more successfully carrying on the business of robbery. Each took an oath of constancy to each other under any and all circumstances, with a fearful penalty attached for violating the obligation. Finding his companions and the business they were engaged in not quite so congenial to his feelings as he had anticipated, he was apparently rather pleased than otherwise at being arrested, and now expresses a strong desire to be afforded an opportunity to amend his ways.

It will be remembered that last Winter the Hoboken Company obtained from the Legislature a charter for a railroad connecting Hoboken with Newark. This result was only attained after a desperate struggle -- the forces in favor of the charter being led by Mr. E.A. STEVENS, the President of the Hoboken corporation, and also of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, while the opposition mustered under Mr. JOHN P. JACKSON, the Vice-President of the New-Jersey Railroad Company. While beaten in the Legislature, the latter had left the stronghold of the Courts, uniformly partial in New-Jersey to the interests of close corporations. The New-Jersey Railroad threw itself upon certain old charters for toll-bridges across the two rivers separating Hoboken from Newark, and contended that the monopoly secured by those papers must bar the prospects of their antagonists. The cause was argued at great length and learning before the Chancellor, who in his decision has ruled against the Hoboken party on all the points raised by it, except one, and that happens to give the entire victory to that side. Chancellor GREEN holds that a special privilege granted seventy years since, for a toll-bridge, was designed to apply to such modes of locomotion and transportation as existed at that time; and it could not have been in the minds of the legislators to apply it to locomotion and steam, and rail, for the very obvious reason that such facilities of travel were then not even dreamed of. He therefore regards a bridge exclusively used for the transit of Railroad trains as not in conflict with the rights of the New-Jersey Company; and so renders his dictum. The case will doubtless be carried to the Court of Errors, where there is little prospect of so wise a decision being reversed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Important Decision.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Important Decision.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aeb9a7b8-9c9e-5e23-bd8c-58fb33b4e6f3,454,nyt://article/aeb9a7b8-9c9e-5e23-bd8c-58fb33b4e6f3

"Perhaps no administration that has swayed within our time the destinies of England has presented a greater combination of extent of experience, breadth of culture, brilliancy of genius, and enlightened sympathies with the people than the present Cabinet, as typified by Lord PALMERSTON, Lord JOHN RUSSELL, Mr. GLADSTONE, and the Duke of NEWCASTLE, who has been so wisely selected as the mentor of the youthful British Telamachus, whom the telegraph tells us landed yesterday on our shores. Nowhere perhaps, has the influence of the true statesmenship of these men been more visible than in the desire they have exhibited, often under severe trial, to cement the alliance with this country. For whatever difference may exist with regard to peculiar institutions, there can be no question that on all great subjects tending to jeopardize those principles of liberty which are the keystone of both English and American life, the two nations must naturally appeal to each other, and derive from their union a moral strength and positive power, which cannot fail to prove invaluable auxiliaries in any contest of civilization, whether on this or the other side of the ocean. Whether to the statesman's desire of cultivating more intimate relations with America, or to the kindly feeling of the Queen of England towards a country in which her name has been held, even in its republican extent, in almost loyal reverence -- as exhibited in the cordiality and gracefulness of her letter to her ""good friend,"" JAMES BUCHANAN -- we owe this visit of her son, it is equally wise and well-timed. At the same time, it is impossible not to mark the judicious line of demarcation which has been drawn between the visit of the Prince to his mother's English possessions and that to the American Republic. The latter he proposes to visit with the quiet dignity of a private traveler, the other with a parade of royalty which will bring the moral weight of institutions that have stood the test of centuries, upon colonies which, geographically at least, may be said to be exposed to the freaks and passions of our restless, wild, and eccentric Republic. England, with all kindness for Young America, thus exhibits her determination to hold her own, and perpetuate among the people of her distant possessions, that abiding attachment for old English institutions which cover the hearts of her people at home. Nor does this visit, which hereafter will belong to the romance of history, derive the least of its poetic interest from the fact that one of the oldest among the monarchies has chosen for its first personal representative to a young world a boy of but nineteen.

Mrs. ELIZABETH F. THORNDYKE, as she is now entitled to call herself, if the divorce laws of Indiana are valid, was married to Mr. HENRY G. RICE, of Baltimore, in 1860. She and her husband became estranged soon after the birth of a boy, to recover possession of whom Mrs. THORNDYKE brings suit, and she appealed to the Indiana Courts and obtained a divorce. Subsequently Mr. RICK obtained a divorce from her on the ground of desertion, and commenced proceedings to have the Indiana divorce set aside, on the ground of fraud, and made diligent efforts to recover the custody of the child. Last December an agreement was made between the parties, by which. Mr. RICE was to have the custody of the child, except at stipulated seasons, (which also had been decreed to him in the Maryland Court;) and a condition of the agreement was that he should discontinue his proceedings to quash the Indiana divorce. The child was placed in the custody of his father last Spring, but when Mr. RICE found as he alleges, that the visits of Mrs. RICE to her son produced an injurious effect upon him, by making him unruly and disobedient he declined to fulfill the agreement, and after six visits made by the boy to his mother in April last, she has been debarred from further intercourse with him. Mr. RICE came with his family to resice at N[???]hant the 1st or July, and Mrs. THOR[???]DYKE has brought the pending suit to compel the restoration of the joint custody of her boy, in fulfillment of the before mentioned agreement. Able counsel are employed in the cause, J.G. ABBOTT and WILDER DWIGHT appealing for the petitioner; SIDNEY BARTLATT and DAVID THAXTER for the respondent.

"From a correspondence printed in the NewOrleans papers, it seems that immense and recondite organization, the Knighthood of the Golden Circle, has offered its services to the Liberal Government of Mexico, and that they have been declined.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/02/archives/a-circle-squared.html,,"From a correspondence printed in the NewOrleans papers, it seems that immense and recondite organization, the Knighthood of the Golden Circle, has offered its services to the Liberal Government of Mexico, and that they have been declined. Indeed, the mere suggestion of such aid seems to have thrown President JUAREZ into the utmost consternation. Not only does he pronounce in emphatic terms against this specific tender, but he declares the indisposition of his Government to avail itself of any offers of the kind originating with Free Companies gathered in the United States, and hints broadly that the apparent friendship of that modern Jason, Gen. BICKLEY, is really a suggestion of the Reactionary adversary at the City of Mexico, eager to lead the progressives into temptation, and thence to ruin. Whether there be justice or not in this suspicion it is unsafe to conjecture; but very surely no more serious faux pas could be committed by either of the actual parties in Mexico, than to court the aid of American condottieri. So long as the ranks of either hostile army can be recruited by individual enlistments, or by the tender of commissions to foreign leaders of ability, there is no hazard of arousing and alarming national prejudices. Much of the actual strength of the Liberal forces is thus obtained. But in the employment of foreign mercenaries upon the Bickleian plan, a cry is at once furnished to the opposite party, who would not fail to rally a people so peculiarly jealous of their nationality in hostility, to the traitors who proposed to level the musket of the stranger at the heart of their countrymen. The career of WALKER in Nicaragua is too recent to be forgotten. That hero, with his band of ragmuffins and cut-throats, was invited by the confiding Liberals of the Central American State, to aid them in much the same sort of a struggle with Conservatism. He went, and served, and conquered. There was no strength in Spanish-American character, or courage to enable the people to resist his ambitious advances. They sank collapsed at his feet. The spectacle, so full of warning, is fresh in the recollection of the Mexican people, who watched the struggle with an interest naturally profound because sympathetic. No existing party would therefore venture to repeat an experiment thus obviously big with peril.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Circle Squared.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Circle Squared.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/644f3dab-aba2-5a62-bb18-824fdb5f6b6d,585,nyt://article/644f3dab-aba2-5a62-bb18-824fdb5f6b6d

The excursion to Newark Bay on Tuesday proved a very pleasant affair, and was highly satisfactory to all concerned. Yesterday the Guard spent the day in the City, under going a review by the Mayor in the forenoon, visiting Niblo's in the afternoon, and Wallack's in the evening. The review by the Mayor took place at 11 o'clock in front of the City Hall, the Guard being escorted thither from the Eagle Drill rooms via Fourth-avenue, Union-square and Broadway, by their hosts the Irish Fusileers. Col. Corcoran and Ex-Col. Doheny of the Sixty-ninth Regiment, and Lieut.-Col. Nugent, Capts. Kelly, Kirker and Breslin, Lieut. Carter and others were present at the review. The Mayor, accompanied by Aldermen Boole, Seagrist, Bagley, Barry and Cornell, and Councilmen Lent and Pinckney passed along the line of the Guard, who presented arms for the occasion. The Guard, with their escort, then marched to review before the Mayor, who was subsequently introduced to the several officers, and addressing Capt. CA[???]ILL, welcomed in a few words the Emmet Guard to the City of New-York Capt. CAHILL responded briefly, and the two Companies then marched several times around the inclosure, receiving the applause of the spectators. The Guard were then escorted to their head-quarters, the Westchester House, where, at half-past 12 o'clock, they sat down to dinner with their hosts, the Fusileers. An interchange of toasts followed the removal of the cloth, in response to one of which, complimentary to the Guards, Capt. CAHILL alluded to the action of an Ex-Governor of Connecticut, in disbanding the Company on account of their being foreigners. Such an act, he thought, was conceived in bigotry; and, although he was a native American himself, he was opposed to all proscription of Irishmen or others on account of their foreign birth. The Emmet Guard did not claim to be the beau ideal of a military organization, and he could not indorse the remark of a previous speaker, that they were ""second to none;"" yet they did claim to be always ready to do their duty, as good citizens to their State and to their country.

The price of wool afterwards went down, and they sued WARREN to recover $5,000 which they had overpaid him on the market value of the wool.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/02/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"KINGS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- THE DEAD HOUSE -- OFFICERS ELECTED -- SURROGATE's FEES. -- An adjourned meeting of this Board was held last evening in the County Jail building, Raymond street, President CROSWELL in the Chair. There was a full attendance of members. The annual report of the Store Keeper for the County was submitted, from which it appears that the following articles were used in the Bakery during the past year: Flour, 2,087 bbls.; Indian meal, 17,275 lbs.; rock salt, 17 bbls.; hops; 75 lbs.; malt, 17 bushels. With which 532,136 lbs. of bread were b[???]ked, and distributed as follows: Almshouse. 149,966 lbs.; Hospital, 87,600 lbs.; Nursery, 59,658 lbs.; Lunatic Asylum, 124,112 lbs.; Penitentiary, 119,800 lbs. A resolution was adopted authorizing a Committee to enter into contract with E[???]BITS HOPKINS, mason, at $652. and WRIGHT RAMSDEN, plumber, at $89, to proceed forthwith and erect upon the Hospital grounds fronting on Willoughby-street, a brick building, one story high, to be used as a Dead House, according to plans and specifications presented. Much the largest portion of the session; was occupied with matters pertaining to the appointment of a Keeper and Assistant Keepers of the Penitentiary. The Board, for first time within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, has a decided Republican majority. The Democracy have heretofore had everything their own way, and have accordingly filled every office in the gift of the Board with a working Democrat. In June last the Republicans in the present Board made an attempt to remove several officers, but for the time the matter was laid upon the table, and passed by. Yesterday the subject was called up by Supervisor COLT of the Sixth Ward. He moved to adopt the report of a Committee, in effect removing HIRAM HELMS, Democrat, Keeper of the Penitentiary. The motion was strenuously resisted by the Democrats, joined by several Republicans, but was finally adopted. A motion to proceed to ballet to fill the vacancy was then carried. Upon the result being announced, Mr. HELMS, having received a majority of all the vo[???]es cast, was declared elected. A motion was then made and adopted, after much opposition, declaring the office of Assistant Keeper vacant, and a resolution, offered in June last, embracing the names of the Republican nominees, was adopted. Soon afterwards the of[???]covery was made that the resolution provided that the new officers should commetee their duties on the 1st of July next, and a long squabble was then had over a motion to reconsider and amend so as to read, ""on the 1st day of August 1860"" and readopt, all of which was finally accomplished. The names of the keepers removed and appointed are as follows: William L. Jones, Joseph Ritze, John Bradshaw, William H. Butts, John Van Zandt, P.H. Moore aim William M. Brown, in place of James Willis, Thomas Gascoyne, Alexander Land, William Willis, O.B. Strickland, James Campbell and William Pearsall. Contracts for various supplies were awarded as follows, coal, James Bell, at $4,50 per ton; wood, Kelsey & Loughlin, at $5 97 per cord; soft [???]eap, Arthur Welwood; at 75c. per barrel. The Surrogate sent in a report of fees received by him to $4,478 20 received in the respective months as follows: August, $278; September, $122 75; October, $401; November, $334 25: December, $405 50; January, $317 50; February, $402; March. $358 75; April, $327 75; May, $428 75; June, $110 95 July, $391.

Fearing violence at his hands they entered the house and slammed the door a moment or two before Mrs. Fawcett and the other lady reached it. Wilson then turned to them and renewed his offensive language, after which he seized Mrs. Fawcett by her dress, dragged her from the stoop, threw her down and beat her most shamefully, besides tearing her garments. Her cries, and those of her companion, brought Officer Warren to her assistance, and the ruffian was arrested.

A number of communications from various sources were received and referred to the Committee on the Whole, with power. The following is an abstract of the report of the Committee on the Whole, which was submitted and unanimously adopted.

From the 20th of July to the 2d inst. 635 persons, male and female, were transmitted to the Workhouse on Blackwell's Island as vagrants. A census being taken at Bellevue Hospital on the 18th ult., showing that the number of inmates there was 947, while the books showed the number of 995, making a difference of 48 inmates. Instructions were given to the Warden of the Island Hospital to remove the dead bodies forthwith, and not to retain them for several days, as had been done heretofore. The salary of Mrs. Heaton, matron at the Almshouse, was fixed at $350 per annum. The salaries of Miss Bell and Mrs. Lloyd, matrons at the Workhouse, were fixed at the rate of $350 per annum each. An inclosure was formed around the Lunatic Asylum to limit the promenade and exercise ground of the inmates for the purpose of keeping them better under supervision. The excavations for the new Lunatic Asylum are now complete, and the architect was notified to proceed with his work. The repairs to the border at the Randall's Island Hospital have been ordered to be done by a competent person, and directions have been given to the Warden to have a sufficient number of men engaged in getting out stone for the base of the new building. At the opening of bids for the erection and extensions of buildings, Charles Vandervoort was awarded the contract for the carpenter's work at $5,700; and D.E. & B Weeks were awarded the contract for the mason work at $1,476.

"THE ANNUAL BUDGET. -- The Joint Board of Aldermen and Supervisors reassembled in the Common Council Chamber, last evening, to make up the tax Budget for the year.

"The Exercises of Anniversary week at Auburn commenced with examinations of the classes on Monday and Tuesday. On Tuesday evening, at 7 3/4 o'clock, an address before the Society of Inquiry, in the presence of a good audience, was delivered at the town hall, by Rev. Dr. SAMUEL HARRIS, of Bangor. An address, not connected with the anniversary exercises, but of much interest, was delivered in the chapel, at 9 o'clock Wednesday morning, by M. BEAULIEU, of Illinois. The object of this was to present the claims of those families of the Canadian Reformed Catholics who declined following Father CHINIQUY into the Presbyterian Church, not feeling that they had sufficient knowledge of Protestant differences to join any denomination, and, therefore, preferring to remain in the Congregational form of worship. These amounted to nearly half of the nine hundred families. Father BRAULIEU gave a sketch of his own life and conversion, and of the causes which led so many French Canadians to leave their homes and the Catholic Church, and seek refuge in Illinois. The Sermon to the Alumni, at 10 1/2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, was to have been delivered by Rev. Dr. WAYLAND, of Providence, but in his absence on account of illness, Professor PHELPS, of Andover, preached from the text: ""Confess your faults one to another, and pray one to another."" -- John 5, 16 -- and from several kindred texts. At the annual meeting of the Alumni, Rev. Mr. MALTBY, of Taunton, presided. The Standing Committee and Secretary of last year were rechosen. Also, for preacher of the next annual sermon, Rev. Dr. WAYLAND, and as substitute, Rev. Dr. THOMPSON, of East Windsor, Conn. Rev. PHILIP SCHAFF, D.D., of Phillipsburgh, Penn., spoke before the Porter Rhetorical Society on Wednesday afternoon, and in the evening there was an exhibition of the Society of Inquiry and of the Porter Rhetorical Society in the Town Hall.

The inquest resulted in a verdict against ADAM JAGER, who inflicted the fatal injury. It appeared from the testimony of PHILIP RICHARD, a witness of the affray, that a difficulty between JAGER and deceased occurred at MEYER'S lager-bier saloon, in Third-street, on Sunday night. JAGER was in the saloon, when his wife came and asked him to go home, but he refused to accompany her, and deceased thereupon remarked something which JAGER construed into an offence. Shortly afterwards witness and deceased left the place, and when near the corner of Avenue A and Third-street, witness saw JAGER and a man named FRIES coming toward them. Witness stopped and spoke to them, after which they remained talking together for some time. While thus engaged JAGER's watch dropped from his pocket and he accused all of them of a design to ro[???] him. In his rage he drew a knife and cut the back of PAEBLER's coat. The latter, however, did not know of the attempt to stab him, and started to go home, but had not proceeded far when witness told him of JAGER's act, and they immediately returned to where the prisoner stood. PAEBLER asked JAGER why he had stabbed him, when be again took out his knife and inflicted a terrible wound in PAEBLER's abdomen. He then ran away but was quickly overtaken and secured by Officer SCHIFF, of the Seventeenth Ward. Upon this testimony the Jury rendered a verdict to the effect that ""HENRY PAEBLER came to his death by a stab at the hands of ADAM JAGER, and that the wound was wilfully inflicted.""

In 1860 France again puts herself at the head of civilized Europe, to decide whether the action of the Congress of Paris on the Turkish question can be maintained with justice to the people of the great empire over which that action provisionally confirmed the supremacy of the Osmanli, or whether the Ottoman has become finally ""tolerable and act to be endured.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France in the East.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France in the East.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Syria', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d1732677-2bc3-5bd0-80f5-05bf793fc3be,976,nyt://article/d1732677-2bc3-5bd0-80f5-05bf793fc3be

"Dispatches relating to the emigration from Canton have been recently presented to the British Parliament, which possess considerable interest for ship owners in this country. It appears that the acts of violence and fraud connected with the Coolie trade had reached such a pitch in the Spring of 1859 as to excite a general feeling of alarm throughout the Chinese community, accompanied by a degree of effervescent popular indignation which rendered it impossible for the authorities any longer to remain inactive. Several known kidnappers were murdered in the streets by the mob of Canton, and the native merchants called loudly for the intervention of the foreign consuls to restrain the subjects of their respective governments from the acts complained of. The allied Commissioners at once instructed their police to aid in the suppression of kidnapping, and the Chinese Governor, PIH-KWEI, took measures for the same purpose, at the same time authorizing the voluntary emigration of Chinese, which had been till then prohibited. PIH-KWEI died before any system of legal emigration could be organized, but in November last the allied Commissioners succeeded in establishing at Canton a system which had the full consent and support of the Chinese authorities. Gov. LAON, the successor of PIH-KWEI, addressed both the allied Commissioners and the foreign Consuls, requesting them to bring the subject under the notice of their respective governments, in order that they might require all their subjects or citizens engaged in the coolie trade to conduct it in future under such regulations as the foreign Consuls and the local Chinese authorities might decide upon. The British Government established a house for the reception of emigrants for the British West Indies, under the direction of Mr. AUSTIN, who issued a public notice of the official character of his emigration, and of the conditions under which he was prepared to engage laborers.

"The game which was begun on a former occasion between these Clubs having been brought to an unsatisfactory conclusion by the rain, they met yesterday afternoon to settle the mooted question of superior skill; and after the full number of innings had been played out, it was shown that the Harlems had concluded to export the ball -- the pledge of victory -- to New-Jersey, the first one they have been compelled to deliver up this season.

Instances have been repeatedly brought to our notice in which notes bearing a three-cent stamp have been handed in to the person whose address they bore branded with a demand ""for one cent additional."" As the Government has undertaken to destroy at one blow both the business of the private expresses established in the City and the facilities which these expresses offered to the correspondence of our citizens, it is surely its duty to see that the citizens at least shall not suffer by its zeal. The New-York Post-office exists for New-York, not New-York for the Post-office. It is of very little importance comparatively to us who shall take charge of our correspondence, but of very great importance that our correspondence shall be well cared for, economically, promptly and safely. In Great Britain and France, and particularly in the former country, the Government has frankly recognized this fact, and the people of London and Paris enjoy, in consequence, a postal system which shames New-York back by the contrast into the days before ROWLAND HILL.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Metropolitan Post-Office.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Metropolitan Post-Office.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/321bce59-4b66-5812-a09d-7f0ab33cdc2b,491,nyt://article/321bce59-4b66-5812-a09d-7f0ab33cdc2b

Since the reduction, three or four years ago, from $3 to the present rate, the economies of the manufacture have made no small progress, and the charge for this extensively-used article being now higher in New-York than in Boston, Philadelphia, and some other cities, the public will not be surprised to learn that our Gas Companies are beginning to feel the pressure from without, especially as considerable excitement has been recently produced relative to gas exactions, and one or two new Companies are starting up and threatening to put an end to the long-enjoyed monopoly. The Manhattan Company has just referred the price of gas to a Special Committee, and there is little doubt of an early change. Two dollars per thousand cubic feet is the rate which will probably be fixed. A lower price has in some quarters been looked for. But, so long as most of the coal distilled has to be brought here from mines 3,000 miles off, there is but little chance of any but inferior coal-gas being supplied in this City, at a price below that we have named. In London the rate charged is about $1 08, and as most of our gas-making requisites have to be purchased in Europe, the first cost of gas here amounts, at present, to about twice as much as in the capital of Great Britain. If, then, our Gas Companies will supply a pure, rich article, at $2, the public, in the existing state of the manufacture, will not be disposed to complain, and the increased consumption induced cannot fail to render the change advantageous to all parties. Until coal-gas is discarded, and we see the general introduction of some method for the cheap production of illuminating gas from other materials, a further decrease in price can scarcely fail to involve some mischievous falling off in quality.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Gas Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Gas Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d764f1c-083f-5e5f-97d2-d4482f97486b,918,nyt://article/3d764f1c-083f-5e5f-97d2-d4482f97486b

SAMUEL CHESHIRE, conductor, was on the platform of one of the passenger cars when the accident happened, and was thrown against a brake-wheel and severely, though not seriously, injured. No other personal damage resulted beyond a few bruises. The escape of the passengers, 125 in number, was very narrow. The fireman, LYNCH, who was killed, lived at Jamaica, and leaves a little child. Through the energetic movements of Mr. MORRIS, the President of the Company, the track was cleared in two or three hours after the accident.

Such a discourse falls to the lot of few ministers to deliver, or of few congregations to hear. Dr. SPRING has been so intimately connected with the growth of the City, so familiar with its changes and improvements, so intimate with its inhabitants -- (how many of them he has seen buried!) -- and has done such good service, not alone as a devoted minister of religion for fifty years, but as a man of education, progress, science, philanthropy, and whatever else is honorable during all that time, that he is entitled to be considered one of the most notable living ""man-marks"" of Manhattan Island. That his church tomorrow morning will be crowded, and that all that survive of the friends of half a century will be present, will be a matter of coarse. Every true New-Yorker who honors himself, will honor Dr. SPRING on this occasion.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc6d0732-3e82-5fb0-8517-00a9500ad1c4,810,nyt://article/cc6d0732-3e82-5fb0-8517-00a9500ad1c4

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/04/archives/miscellaneous-issues.html,,"-- Another contribution to medical literature is The Movement-Cure, just published by FOWLER WELLS. The author is Dr. GEORGE H. TAYLOR, physician to the ""Remedial Hygienic Institute"" of this City. The so-called movement-cure was introduced to the notice of a long-suffering and diseased public by PETER HENRY LING, a Swede, to whom the Swedish Government gave countenance and support some forty years ago. The author of this work visited Sweden, for the purpose of drinking directly from the fountain of curative wisdom, just as the water-cure disciples visited PRIFSSNITZ to take courses of wet-sheets. He returned fully charged with admiration of the practice of LING, and forthwith indited this book, in explanation and advocacy of the new system. The movement-cure, as herein expounded and illustrated, consists of a series of gymnastic exercises; the medical use of one's limbs and contortions of the body being the means relied upon for conquering all the ills of feeble frames. The sick, who may have tried, to their disgust, the relative virtues of allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, Galvanism, and half a dozen other methods of treatment, will find in Dr. TAYLOR's book full directions for a new series of experiments, -- if they have courage to undertake the task. It is not clear that a season at a gymnasium would not be the best ""movement "" cure. -- for LING's system is merely exercise in calisthenics -- nothing more.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e3192e2a-948c-54fc-9112-151b34ba6239,1269,nyt://article/e3192e2a-948c-54fc-9112-151b34ba6239

The doctrine of Mr. DARWIN had been enounced, in the course of the preceding Winter, long enough before the meeting of the Association, to have provoked discussion, both popular and scientific, in all parts of the world. Coming from one of the most accomplished and respected of living naturalists, as the result of twenty years of unrelaxing study, travel and experiment, it could not fail to command the attention of the whole scientific guild, and not for these reasons alone, but also because the doctrine was at once novel in itself, in conflict with established beliefs, and seemed to offer solutions for a thousand difficulties which beset theories currently received. Review, magazine and newspaper had in turn expressed their more or less enlightened opinions of the book; but to the great annual conference of British science popular expectation was directed, as the criterion of the real scientific value of the discovery. The Association, to the disappointment of everybody, adjourned without passing any judgment upon the subject; in fact, it was only noticed cursorily, as furnishing an opportunity for a Bishop of the English Church to denounce its heretical tendencies. This denunciation seems to have stifled discussion; and a theory, which, whether true or false, is destined to distinguish the current year in the history of natural science, has not even been recognized by the most imposing scientific body of the period.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Advance of Science.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Advance of Science.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Darwin, Charles Robert', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6dad71d9-ae2d-5e2d-a195-ee3e9b829e25,719,nyt://article/6dad71d9-ae2d-5e2d-a195-ee3e9b829e25

Lord PALMERSTON, the recognized champion of the Anglo-French Alliance, and the twice-consecrated martyr of his faith in the ruler of France, has announced on the floor of Parliament, and with financial emphasis, his conviction that England can no longer re y upon continued peace with hertoo powerful neighbor across the Channel, and that the political ""horizon is charged with clouds which betoken the possibility of a tempest."" The most British of British statesmen, the ""pluckiest"" of Ministers, and not the least boastful of orators, has been forced to avow that France stands to-day to her British ally in the attitude of the stronger Power, and as such may ""expect a submission which the weaker Power may not be disposed to give."" What unrevealed secrets of the Foreign Office lower behind these simple but ominous words, it may not be difficult for those who have carefully followed the recent course of European politics to conjecture. In the internal condition of Germany; in the unsettled questions of Italy and of the East; in the revival of the power of Spain; France has interests at stake, and an influence to be asserted which must inevitably come into conflict with the interests and the influence of England, if England is still to be governed as Whigs and Tories seem alike to agree that she shall be, by the traditions of 1815. The hope of peace for the world has lain for years in the prospect that these traditions might wear out their own life in England before France could become strong enough to insist upon their disappearance from the policy of the British Government. Upon this prospect, it seems, we are no longer to count. The most conspicuous friend of the French Imperial Government in England, whether as a sacrifice on the altar of political expediency or as the result of serious convictions matters little to the present purpose, has formally indicted the strength of France as a terror for England. The British Premier has given all the sanction of his high office and of his personal reputation to the doctrine that England has a right to decide how large an army France has a right to keep in the field, and that a positive ""naval superiority to all other Powers is absolutely necessary to the existence of England as a nation."" The importance of such language, from such a source, cannot easily be over-estimated, and the speech made by Lord PALMERSTON on the 23d of July may, without exaggeration, be described as a new and formidable cloud upon that horizon of which it professedly laments the dark and ominous aspect, and the ""ragged rims of thunder, brooding low.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'France and England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'France and England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/700696f3-3b97-5957-b794-55ddcef32d79,1449,nyt://article/700696f3-3b97-5957-b794-55ddcef32d79

His mode of proceeding is thus described: Being proprietor of a sowing machine establishment in Orange-street, he would advertise for a partner, and to the person replying would make representations as to the magnitude of the business carried on. He would agree to give the applicant an interest on the latter putting in five machines, to be purchased at a specified place. When the machines were brought to the factory they were seized by a confederate of the accused and carried off, to satisfy a claim under an alleged judgment.

It is also reported that the Syrian question will be dealt with summarily in a Conference of the Powers at Paris. Sicily had been entirely evacuated by the Royal troops, and GARIBALDI, in whose councils the MAZZINI misleaders seem to be gaining a perilous influence, was supposed to be on the point of passing over into Calabria. The interest of the public, however, will be partially drawn away from the Syrian and Sicilian questions by a very remarkable speech of Lord PALMERSTON on the national defenses, which had caused a fall of the funds at Paris, and provoked strong expressions of dissatisfaction from Mr. BRIGHT and Mr. BERNAL OSBORNS, the latter of whom declared that cordial relations between France and England had been made impossible by the language of the Premier.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8469a4e-4d78-53df-8ff4-e608892ac365,1155,nyt://article/d8469a4e-4d78-53df-8ff4-e608892ac365

CURRIER & TROTT, as a watch, repairer with a liberal salary. His employers had every confidence in him, and his standing with the trade and the community generally was of the highest character. Some time since Mr. GOLDENBERG informed his employers that he had teen authorized by a friend to get up a costly article of Masonic jewelry, and as they had no diamonds of the quality wanted, they allowed him to go to New-York to select them, giving him letters to their correspondents in that City. He brought back from New-York about $1,000 worth of diamonds, from which he selected several of the value of $350, for his purpose. But now commenced the most extraordinary part of this affair. Taking these jewels, he went round to the leading jewelers, and stating that his friend who had employed him to make up the Masonic Emblem, though perfectly good, was for the moment short of the cash required to get up the article, has borrowed from one place and another, in sums varying from $300 down to $75, about $1,200 or $1,500. In this way six prominent jewelers were swindled. In one case he employed a journeyman jeweler to manufacture about one hundred rings, which were delivered, and in consequence they are a total loss to the industrious manufacturer. But his operations did not stop here. He went round to his personal friends, who had the greatest confidence in his good character, and borrowed of one and another on similar grounds, until the total reached nearly five thousand dollars. In one case he victimized an old shipmaster to the tune of $800. In a number of cases, as a slight token of his appreciation of the ""accommodation,"" he insisted upon taking the valuable watches of his respective friends, for gratuitous cleaning, thus relieving them of both time and money. Having in a brief period accumulated together a little fortune, he informed a neighbor last Friday that in the absence of his wife, who had gone into the country, he felt quite lonely and should follow her, which he did, without, however, the slightest knowledge on the part of any one of his rather extensive operations. Since that time he has not been seen by his friends, who are unable to obtain any particulars as to his whereabouts. He is about 55 years of age, and has a wife and several children.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Great Swindling Operation in Boston.; A JOURNEYMAN JEWELER DECAMPS WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS AND MONEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Great Swindling Operation in Boston.; A JOURNEYMAN JEWELER DECAMPS WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS AND MONEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/459a943b-7da1-55a5-b2e1-0fbe6977ed49,457,nyt://article/459a943b-7da1-55a5-b2e1-0fbe6977ed49

About midnight the rowdies, who had become quite intoxicated, took possession of the house and helped themselves to liquor, some charge from the till and whatever else they saw fit to appropriate to their own use. When the proprietor remonstrated he was set upon and beaten in a most shocking manner. The female inmates raised a cry of murder, which was heard by the Police of the Fourth Ward in Jersey City, four of whom went un and assisted the officers from Hudson City in arresting the [???]ters. The furniture and everything movable in the bar room had been demolished; the landlord has received serious injuries, and one of the women had nearly every particle of clothing stripped from her.

CROSS, who has already gained a wide-spread notoriety for counter-felting exploits: ""On Saturday morning Col.J. BUCHANAN CROSS, who was awaiting sentence for forgery, escaped from JOHN PORTER, one of the tip-staves of the Quarter Sessions, who was bringing him to Court. A motion for a new trial was pending, and was to have been argued on Saturday, but owing to some misunderstanding between CROSS and his counsel, the defendant was satisfied that the motion would not be argued, but that he would receive his sentence. When Mr. PORTER stopped for him at the prison, he requested the officer to get a carriage, as he wished his wife to accompany him, it being the last opportunity which would be afforded him previous to his sentence. The officer got the carriage, but no wife appeared, and CROSS and PORTER alone started off. On the way down, the Colonel requested as a favor that he might be taken to Miller's Hotel, corner of Washington-avenue and Moyamen-sing-avenue, so that he might arrange his trunk, which had been left there when he was arrested. To this the officer agreed, and the parties drove to the hotel, where they went up to the third story. The room was darkened, and while CROSS was pretending to unlock the trunk, he asked Mr. PORTER to open the shutters, and as he stepped to the window to do so, CROSS sprang to his feet, and was out the doorway, and had the door locked upon the officer before he could well recover from his surprise. Down stairs at full speed he went, dropping his hat on the way, out into the yard, and then over the fence, his escape being facilitated by two chairs which were standing in the yard. Once in the street, he jumped into a covered wagon which seemed to be there in waiting, and was driven off at a rapid rate, before Mr. PORTER could escape from his room, Mr. PORTER had to kick out the panels of the door before he could get through, and when he reached the sidewalk he was in time to see the wagon disappearing from his sight. He ran after it, but the pursuit was fruitless. ""The matter was brought to the notice of the Court as soon as it had opened, and Mr. PORTER was suspended.

The particulars of the occurence are as follows: The track between Schodac and Stuyve[???]ant is double. On the down track was a freight train which had stopped to cool a hot journal. On the other track, a short distance above, was a gravel train and opposite the freight train was a hand car, on the same track as the gravel train, with Mr. COON and Mr. DONOLLY upon it. They did not notice the gravel train, which was slowly backing, until it was within ten or fifteen feet of them, when Mr. COON saw it and sprang from the car. He might easily have escaped uninjured, but he attempted to pull DONOLLY off the car, as the latter had not noticed either the approach of the train or Mr. COON's leap. Mr. COON had scarcely seized DONOLLY when the rear car of the train struck them both, instantly killing DONOLLY, and crushing in the back part of Mr. COON's head. He was alive at last accounts, but insensible, and his recovery is considered impossible. The occurrence was purely accidental. DONOLLY resided at Germantown, and leaves a wife and six children, who were dependant upon him for support. He was about 45 years of age.

There was also noted the fact, that in July a resolution was passed through both branches of the Common Council, authorizing the Croton Board to proceed with that work without entering into a contract; and on Monday the work was commenced, when some three hundred men were set at work, Yesterday, however, the Croton Board received a communication from the Mayor's Clerk, acting on which, they at once stopped the work, and discharged he men employed. The history of this operation is one of some interest to tax-payers, and we therefore give the official correspondence which has brought about a result so disastrous to householders and consumers of Croton Water.

A man's indignation must be high indeed, if he can get higher than ""Phoebus Apollo"" has reached during the past two days. Consequently, although persons were present perforce, in the Court of Sessions, (for no longing for ""green fields and pastures new,"" would have been of avail to them,) yet prosecutors were generally distant, and witnesses in their excessive love of nature, were as hard to catch as shad at Christmas. There was no Grand Jury impanneled, as a matter of course. How could a quorum be obtainable with Saratoga, Niagara, Cape May, Long Branch, the White Mountains, the Catskills, &c., &c., inviting over-broiled citizens to quit the City? Recorder BARNARD, who holds Court this term, is a patient man, who never shirks his duty, but does it assiduously and honorably, but if he were in the country instead of on the Bench, he would undoubtedly feel cooler and enjoy himself more. Mr.SEDGWICK, the Assistant District Attorney, looks as if a rural district in Massachusetts would please him better than his snug seat in the Court-room. The petit jurors appear miserable and the reporters are undeniably indignant. Put the thermometer down eight or nine degrees, and outshines will go on in earnest, but unless the sessions of the Court were held in an ice-house, it would be folly now to expect the attendance of witnesses or prosecutors. Nevertheless, some parties who pleaded guilty to various offences have been sentenced by the Recorder to the State Prison for two and three years each.

In the absence of Capt. ATTERBURY, Sergeant FITCH was called to the Chair. Lieut. COPPINGER stated that since the last meeting, a communication had been received from the Governor, through the Adjutant-General, in answer to the application of Company E to be allowed to organize as a Zouave or Light Infantry Company of the Regiment, stating that the plan was approved of by the Commander-in-Chief, but that before it could be carried out, some modification in the Militia Law would be required, which would necessitate an application to the Legislature. At the same time, the Governor thought that the Company should obtain the approval of the Division Board to which they belonged. Lieut. COPPINGER said that the plan had been submitted to the Division Board, by whom, for certain reasons, it was not approved. Nevertheless, the thought their objection might be overcome; and as no organization could be effected until an application was made to the Legislature, all the company could do would be to go on and drill in the Light Iniantry tactics., so that by the time their new organization was effected, they would be in a great measure perfeet in the new drill. The plan proposed by some gentlemen, at the last meeting, to organize an independent Company of Zouaves was impracticable, as the law expressly forbids the organization an independent Company of Zouaves was impracticable, as the law expressly forbids the organization of independent companies. Every Regiment, however, is allowed two flank companies, of, which one might be a Light Infantry Company, and the only practicable mode would be to organize Company E into such Light Infantry Company.

He argued that the act of the Legislature clear ly provided for an assessment and award of damages accruing from a loss of the claimants' property by fire. In consequence of the burning of the Marine Hospital and other buildings. The term property was undoubtedly intended to embrace all classes of property, both real and personal, and ""damages"" was intended as a recompense for injuries sustained as specified in the act. In order to make this a recompense in the meaning of the act, it must cover the losses arising from any unwarrantable interference with the rights and property of another, which amounted to an injury. This would embrace the actual value of the property, with interest thereon from the date of its destruction until the award is made and paid. The boatmen's claim for rent was proper, as the destruction of their houses resulted In depriving them of employment, and, assuch deprivation was caused by the conflagration of the Hospital establishment, they must be indemnified. The stevedores were entitled to recover on the same principles, as their arrangement with the Health-Officer to do the stevedoring was broken up by the tame causes: and the workhouse dock was specially assigned for their use. The claim of Dr. WALLER for rent was also good, as well as that of Dr. THOMPSON, who was expressly required by law to reside within the Quarantine inclosure: he was employed for two years, and had a lease of the house for that period; this house was destroyed, and Dr. THOMPSON thus sustained damages which he had an unquestioned right to recover. As a rule the claimants should be allowed the full value of the property at the time of the fire, with interest from the date of the destruction of the property. For the injured property, the difference in its value should be allowed, which, in some cases, was sufficiently indicated by the cost of repairs; in others it had to be established by the uncontradicted statement of witnesses. Interest should also be allowed on the damages to the property saved, and, if the property was destroyed by a mob, the claimant was entitled to recover as though the property was burred; it should also cover the expenses of cartage and assistance while making provision for the family on the night of fire, with interest.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Staten Island Damages.; SUMMING UP BY THE COUNSEL FOR CLAIMANTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Staten Island Damages.; SUMMING UP BY THE COUNSEL FOR CLAIMANTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b370c668-d105-5e17-8760-608eea4ff473,413,nyt://article/b370c668-d105-5e17-8760-608eea4ff473

"EXCITING AFFAIR AT HAMILTON, OHIO -- SHOOTING OF A CITIZEN BY A JUDGE OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. -- We learn, says the Cincinnati E[???]irer, of the 4th inst. that an exciting shooting affair took place in the city of Hamilton yesterday afternoon. The history of it, with the preceding circumstances, are about as follows: A minister over one of the religious congregations of the city received several anonymous communications through the post-office, in which the author professed a desire to join his church, but did not wish to become associated with such persons ascertain ladies of his congregation. These letters were finally shown to the husband of one of the ladies, a prominent merchant, who thought he recognized the handwriting of another citizen, and subsequently charged him with being the author of the slanderous communication, and a personal encounter followed. This occurred several days ago. The fact finally came to the knowledge of one of the most prominent lawyers of Hamilton that the same anonymous calumniator had attacked his wife in the same contemptible way, and, taking means to satisfy himself of tie anthership, resolved to inflict summary punishment. While passing along the street, yesterday afternoon, in a buggy, he discovered the supposed author of the letters in a store, and, alighting from his wagon, he walked in and commenced an attack by firing at him with a revolver. The individual attacked attempted to escape, and succeeded in so far avoiding his assailant as to dodge all but one shot, which took effect in the shoulder, inflicting a severe but not a dangerous wound. The interference of other parties present put an end to the affair for the time being. Much excitement existed through out the city, all the parties to the scandal being among the most prominent and well-known citizens. For reasons which will suggest themselves, we forbear giving names, which may, perhaps, be made public through an investigation.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/08/archives/article-2-no-title.html,,"EXCITING AFFAIR AT HAMILTON, OHIO -- SHOOTING OF A CITIZEN BY A JUDGE OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS. -- We learn, says the Cincinnati E[???]irer, of the 4th inst. that an exciting shooting affair took place in the city of Hamilton yesterday afternoon.

"Prof. ROGEES, whose extremely interesting optical investigations have been already mentioned, to-day gave same fresh illustrations of the metaphysics of vision, in his paper on our inability from the Retinal Impression alone to determine which retina is impressed. Although it would seem almost necessary that the retina receiving an image should have consciousness of its place, yet there are simple experiments showing that the eye, unassisted by the Judgment from other sources, has no such power. Take a sheet of pasteboard with a short tube in the centre, and placing it in the front of the eye of a second person, adjust the tube centrally before the right eye: when he directs his view, both eyes being open, to a distant point, he will feel as if he saw the bright aperture equally with both eyes, and will be wholly unable to decide which eye is impressed. By moving the aperture a little nearer the nose, but still out of the view of the other or left eye, he will feel as if it were before his left eye, although actually invisible to it, Again, placing a white spot of paper on a black stereoscope slide, so that the spot shall be directly in front of either eye, it will appear as if seen just as much by one as by the other, and without closing one of the eyes or same other extraneous help, the observer will be wholly unable to decide before which eye it is placed. In all these cases it is not the retina that perceives, but the optical part of the brain behind the retina, and common to both eyes, in which the perception is formed. These considerations explain the experiment which forms the foundation of the instrument called the pseudo-dyoscope, lately described, and which has been erroneously supposed to illustrate same new law of vision. In fact, the principle is as old as an observation of LEONAEDO DA VINCI, that a small object entirely opaque might yet be made to appear transparent by placing it near the eyes. Holding a paper-cone with its small aperture directed forward and its base against one of the eyes, having it so supported as to rest between the thumb and hand, on directing both eyes forward to a distance, the hand will appear as if perforated through the centre, and distant objects will seem to be seen by the eye immediately behind the hand as if a hole had actually been bored through it.

Mission Church in Twenty-fourth street, between Eighth and Ninth avenues, was laid yesterday afternoon by Bishop JANES, with appropriate ceremonies. There were some two hundred persons present -- mostly ladies interested in the success of the Mission. The exercises were commenced with prayer by Dr. OSBOEN, and staging by the congregation. Dr. THOMPSON, of the Christian Advocate, delivered a brief address, after which Rev. Mr. FERRIS, pastor of the Mission Church, made a statement of the organization and progress of the Mission. It was organized about three years ago, and at that time the congregation worshiped in a little wooden church, situated near the site of the building now in progress. Last year the little church was burned down. The Mission Society, which numbers about 100 members, afterwards purchased the present site, at a coat of about $8,000, and the building now in progress of erection, would, it was estimated, cast about $6,000. The first story of the building is already tip, occupying 50 feet of front by 100 feat in depth and 11 feet in height. It is not the intention of the Trustees, at present, to raise it beyond the first story, unless $3,000 additional is subscribed to enable the work to proceed. In case that amount is not now guaranteed, a temporary roof will be constructed the floor and ceiling of the first story finished, and the congregation will worship there until the building shall have been completed. It is to be built of brick the front to be trimmed with Nova Scotia stone. When Mr. FERRIS had concluded his remarks, a collection was taken up; an address was delivered by Bishop JAMES who also laid the corner-stone, after which the congregation separated.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17616d37-4dc3-5fed-b612-d86555445626,1417,nyt://article/17616d37-4dc3-5fed-b612-d86555445626

The Coroner, anxious to show all due diligence in his first case, was promptly on hand, and took into his possession such material proofs of crime as he could obtain. Investigation was also made in all directions with a view, first to discover the ""body,"" and second to ascertain if anybody was missing. The roll was called at all the boarding-houses, and, so far as could be ascertained, every person who hadwisited the place and registered themselves, answered to their names, or had paid their bills and gone home.

"The latest advices from Europe, which reach us this morning, are singularly negative in character. This is especially true of the intelligence which comes to us from the focus of Italian revolution in Sicily. We are simply informed that the evacuation of Messina, which was last week announced as on the point of completion, has been arrested, and that GARIBALDI is suffering from a wound received at Melazzo. In the current confusion and uncertainty of news, both official and unofficial, it is hardly fair to assume that the retreat of the royal troops from Sicily must have been countermanded by the King of Naples. A vacillation of this sort would be too perilous to the hopes of the King on the mainland to be wantonly ventured upon. Whatever may be the momentary state of things in the island which has so heroically cast off the yoke of the Bourbon dynasty, the waves of popular disaffection are running too high about the very palace-gates of Caserta to permit the heir of Bomba to indulge, just at present, in any freaks of hereditary treachery beyond the Strait of Reggio. Scylla is too menacing to allow her lord to make free with Charybdis. Signor DELLA GRECA, the special Envoy of FRANCIS II. to the Court of the Tuileries, has frankly admitted to the Emperor NAPOLEON that the liberal proclamations of the King have produced the very slightest effect in calming the public mind or conciliating the good will of the nation. On the 18th of July a grand manifestation indeed took place at Naples in favor of the Bourbon sway, on the occasion of the inauguration of the National Guard. At that time everything was done to propitiate the Constitutional party. It was publicly announced that the King had sent into the country these regiments of the Royal Guard which had been guilty of anti-liberal demonstrations on the 15th. But all this produced the very slightest effect. On the very next day the leading officers of the Neapolitan Navy went in a body to the Count D'AQUILA, the Grand Admiral, to renew their oaths of fidelity to the King as a protest against the desertion to GARIDALDI of the war steamer Veloce with her crew; but they all took the oath with a reservation, to the effect that they were never to be employed in battle against any Italian power. GARIBALDI himself could hardly have quarreled with loyalty of this guarded and peculiar stamp. That the King should have accepted or even allowed its expression is a most pregnant sign of the extremity in which he finds himself. It proves that he fully appreciates the truth that his only hope for the salvation of his dynasty lies in an alliance of policy and principle with Sardinia. This hope itself is apparently growing more shadowy every day.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/09/archives/naples-and-sicily.html,,"The latest advices from Europe, which reach us this morning, are singularly negative in character.

"Dr. NEWBXERY (""On the late extinct floras of North America"") gave a sketch of the succession of different floras on the North American continent, remarking that the Devonian and Carboniferous floras had been carefully, studied and characterized by the prevalence of eyptogamous plants, as ferns, &c, and that the floras of America during these ages was strikingly like that of Europe of the same epoch. The Permian flora was scarcely known in this country; it was but a continuation of the carboniferous. He observed that the Triassic and Jurassic floras were characterized by the prevalence of numerous and beautiful Cycadaceous plants, which had been studied and beautifully illustrated by European fossil botanists, but had hitherto been very little known in this country. ""Recently he had procured a large number of fossil plants of this age from New-Mexico and elsewhere, which had shown that, as in Europe, the flora of America, during the period of deposition of the New Red Sandstone, was cycadaceous in character and similar to that of Europe. At the commencement of the cretacious era, however, the flora of the continent was revolutionized, and apparently suddenly, though doubtless gradually. The broad-leaved dicotyledonous plants were introduced, and the vegetation of the continent assumed the general aspect which it has at the present day. Among the cretaceous plants are found species of Liriodendron, (tulip tree,) Liquid-amber, (sweet gum,) Sassifras, etc, etc. -- genera now living in our forests, of which the first two existed on the continent of Europe during the tertiary ages, but are not now known there: Dr. NEWBXERY concluded by saying that the aspects of nature, as far as vegetation is concerned, on our continent, are of an antique type, and that the plants, as was the case with many of the fishes, were old-fashioned forms.

"In opening the question it was remarked by Prof. PUGH (""Investigations on the Assimilation of Gaseous Nitrogen of Plants,"") that there are two sources whence plants might be supposed to derive a nitrogen either from combined nitrogen in its varied forms or from the gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/09/archives/nitrogen-in-plants.html,,"In opening the question it was remarked by Prof. PUGH (""Investigations on the Assimilation of Gaseous Nitrogen of Plants,"") that there are two sources whence plants might be supposed to derive a nitrogen -- either from combined nitrogen in its varied forms or from the gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere. It has long been admitted that plants can derive this element from the former source; the present investigation was to discover whether or not they can obtain it from the latter. This question derives a practical importance from the fact that in agricultural practice one of the most expensive elements in manures is nitrogen, and the question arises as to how far supplies may be drawn from the nitrogen of the atmosphere. The question, further, has a high theoretic importance due to the fact that no vegetable growth can take place without the presence of combined nitrogen, this being an indispensible element in cell-formation. This question has occupied the attention of chemists and vegetable physiologists from the time of INJENHOUSE, PRIESTLEY and DE SAUESSURE, who about 100 years ago, investigated this subject with discrepant results. More recently BOUSINGAUNT DRAPEE, of New-York, and Mr. GEORGE VILLE have in like manner devoted considerable time to this question, though the conclusions they have arrived at are diametrically opposed to each other. In this question two general modes of investigation suggest themselves: one in which the air in which the plant grows is analysed at successive periods of its growth in order to ascertain whether the quantity of nitrogen contained undergoes any change, which change must have been due to the assimilation of nitrogen to the plant; the other, by examining the plant itself at different periods of its growth, to ascertain whether the quantity of nitrogen it contained has changed. BOUSSIXGAULT and VILLE followed the latter method, the one getting results proving that plants can assimilate nitrogen, and the other that they can not. Indeed, the results were of such a character as to reduce themselves to a question concerning the moral character of the respective investigators. On chemical principles they were irreconcilable. The speaker had no doubt of the conscientious accuracy with which BOUSSINDGAULT had given his results (leaving the audience to make an inference no favorable to the character of the other gentleman, Mr. PUGH undertook an elaborate series of investigations, extending over three years, and of which he now gave the results. And the speaker could no omit the opportunity of stating that all the expenses, amounting $6,000, had been generously met by Mr. LAWES, of Rothamsted, England. With out going into details touching the means he had employed details touching the means he had employed to avoid error, enough to say that no assimilation of gaseous nitrogen was found to take place -- a result coinciding with that arrived at by BOUSSINGAULT. The experiments had been conducted with the chief cereals -- wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, buckwheat, clover and tobacco. In regard to all but the leguminous plants, there was no doubt as to the above result With the latter, the experiments were less decided in consequence of their not having given results so satisfactory as in the case of the otters.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NITROGEN IN PLANTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NITROGEN IN PLANTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad7229a0-7781-5b9c-ac52-d9cf581495f3,534,nyt://article/ad7229a0-7781-5b9c-ac52-d9cf581495f3

It will be remembered, by those interested, that at the meeting of the Association in March last resolutions were adopted unanimously recommending, in consequence of the flooded state of the market, 'a curtailment of thirty-five per cent, in the manufacture of sole-leather. The members had just ceased to manufacture the article, when the Western tanners exported it in abundance to New-York -- perpetuating the over-stock which the Association intended to reduce. The efforts of the Association, however, to equalize the stock were only partially paralyzed by the action of outside tanners.

This intellignece, interesting as it is to scientific men, will doubtless at this time interest a large portion of the general public here, on account of the recent appearance of a most magnificent meteor. The cosmical origin of meteors and meteorites first recognized, by the celebrated CHLADNI, and so brilliantly confirmed by our own Prof. OLMSTED, is now generally admitted. Comets are as generally admitted to consist of a loose transparent mass of solid particles (based on ob served absence of light-refracting power,) and to be cosmical bodies that must be considered still in a state of development. And REICHENBACH'S theory simply and beautifully explains the connection between the two phenomena, as follows: Most meteorites -- R. has made a collection of 150 different specimens -- can be proved to be an aggregate of distinct particles, inclosed in a dark mass or stroma. Each particle is, as it were, an independent individual, and existed before the en closing mass did: being an older meteorite inside of a younger, like a fossil shell in chalk. If we conceive a space as large as the comet's tail, originally filled with a gaseous substance, in which the atoms of these particles were suspended; and if we furthermore conceive a tendency in these atoms to precipitate and crystalize, -- it is clear that this process, going on at innumerable points at the same time, milliards of crystals will form: each not much larger than the original atoms, be cause the matter is taken up synchronously by all neighboring crystals. These crystals being an easily moved mass from the 'tail' of the comet, and by friction and pressure among themselves, from the various motions observed in comets, they become at last those particles which still show traces of crystalline laminated structure. Unequal distribution of the different elements and the action of their forces will produce at some points denser aggregation than at all others, and from this results the phenomenon of one or more 'heads' or nuclei. The process of condensation may continue, and the nucleus, at the expense of the tail, may thus become enlarged and finally consolidated, as shown in the compact masses of the meteorites,"" ""Thus is the comet the building material of the meteorite; but a meteorite is a small planet, the destination of which is to unite with a larger planet, to advance by one step the world's process of increase. Thus do we arrive from atoms of matter, isolated in the universe to smallest crystals, to the cometary tail, to the nucleus of the comet, to the meteorite, and to the planet upon which we walk.""",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NEW THEORY OF THE FORMATION OF COMETS AND METEORITES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NEW THEORY OF THE FORMATION OF COMETS AND METEORITES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ebc1842b-dee9-5dcf-b606-d5d7bb96c63a,488,nyt://article/ebc1842b-dee9-5dcf-b606-d5d7bb96c63a

From the information so far obtained, it appears that the parents of deceased reside at No.159 West Eleventh-Street, and the child being supposed to need medical attention, Dr. BUCK, of Grand-Street, physician to the family, was sent for. He, however, was out of town and having arranged with Dr. ALLEN to attend his patients, that gentleman called to see the babe, and prescribed for it a mixture containing two grains of opium, with direction to administer it in four doses, The father of the child procured the medicine from a druggist at No. 163 Avenue-A, who remarked, upon being informed that it was intended for a child, that the quantity was much too large, and seemed reluctant to make up the prescription. He finally, however, handed it to Mr. FOSTER, but the latter having been alarmed at the hesitation of the druggist to give him the medicine, determined to administer to the infant only one-half of the quantity which the physician had directed. Soon after having done so, the child was thrown into convulsions and died. Dr. ALLEN was summoned before its death, and it is said that he remarked that the little sufferer was under the effects of poison, and that there had been no necessity to give it medicine at all, but that he had ordered the prescription to satisfy its mother. The quantity of opium thus prescribed is said to have been sufficient for an adult, and Dr. ALLEN will be called upon to explain his reasons for making an error which has resulted so sadly. On account of the necessary absence of a member of the jury, Coroner GAMBLE has adjourned the inquest for a few days. Dr. WOOSTER BEACH, J[???]., made an examination of the body of the infant, but failed to discover any disease sufficient to have caused its death.

"FUNERAL OF MRS. GARDINER SPRING. -- On Sunday last the venerable pastor of the ""Old Brick church"" preached the semi-centennial sermon of his ministry in this City. It was an occasion worthy of commemoration and the surviving friends of the Rev. Doctor -- those who were youths with him, (very few they were,) those who knew him in early manhood, those who, in successive years, have attended his (church -- were gathered together on that occasion. It was known then that his esteemed wife was sick, and that, being advanced in years, her health might never again thoroughly be restored; but it was not anticipated that the end was so near. The sermon was preached on Sunday -- on Tuesday she died. The funeral solemnities took place yesterday afternoon, at the Fifth-avenue Brick Church -- the same edifice in which the semi-centennial sermon had been preached four days before. Of course, it was filled with mourners. The preliminary services were held at Dr. SPRING's house, in Thirty-seventh-street, after which the body was borne to the Church -- Messrs. Horace Holden, Shepherd Knapp, Abner L. Ely, Thomas Egleston, Moses Allen, Peter Naylor, Guy Richards, Jasper Corning, Samuel Marsh and Daniel Lord acting as pall-bearers. Dr. SPRING followed the corpse, reported by his four sons. Dr. HOGE commenced the services by reading the fifth Chapter of Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians. After the singing of a [???]mn, Rev.

GARDINER SPRING. -- On Sunday last the venerable pastor of the ""Old Brick church"" preached the semi-centennial sermon of his ministry in this City. It was an occasion worthy of commemoration and the surviving friends of the Rev. Doctor -- those who were youths with him, (very few they were,) those who knew him in early manhood, those who, in successive years, have attended his (church -- were gathered together on that occasion. It was known then that his esteemed wife was sick, and that, being advanced in years, her health might never again thoroughly be restored; but it was not anticipated that the end was so near. The sermon was preached on Sunday -- on Tuesday she died. The funeral solemnities took place yesterday afternoon, at the Fifth-avenue Brick Church -- the same edifice in which the semi-centennial sermon had been preached four days before. Of course, it was filled with mourners. The preliminary services were held at Dr. SPRING's house, in Thirty-seventh-street, after which the body was borne to the Church -- Messrs. Horace Holden, Shepherd Knapp, Abner L. Ely, Thomas Egleston, Moses Allen, Peter Naylor, Guy Richards, Jasper Corning, Samuel Marsh and Daniel Lord acting as pall-bearers. Dr. SPRING followed the corpse, reported by his four sons. Dr. HOGE commenced the services by reading the fifth Chapter of Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians. After the singing of a [???]mn, Rev. Mr. PHILLIPS invoked the Divine blessing, and Dr. HOGS followed in a touching address, a binding with, eloquent earnestness to the merits of the deceased end her honored husband.

"On Wednesday afternoon, the Atlantic ground, corner of Marcy and Gates avenues, Brooklyn, was the scene of the greatest gathering that has yet appeared on a ball ground, excelling in numbers even the great assemblage on the Excelsior ground on the occasion of the former match between these two Clubs. The ground was completely inclosed by a wall of human beings; this was well lined on the inside with ladies, and strongly entrenched without by numerous vehicles crammed to overflowing. Hundreds of representatives of the Clubs of cities and villages far and near, -- from Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Troy, Newark, Elizabeth, Rahway, Boston, etc., were on the ground, and altogether the scene was one of unwonted excitement. The friends of both parties were out in full force, and any success on either side was greeted with loud applause, the Atlantic throats being in the ascendancy. During the first three innings the Excelsior play was very fine, the Atlantic's not scoring a run, but in the fourth innings they played quite loosely, and the Atlantics succeeded in scoring two runs, Leggett permitting two or three balls to pass. Up to this point the Atlantics fielding was very unsteady and the throwing quite wild, P. O'Brien letting several balls pass by him without stopping them, and Hawkshurst missing an easy chance on the bound. They profited, however, by a mistake on the part of the Excelsiors, for some outsider calling out foul for a ball struck fair, deceived and became the means of putting out two of their players. In the first innings Smith made a very fine fly catch from a staver sent by Brainerd to the third base. In the Atlantics sixth innings Joe Oliver distinguished himself by a splendid hit past second base, on which he made his third. John Oliver was put out by a fine stop, and thrown by Whiting from the third to Pearsall at the first. In the Excelsiors sixth, Smith made a wild throw to the first base, sending Creighton, but a good bound catch by M. O'Brien and two neat plays by Jno. Oliver and McMahon left him there and the Excelsiors without a run, amid great cheering. In the next innings of the Atlantics their batting was very powerful and safe, and the outside excitement was most intense, McMahon sending two men home and making his second on a strike to left field, and P. O'Brien also making his second on a similar strike. Jno. Oliver struck a splendid ball over the left fielder, on which he made his third; this was the best hit of the game. Price was caught in the left field by Russell, acknowledgedly one of the most beautiful catches ever witnessed on a ball ground. A miss on the fly by Brainerd and a ball passing the catcher gave Pierce, a run. The innings was one of the finest on both sides that has occurred at any time, the batting bordering on the terrific, and the throwing of the Excelsiors being splendid.

In the corresponding Excelsior innings, Joe Oliver made a very pretty bound catch at left field, disposing of Whiting.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/10/archives/base-ball-great-match-between-the-atlantic-and-excelsior-clubs-of.html,,"On Wednesday afternoon, the Atlantic ground, corner of Marcy and Gates avenues, Brooklyn, was the scene of the greatest gathering that has yet appeared on a ball ground, excelling in numbers even the great assemblage on the Excelsior ground on the occasion of the former match between these two Clubs. The ground was completely inclosed by a wall of human beings; this was well lined on the inside with ladies, and strongly entrenched without by numerous vehicles crammed to overflowing. Hundreds of representatives of the Clubs of cities and villages far and near, -- from Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Troy, Newark, Elizabeth, Rahway, Boston, etc., were on the ground, and altogether the scene was one of unwonted excitement. The friends of both parties were out in full force, and any success on either side was greeted with loud applause, the Atlantic throats being in the ascendancy. During the first three innings the Excelsior play was very fine, the Atlantic's not scoring a run, but in the fourth innings they played quite loosely, and the Atlantics succeeded in scoring two runs, Leggett permitting two or three balls to pass. Up to this point the Atlantics fielding was very unsteady and the throwing quite wild, P. O'Brien letting several balls pass by him without stopping them, and Hawkshurst missing an easy chance on the bound. They profited, however, by a mistake on the part of the Excelsiors, for some outsider calling out foul for a ball struck fair, deceived and became the means of putting out two of their players. In the first innings Smith made a very fine fly catch from a staver sent by Brainerd to the third base. In the Atlantics sixth innings Joe Oliver distinguished himself by a splendid hit past second base, on which he made his third. John Oliver was put out by a fine stop, and thrown by Whiting from the third to Pearsall at the first. In the Excelsiors sixth, Smith made a wild throw to the first base, sending Creighton, but a good bound catch by M. O'Brien and two neat plays by Jno. Oliver and McMahon left him there and the Excelsiors without a run, amid great cheering. In the next innings of the Atlantics their batting was very powerful and safe, and the outside excitement was most intense, McMahon sending two men home and making his second on a strike to left field, and P. O'Brien also making his second on a similar strike. Jno. Oliver struck a splendid ball over the left fielder, on which he made his third; this was the best hit of the game. Price was caught in the left field by Russell, acknowledgedly one of the most beautiful catches ever witnessed on a ball ground. A miss on the fly by Brainerd and a ball passing the catcher gave Pierce, a run. The innings was one of the finest on both sides that has occurred at any time, the batting bordering on the terrific, and the throwing of the Excelsiors being splendid. The Excelsior seventh was marked by a good fly catch by Smith; a good hit to the centre field, which took Leggett to his second, but was left there by a tip from Holder's bat, which ended operations.

MILNES asked the Home Secretary what measures had been taken to bring about a Convention with the Government of the United States to remedy the impunity with which crimes are committed on board vessels trading between the United States and this country, and called the attention of the House to some recent circumstances bearing on the question. It would be recollected that last year he called attention to the horrible atrocities committed on board American vessels trading between England and the United States, the perpetrators of which atrocities, in consequence of the defective state of the law, were able to escape with entire impunity. At that time the Foreign Minister undertook to do everything in his power to remedy that great evil, but the noble Lord, at the beginning of the present session, informed the House that he had handed the matter over to the Home Secretary, considering the question to be one of domestic legislation. Since that period the House had not heard one word of the matter, although the atrocities were still frequently committed. A sailor lately died in a hospital in Liverpool in consequence of injuries received on board the Ocean Monarch. An inquest was held upon his body, and the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against the second and third mates; but these men escaped under the Extradition Treaty during the inquest, and were now free from the consequences of their brutality. What rendered the case worse was that the parties in question were the same men who, three years ago, were found guilty of manslaughter on board a ship bearing the pacific name of John Bright. [A laugh.] It seemed that the crime of manslaughter did not come within the terms of the Extradition Treaty. If this sort of proceeding was to go on, he asked what quantum of murder would be sufficient to induce the Government of this country and of the United States to put a stop to such transactions? Was the great Atlantic to be a place where every kind of outrage might be committed with impunity, and did not the Government of this country and the Government of the United States see that as regards two civilized nations such a state of things was a great calamity and opprobrium to humanity?",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cruelty on Board American Ships.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cruelty on Board American Ships.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ec80e90-b092-5bd9-81c5-18a799b9ba7a,443,nyt://article/1ec80e90-b092-5bd9-81c5-18a799b9ba7a

In England very large sums of money have been raised for the cause of freedom in Italy, and the greatest enthusiasm for GARIBALDI prevails among the people, Not content with a general fund, the people have expressed a desire to have boxes placed in situations of public resort so that all may contribute their mite. This has been done recently in London, Liverpool, Manchester, and other large towns. There are also in the large towns Committees of ""the Ladies' Garibaldi Benevolent Association"" to whom subscriptions are forwarded. The object of this Association is not to supply munitions of war to GARIBALDI, but to furnish aid to the poor fellows who are lying in hospital and to the families who have suffered from the barbarities committed at Palermo and elsewhere by the Neapolitan troops. We trust and believe that in the United States there will be an equal amount of practical sympathy shown for the cause of freedom in Italy; and at the present time it is only necessary to organize a movement, similar to any of those already organized in England, to insure the contribution of very material aid from America to GARIBALDI and his noble compatriots.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22941deb-8118-57d9-a8f7-0520d1aa6edd,1080,nyt://article/22941deb-8118-57d9-a8f7-0520d1aa6edd

HAMILTON, of Texas, spoke at Austin on the 26th. After discussing local topics at some length, he turned to the consideration of the political issues involved in the present canvass. Mr. BRECKINRIDGE he called the candidate of the Democratic Secessionists. Mr. DOUGLAS, on the other hand, was the nominee of the National Democracy. He had not changed his position since 1850, and was the only reliable Union man before the people. Mr. HAMILTON's next choice was Gen. HOUSTON, and his third Col. BELL. If compelled to choose between LINCOLN and BRECKINRIDGE he would reluctantly support the later. He spoke at length regarding the secession influences by which Mr. BRECKINRIDGE was surrounded, and denounced Mr. YANCEY and the members of the Constitutional Contention, whom he styled his followers, in the severest terms. ""Whom the gods love,"" as the proverb goes, ""die young."" Mr. BRECKINRIDGE was young, and he considered him politically dead. Mr. HAMILTON said, further, that he would not give his own chances for the Presidency for those of BRECKINRIDGE. He might, when he was very dry, dispose of them for a glass of lager, but he would not exchange even with BRECKINRIDGE; he would rather start like old SAM HOUSTON, ""go it alone and get eucred."" He ridiculed Gen. LANE as an ignorant and illiterate man, one who had fought well for his country, and deserved well in an humble way; but he was so very ignorant that he would venture the assertion that unless he had been drilled since his nomination, he could not mention the names of half a dozen Governments existing at the present time, outside of the limits of the United States. Mr. HAMILTON concluded by denouncing all who were not in favor of submission to the election of LINCOLN, or any other man elected with the necessary constitutional majority, and declared it they should go about with halters in their hands for those who were in favor of submitting to the constitutional authorities of the land, that they themselves would furnish both the victims and the halter. He also advocated a coalition, by means of one Electoral ticket, of the friends of DOUGLAS, HOUSTON and BELL, and said that with the conservative element which would thus be united against the Secession candidate, there could be no doubt that Texas would give twenty thousand majority against BRECKINRIDGE, and that he was willing to meet the champion of Secession upon any of these issues.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Political Miscellany.; SPEECH BY HON.

To these questions Dr. GUNN replies, first, that the utmost vigilance is exercised to ascertain the sanitary condition of all such vessels, and, when necessary, the most rigid quarantine measures are enforced. Second, that vessels arriving from ports where malignant, contagious or infectious diseases are known to prevail are quarantined. Ship fever, small-pox and cholera generally occur in emigrant passenger ships from European ports. Third, he has a hospital ship well equipped for the treatment of yellow-fever patients, where the disease can be as successfully treated as on land. Cases of small-pox are treated on Blackwell's Island, and the vessels on which such cases arrive are detained at Quarantine until they are fumigated and well cleansed.

In the effect of this menace the Mercury places its last hope of defeating the Republican candidate. Southern Pro-Slavery Democrats evidently take the same view of the case, and are trying to act upon it. They have planned a regular political campaign, based on making the North believe that Disunion will follow LINCOLN's election. A Committee has been appointed to catechise Southern members of Congress, and elicit from them letters in favor of dissolution. First came KEITT's ferocious manifesto -- full of sound and fury, written in the Ercles vein and proclaiming the instant secession of South Carolina in case LINCOLN should be elected. It was the first gun in the general bombardment, -- but it scared nobody but the poor old woman who edits the Herald, and whose nerves have been for a long time so shattered that the noise of a pop-gun gives her spasms. Everybody else laughed -- and there it ended. Next came Speaker ORR's pronunciamiento, in which the menace was slightly modified. He was in favor of secession, -- quite as much so as Col. KEITT, -- but he was more judicious: -- he was opposed to South Carolina's going out alone: -- when she could get four or five States to keep her in countenance, then he waa in favor of her departure, -- but not before. This, so far as it goes, is sensible, -- and everybody saw at once that, if the Union lasted until Mr. ORR could get everything comfortably arranged for its dissolution, the peril of that event was not immediate. Mr. BOYCE is the next customer: and his fulmination will be found in full in another column.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'More Disunion Nonsense.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'More Disunion Nonsense.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fa39c240-b4f7-518b-aa08-1a2394817e35,1043,nyt://article/fa39c240-b4f7-518b-aa08-1a2394817e35

In Indianapolis, since the Breckinridge Convention, CHARLES COULON, the most prominent German Democrat in the city, and one of the marshals at the Douglas Convention of the 18th, has declared his intention to support LINCOLN. Following in his wake, and influenced by the same reasons, (the impossibility of electing DOUGLAS, and their preference for LINCOLN next,) twelve other active German Democrats have marched into the Republican camp. In, the Fourth District, many recruits, mainly from the German Democracy, are reported -- no less than fifty in one township of Ripley County, being of the number. Though heretofore esteemed nearly hopeless, the most sagacious Republicans begin to feel that the Fourth District will be redeemed this Fall. In Wabash County, the Plaindealer, the leading Douglas paper of the Eleventh District, has hauled down the Douglas flag, and run up that of LINCOLN, assigning as a reason that, with the Wickliffe resolutions as his platform, DOUGLAS is only a Northern man with Southern principles; while BRECKINRIDGE is a Southern man with Southern principles; BELL is a Southern man with no principles; and LINCOLN is a Northern man with the nearest approach to national principles of all of them. A very satisfactory reason. Nearly all the candidates -- State, Congressional and county -- are now busily engaged in the canvass. Every local paper is full of reports of 'enthusiastic rallies' that have been, or of appointments for those to be. Though by no means up to the mark of 1856, yet the enthusiasm is visibly and rapidly rising. Big meetings are becoming common, and crowds of 5,000 and 10,000 have been addressed by leading speakers at least ten times in the last two weeks. Up in the Ninth District COLFAX is having a perfect ovation at every appointment. Even the township meetings he is holding in the 'outermost parts' of Miami and Cass show crowds of 1,000 and more.""",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Political Miscellany.; PROSPECTS BRIGHTENING IN INDIANA.

Mr. IRVINE gives a tabular statement of the revenue and expenditure of the fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1859, and of the commerce and navigation of the United States for the same period, drawn from the official report of the Treasury Department, and a brief statistical view of American manufactures, compiled from the digest made in 1858, of the returns of the census of 1850, and presented to the Senate. As Mr. IRVINE makes no comment on these statistics, there is nothing original in the portion of his report which relates to them; but his remarks on the agriculture of the United States are interesting, both because the subjects which he notices have recently engaged the attention of the Patent Office at Washington, and for the important bearing which they have on the export trade of the country. After noticing the variety and productiveness of our soil, and stating, as an instance of the latter quality, that in Ohio an acre of land planted with vines, will, in a favorable year, produce two hundred and fifty gallons of wine, whereas the best vineyards in the Bordeaux district, of France, do not furnish more than one hundred and twenty-six gallons per acre, Mr. IRVINE remarks upon the low state of agriculture among us, and the consequent disparity between the produce of the soil on the one hand, and the extent of the land and number of the population on the other. ""The immense extent of territory,"" he observes, ""and the comparative scantiness of the population, have induced a good deal of carelessness in the cultivation of the soil. The price of land being low, the proprietors have found it more economical to work out their land than to expend their capital in manures and other means for preserving its productive qualities; and when the soil has become exhausted, the owners have left it for some new settlement. The consequence of this has been that, instead of full and abundant crops, in many parts of the older settled portions of the country, the fields do not yield at present half as much as formerly, and in many localities not a third, nor even a quarter, as much; and that, notwithstanding the advantages of climate, the facility of transport to available markets, and the lightly taxed condition of farmers and planters, the ratio of increase in the agricultural products of the United States is not in proportion to the increase of population.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An English Diplomatist on American Agriculture.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An English Diplomatist on American Agriculture.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d97f297-f30f-5c24-a526-7671216e3e09,775,nyt://article/4d97f297-f30f-5c24-a526-7671216e3e09

Its path was over two miles wide, and was in nearly a straight line from Walworth to about the centre of the town of Sodus, when it suddenly turned toward Lake Ontario, which it probably struck not far from Sodus Point. Our informant came from Sodus village yesterday, and tells us that the south part of that town presents the most frightful spectacle he ever witnessed. Extensive tracts of woodland were leveled with the ground, and large orchards completely uprooted. Scarcely a rod of fence is left standing throughout the whole district over which the whirlwind passed. In some cases fence-rails were carried more than thirty rods by the terrific force of the wind. Trees more than two feet in diameter were twisted into splinters. We have not yet heard of any lives being destroyed, but it will be a marvel if there be none.

The regular overseer had been temporarily superseded by one SNOW, a man of energy and determination. He had long been accustomed to exact implicit obedience from the sailors whom he had formerly commanded as mate, and did not change his system of discipline on the Island. The negroes, who were principally English and Danish, and were obtained from the neighboring islands of the West Indies belonging to those nations, and were consequently always hostile to Americans, on account of the latter's slavery proclivities, grew dissatisfied with the management of their new superintendent and meditated every variety of revenge. Only four of them, however, seemed to have brought their designs to a concerted measure, and on the 24th of July, one of them was delegated to murder him, while the others were near to see that it was effectively done. They were engaged in loading a car, on this day, and the chosen murderer being on the top of it, took advantage of the foreman as he was stooping on the ground below, and hurled a tremendous lump of guano at his head, crushed his skull with the blow, and left him for dead on the ground. Considerable commotion followed among the whites upon the discovery of the attempted murder, and the negro who committed the deed was immediately attested by Capt. BURNELL, of the Emma Tuttle, and ""Capt. BENTHALL of the bark Warren, of Baltimore, placed in irons and conveyed on board the latter vessel. It was their determination to take him into a United States port for trial. The arrest created the wildest excitement among the negroes, who rose en masse, and took possession of the island. The white employes, who numbered only twelve, were compelled to submit to the revolt, but were unharmed, since they remained non-committal, being too much intimidated to attempt to suppress the rage of 200 half-savage negroes, and at the same time afraid to join with them against the vessel, knowing that punishment was sure to follow from the United States authorities as soon as intelligence should have been conveyed to the nearest American port. The negroes threatened to sink the two vessels if their comrade was not given up; and when Capt. BENTHALL attempted to return to shore from the Warren they collected on the wharf and stoned him until he was forced to take refuge back upon his bark. Capt. BURNELL got ashore safely, but was met with savage demonstrations from the insurgents, who were armed in their right hands with huge clubs, and in their left with heavy blocks of guano. He with difficulty made his way through them, and was compelled to surrender all the English money he had in his possession, to appease them sufficiently to admit of his escape from their murderous clubs. Getting safely into the office of the agent, Mr. ELLIOTT, who is owner of a large interest in the island, and is well known in this city, he succeeded in making ready for his departure next day, having already taken his road for this city, and of returning unharmed to his vessel. Mr. ELLIOTT expected in the course of a few days fifty Irish hands from Richmond, with as many revolvers and other instruments of government and civilization, through means of which he would be able to subdue the revolters, and effectually prevent any further outrages, should it be his good fortune to escape their fury until that time.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Negro Insurrection on a Guano Island.; AN OVERSKER EATALLY INJURED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Negro Insurrection on a Guano Island.; AN OVERSKER EATALLY INJURED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87bfe66e-16c1-573a-ae32-45789c2bac5a,704,nyt://article/87bfe66e-16c1-573a-ae32-45789c2bac5a

The body of Mr. RATZ was brought to this City last evening by the steamboat Long Branch, and taken to his late residence, the Philadelphia Hotel, in the Bowery, of which he was the proprietor. Mr. RATZ was only twenty-seven years old. He was a native of Germany, and came to this country very young. For several years he was the Secretary of Commodore PERRY, and at one time was clerk in the office of Mr. AUGUSTE BELMONT. He was a member of the Seventh Regiment, as also of the Free Masons. Arrangements for his funeral will be made to-day. The young man GARDNER lived in Buffalo, and was on a visit to this City.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f4fdbd5-9003-5590-9533-bb1be5d24cf2,1185,nyt://article/9f4fdbd5-9003-5590-9533-bb1be5d24cf2

The cars are new and comfortable, the engines whirl their attendant trains along at quite a respectable rate of speed, the sleepers lie quietly in their beds, and the conductors generally conduct themselves in a proper manner. The necessity for these appliances to increase the popularity of a railroad may be seen at a glance, but the necessity for constructing ex-tempore guillotines along the line is not so easily to be perceived. At one station of the Camden and Amboy road, however, -- Rahway, we think -- a line of posts is placed so ingeniously near to the passing train that the inadvertent protrusion of a head or an arm would produce as complete a decapitation or amputation as could be obtained in a College of Surgeons. The Company have sagaciously distributed notices through their cars, warning passengers of the danger of standing on platforms, looking out of windows, &c.; -- this is all very well as far as it goes, but a goodly proportion of those that travel are, unfortunately, unable to read. Children are proverbially thoughtless, and many adults are constitutionally careless. Safety demands that the line of posts referred to be either uprooted permanently, or else removed to a respectable distance from the passing trains. Unless this suggestion is complied with the Camden and Amboy Railroad may some day find a ""dead head"" on the train unprovided with a pass from the proper authorities.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Minor Topics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Minor Topics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b2f908da-dd37-5ab4-ac62-00d22b759926,554,nyt://article/b2f908da-dd37-5ab4-ac62-00d22b759926

He alluded in one place to the lazy Christian who pinned his devotions to the bed-post, and said to the Lord 'them's my sentiments;' and in another place told the story of the inconstant teetotaler who broke the pledge in hot weather, after signing it repeatedly, and excused himself by saying that all signs failed in a dry season.

This Committee consisted of Lieut.-Gov. TRASK, Hon. JACOB SLEEPER and Hon. J.M. CHURCHILL. They have investigated the matter, and yesterday submitted their report, which we publish in full below, and by which it will be seen that the charges are sustained -- to this extent -- that boys 17 or 18 years of age have been kept confined in dark, impure cells -- ""black holes"" the Committee term them -- from eight to sixteen weeks, a portion of the time with their hands manacled behind them and with no food but bread and water. There were three cases which came directly before the Committee, but in their investigations they found that others -- the Superintendent admits to the number of twenty -- had been similarly punished for terms ranging from one month downward. The Committee seem to imply that the number may have been larger than that, and there was some evidence to show that in some cases the punishment had been extended as long as sixteen weeks. The Committee blame the Superintendent, WM. E. STARR, for this state of things, and also say that the Trustees are scarcely less culpable than their servants, and have been wanting in a proper discharge of important public trusts. They recommend an immediate and thorough reorganization of the government of the institution. The report was unanimously accepted. It is proper to remark that the Superintendent is chosen by the Trustees, who are appointed by the Governor and Council. The present Trustees are Parley Hammond, Simon Brown, Thomas A.

The evidence to this effect is so palpable that either blindness or obstinacy must account for his final perseverance; and neither of those qualities, even in the eyes of a supporter of the actual administration, is desirable in an occupant of the Presidential office.

Journal, of the 8th inst., were started, last Monday morning by the report of a double murder, commited Some five miles south west of town. A number of persons immediately repaired to the spot, when the following facts were disclosed. The deed was committed in the house-yard of Mr. MEGGINSON, a farmer who lives between this town and Lynnville. Mrs. MEGGINSON was waked from her sleep about 1 o'clock on Monday morning, by the cry of ""Murder, murder!"" She immediately sprang to her window, and looking out saw in the yard, and about thirty feet from the house, a man stamping the head of a woman with his heels. Mr. MEGGINSON and his son ran out, and on approaching the man he ran into a patch of corn. They began to turn their attention to the woman, when he came out of the corn again, and armed with a large club with which he seemed about to assail them. On this Mr. MEGGINSON urged his dog upon the fellow, and the dog having laid hold of his leg, gave Mr. MEGGINSON opportunity of hitting him across the back of the head and felling him to the ground. The son now held him till the father procured a rope with which he was effectually tied. Having thus disposed of him, they took the woman up and carried her into the house, supposing her to be badly injured but still alive. On striking a light, she was found to be dead. Her eyes were protruding from their sockets, her cheeks were cut open and her jaws broken, her tongue hanging nerveless from her mouth, presenting a most appalling spectacle. To make she tragedy still more dreadful, a little boy was found in the yard, about four years old, his face dreadfully mangled with blows from the same instrument which tad Killed his mother. He was taken into the house, and although perfectly insensible, he may possibly recover from the shock and live. The murder was perpetrated with a thin oak clapboard. The wretch struck the woman with the sharp edge of it, every blow sinking into her flesh to the bone. The board was brought to town, and left in Mr. C. DALTON's office. It bears abundant evidence of the diabolical was to which it was put. It was stained with blood. It appears, from papers found on the person of the murderer, that his name is MICHAEL REDMAN, an Irishman by birth. He was seen in Lynnville on Sunday last, where, with his wife and child, he bagged some food, with which certain persons there amply provided him. He left Lynnville, as he said, to go to JACOB STRAWN's, he having worked for Mr. STRAWN some ten years ago. The murder was committed some few miles West of STRAWN's. As the house Mr. MEGGINSON is some distance from the road, it is thought that the crime was committed in his yard in the expectation of throwing suspicion upon him, or at least vailing it in impenetrable mystery. The man acknowledged that he committed the murder, and says that he intended to kill them both. He says ""she was not very smart, and was in his way."" Mr. MEGGINSON says that there was no smell of liquor upon him, and that an empty bottle which was found in his carpet bag ""had no smell of whisky about it."" The wretch does not seem to be crazy at all. The deed was seemingly prompted by a desire to rid himself of the burden of supporting his wife and child. There was some talk upon the streets of Synching him upon the spot, and some suggested even after he was put in jail that he should be taken out and hung; happily, setter counsels prevailed, and he ^will have to suffer the penalty of the law.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Man Kills His Wife and Attempts to Kill his Son.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Man Kills His Wife and Attempts to Kill his Son.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62b8b39a-e1c3-538b-8223-ca17afcdada8,648,nyt://article/62b8b39a-e1c3-538b-8223-ca17afcdada8

It seems that Mary, who is pleasant looking Irish girl, about 17 years of age, some two months ago engaged herself in the family of a respectable resident of Rye, as a domestic. She soon made the acquaintance of deceased and received an offer of marriage from him. His suit, however, she rejected, on the ground of his intemperate habits, and the match was also opposed by his friends. Subsequently Jacob Chatham, another young man, offered himself as a candidate for the girl's hand, and was accepted. After Nichols learned this fact he became very jealous of Chatham and is said to have availed himself of every opportunity to annoy both him and the young woman. At the time of his disappearance, having learned that the young couple had gone out in a small boat for a pleasure excursion on the Sound, he procured a skill and went in pursuit of them. He was never seen alive again, and a few days since his body was found in the water so much decomposed, however, as to make it difficult to decide whether his death had resulted from violence or from drowning. The friends of Nichols had their suspicions excited against Chatham and Mary as being in some way cognizant of his death, and these were heightened by the fact that the young woman, immediately after her return from the excursion, left Rye for this City, where she has since been living with her mother, Accordingly, a day or two subsequent to her arrival; here, some of them followed her and represented the affair to Inspector Carpenter, who sent for the young woman and questioned her as to her knowledge of the matter. She denied that she had seen anything of Nichols after going into the boat, and her manner seemed so truthful, that all who heard the examination became convinced of her innocence, particularly as her story coincided with that given by Chatham. Since the remains of Nichols have been discovered, however, a thorough investigation of the circumstances attending his death has been determined upon by the Coroner of Westchester County, and a warrant having been issued for the arrest of the young woman, Detective Bennett, yesterday, took her Into custody, pending the result of the inquest, which will be held to-day, at Rye. Some of the friends of deceased state that he was heard to scream ""Murder"" and others say that his boat was seen to approach that which contained the lovers, while the majority of those who know all the parties are of opinion that Nichols, being under the influence of liquor, fell overboard and was drowned.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; FATE OF A REJECTED SUITOR-A SUSPICIOUS CASE.

So long indeed as thirty sovereignties distract the allegiance and dissipate the forces of the German people, it is as nearly impossible as anything in the realm of modern politics can be said to be, that the German States should succeed either in arranging their domestic relations on a harmonious system, or in making themselves felt as a formidable presence in the diplomacy of Europe. The upshot of the recent interview at Toplitz between the two natural chiefs of North and South Germany has only brought this impossibility more clearly out into the light of day. Thanks to the portentous etiquette which broods from the Baltic to the Adriatic over all the German Courts, and invests the movements of German Sovereignty with an awful mystery, the world is still considerably in the dark as to the real origin of this interview and the objects with which it was solicited on the one hand and accorded on the other. The best information, however, seems to point to the Emperor FRANCIS JOSEPH as the moving spirit of the meeting. Either alarmed or merely excited by the interview of NATOLZON III. at Baden Baden with the German Princes, the young Emperor seems to have urged the Prince of Prussia to invest the meeting at Toplitz also with the character of a quasi-Congress, and to join him in convoking upon the august occasion all the German rulers who had taken a part in the discussions which have immortalized the Duchess of HAMILTON's German villa.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/14/archives/a-chapter-on-social-torture.html,,"It has often been remarked that, under all the superficial crust of civilization, the primitive barbarity of man remains. The cruelty that prompts the Indian to torture his captives and the cannibal to eat his enemy, is smothered, not extinguished, by the refinements of life. Man cannot rid himself of the disposition to put his fellows to pain, and to shield himself under the plea of necessity. But in civilized life, as death and bodily affliction seldom follow as the immediate and visible consequences of this propensity to torture, the cruelty is often so managed that it is concealed from those who inflict it, and in a measure from those who suffer from it. Both parties try to persuade themselves that it does not hurt so very much, after all. Many of the small tortures of life also fall only on those who are possessed of at least moderate riches, or are acquainted with their possessors; and the voice of general and popular indignation is therefore never raised against the authors of the torment. An excellent instance is afforded by ""At Homes,"" which yearly cause so much pain and annoyance in London, and are yet borne very meekly and gently. At no one moment of the process do the tormentors or tormented exactly realize what the amount of suffering is; and as the pain is treated as inevitable, and is spread over a considerable space of time, there is no violent feeling of antagonism awakened by it. Besides, there is no real danger, no lasting inconvenience or misery connected with it; and so the sufferers are able to cheer themselves with the thought that it will soon be over. In all these respects it resembles the toothache more than a really serious disease. The toothache is hard to bear, but the pain is distributed over many hours, and it does not injure the constitution or shorten life. We can learn to go through ""At Homes"" with the same sleepy and melancholy courage that we can bring to confront the toothache, and the end of all reflection on ""At Homes"" is the conviction that to acquire this courage is the true aim of the wise. There is no chance that ""At Homes"" will cease; and the only thing to do is to endure them in a proper spirit.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Chapter on Social Torture.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Chapter on Social Torture.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Saturday Review', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e09830f4-5d12-56b4-b499-1ea5b7c3892c,2244,nyt://article/e09830f4-5d12-56b4-b499-1ea5b7c3892c

He still remains at the New-York Hospital in a very precarious condition, his skull being fractured, and the bone of his lower jaw shattered. So far no statement has been obtained from the sufferer wits reference to the manner in which he received his injuries, as most of the time he is unconscious; but should he be restored sufficiently for the purpose, one of the Coroners will visit him, and take his ante-mortem deposition. Officer Petty has been engaged, ever since the occurrence became known, in obtaining information as to who inflicted the violence, and his investigations have resulted in the arrest of four persons named John Ryan, Jas. Wilson, Elizabeth Barry and Mary Hart, who have been identified as participants in the transaction. John Maloy, a lad, residing at No. 91 Monroe-street, has made an affidavit before Justice KELLY to the effect that about 1 1/2 o'clock on Sunday morning he was standing with some of his companions at the corner of New Bowery and Madison-street, when their attention was attracted by a cry of ""Murder"" and ""Watch"" proceeding from the vicinity of James and Madison streets. They ran to the place as quickly as possible, and there saw Cusick, who appeared to be badly hurt, staggering about like a drunken man. The four prisoners and another man stood near Cusick, seemingly much excited, and one of them asked for a pistol, but was not successful in procuring one, when all of them dispersed.

At noon the rain, which had commenced about 11 o'clock, seemed to be falling as rapidly as it was possible for it to do, ut it continued to descend, in greater abundance until 2 o'clock. Then the storm reached its height, although it did not cease until 11 o'clock in the evening. About 2 o'clock, P.M., says the Enquirer, a most extraordinary occurrence took place, resulting in the death of one boy, and the severe, if not fatal, injury of another. The two parties were at work in a brickyard on Long-lane. The lot was open and exposed. The storm made its approach, and was unheeded. Almost without any knowledge of their position, or of the danger, the boys continued their occupation, and sought no shelter. In an instant, one of them, named DANIEL HUTTER, was struck by lightning, and fell, although not dead. As he lay upon the grass, Mr. SREETZ, the owner of the yard, directed the remaining lad, JAMES HUGHES, to go for a cart, whereon to convey the body of the sufferer to the nearest house. HUGHES started to run, but had only gone a few-steps when another blast struck him down dead. HUTTER was taken to a place of safety, and it is hoped will recover, if proper care is used. The deceased was 17 years of age, and assisted his brother to support a widowed mother. He resided at No. 1,238 Federal-street, to which place the body was at once conveyed. It presented a terrible appearance, the skin being apparently scorched, and the face somewhat disfigured.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Heavy Storm in Philadelphia.; TWO BOYS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BUILDINGS AND CULVERTS DAMAGED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Heavy Storm in Philadelphia.; TWO BOYS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING BUILDINGS AND CULVERTS DAMAGED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6d9f69d-3c3a-5449-b2ad-51baed5536ac,493,nyt://article/f6d9f69d-3c3a-5449-b2ad-51baed5536ac

"The United States steam-frigate Powhatan, late flag-ship of the East Indies Squadron, has arrived at Philadelphia, as announced by a telegraphic dispatch published this morning. The Powhatan has been in commission over two years, about nine months of which were spent in going out to and returning from the East. She relieved the San Jacinto a short time before the outbreak of hostilities between the British and Chinese; and in the engagement of the Pei-ho, Commodore TATNALL rendered assistance to the English Admiral -- an act that caused him to become notorious for a while. The Powhatan has visited more harbors on the China Station than any flag-ship we have ever had there, and has had quite a narrow escape from total destruction. In consequence of the shallowness of the waters and of exceedingly tempestuous weather, near the Rugged Islands, passing which, while she had in tow the little steamer chartered by the United States Government for navigating the rivers of China, she was driven aground on the 27th of May, 1859, and badly injured. It was necessary to throw over a quantity of coal to lighten her, and arrangements were also made to throw over some of the guns, if necessary, to get her off. At 2 1/2 o'clock a Chinese furnishing boat was hauled alongside, and three officers started in her to find assistance. The crew of the boat consisted of fifteen Chinamen -- a piratical looking set of fellows -- but they proved to be better than they looked. After five and a half hours' sail in this open boat, exposed to a drenching rain, the relief party reached Woosing. The Mississippi and another vessel were dispatched the following morning to the relief of the Powhatan, but fortunately a pilot had gone to her assistance, and by his boldness and energy was enabled to get her off the banks, with the loss only of one anchor, a boat and some coal. She was, however, again forced upon another shoal, about three-fourths of a mile long, and had for a time a fearful humping and thumping upon it.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/16/archives/naval-cruise-of-the-steamfrigate-powhattan.html,,"The United States steam-frigate Powhatan, late flag-ship of the East Indies Squadron, has arrived at Philadelphia, as announced by a telegraphic dispatch published this morning.

Two steamboats conveyed the visitors from the dock to the ship every fifteen minutes, and were inconveniently thronged on each successive trip. A large number of these visitors appeared to be from the country. Several coal-barges were alongside the ship throughout the day, making up the deficiency in the stock of coals, which, in accordance with her arrangements, she was unable to wait for and receive at Annapolis Roads. The services of the donkey engines were brought into requisition for hauling them on board. To-day, shortly after 4 P.M., the Great Eastern will start for Milford Haven, England, calling at Halifax on her way. Rather over one hundred tickets have, so far, been sold for the entire voyage, and nearly forty for Halifax. At Milford Haven she will be drawn upon a ""gridiron,"" which is now being prepared for her, and her bottom cleaned.

According to one of our Newport correspondents he expresses his sentiments with the utmost freedom, and does not hesitate to state precisely what he expects to accomplish in the pending Presidential canvass. We gather from our correspondent's letter that Judge DOUGLAS has not the slightest expectation of achieving his own election, -- and very faint hopes of preventing the election of LINCOLN. But he does expect and intend, not only to render the election of BRECKINRIDGE impossible, but to crush out utterly and forever the wretched Pro-Slavery faction which has made him its candidate. He does not believe that BRECKINRIDGE can possibly get votes enough to carry him into the House as one of the three highest candidates, and doubts whether he will receive the support of more than one or two States. South Carolina will vote for him, and so may Mississippi; but no other Southern State, in Judge DOUGLAS's opinion, will give him its support.

"Hon. ELI THAYER, of Massachusetts, is fighting his own battles vigorously in Massachusetts.

Mr. THAYER asserted that the administration of the affairs of the different Territories was entirely under the control of politicians, and all a broken down fellow had to do was to gather a dozen companions and emigrate to the borders of civilization, and there set himself up. A Territorial government would then be asked for, and the fellow would next be heard from as a delegate to Congress. Our Indian wars, said he, have always followed in the track of Government officials; and the millions that the Government has paid on this account has gone principally into the pockets of these leeches. The speaker said he had the authority of Hon. EDWARD WADE, of Ohio, for these statements, and as Mr. WADE had given the subject much attention, he was assured they were truthful.

"The circumstances attending the decease of MARY HALLIGAN, an Irish woman, 35 years of age, who was fatally injured on the evening of the 5th inst. by her husband, MARTIN HALLIGAN, were yesterday investigated by Coroner SCHIRMER. RICHARD MARTIN, a patrolman of the Twenty-second Precinct, testified that on the evening the violence was committed, he was informed by a woman, whose name he did not ascertain, that deceased was lying upon the floor at her residence. No. 317 West Forty-third-street, apparently dying. He went to the place indicated and found the woman's statement was true, deceased being covered with blood, perfectly insensible, and having scarcely a piece of clothing upon her. Witness questioned the other occupants of the house with reference to the matter, but was unable to learn anything, each of the parties declaring that no disturbance had been heard. He at once had the suffering woman removed to the Hospital, and later in the evening, Sergeant MURPHY, also of the Twenty second Ward Police, met her husband at the corner of Tenth-avenue and Forty third-street. The officer immediately arrested him and charged him with having beaten his wife. The prisoner replied that ""he could not deny it,"" adding that he did so because she was almost always drunk, and he could have no peace with her. He was thereupon locked up to await the result of his violence. It was ascertained, after the admission of deceased to the Hospital, that two severe wounds had been inflicted upon her head, apparently with a sharp instrument, and she became delirious from their effects, in which condition she remained until Tuesday night last, when she died. A verdict was rendered that deceased had died of meningitis, the result of wounds inflicted by her husband, Martin Halligan. The accused was then examined by the Coroner, in the prescribed manner. He stated that he was 35 years of age, and a carpenter by trade. With reference to the charge, he said: ""I never raised a deadly weapon to her in my life -- I never had a weapon of any kind in my hand.""

BOSTWICK's reputed father was a respectable citizen of Dexter, and was possessed of considerable property. The young man had become quite dissipated by his residence in this city, and his father, hoping to reform him, induced him to remove to the West with his wife. Among the first acquaintances he formed was that of Mr. GEORGE W. HAYES. He immediately became intimate with the family, and was quite marked in his attentions to Mrs. HAYES. Meantime the young man's father died, and the sympathy which Mr. HAYES felt for him afforded him a better opportunity to carry on the intrigue which he had commenced. Finally matters reached such a pass that Mr. HAYES could not shut his eyes to the evidences of infidelity on the part of his wife, which were continually thrust upon him, and he forbade BOSTWICK entering the house. The prohibition was again and again disregarded until the people of the town took the part of the injured husband and threatened to lynch, his betrayer. On one occasion he was about to receive a coat of.. tar and feathers, when Mrs. HAYES walked over to.. the hotel where he was staying and placed a pair of loaded revolvers in his hands, with which he protected himself. This demonstration frightened BOSTWICK away from Dexter for several months, but on the right of the 3d Mr. HAYES, on going horns from business, could find nothing of his wife. His sister-in-law, in answer to his questions, said that she had gone to bed sick with a headache. Mr. HAYES finally prepared to go to bed himself, and bad retired to his room for that purpose, when he heard whispering in his wife's apartment. He immediately went to the door of his room and demanded admittance. After some parley, the door was opened, and Mr. HAYES looking under the bed discovered BOSTWICK there wrapped up in a sheet. No sooner had he made this discovery than Mrs. HAYES blew out the light, leaving the room in total darkness. BOSTWICK immediately came out from his hiding place, and the two belabored Mr. HAYES with a chair until it was broken to pieces. His cries finally attracted the attention of the neighbors and passers by, but BOSTWICK managed to make good his escape before they could apprehend him. The only article of clothing which the fugitive had on at the time was his shirt, but he managed to supply the deficiencies in his wardrobe and to escape arrest until the Wednesday succeeding, when the officers found him secreted near Ann Arbor.

They have at least learned that if British and French balls carry death with them, Chinese balls, when equally well-aimed, may be equally trusted to disturb and disorganize hostile ranks. When we consider that the Chinese population numbers more than three hundred millions, and that Europe itself with America, is no more safe from a military movement of this colossal mass than the Roman Empire was from the awakened energies of the Germanic barbarians, it is easy to see that the Chinese war, of 1860, may possibly take its place among the great secular convulsions which have changed the face of human history.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'China and the West.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'China and the West.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19c666f1-603f-5e05-810b-d96eeb8514a3,256,nyt://article/19c666f1-603f-5e05-810b-d96eeb8514a3

Purley, and the building, with most of the stock, was destroyed.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/18/archives/police-reports-arrest-of-an-alleged-incendiary-arrest-of-more.html,,"On the morning of the 22d of April last a fire occurred in the building No. 869 Broadway, occupied as a liquor and cigar store by a man named Wm. H. Purley, and the building, with most of the stock, was destroyed. Connected with the fire were many circumstances which warranted a supposition that it was not of accidental origin, and Fire-Marshal Baker has given the matter a thorough investigation. The testimony implicates Purley and one Wm.G. Lambert, Jr., as having designedly set fire to the place with the object of obtaining the sum of $16,000, for which amount the stock had been insured in the Standard, American and Home Insurance Companies. Purley stated at the time of the fire that his loss reached the snug little sum of $16,888 27, but the investigation has demonstrated that the value of his stock was scarce one-fourth of that sum. Two young men, named James Peevers and Daniel Wilson, testified that they were both employed by Purley, and that for five or six weeks prior to the fire they suspected that it was the intention of the proprietor to burn the place. Peevers states that on one occasion at Lambert's office, No. 26 Broad-street, he heard Lambert say to Purley, ""That d _____ d store is not paying -- I wish I could sell it or get rid of it in some way."" Purley replied, ""I'll tell you what to do with it: get a cheap stock into it, get it fully insured, and buns it up."" Witness from that time made up his mind that they intended to burn the store. On other occasions Lambert had said to witness, ""What a fine fire that store would make,"" and ask it he believed it would burn out quickly. About a week previous to the fire, Lambert had all the liquors put into bottles, which were not corked, and on the afternoon of its occurrence he sent witness to procure some oysters, stating that he intended at 10 o'clock that night to have some company there to supper. Shortly after 12 o'clock that night witness left the place, but, suspecting something wrong, he loitered near the premises until all had left. He afterwards looked through a crack in the shutter, and saw a glare of light, but was unable to decide whether it proceeded from the gasburners or something else. He did not give an alarm, but walked off a couple of blocks, and returned in a few minutes to find that the light had disappeared. He then went home, and next morning, on coming down to work, he ascertained that the store had been burned up. This formed the substance of the testimony against the parties, and it was fully substantiated by the evidence of many other witnesses. After the testimony had been submitted to Justice KELLY, he issued warrants for the arrest of the parties implicated. Lambert was yesterday apprehended by Capt. Cameron, of the Eighteenth Precinct, and, having been taken before the magistrate, was required to furnish bail in the sum of $10,000 to answer the charge. His father became his surety.

It is an action brought by Judge T.W. WHITLEY, magistrate, author, artist and editor, of the village of Hoboken, against D.C. CRAIG, Esq., the New-York Telegraphic Agent-of the Associated Press, for services rendered in writing a biographical sketch of Mr. ROBERT W. RUSSELL, the Secretary and legal adviser of the American Telegraph Company. It seems that in the late controversy about the management of the American Telegraph Company, it became a matter of interest to Mr. CRAIG to learn some thing of the personal history of Mr. RUSSELL, and hearing that Judge WHITLEY was in possession of the facts relative to his former career, both in this country and England, he applied to him through an agent to write a sketch of his life. The Judge complied with the request, and wrote a biographical sketch of Mr. RUSSELL, covering ten or twelve pages of foolsca[???], in which the leading incidents of his life were duly set forth. The manuscript was forwarded to Mr. CRAIG, who, after perusing it, returned it to the author with a note stating that it contained nothing not previously know, and was therefore of no value. The author replied that the greater portion of the sketch was new, and not ""previously known,"" and demanded $50 as a reasonable remuneration for his services. The demand was refused, unless the amount were reduced to $5, and hence the action at law. The case was called by Judge FONDA, yesterday morning, when the plaintiff with his counsel, R.D. DEMING. Esq., appeared with their witnesses ready for trail. The defendant's counsel, GALPIN & SKINNER, asked for a postponement, stating at the same time that they should plead the general is the ""with a special plea that the contract between the parties was contra bonos mores."" Plaintiff's counsel wished to know what was intended by the special plea of ""contra bonos mores,"" but the Judge said it was of no consequence, that the plea of the general issue was quite sufficient, and that the case might stand over until Monday next at 11 o'clock A.M.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f15034a-fcc4-5b6a-a4b8-cbf06da841a5,1806,nyt://article/2f15034a-fcc4-5b6a-a4b8-cbf06da841a5

The pilot, who is considered one of the best on the river, was subsequently put in irons. At Montreal, it is understood, considerable jealousy exists between the English and the French Canadian residents, growing out of the preparations for the reception, and serious difficulties, it is feared, may result.

JAMES GUBBY, Pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church in Jersey City, and JOSEPH WELLWOOD, a member of the same Church, appeared before Justice BEDFORD and preferred complaints against SAMUEL STERLING, JOHN WILSON and WM. ATCHISON, who are, or were, members of the Third Presbyterian Church, charging them with assault and disorderly conduct at a session meeting on Thursday night. One of them is also charged with having threatened to tear down and destroy the edifice. A feud has existed for many months between certain members of the Church, the cause of which is not made public. Several persons have been expelled from the Society. Rev. Mr. GUBBY makes two affidavits. In one he testifies that he is the minister of the Church; that on the evening of the 16th of August a meeting of the Session of the Church was held, and while in session, SAMUEL STERLING, who was present, without cause or provocation, put his fist to the face of deponent and threatened to make him suffer, thereby putting Rev. Mr. GUBBY in bodily fear. He further complains that said STERLING wilfully and unlawfully interrupted and disturbed said meeting by rude and noisy behavior. The reverend gentleman made another affidavit, charging JOHN WILSON with having, on the 23d of July last, threatened to pull down and destroy the Church, and further, that on the evening of the 16th inst., at a meeting of the Session, Mr. WILSON interrupted and disturbed said meeting, by making a great noise and by rude and indecent behavior. Mr. JOSEPH WELLWOOD made an affidavit, that on Thursday evening, while reading a document, charging one of the members of said church with selling liquor on the Sabbath, WM. ATCHISON made a violent assault and struck deponent with a fan, and greatly interrupted the business of the meeting.

For more than a generation, says the Troy Daily Whig, Judge BUEL has been one of the best known and highly esteemed citizens of Troy. Prominent at the Bar, he was as well for many years very active and efficient in all public concerns, in both city and country. He always enjoyed public confidence, and was most faithful and devoted to any cause which enlisted his energies. In 1821 he was a member of the Convention which revised the Constitution of this State. He distinguished himself in that body in the discussion of several important questions. He held the office of Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for several years, receiving the office first from the old Council of Appointment. Ill health obliged him to resign this position in 1827. Spending some three years in the South, soon after, in pursuit of health, he returned, and devoted himself to his profession, avoiding public life. In 1842 he was appointed one of the State Regents of the University, which office he held at the time of his death. We cannot enumerate the various positions of honor and trust, connected with business, charitable and religious interests, which the deceased held in later years. They were numerous, and every duty belonging to them was discharged with rigid fidelity. In religious faith he was an Episcopalian, and for many years, to the time of his decease, he was senior Warden of St. Paul's Church.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Judge Buel.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Judge Buel.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e7179492-8826-5bce-ae83-46b935b7659e,473,nyt://article/e7179492-8826-5bce-ae83-46b935b7659e

The cable on which he performed was stretched across the river a third of a mile below the Clifton House, and was in length nearly double that on which Blondin has been exhibiting. At first Farini stepped nervously upon the cable; his pole, which was two slender for its weight and length, caught in the guy-ropes, and for a few moments the adventurer was in a rather embarrassing condition. He soon regained his confidence, however, and completed the trip to the Canada side in safety. On his return he stopped midway, lowered a cord to the Maid of the Mist, which was waiting in the stream, and by it raised a rope which he fastened to his cable. By means of this he descended to the steamboat, a distance of 70 or 80 feet, and then, having climbed up again, completed his transit. The crowd was much disappointed that FARINI did not add another to the many risks which he ran of breaking his neck by going down to the Maid of the Mist head foremost, as he had advertised; but the narrow escape he had in the earlier part of his performance nearly compensated for this.

Indeed, the elections of the past few weeks have covered them with clouds and doubt. The party Conventions in the same quarter are of the same complexion, and it looks very much as if some of his most prominent partizans in the South were looking about for some safe and not ignoble retreat. Judged from this distance the result of the Charlottesville (Va.) Convention has a strong squinting towards a coalition with BELL. There was much less of the secession element in that body than the nomination of BRECKINRIDGE at Baltimore was supposed to imply. We see it intimated, that but for the adoption of the resolution of instruction to the Breckinridge electors to so cast their vote as to defeat LINCOLN, the Convention could not have harmonized. It would scarcely be reasonable to infer that this alternative means the promotion of DOUGLAS, after the declaration of Senator MASON, that his course tends ""to the Abolition camp."" It must, therefore, mean that Mr. BELL would be acceptable to the Breckinridge Democracy in the event -- now almost certain -- that they cannot have their first choice. There are collateral circumstances also which go to strengthen this intention, which we may as well glance at.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Virginia Democracy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Virginia Democracy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0751ed6d-0c64-5e5b-a358-d987b36afe82,946,nyt://article/0751ed6d-0c64-5e5b-a358-d987b36afe82

The second preliminary meeting to effect this object was held at No. 618 Broadway last evening, SILAS B. DUTCHER acting as Chairman, and Messrs. GAVIT and TUCKER as Secretaries. Three delegates were received from each of the Wide-Awake Clubs and the Ward associations, with the exception of the Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fifteenth, Eighteenth and Twenty-second Wards. Two sets of delegates were received from both the Nineteenth Ward and the Rail-Splitters battalion. After a very long and tedious debate, the meeting decided to receive delegates from all organizations present, regardless of there being more than one in each Ward. This course was emphatically necessary, in order to include all the working Republicans, and was adopted by an overwhelming majority. Messrs. Ritterhand, Ward, Gillespie, Van Orden, Gavit, Jackson and Tucker, were appointed a Committee to draft a constitution and by-laws. After due deliberation the Committee reported that the name of the Society be the "" Republican Wide-Awake General Committee of the City and County of New-York; that the officers be a President, two Vice-Presidents, Treasurer, Secretary, Sergeant-at-Arms, and a Marshal; that three delegates be received from each ward association, and each independent Wide-Awake Club having fifty members or more; that no general parade be ordered without the sanction of the Committees.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/22/archives/german-harmony-and-the-european-concert.html,,"The reply of Prussia to the demand of France that Spain should be readmitted to her seat in the great council of Europe, as it comes to us in the columns of the Cologne Ga zette, affords a curious commentary on the paeans which the Anti-Gallican Press of Germany and England have just been singing over the interview of Toplitz and its precious fruits. The ""united front"" which Germany was henceforth to present to all foreign aggressors, divides at the first touch of a practical question, and the harmony in which it was so pompously proclaimed that FRANCIS JOSEPH and the Prince Regent were to fulfill their joint mission as the protectors of German independence and the combined balance-weights of Europe, resolves itself into a very meagre and dismal agreement of the two rulers to keep an eye on the suspicious man???uvres of that arch mischief maker, the Emperor of the French. Austria having signified her perfect readiness to welcome back Spain to the rank of a great Power, Prussia discovers an alarming number of very excellent reasons for hesitating to follow the example of her imperial sister. She does not, indeed, positively pronounce against the claims of a monarchy which awed the world while the ancestors of FREDERIC the Great were hustling for a livelihood among the petty Courts of Northern Germany, but she cannot hail the return of Spain to the concert of Europe as heartily and as frankly as the Court of Vienna. Of course Prussia and Austria are the best of friends, but then Prussia is a Protestant Power; and although she confides entirely in the good Germen feeling of the Kaiser, still she remembers that His Imperial Majesty prefers mass in St. Stephen's to the hymns of LUTHER; and reflecting that ISABELLA of Spain inherits, if not the faith, at least the fame of the most Catholic of Queens, Prussia cannot resign herself to the presence at the common Council-board of another Roman Catholic Power. Prussia accordingly suggests the propriety of admitting Sweden as a Protestant make-weight in the grand Continental balance -- of course, without any consideration of the circumstance that in the possible future revival, at no distant day, of the question of Schleswig-Holstein as a matter of European debate Sweden might be relied on with tolerable certainty to give her vote and her weight against Denmark and in favor of the annexation to Prussia of the German Duchies now attached to the Danish Crown, in return for the influence which Prussia and England might then be induced to exert in favor of the incorporation of Denmark itself with Sweden and Norway in a new Scandinavian Kingdom able to hold the Baltic gate aginst Russia.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'German Harmony and the European Concert.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'German Harmony and the European Concert.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Spain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22bbe2e2-d337-5518-b3a9-ffab63c8b2be,995,nyt://article/22bbe2e2-d337-5518-b3a9-ffab63c8b2be

They called a meeting last evening for the purpose of considering their grievances in the matter of opening, grading, paving and sewering their street. Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, and the retired spot selected for the meeting -- corner of Fifty-second-street and Twelfth-avenue -- about forty lots were represented. In a conversational way, it was stated that Fifty-second-street has been graded about three years; that the assessments have been made and paid long since; that now, when the curb and gutter is about to be laid, it appears that the level of the street, between Eleventh and Twelfth avenues, is several feet above the grade; that instead of making sundry rock excavations and laying a gravel bed for the street, the contractors for grading left the rock so near the surface that more rock excavations are necessary in order to set the curb; that the contract for paving was given out one week before the contract for building the sewer between Tenth and Eleventh avenues; that the plan is evidently to pave the street, and then immediately tear it up for the purpose of building the sewer; that from Ninth to Eleventh avenues is already paved, (in the roadway.) and that the work is culpably bad -- not at all according to the specifications; that the stones are nut culled, and are, some of them, very soft; that there is no sand-bed for them; that they are not properly rammed down, but are loosely set in the sand; that crevices are left between them of unusual size; and that, in short, the entire work of paving is a gross violation of contract, and an attempted swindle on the property holders; that the Croton Board had been appealed to in vain to redress these grievances, and that more flagrant outrages on the rights of the property holders were contemplated. Various plans had been talked over for a remedy, and those present decided that whatever legal protection they could obtain, by injunctions, mandamuses, protests or other devices of the law, should be secured.

A walk around the block with the swain of her choice, which, as the house is ""all locked up,"" and secured moreover, with bolt and chain, extends itself into several blocks, and is so congenial, and comfortable, and collateral, in warm weather that she forgets to be home early, and when she does return and retires to bed, she courts ""tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep"" as ardently as her Patrick courted her. Then is the burglar's time. Then skeleton-keys are of service, and broken panes of glass are not heard. The dreams of Bridget carry her back to childhood, or onward to that blissful moment when the good priest makes one of twain. Meanwhile, stealthily, securely, steals the stealer.

She gave information at the Eighteenth Ward Station-house, and Officers Syphers, Shaw and Kinnard were dispatched to examine the premises. They soon discovered that not only Judge Pierrepont's residence had been broken into, but also that of Mr. H.A. Johnson, next door, both of which had been ransacked from top to bottom and robbed of a large amount of property; but how much could not be ascertained, as both families were out of town. The burglars had gained access by forcing the back basement-door of Judge Pierrepont's house, and then ascending to the roof, had forced open the scuttle of the house of Mr. Johnson. Supposing that the burglars would return for more plunder, Detective Elder obtained permission of Dr. Moffat to allow the officers to watch from his parlor windows for them, and at 5 o'clock yesterday morning two men were seen to enter the dwelling of Judge Pierrepont. The officers immediately rushed upon them, and the burglars made for the street, but were closely pursued, and after three shots from a revolver had been fired at them, they were brought to a stand and arrested. The prisoners names are John Smith, alias Cahill, and George Waters, alias Baker, and in their possession were found two lock-picks, a jimmy, and $60 in bank-bills. Both are known to the Police, and Waters is but recently out of State Prison, and they were both locked up by Justice CONNOLLY for trial. During the day Detectives Slowey and McCord visited Cahill's residence, were they found a very large amount of stolen property, burglarious implements, crucibles for melting up silver ware, &c. After having secured Cahill's wife, the officers removed the stolen goods, amounting to about $5,000 worth, to head-quarters. Mrs. Cahill then informed Officer Slowey that she had pawned numerous articles which her husband had given her, and which she supposed to have been stolen. She had not received any pawn tickets for the goods she had disposed of, and she was accordingly taken to Essex Market, where, on her affidavit, search warrants were obtained for the pawn shops mentioned by her. These warrants will be executed this morning early, when, if her story be true, another valuable lot of goods will be recovered.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/22/archives/lynching-the-prince-of-wales.html,,"It is an unpleasant thing to say, but it is nevertheless true that the Prince of Wales is destined to be lynched in New-York. Of course his Royal Highness will not object to the process; in the first place, because he is as polite a person as the first gentleman of England ought to be; and, in the second place, because lynching is an American institution, and he comes to the United States expressly to see our institutions. But surely no New-Yorker can reflect without a sentiment of shame and humiliation upon the doom which impends over our illustrious young visitor; a doom which yet no respectable citizen can have the heart to wish averted from its destined victim. For in the case of the Prince as in most other cases of lynching, all the best portion of the community will be united in perpetrating the deed. Lynch law, as we all very well know is simply a return of society to first principles. It is put into force only when the constituted authorities have proved themselves unequal to their duty, or unfit to be trusted with official responsibility. When justices of the peace turn brigands, and judges hob-nob with highwaymen, decent people seeing their lives and their purses in daily peril, are compelled to erect themselves into a Supreme Court, and to carry their own judgments into execution. It is in this way that horse-thieves and gamblers come to be lynched out of the world on the wild frontiers of the West. In like manner will the Prince of Wales come to be lynched in the civilized metropolis of the Union. The City of New-York, in its corporate capacity, has extended an invitation to the Prince of Wales, which invitation the Prince has accepted. Had such a correspondence passed between the heir of England and the Corporation of New-York twenty years ago, the consequences would have been as simple as possible. The Prince would have come to New-York, where all proper arrangements to receive and entertain him comfortably and honorably would have been made by the Mayor and the City Government. They would have represented their fellow-citizens in all ways of hospitality, convenient to the occasion His Royal Highness would have eaten a civic dinner, danced at a civic ball, seen the great City in the light of civic wisdom and civic courtesy, just as he would go into Guildhall on the invitation of the City of London, or into the Parisian Hotel de Ville at the prayer of the Prefect of the Seine.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lynching the Prince of Wales.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Lynching the Prince of Wales.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b96e00ea-ec27-5f8e-b900-811d7edb7927,723,nyt://article/b96e00ea-ec27-5f8e-b900-811d7edb7927

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/22/archives/the-sick-man-of-america.html,,"The great Mexican question, which the people of the United States have so often and so obstinately refused to answer, promises now to answer itself. Entangled by the heat of Southern extremists, and the hypocrisy of Northern politicians, with the all-confusing snarl of Slavery, this question has been once and again deliberately strangled out of sight and hearing in the National Legislature. It has been talked about, written about, fought over, used as a hobby-horse, used as a scarecrow used as a battering-ram, now by one and now by another of our own parties; but by neither of our parties has it ever been taken up honestly, with a view to practical action of the kind and on the scale demanded by its real political, social, and historical importance. So far as any policy can be said to have been indorsed by the public sentiment of the United States in regard to Mexico, the negative policy of affirming that nobody but ourselves should ever settle the anarchy of Mexican affairs may be conceded to have been. And if the anarchy of Mexican affairs would only have been polite enough to wait on our movements, and to keep itself simmering along as comfortably as might be, till we were quite ready to attend to it. things would no doubt have been made very pleasant in the end to everybody. The case indeed singularly resembles that of the great European invalid, the Ottoman Empire. The hostile political and sectional camps of American opinion represent fairly enough the European Powers which have stood around the death-bed of the Sultans ever since the treaty of Adrianople, each one bent on disposing of the patient after getting everybody else cleverly out of the way. As in the case of Turkey, too, the disease of the sufferer has shown a most discreditable impatience of diplomacy. The Druses of the Lebanon and the fanatics of Damascus, are not symptoms to be watched with tranquillity, and Europe finds itself drifting, with a rapidity alarming to nervous statesmen, onward to the absolute necessity of settling issues which nervous statesmen had hoped still to be able to use to their own advantage for a number of years to come.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Sick Man of America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Sick Man of America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ba799bd0-4a59-5d5d-a0e3-060c7ff06503,820,nyt://article/ba799bd0-4a59-5d5d-a0e3-060c7ff06503

"The first prize-fight which has created any great interest among the ""sporting men"" of this City, since the ""great international"" affair between HEENAN and SAYERS, was fought on Tuesday last, near Island Pond, in the town of Brighton, Essex County, Vermont, between JAMES KELLY and DANIEL KERRIGAN, to $1,000 a side. Both the men are well known here to their class. KERRIGAN, who is an Irishman, 25 years of age, has heretofore been the victor in many fights, not considered of great importance by the fraternity and therefore not elaborately reported in the sporting papers. KELLY is also an Irishman, 28 years of age, and is reported to have made the ""longest prize-fight on record"" while in Australia, since which time he has been known as ""Australian KELLY"" among his associates. KERRIGAN is 5 feet 8 inches in height, and, when in fighting condition, weighs 141 pounds; while KELLY is 5 feet 10 inches in height, and on Tuesday weighed 154 pounds. The preliminary arrangements for the fight were made some six weeks ago, and from that time until the meeting near Island Pond, both men had been in active training. The party of men who left here to witness the encounter, and those who joined them on the route, all succeeded in reaching the Island Pond Railway station, without any unpleasant interference from the authorities, and at 4 o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, they proceeded to the ground, and soon after their arrival there the men were ready for the fray. The friends of KERRIGAN were far more numerous on the ground, and were offering large odds on their man, as high as 100 to 75, and in some instances 100 to 80 being freely offered on KERRIGAN, but even this tempting offer found no takers. KELLY's friends had all been estranged or discouraged by the result of his battle with ED. PRICE, and the few that were on the spot did not seem disposed to make investments. The owner of the farm lent his aid in the selection of a level spot, and soon a decision was made. The accommodating farmer learned his scythe and rake, to get the spot in condition, and speedily all was ready to set up the ring. JACK MONTGOMERY produced a set of stakes, that had been elaborately finished in a lathe. Under his distinguished supervision the ring was soon pitched, and an outer ring formed; and to his personal care, the reporters are indebted for the best places from which to see the combat.

Both the men are well known here to their class. KERRIGAN, who is an Irishman, 25 years of age, has heretofore been the victor in many fights, not considered of great importance by the fraternity and therefore not elaborately reported in the sporting papers. KELLY is also an Irishman, 28 years of age, and is reported to have made the ""longest prize-fight on record"" while in Australia, since which time he has been known as ""Australian KELLY"" among his associates. KERRIGAN is 5 feet 8 inches in height, and, when in fighting condition, weighs 141 pounds; while KELLY is 5 feet 10 inches in height, and on Tuesday weighed 154 pounds. The preliminary arrangements for the fight were made some six weeks ago, and from that time until the meeting near Island Pond, both men had been in active training. The party of men who left here to witness the encounter, and those who joined them on the route, all succeeded in reaching the Island Pond Railway station, without any unpleasant interference from the authorities, and at 4 o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, they proceeded to the ground, and soon after their arrival there the men were ready for the fray. The friends of KERRIGAN were far more numerous on the ground, and were offering large odds on their man, as high as 100 to 75, and in some instances 100 to 80 being freely offered on KERRIGAN, but even this tempting offer found no takers. KELLY's friends had all been estranged or discouraged by the result of his battle with ED. PRICE, and the few that were on the spot did not seem disposed to make investments. The owner of the farm lent his aid in the selection of a level spot, and soon a decision was made. The accommodating farmer learned his scythe and rake, to get the spot in condition, and speedily all was ready to set up the ring. JACK MONTGOMERY produced a set of stakes, that had been elaborately finished in a lathe. Under his distinguished supervision the ring was soon pitched, and an outer ring formed; and to his personal care, the reporters are indebted for the best places from which to see the combat. Prof. MONTGOMERY was assisted in pitching the ring by the High Sheriff of the County, who swung a sturdy sledge during the stake-driving ceremonies, and also three select men of the town, and divers Grand Jurors of the county, looked on with approving smiles.

"Wm. Cummings, an Irishman, who keeps a drinking-saloon at No. 259 West Twenty-sixth-street, was admitted last night to the New-York Hospital, suffering severely from a pistol-shot wound in the ankle. It would appear that Cummings had some words with a man named John Burns, who lives in the second story of the same house, in regard to the sum of $15, which the latter owed him. After quarreling for some time, Burns left the saloon, when Cummings took a horse-pistol and followed him to the sidewalk. Hastening up to Burns he struck him a violent blow on the head with some heavy instrument, inflicting a severe scalp wound. Burns immediately turned upon his assailant and clinched with him. During the scuffle which ensued, Burns became possessed of the pistol and discharged it at his antagonist. The charge, consisting of five or six slugs, took effect in the lower portion of Cummings' right leg, penetrating the ankle joint. One or more of the slugs were forced down into the foot. Officer O'Reilley, of the Sixteenth Precinct, hearing the disturbance, hastened to the spot, and succeeded in separating the men. Burns was taken to the Station-house, where his wound was dressed by the Police Surgeon, while Cummings was conveyed to the Hospital. His injuries are considered extremely serious, as there are four distinct wounds, which will probably render the amputation of the foot necessary. The slugs were extracted by Drs. Wier and Tuttle.

This building is one of a row of houses now being built near the corner of Second-avenue, by JAMES G. BURCHELL. A day or two since DAVID TUCHS, a German, moved into the second story of No. 155, for the purpose of guarding the houses. Yesterday, Messrs. MAHONEY and MILLIGAN had engaged about the house, putting in gas pipes. They had run half inch pipes up through the basement floor into a dark closet, where the meter was to be placed. In the ceiling of the closet a small hole had been cut for the purpose of carrying the pipe to the second floor, but the pipe had not been inserted. On leaving their work, the laborers had forgotten to seal up the pipe, and the consequence was that the closet became filled with gas. The only means of escape for it was up through the little hole in the ceiling, and here it diffused itself between the ceiling and the floor overhead. About 9 o'clock Mr. FANCH had occasion to pass through a close bedroom on the second floor, from one room to another with a lighted lamp. Immediately on entering the bedroom an explosion took place, the concussion throwing Mr. FUCHS to a considerable distance. It was subsequently learned that the gas between the floor and ceiling having been ignited, it exploded with such force as to throw down the partition wall, tear up the flooring, shaking the lathe and plastering all down, and leaving the whole interior of the building a perfect wreck. Mr. FUCHS was seriously burned about the hands and face, and his wife SOPHIA, his three sons, WILLIAM, FREDERICK and JACOB, aged respectively 14, 10 and 2 years, were also burned severely. ADAM FINCH, a brother of DAVID, was burned in a similar manner. The neighbors, who had been called to the spot by the terrific explosion, hastened to render every assistance to the sufferers. A physician was immediately summoned and he pronounced the youngest son's injuries of such a nature as to lead him to fear a fatal result. None of the others are considered dangerous. An alarm of fire immediately followed the explosion, and several fire companies hastened to the spot, but their services were not required, as the fire had been extinguished by the neighbors. The interior of the building was almost completely destroyed, the damage being estimated at $1,200 or $1,500. The gas-fitters are charged with the most culpable careless in leaving gas escaping in the manner they did.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SINGULAR EXPLOSION IN A TENEMENT HOUSE.; Six Persons Injured.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SINGULAR EXPLOSION IN A TENEMENT HOUSE.; Six Persons Injured.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15b8d197-8d19-5f4e-8386-3e09cae6cdcd,447,nyt://article/15b8d197-8d19-5f4e-8386-3e09cae6cdcd

MOSQUERA is said to be in command of 6,000 men. The discovery of valuable silver mines in Chili is the chief item of information from that Republic. From Peru we learn that a despicable attempt had been made to assassinate the President. The would-be murderer escaped. Peru has not yet adjusted the American claims, and it is feared that to obtain satisfaction our Minister will be compelled to resort to extreme measures.

"Mr. D.U. MARTIN, whose progress in his two-oared wherry from Boston to New-York has been chronicled from time to time, arrived here safely about 5 1/2 o'clock last evening. Harbor Police boat No. 8, Coxwain SMILEY, was the first who discovered him pulling his little skeleton boat at a smart pace down the East River.

""Yes,"" said the rower, ""I am a stranger here."" ""Where are you from?"" inquired the coxswain. ""Boston,"" replied the stranger. ""Then you are the man we have been looking for,"" said SMILEY. Mr. MARTIN desired to be shown the boat-shop of Messrs. WM. H. & J.S. DARLING, and by the direction of the policemen he was soon at the place -- No. 371 South-street. Quite a crowd was gathered to witness the landing of the singular looking stranger. Mr. DARLING, who has several days anticipated his coming, was soon at hand, and the little boat which had breasted so many waves, and borne its navigator in safety to the end of his journey, was deposited in the boat-house. This boat was built to order for Mr. MARTIN and sent to Boston by the way of Fall River, about two months ago. It is 21 feet long, and is a neat, lap-streak shell boat, having air-tight compartments at each end. Mr. MARTIN appeared in good condition, and nothing except his arms, which were somewhat burnt by the sun, indicated the protracted and tiresome physical effort which he had just accomplished. According to his ""log,"" he has performed the whole distance from Boston to New-York in about 80 hours of rowing, which, allowing the distance to be four hundred miles, is about five miles per hour. He left Eastham on Thursday, and reached Hyannis the same evening, where he put up on board of a schooner which was anchored inside of the breakwater. On Friday he stopped at Falmouth for a short time, and then pushed into Wood's Hole, which he reached at noon. Here he made some slight repairs of his boat. He then replenished his stock of berries at the store of Capt. FISH on the wharf, and started on his journey, reaching Cuttyhunk, at the west end of the Elizabeth Islands, late in the evening. Here he was hospitably entertained by Mr. SMITH, keeper of the light, who manifested much interest in his journey. He remained here over Saturday night and left on Sunday morning, arriving at Stonington that night. He dined on apples, and that day rowed nearly to Guilford. On Tuesday he called at New-Haven and took dinner -- this time having the ill-luck to get hold of some unripe fruit which did him no good. He crossed the sound and slept in a point of land some twelve miles east of Sand's Point, and yesterday morning rowed to the Sand's Point Light-house and ate breakfast on his accustomed berries. Having laid in a water-melon, he again embarked, and reached New-York at 5 1/2 o'clock P.M., pulling over forty miles during the day.

Referring briefly to the ancient achievements of that renowned race, in arts and in arms, he rehearsed the political events which gave the kingdom its present form of Government, and proceeded to say that the genius of the old Greeks still survived among their descendants -- that the perfection of form which we admire in the works of the ancient sculptors, is still found in breathing loveliness, among the youthful generation of the Greeks; and that the Greek language, restored to almost Attic purity, is heard in the society of Athens, in the pulpit, in the professor's chair. In the closing portion of his lecture, President FELTON gave a very interesting narrative of his own observations and experience in Greece during two visits that he made in 1853 and in 1858. The labors of EUGENIUS and of CORAY in preparing the people for the revolution were related. The latter, who was an able man and comprehensive scholar, guided for a time the affairs of his countrymen, though he was himself in Paris. Referring to the scenes in Scio, during that revolution, he said the Powers of Europe ought to have united against the Turks then and driven them not only into Asia, whence they came, but into the remotest parts of it Among the influences that have favored the education and the progress of the Greeks is the fact that the Priests have always favored the study of the Scriptures in the Septuagint version. Another thing favorable to their progress is the fact that they have no permanent head of the Greek Church. The Patriarch of Constantinople is Patriarch of Turkey and the Ionian Islands only. The Kingdom of Greece is under Bishops of tie Greek Church, and Russia is under still another Ecclesiastical organization. He said he coincided perfectly in the opinion of those who think that the most proper course for the. missionaries to take there, is not to attack the Church; for it is a Christian Church, and though it has superstitions it may be reformed from within.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EVENING SESSION.; ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT FELTON OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EVENING SESSION.; ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT FELTON OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d06add2e-5e37-5bda-ba80-6148cc4083bf,1296,nyt://article/d06add2e-5e37-5bda-ba80-6148cc4083bf

Biggs appeared very friendly, gave her his card, and invited her, if she ever came to New-York, to call and see his family. She then left him, and proceeded on board the boat designated, and the following day, to her surprise, found herself in this City instead of Philadelphia.

Here he showed her every attention, and made her a present of some clothing, but failing in his purpose towards her, he became angry, accused her of stealing the clothing he had given her, and caused her arrest on a charge of larceny.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/25/archives/religious-intelligence-notices-of-religious-movements-spirit-of-the.html,,"The last number of the Freewill Baptist Quarterly has a curious and interesting article on the ""Advantages and Disadvantages of a Permanent Ministry."" In favor of a permanent pastorate, it is said that it saves the expense of frequent removals. The Freewill Baptist ministry, numbering 1,246, are supposed on an average to change locations once in four years. Calculating the expense of each removal at $30, the total amount expended in this way would be $9,445. A more important consideration is, that a permanent pastorate ""tends to stability of mind,"" on the part of both pastor and people; ""it deepens the affections and tends to establish mutual confidence."" On the contrary, it may be said that a permanent pastorate ""lacks the inspiration of new faces,"" -- it results often in despondency on the part of the pastor, forbids extended effort to enforce and impress some particular truth which a roving ministry can set before a variety of congregations, and prevents the pastor from pursuing that extended system of visitation in his congregation, which often results in much good. The Evangelist, in commenting on this article, remarks that a permanent ministry is essential to the highest type of Christian development -- to stability of Christian character, and to mutual confidence between pastor and people. Allusion is also made to the causes or occasions of change in the pastoral relation. The people are frequently, but not always, responsible for them. Greater care is recommended in the selection and settlement of ministers. The ease with which the pastoral relation may be dissolved should not be allowed to act as a premium on hasty settletlements, for the intimate relations which must exist between a pastor and his people are of too sacred a nature to be treated lightly.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RELIGIOUS INTELLIGENCE.; Notices of Religious Movements Spirit of the Press.

The explanation is furnished by the tables of Mr. DOWNING, Superintendent of Sanitary Inspection. For the week ending Aug. 11, there were 297 men employed, who performed 1,074 1/2 hours' work, and who removed 14,182 loads of dirt, ashes and manure, at a cost of $4,631.

Naples had been declared in a state of siege, in preparation, no doubt, for GARIBALDI's anticipated attack.

Passengers will then be enabled to step from the boat directly aboard the cars, instead of walking several hundred yards through the sand, as they are now obliged to do. It is also in contemplation to establish a new ferry line to New-York, to run in connection with the cars, and to afford the public better accommodations than are now furnished by the miserable boats which ply between this City and the Island, under the auspices of Mr. LAW. The success of the Staten Island Railroad, which has now been running three months, has exceeded the most sanguine hopes of its projectors, and is proving to be of inestimable advantage to the residents of the interior and lower end of the Island. The cars make eleven stoppages between Vanderbilt's Landing and Tottenville, a distance of 15 miles, thus accommodating every hamlet on the route, and enabling those who live at the extreme end of the Island to reach New-York in 1 1/2 hours. The Company has secured the services, as conductors, of Mr. GEO. BARKER, well known to travelers on the Erie road, and of Capt. FRAZER, formerly of the steamboat Thomas Nelson, who, notwithstanding the frequent stoppages, contrive to put their trains through with the usual ""railroad speed,"" and at the same time render the trip agreeable by their urbanity and accommodating spirit. The opening of this road renders the whole interior of that beautiful Island easy of access from New-York, and there is no doubt that in a few years, not merely the shores, but the entire surface of the Island will be thickly dolled with suburban villas.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Staten Island News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Staten Island News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb4ab275-e124-5155-a7fe-8b2daac45b88,305,nyt://article/cb4ab275-e124-5155-a7fe-8b2daac45b88

We obtain, from our files and correspondence, details of the intelligence telegraphed from Cape Race, and published in our impression of Saturday. They are of considerable interest and importance. It is confirmed that 1,800 Garibaldians had landed in Calabria, and a French telegram states that they had been repulsed. This however, is not generally credited. Great preparations were going on in Naples to meet the anticipated invasion; but nearly all the newspaper correspondents agree in stating that, unless supported by foreign aid, the King will be compelled to abandon his dominions, as neither his army nor navy will fight for him. The Paris Patrie and other French papers assert, in positive terms, that in the event of GARIBALDI taking possession of Naples, Austria will not wait for his attack upon Venetia, but will meet the Garibaldian troops at whatever point of the mainland she may deem necessary for her own interests. We publish, from the special correspondence of the London Times, some very interesing accounts of the Italian General's projects of invasion. The French force destined for Syria will now, it is said, exceed 12,000men. The British have empowered their Commissioner to land 1,500 seamen and marines on the Syrian Coast, in case of need. In regard to this question, Lord STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE made some important statements in the House of Lords on the evening of the 14th inst. His Lordship, who was for many years British Ambassador at Constantinople, and may be presumed to understand thoroughly the condition of Turkey, frankly admitted that the Syrian disturbances ""were not referable to local causes alone, but were immediately connected with the general condition of the Ottoman Empire."" Telegrams from Vienna state that Prince DANIELO, of Montenegro, was shot by an assassin on the 11th, and died on the 13th inst. Further intelligence is received by the Vanderbilt of the great progress made by the rebel factions in China, and much surprise is expressed that the Emperor does nor at once come to terms with the Western Powers.

I am not. as Mr. YANCEY expressed himself at the Maryland institute, upon the occasion of Mr. BRECKINRIDGE's nomination, merely neutral with respect to the continuance of the Union or its destruction; I am for the Union, and against disunion, at all times, without apology, or contingency, or qualification. The Constitution may be violated (as it often has been) by unfaithful public servants, or in the tempest, of faction, or from other causes; but our plain duty, as patriots, in every such emergency, is to invoke, again and again, and again, until seventy times seven, the sober sense and calm judgment of the people. If our Revolutionary fathers, under Washington could prolong an apparently desperate struggle for seven years -- driven from city to city, from camp to camp, from State to State, by superior numbers -- trampling the snows and ice of mid-winter with bare feet -- suffering two or three disasters for each victory -- and, at last, by sheer fortitude, achieve the liberty and independence we how enjoy, he does little honor to the memory of such ancestors (as it seems to me) who would now in our zenith of national and individual prosperity, abandon the great result of their labors -- the Union which they established -- without an equal exhibition of heroism. What can be more criminal than this modern habit of betaking ourselves, upon every trivial occasion, or even upon solemn occasions, to the jargon of Disunion, and secession, and revolution? I am not only opposed to it, gentlemen, tout I am tired of it, and disgusted with it. I hope to see the day when a public declaration from any man (ever so eloquent and distinguished) that he is ""neither for the Union nor against the Union"" will, instead of provoking thunders of applause, as in the Breckinridge Convention at Baltimore, be received with universal indignation and abhorrence. I have been a faithful Democrat ever since I had a vote; I love the Democratic Party, its principles, its policy, its usages of organization; I am proud of its history, and have always felt my heart throb with noble pulsations in musing upon Us future achievements; but with all this affection, and even with more than I have expressed, or can express, I declare to you, gentlemen, in all earnestness, that if Disunionists, or those to whom Union or Disunion is an affair of indifference, are now to become the leaders of the Democratic Party -- to prescribe the language of our platform -- to dictate, by means of secessions at Charleston and at Baltimore, whom we shall choose for candidates -- it will be high time for me, at least, to seek another and more congenial association.

The news is two days later than by the Vanderbilt.

He looks upon all as lost, and expects to die by the hands of an assassin, but expresses his determination never to quit Rome upon compulsion. Later advices from Syria represent that FUAD PASHA had surrounded Lebanon with troops, and had threatened to put all the Druse Shieks tco the sword if they did not surrender in two days. Twenty of them had been captured, and about eight hundred other important arrests had been made. A large quantity of plundered property had also been recovered. The Turkish Sultan had made a speech to the foreign Ministers, in which he expressed the determination to punish the Syrian offenders with the utmost severity. It was understood, also, that he was about to address another autograph inter to Queen VICTORIA and the Emperor NAPOLEON, in which he would express a desire to have the sole punishment of the criminals. An important report had been made by a select committee of the British House of Commons, in which they state that the condition of the laws regulating the national intercourse with France, Spain, Portugal and the United States is most unsatisfactory.

From the doctrine laid down in it, it was now sought to turn the people of the State of New-York, and as usual the attempt was made under a specious pretext.

Coroner O'KEEFE, on Monday, held an inquest upon the body, when it appeared in evidence that at the time in question some firemen were fighting among themselves and throwing stones at each other. The members of the Company to which deceased belonged were not engaged in the fight, and when deceased was struck he was standing quietly beside his engine. The stone was thrown by one of the contending parties, but by what particular person could not be ascertained by the Coroner. The deceased, after being struck, was conveyed to the New-York Hospital, where he remained a few days and then left, apparently well; but about a week ago he was attacked with congestion of the brain, which finally terminated his life. The medical testimony showed that the injuries to the head, inflicted on the 3d ult., had caused the congestion, and the jury rendered a verdict to that effect.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/28/archives/the-new-steam-line-to-jamaica-arrival-out-of-the-baltimore.html,,"The steamer Baltimore, recently dispatched from this port to Kingston and Aspinwall, by Messrs. BREAKSPEAR, FREUND & CO., as the beginning of a regular mail communication with Jamaica, was heard from at Aspinwall, the owners having received letters by the Ariel. The Baltimore made a good run out, and her arrival at Port Royal was greeted with much enthusiasm by the merchants and people, as the harbinger of better mail and passage facilities with New-York. At last accounts over twenty passengers were engaged for the return trip, and there were also liberal freight engagements. The Colonial authorities received the agents of the steamer with great cordiality, and, with a view to insure the early establishment of the line, the Postmaster-General agreed for the present not to insist upon the running of the steamer to Aspinwall. This relieves the enterprise of one great feature of embarrassment. The Baltimore was run to Aspinwall on her first trip only because the Jamaica authorities insisted on that part of the service being joined to the bi-monthly trip from New-York, in order to connect with the English mails to the South Pacific, and also to Australia, when that line shall have gone into operation. The advices from the agent who went out in the steamer, after his interview with the Governor and Postmaster-General, are very encouraging. The steamer is now about due at this port, with a good complement of passengers, and with a handsome return freight. This new enterprise has naturally excited opposition among those who have hitherto held the monopoly of the trade by sailing vessels, and disparaging rumors have been put in circulation, both here and in Jamaica, concerning the steamer now employed in the service. The Baltimore is a snug screw steamer of nearly three hundred tons, with good carrying capacity and cabin accommodations. She is nearly new, having been built in the latter part of the year 1858. She is rigged with three masts, her auxiliary canvas being sufficient to make good headway in case of accident to the machinery. She has also good provision against fire in the shape of force-pumps and other appliances.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Steam Line to Jamaica.; ARRIVAL OUT OF THE BALTIMORE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Steam Line to Jamaica.; ARRIVAL OUT OF THE BALTIMORE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6497781-a514-51d0-86a5-2032a6b668dc,355,nyt://article/a6497781-a514-51d0-86a5-2032a6b668dc

"A very interesting and pleasantly-contested game was played between these two strong Clubs on the Eureka ground at Newark on Monday, Aug. 27, when, after some most excellent batting and fielding being shown on both sides, the Eurekas came forth from the contest victorious. The Enterprise were weakened by the absence of three of their first nine players, their places being filled by substitutes -- one of them, Mr. Sutton, of the ""muffin"" nine, establishing a good claim to promotion. O'Neil, as catcher, did not allow many balls to pass, and guarded the bases so vigilantly that his opponents were very loth to run the hazard. Oddie pitched fairly, while Cornwell was very active at short, catching several balls and throwing with judgment to the bases; his batting was very successful. Chapman, at the first base, made some misses, but atoned for them by some brilliant, doings; and Start not only batted finely, but was very steady on the third base, making two very neat fly catches on foul balls. Smith and Ibbotson made two good catches each in the field -- one on the fly and one on the bound, and were efficient in other respects. Sutton distinguished himself by two catches, one very excellent, but was unfortunate at the bat. Boyd at the second was uncommonly slow, not distinguishing, himself by anything but his inefficiency. The Eureka fielding and batting were undoubtedly good, but did not equal their usual standard, several unaccountable misses being made in the field, and the batting not showing as successful as in their former contests this season. Pennington's play at the second would have been highly creditable but for two muffs on which bases were made. His pitching was very powerful and effective, but he lost too much time by walking up to receive the ball from the catcher. Davison, in the left field, let a few balls pass him, but distinguished himself by a splendid one-hand fly-catch, and by his excellence at the bat. Rogers, as catcher, did not do himself justice either in this position or in batting. Van Houten had little to do at short, and was out every strike, sometimes very closely indeed. Linen's reputation as a pitcher did not suffer on this occasion while his usual success followed him in batting. Collins, at centre-field, and while relieving Rogers as catcher, fielded most admirably, three well judged fly catches falling to his credit. Northrup, though not as reliable as usual on the first base, was most efficient at the bat, as was Oliver, who in addition made two splendid fly catches. The only demerit of Thomas was a wild throw to the first base, while the remainder of his fielding and his batting were equally praiseworthy. It would be unjust to conclude without commending the umpire, Mr. Dusenberry, who certainly filled that post in an able and satisfactory manner, his promptness being generally noticed. The best feeling was shown on both sides, and the departure of the train was the signal of hearty cheers from both Clubs for their rivals in the game.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/28/archives/base-ball-eureka-of-newark-vs-enterprise-of-brooklyn.html,,"A very interesting and pleasantly-contested game was played between these two strong Clubs on the Eureka ground at Newark on Monday, Aug. 27, when, after some most excellent batting and fielding being shown on both sides, the Eurekas came forth from the contest victorious.

We have examined it with some care. It is remarkable, both for what is in it, and for what is not. The public mind was anxious to know how the ten Union men placed on the Douglas electoral ticket were to cast their votes; whether it was agreed or understood that they were to cast them for BELL, or for DOUGLAS; or whether there was no agreement about it, but only an understanding that they were gentlemen who could be ""manipulated."" On these points we find, in this report of the result of the Committee's labors, some insinuations, some ""generalities,"" more or less vague and glittering, but no definite and positive information. Perhaps, as it was an address to the ""Union men,"" who were to be called on to vote the ticket, it was deemed unadvisable to be too explicit on this point. However, ""all's not lost that is delayed,"" and, unless we mistake the temper of the public mind, information on that point, definite and positive, must be soon forthcoming, or the people will mark their disapprobation of the transaction in a manner which will be definite and positive enough.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Address of the Bell and Douglas Union Committee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Address of the Bell and Douglas Union Committee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-08-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed129d11-39ab-5232-9000-1a3be3440028,1352,nyt://article/ed129d11-39ab-5232-9000-1a3be3440028

SCROGGS and request him to resign, but this request he declined to comply with. He also declined various other propositions made by them, in consequence of which it was resolved to meet in Convention with Gen. SCROGGS as President, but to take the business immediately into their own hands. As soon as the regular Convention was called to order a scene of the most ludicrous confusion commenced, which was only ended by the resignation of the Chair by Mr. SCROGGS, who, with his friends, left the Convention. Business then proceeded uninterruptedly, Gen. PRESCOTT being called to preside. A Committee on Credentials and Permanent Officers was appointed, who reported, of course, in favor of giving seats only to those who approved of the union with the Douglas Democracy on an electoral ticket, which union was fully indorsed. Gen. PRESCOTT was selected as President for the ensuing year, and JESSE C. DANN as Vice-President. A State Committee of fifteen also appointed. The question of suitable candidates to be supported for the State officers was referred to the State Committee, with power. Gen. SCROGGS and the other seceding members subsequently met at another hall, and effected a separate organization, of which Mr. SCROGGS was elected President for the ensuing year, and Mr. DUGANNE Vice-President.

"A DOMESTIC SQUALL IN THE STREET. -- The residents in the vicinity of Nelson-place and Eighth-street were treated yesterday to a scene which is at least of uncommon occurrence in that neighborhood. A well-dressed and moustached man, while passing up Nelson-place, was overtaken by a plainly but neatly-dressed woman, who accosted him in terms more forcible than polite. He pushed her away, and she screamed ""murder"" loudly. Windows flew up in every direction, and a crowd soon gathered. The woman, meantime, continued her tirade, and the man tried in vain to stop the flow of words. In return for some remark from him, she dealt him a blow across his face with the handle of her parasol, snapping the handle like a pipestem. Seizing the other end, she continued to belabor him over the face and shoulders until there was very little of it left. He managed to get the remnant from her hand, and tried to quiet her with soft words, but her rage was for some time unappeasable. At length, however, her passion having exhausted itself, she consented to walk along with him, but her countenance did not indicate that she felt any very great pleasure in his company. The accusation which she brought against him was that, after having seduced her from her husband, home and friends, he had deserted her, and left her to prostitution or starvation.

If any reliance is to be placed in the declaration of BRIGHAM YOUNG, such a contingency as this is far from probable. In a speech delivered very recently, in full conclave of the Saints in Salt Lake City, the Mormon Prophet expressly disavowed any design to change the quarters of the tribe. He declared it to be the settled purpose of the Mormons to occupy the land they now hold, to improve its capacities for the support of a large population, to develop its resources in every way, and to resist any attempt to deprive them of the privileges they enjoy. It is true that Brother BRIGHAM is sometimes insincere, not to say hypocritical, but it is also fair to presume that he is shrewd enough to know when he and his people are well settled. The Mormons have had but too great success in their defiance of the Government and in the resulting confirmation of their own power. They are very unlikely to relinquish the eligible locality which is now in their undisputed possession, or to make rash ventures for the sake of a possible advantage. Least of all, are they likely to return to Illinois, whence they were driven with ignominy and at a serious loss to themselves.

"A meeting of ""front bricklayers"" was held at the Jackson House, on the corner of Greenwich-avenue and Thirteenth-street, last evening, for the purpose of resisting the ""Bricklayers Protective Union.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/30/archives/meeting-of-front-bricklayers-a-union-of-capital-and-labor-advocated.html,,"A meeting of ""front bricklayers"" was held at the Jackson House, on the corner of Greenwich-avenue and Thirteenth-street, last evening, for the purpose of resisting the ""Bricklayers Protective Union."" It appears that the front bricklayers are a class of men who do such fine work as the fronts of houses only, and that their wages are from twenty-five to fifty cents per day more than the other class of bricklayers who do other kinds of work. The latter have organized them selves into a Union, and their constitution prohibits any member thereof from working with [???]bers. The consequence is that when a man who is not a member of the Union is working with one who is, the latter insists that he shall either ""quit the building"" or be will leave himself. The employers sustain those who have not joined the Union, and are generally inclined to prefer them to the other,but the combination is strong against them, and they are, consequently, obliged to protest themselves, as the Union pays something towards the support of such of its members as are out work. The Union at first charged but twenty-five cents initiation fee, and now they have raised it to $2, so that even if the front bricklayers were willing to join the society, they do not feel willing to pay such a sum, nor to have themselves placed on a level with the members as regards wages, which it is allege, is what the latter want. The front bricklayers have therefore, formed a temporary organization to resist the Society, and in imitation thereof give assistance to such men as have not joined it, and who have been deprived of work in consequence. This assistance is, however, by voluntary subscription. One hundred fifty names have already been enrolled, and they meet fortnightly simply to show that they will not join any society which has for its object the dietation to employers or workmen, whom the former shall employ, or at what wages the latter may work. At the meeting last evening, a gentleman from the Society informed the meeting that he intended to resign, and enroll his name with the non-society men. He further stated that he had given notice to the Socicty that unless they came to some arrangement, he should withdraw his name from the roll. The announcement was received with loud cheers. Several other persons signed their names to the roll during the evening, and after a speech from the Chair in support of a union between capital and labor, the meeting adjourned.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Meeting of Front Bricklayers.; A UNION OF CAPITAL AND LABOR ADVOCATED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Meeting of Front Bricklayers.; A UNION OF CAPITAL AND LABOR ADVOCATED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/63dc26b7-4878-5010-b031-19279444aea9,426,nyt://article/63dc26b7-4878-5010-b031-19279444aea9

In an affidavit made by the representatives of the companies before the Magistrate, they charge that the persons interested in the vessel had forged names of respectable mercha[???] to bills of lading and other papers, whereby the insurance companies were led to believe that the cargo was much more valuable than it really was; also that these persons had willfully run their vessel upon the rocks, thus causing her loss, as well as that of the cargo.

The inhabitants of Venetia do not wish to live under the rule of the House of Ha[???]sburg on any account whatever; the Government, after so many mismanagements, finds it impossible to satisfy them by friendly approaches; and the people, who have fed for so long a time on hopes of liberation, will only submit to be ruled henceforth under compulsion of its force. Such deep-rooted aversion on the part of its subjects would shake the courage of even the most resolute Government, especially when other nations reproach it with the rigor of its policy. And financial reasons make it still more difficult to keep up such a Government. The Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom has always been a source of revenue for the Empire, whatever may have been said to the contrary to the other subjects of the Emperor, in order to arouse their hatred against the Italian possessions of the Crown, which were said to be very ungrateful for the favors they received. These two provinces have paid far more taxes than were expended on their Government and internal development; their contribution to the expenses of the General Government was large in proportion. At present the revenues from Lombardy have ceased to flow into the treasury, while the occupation of Venice still demands an enormous military budget. The prosperity of this province must, under present circumstances, inevitably retrograde,the amount o[???] revenues diminish, and all commercial activity be checked by the insecurity of the future. And whilst the revenues diminish, the Government will be little inclined to, pay the expenses of a province whose future possession is so very doubtful.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Austria in Italy.; Translated for the Times from the National Zeitung.

Corkery, from all of which it appears that she has been swindling boarding-house keepers, hotel-keepers, livery-stable keepers, and others, for the past nine year. Mr. Frederick W. Dieterney, of No. 30 New-street, testified that he knew her in 1851, that he believes her real name is Sarah J. Corkery, and that she is about forty years of age. He states that when he became acquainted with her, she represented that she owned a beautiful place on Staten Island, had $10,000 worth of diamonds, which were given her by her ""dear father,"" who, she said, was King of Portugal, besides houses. &c. This valuable information cost him $300, which he loaned her. Mrs. Susan Ramsay, proprietress of the European House, No. 767 Broadway, testified that the lady had boarded at her house to the tune of $125, the first dollar of which she has not as yet seen, nor does she ever expect to be so favored. She told Mrs. Ramsay the old story about the ""charming place"" on Staten Island, the diamonds, horses. &c. After having boarded the lady for some weeks without receiving any remuneration, Mrs. Ramsay one day expressed an ardent desire to see the ""charming place,"" and the accomplished Senora Pedro actually went with her to Staten Island, and showed her a house belonging to Mr. Thos. Munroe, merchant, of this City, situated about a mile from Vanderbilt's Landing, which she said was her own. When Mrs. R. expressed a wish to go through the house, the Donna told her that she did not like to put its occupants to the inconvenience of showing it. Mrs. Mary Ann Forman, keeping a boarding-house at No. 37 Twenty-seventh-street, testified that the would-be Countess had made similar representations to her in regard to her property, diamonds, &c., and that after the said lady had boarded with her a while and paid nothing, she one day took it into her head to pay a visit to the Island, to see the ""charming place."" She accordingly did so, and searched the whole island for somebody who knew Senora Donna Pedro, but could find nobody, and finally the tax collector told her that no such person was taxed on the island. She came back and turned the lady out of doors. Mrs. Mary A. Bellinger, keeper of a boarding-house, and Mr. Holland L. Knight, proprietor of the Planter's Hotel, were also victimized out of board bills by the lady, and the general opinion of all the victims in regard to her was, that she is an adventurer, with no means whatever except her tongue and some pretty good clothes.

Mr. ELI THAYER, for instance, in that Worcester speech, which was reprinted in the TIMES yesterday, classifies Texas with Kentucky, as a State where the element of Slavery has almost ceased to augment, and where the institution, after a short period of stagnation, must presently begin to decline; whereas, so enormous is the yearly increase of slaves -- the result of immigration and reproduction -- that the number nearly doubles in each period of five years. From indications furnished by the report of the State Comptroller in 1858, there is every reason to anticipate that instead of 58,161, the number in 1850, the census of the present year will present 160,000.

Messrs. W.H. & J.S. DARLING, the builders of his wherry, were the hosts of the day, and invited some hundred friends to meet around their hospitable board. Their large boat-shop was temporarily transformed into a dining-hall, and the walls that were wont to echo with the noise of hammers, planes and saws, resounded with the grateful music of knives and forks. The odor of fresh shavings was deliciously intermingled with the aroma of hot-corn, and the ambrosial scents of varied fresh fruit. Here and there the table was dotted with sandwiches, (a la VAN TINE,) for the unbelieving, but, in honor, of the guest, the body of the repast was presented fresh from nature's kitchen, whose air is always heavy with sweet perfumes. Preliminary to the feast conversation wiled away the hour from twelve to one, while wistful eyes gazed upon the stores of good things. The lion -- or rather the lamb -- of the day, was, of course, the wherryman -- he who has rowed from Boston, recuperating himself solely from vegetable, and mainly fruit diet. Mr. MARTIN was affable as he was healthy, and good-naturedly responded to the hundred questions with which the listeners plied him. In the course of the interrogation he communicated the interesting information that he had for three years subsisted entirely on vegetable food, and for the last year mainly on fruit; that his health was much improved, his mind clear, his muscles hard, his strength increased, and his hopes for a Methusalehstic life ardent; that he didn't like milk for grown people; favored the grape, but not the juice of it; couldn't tell whether a tomato was a fruit or a vegetable, and seemed rather more inclined to desire the election of LINCOLN and HAMLIN than of any other candidates who have a possibility of being chosen. He thought that fruit diet was the best to train a man for a prize fight, and much more adapted to develop a great race than tough steaks, bean-coffee, sandy sugar, swill-milk, or indigestible cookery.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WHERRYBERRYMAN OFF FOR ALBANY.; A Semi-Vegetarian Collation to the Boston Wherryman His Departure and Escort, &c., &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE WHERRYBERRYMAN OFF FOR ALBANY.; A Semi-Vegetarian Collation to the Boston Wherryman His Departure and Escort, &c., &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-08-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89c9ee9c-eb65-55d6-b75e-01357f986b11,1123,nyt://article/89c9ee9c-eb65-55d6-b75e-01357f986b11

It has undergone complete renovation, and is as handsomely, and at the same time, as chastely decorated as any theatre to Broadway. To the good taste of Mr. GEORGE WOOD, the now lessee and manager, this improvement is to be credited. Nor was this the only improvement. A much higher order of performances than have usually been exhibited here, were introduced, and instead of the blue fire melodrama, the ""Lady of Lyons"" was put on the stage, with accessories that would not have disgraced any theatre in the City. Mrs. RYAN (KATE DENIN) personated Pauline, and accomplished the character very much to the satisfaction of the audience, if applause and showers of bouquets are any indications thereof. Claude Melnotte was quite respectably played by Mr. E.L. TILTON. He was, perhaps, not too melodramatic for sensation purposes, but his abilities would be improved by a diminution of muscular power. The whole performance was exceedingly creditable, and Mr. WOOD deserves the praise of the public for his effort, to improve the taste of the patrons of his theatre.
