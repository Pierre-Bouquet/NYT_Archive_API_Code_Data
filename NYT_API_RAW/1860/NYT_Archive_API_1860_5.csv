"The long-threatened disruption of the Convention at Charleston came at last yesterday. The indications early in the session pointed to that event as inevitable.

The President ruled that it was; and an appeal being taken, the decision was reversed by a decided majority, and so two votes for DOUGLAS set at liberty. This victory was followed up by the adoption of the minority report by a very large majority, averaging upon each resolution 272. Upon the attainment of this result, the delegates from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Texas and South Carolina, with a portion of the Arkansas delegation, after protesting against the action of the majority, retired, and repairing to St. Andrew's Hall, organized a separate body.

This seems to be regarded as a matter of very trifling consequence -- quite beneath the consideration of either combatant. The Tribune has a double object in view. Its first, and most difficult undertaking, -- upon which no one less sanguine and visionary would have ever ventured, -- is to ""shame the Express into telling the truth."" Its next task -- which may be easier, but is quite as profitless -- is to show that, ""if the City has been swindled, the responsible parties are Democrats."" The Express, on the other hand, contents itself with exclamation points, small capitals and a general howl. These exhaust its rhetoric, and habitually serve instead of logic. It seems to have a confused notion that, as the State is now in Republican hands, whatever mischief has ever been done within its limits is to be charged to the Republican account.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'West Washington Market.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'West Washington Market.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4df561b8-1ac9-5ccd-b79a-f1628430dad7,1273,nyt://article/4df561b8-1ac9-5ccd-b79a-f1628430dad7

"The inquest on the body of the female who was found gagged and sunk with a barrel of pitch at the York-street dock, on the 14th of April last, was concluded last night before Coroner MORRIS, at the Station-house in Jersey City. The announcement of the fact caused great excitement, and hundreds of people called at Dr. QUIDOR's office to view the head, which had been severed from the body and preserved in alcohol. Some of these called from motives of curiosity; others, thinking that that they might recognize it as is that of some person with whom they were acquainted, and of the whole number about forty persons were of the impression that the description which had been published answered in some respects that of missing friends. No person was known to have been missed from Jersey City, and the impression prevailed that the victim and perpetrators of the crime belonged in New-York. Coroner MORRIS accordingly applied to Deputy Superintendent CARPENTER to assist in unraveling the mystery, and Officers ELEER and YOUNG were detailed for the purpose. On the Tuesday following the discovery of the body, a genteel appearing young man called upon Dr. QUIDOR and asked to look at the head, stating that the description answered perfectly with that of his wife, with the exception that instead of one ear having been torn out, where they had been pierced for earrings; both had been torn out, but that one of them had been healed up, leaving a slight scar. The Doctor, on examination, discovered a scar as stated. The young man then departed, but returned again on the following day, and requested that the body might be exhumed -- stating, further, that, if it was the body of his wife, there would be found a small scar on the right groin, caused by an abscess; a peculiar, thick toe-nail on the right toe, and large bunions on the large toe-joints. Dr. QUIDOR, accompanied by Coroner MORRIS and the young man, proceeded to the New-York Cemetery and caused the remains to be exhumed, when the marks were all found as described. The young man, who is known as ""Boston Charley,"" stated that he had not lived with his wife for over two years; that she had resided at the Brandreth House, St. Denis Hotel, and other places, living a fast life. These facts were communicated to Deputy CARPENTER, and furnished a clue for the officers to work upon, and by which means they tracked Mrs. RICHARDSON for a period of over two years, during which time she lived in magnfficent style at the St. Denis; next to the house in Astor-place; from thence to the St. Julien Hotel; next to a private house in University-place; from there to the Lafarge House, whence she went on board the steamship Cahawba on the 12th of January, for New-Orleans, which was the last positive information they had of her.

"This Court met yesterday morning, pursuant to adjournment, Judge SUTHERLAND presiding. There were no cases ready for trial, but the unhappy youth, Henry Karples, Jr., was brought forward for sentence. This young man has occupied the attention of this Court, and that of the General Sessions, for several months. He was employed as a clerk in the service of the well known flour merchants, Hecker & Brothers, and his crime against them and society at large, was the embezzlement of 971 parrels of flour, during a period of twenty months, from October, 1857, to June, 1859 -- the value of said flour being $6,495. He is of highly respectable connections, and his case, in consideration of the position which he occupied, his youth, (he is not yet 21 years of age,) his education and former good character, has been one of much general interest.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/02/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Our references to the Charleston Convention must hereafter be placed in the dual number; for Charleston has two Conventions, the proceedings of which claim equal attention. The Southern Seceders, who on Monday afternoon bade solemn farewell to their fellows, and, taking up their cross, fashioned, doubtless, after the symbol of the Scottish tutelar Saint, repaired to St. Andrew's Hall, on the same evening met in conclave not unlike the primitive seceders from heaven, conferring over their deed and its momentous consequences. Mr. JOHN C. PRESTON, of South Carolina, spoke with great eloquence and at much length upon the subject, regarding the bolt as ""a great occasion -- a movement of the constitutional lovers of the Republic."" He was succeeded by Mr. YANCEY, of Alabama, who counseled delay, that the Southern delegates who still lingered in the Douglas Convention might yet consider, repent and withdraw. Only when Mr. DOUGLAS should be placed in nomination would the time for Southern action arrive. Mr. BAYARD, of Delaware, thought the spirit which ruled the regular Convention was less the spirit of Black Republicanism than of plunder. A call of the States was ordered when, in response to the State of New-York, a Wood delegate stated that his colleagues were present and prepared to sustain the policy of the seceders; and Mr. FISHER, of Virginia, when that State was named, declared that he would not be alone; and that he had invited Mayor ""WOOD to attend. Maryland made no response; two Delaware delegates were present, with a minority of the South Carolina delegation. The Monday evening meeting closed with an adjournment to the open air, where Mr. YANCEY addressed delighted multitudes. The National Convention met yesterday at the usual hour; when, prior to the commencement of business, a member of the Georgia delegation announced that after anxious consideration, he, with a number of his colleagues, felt constrained to enter their protest against the platform, and retire. Twenty-four arose at once and left; four others followed, declaring they never would abandon the majority; while eight retained their seats. The Arkansas delegation then bolted, leaving FLOURNOY alone behind; and the entire representations of Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina, with portions of those from Maryland, Delaware, and Kentucky, asked and procured leave to retire for consultation. Mr. COHEN, of the Georgia relict, obtained the floor, declaring his early and late devotion to the party, and his intention not to desert it ""until the last feather should be laid on the camel's back, when he would be the foremost to go."" Mr. FLOURNOY, of Arkansas, denounced the bolt as uncalled for, or at least premature, and expressed the opinion that it would fail to obtain the sanction of the great body of the Southern people. These apologetic and explanatory remarks were cut short by Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Pennsylvania, who wanted to hear no more of the bolters; but did greatly desire to proceed to business. The great struggle of the day was on a motion to abolish the two-thirds rule; Messrs. STUART and RICHARDSON advocating that measure, and Messrs. BIGLER and BUTLER opposing it. The contest prevented the attainment of a ballot. The bolting Convention succeeded in effecting an organization in the afternoon, choosing Mr. BAYARD, of Delaware, for President.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/55855abd-d57c-5d95-a1b2-20c787f3bcc2,1868,nyt://article/55855abd-d57c-5d95-a1b2-20c787f3bcc2

We acknowledge that New-York can learn a great deal from European cities in the matter of sanitary science; and we must say we think a pair of Common Councilmen would be just the fellows to bring us home all we ought to know. Their great familiarity with European languages, and with the ways of European society and governments, and their scientific attainments, would at once place them in the most agreeable relations with European officials; while the habits of observation, skill in classification of facts, and severely judicial tone of mind acquired by rigid training and great culture, would of course render their report a most invaluable contribution to the work of sanitary reform.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Committee on Bad Smells.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Committee on Bad Smells.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09697a2e-dd50-5355-a227-2e8cbecd068e,1062,nyt://article/09697a2e-dd50-5355-a227-2e8cbecd068e

"Rev. John James, of Missouri, entered a complaint last Saturday against James Duffy, the keeper of the notorious ticket swindling office, No. 109 West-street, charging him with having defrauded him out of the sum of $250 by false representations in the sale of passage-tickets by the steamer to California, whither the reverend gentleman desired to go. Mr. James alleges that, believing Duffy's to be the genuine office, he paid $600, as he supposed, for three first-class tickets, but, on presenting them on board the steamer, he learned that they only entitled him to the accommodations of the steerage, and that they could have been purchased for $350 at the office of the Steamship Co. As one of the provisions of the act passed by the last Legislature to prevent frauds in the sale of passenger tickets, makes it a misdemeanor, with a penalty upon conviction of imprisonment for not less than six months or more than two years, to charge more than the regular price for a ticket, whether the offender, be an authorized agent or not, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Duffy and one Charles Gilmour, his clerk, but both of them had placed themselves without the pale of the law by fleeing to Jersey City. Under these circumstances the complainant made a supplementary affidavit, based on another provision of the act in question, which declares that ticket offices of the description [complained of shall be proceeded against and broken up as disorderly houses. In the afternoon Capt. Hart, with two of his officers, went to the place for the purpose of arresting all persons they might find there; but its occupants had departed, and its doors were closed.

The figure which the United States cut in the affairs of the Territory, is a mixture of the comical and the absurd, which if it could be well put on the boards of a popular theatre, would make the fortune of the enterprising manager. We sent an army out, two years ago, to reduce the Mormons to subjection enforce our laws, and make our Courts respected. It has been so far successful in its mission as to put an end to all open rebellion; but there is no other mode of setting Governments at defiance, in which our fellow-citizens of that region do not still indulge. Not that the presence of the army is disagreeable to them; they are, on the contrary, so anxious to have it stay that a careless observer might come to the conclusion that they were penitent sinners, kissing the rod which has been the instrument of their chastisement and salvation. Their devotion to the ministers of our will is, however, due neither to loyalty nor to fear, but to that common-place instinct which makes every man who has cabbages for sale glad to find a purchaser. The camp is a good market for vegetables and forage; the profits of the Mormon farmers on the sales of these articles to the troops are said to reach half a million of dollars per annum; and under the circumstances they are, as our correspondent naively informs us, ""very desirous the army should remain.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs in Utah.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs in Utah.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ea72d1d0-89e9-5544-b43b-8993148d9a26,1044,nyt://article/ea72d1d0-89e9-5544-b43b-8993148d9a26

Two thousand volumes have been added to the Society during the year, besides a valuable collection of maps, pamphlets and statistics. The paper of the evenig was read by HENRY B. MILLANO, M.D. He estimated that nearly one-sixth of the deaths among the human race occur from consumpion. From statistics extending over a considerable period, he found that one death in every 5 7-10 occured from consumption. In New-York, from 1804 to 1820, one death in every 4 3-10 was caused by consumption; from 1820 to 1835, one in 5 4-10; from 1835 to 1850, are is 6 5-10; 1-13 to 1859, one in 8 46 1[???]; in Brooklyn, 1848 to 18[???], one in 8 11 100. Of leather in the army, be found that the greatest number of cases of consumption was from 6 9-10; to 3 2-10 annually for every thousand men, between latitudes 26° and 25° characterised by high temperature, copious rains and, excessive moisture. The smallest number of deaths was 1 3-10 per thousand men in New-Mexico, characterized by high land and dry atmosphere. While consumption is rare in countries of high latitudes, it is curious that in tropical countries the proportion of deaths is often too small to be calculated. In all Judea, in forty-three years only 29 died of consumation. The theory that the sea air may prevent, as welt as cure, consumption, is supported by statistics. In the British army out of 14,590 men, 51 died of censumsion; while out of 12,512 men is the navy only 19 died of that disease. Consumption is not necessarily more prevalent in large than in small cities. Among the trades and professions, the folllowing order of mortality by consumption was mentioned: The greatest was among tailors, shoemakers; next came blacksmiths, gardeners, bakers, butchers and lawyers. The mortality among tailors being four times that of the lawyers. The greatest mortality by consumption among males is said to be in the city. There is greater liability to consumption between the twentieth and thirtieth years of age than at any other period of life. The general conclusion was that humidity of the atmosphere is favorable and dryness unfavorable to the generation of the disease, but moist salt water is not calculated for its development. Want of exercise, and air, tend to produce it; lack of light does not. It is more prevalent among females than among males. There are no reasons for the conclusion that the disease is either on the increase or decrease.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Geographical and Statistical Society.; INTERESTING STATISTICS OF MORTALITY BY CONSUMPTION ANNUAL ELECTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Geographical and Statistical Society.; INTERESTING STATISTICS OF MORTALITY BY CONSUMPTION ANNUAL ELECTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2cd81874-3ee5-5bf9-b9e5-b8812528bb03,586,nyt://article/2cd81874-3ee5-5bf9-b9e5-b8812528bb03

The audience was quite small, not more than one hundred persons being present. The Chair was occupied by PETER BALEN, Esq., the President of the Society. After prayer by Rev. Dr. GILLKTTE, and reading of Scripture by Rev. J.R. STEWARD, the Secretary, Capt. FRISBIE read his report. Though the funds of the Society were of small amount, its success during the past year had been very great. In the Baptist Mariners' Church of this City three sermons were preached every Sunday, the services being attended by about 500 seamen while the average attendance on week days was 60 seamen. During the year 233,356 pages of tracts had been distributed, besides 120,151 religious books and papers. The Society were benefiting seamen belonging to thirty different nations, and especially in Sweden were its labors valuable. Dr. MULTERSVAND had sent very cheering reports to this country. He had suffered much persecution, and had been driven from his post of duty by ruffians, but he had persevered in his endeavors to convert souls, and had fought the good fight, What the Society needed were more colporteurs, more missionaries of those already employed, and more money to sustain them. After an original hymn, commencing ""The way of God is on the sea,"" had been sung, the meeting was addressed by Rev. Dr. HISCOX, of the Stanton-street Baptist Church. Rev. A.H. BURLINGHAM, of the Twenty-fifth-street Church, Rev JOSEPH STOCKBRIDGE, Chaplain of the Navy-yard, and Rev. J.R. STEWARD. A collection was taken up, and the audience separated.

Respect for the parents has caused the church officers to refrain from prosecution until the evil has become too serious to be longer winked at. The only wonder is, that these errant young gentlemen have contented themselves with pummeling the windows of a church: had they aped Congressional manners to the fullest extent, each would have dirked or killed a man or two.

Yesterday morning, as soon as the Conven tion had reassembled, Mr. RUSSELL, of Virginia offered a resolution that it adjourn to meet at Baltimore on June 18th, in order to afford States which were not represented an opportunity to fill up their delegations. A point of order was raised that action could not then be taken on the resolution but this was overruled by the Chair, and a motion to suspend the order to ballot was carried by yeas 199, nays 51. Various amendments were proposed by the opponents of the resolution to adjourn, but it was finally carried by 195 ayes to 55 nays. Gen. CUSHING then addressed the delegates, lauding them for the mutual forbearance they have displayed, and asking the pardon of those whom he might have offended by hasty expressions extorted by the exciting scenes through which they had passed. Immediately after the adjournment the wearied delegates took their departure for home. The seceders assembled at noon, about forty delegates being present. After a brief debate on the subject, Mr. JACKSON withdrew his resolution declaring it expedient for the Convention to express its preference for candidates for President and Vice-President. A motion was then made by Mr. BURROWS, of Arkansas, to appoint a Standing Committee to prepare and issue an address to the Democrats of the Union. This, too, was soon withdrawn, and a discussion sprang up as to whether the seceders, by the course they had taken, meant it to be understood that they were willing to dissolve the Union. Among others, Mr. HILL, of Georgia, utterly repudiated any such intention. Mr. YANCEY was drawn out by this denial and a sharp colloquy ensued. After a protracted debate in which speculations were freely indulged regarding the probable action of the National Convention, the Seceders adjourned without making any nomination.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4d7163f-f821-5235-bd66-e6dd33516cb1,1713,nyt://article/c4d7163f-f821-5235-bd66-e6dd33516cb1

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/05/archives/police-reports-an-unauthorized-speculator-in-city-lots-singular.html,,"A short time since, a young man named Lewis H. Lawson was arrested on a charge of burglary, and one Mr. Wilcox presented himself at the District-Attorney's office, and offered to become his surety, stating that he owned five lots of ground in Ninety-sixthstreet, worth $6,500, which was unincumbered. He asserted also that he had bought the property in question from one Roberts alias Lawson, a resident of Chicago. III., through Charles G. Thompson, a broker at No.95 Nassau-street, and at the same time produced the deed. The clerk, Mr. H.W. Allen, was not satisfied with these representations, and Mr. Wilcox went away, promising to return with proof of their correctness, Meantime, two gentlemen named Van Heuvel, who own a great deal of real estate up-town, appeared before the District-Attorney and complained that several of their lots had been fraudulently transferred by some unknown persons, and an examination showed that the identical land which Wilcox had stated belonged to him was part of that which the Messrs. Van Heuvel claimed. It subsequently transpired that Thomas Lawson, a man employed as copyist in the law office of Ex-Senator Westcott, in Clinton-place, had been engaged, it is alleged, in forging deeds, transferring up-town lots to which he had not the shadow of claim to persons who have not yet made themselves known. Lawson was arrested at his residence in Clinton-street, by Detectives Hampson and Devoe, and an examination of the charge against him was yesterday had before Justice WELSH. It is believed that the accused has forged deeds, transferring property to the value of $100,000, and in the progress of the investigation a deed, dated Jan. 3, 1860, was produced which purported to dispose of 57 of the Messrs. Van Heuvel's up-town lots for the sum of $55,000, to Ephraim R. Roberts, alias Lawson, by David S. Pike and Henry W. Morris � the two last-named individuals existing, it is believed, only in the imagination of the prisoner, Thomas Lawson. It was shown at the examination which took place before Justice WELSH, that Lawson, under the name of Roberts, gave a deed for a lot in Ninety-fourth-street, near Ninth-avenue, to one James M. Aldon for $500. The deed was dated Feb 29, 1860, and was acknowledged before Henry Farrington, Notary Public. Mr. Wm. H. Stansbury deposed that Lawson, on the 20th ult., accompanied by two other men, ca[???] to his office, and by making the prescribed affidavit induced him to write an acknowledgment or deed purporting to be from Ephraim R. Roberts to Smith Wilson, to which Lawson signed the name of the grantor. Three similar transactions were testified to by Henry Farrington, a Commissioner of Deeds, as having occurred during last February between the accused and himself. On the strength of these affidavits Lawson was committed for trial, to answer four separate charges of forgery. In consequence of other developments which were elicited during the progress of the examination, the magistrate issued warrants for the arrest of Charles G. Thompson, and his son Charles P. Thompson, brokers, lately having an office at No. 85 Nassau-street, who are alleged to be implicated in the forgeries, and the young man was arrested last evening, and committed pending an examination.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Reports.; AN UNAUTHORIZED SPECULATOR IN CITY LOTS SINGULAR CASE OF FORGERY.

"The Springfield Republican, of the 26th, tells of the following curious freaks played by electricity: ""About 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, during the heavy snow-squall prevailing at the time, a singular phenomenon was observed at the telegraph-office in this city. A strange ticking noise was heard coming from the 'switen,' where most of the wires running through the office are connected. The sound was loud and similar to that produced by steam raising the lid of a kettle of boiling water, in escaping. The operator commenced 'testing' the various wires, and found that the noise proceeded from a wire that was 'open' or disconnected in the Springfield office, and running only to Hartford, where it was also open. From this wire the operator received a shack that completely paralyzed his arm, and at the same time a spark of intense brilliancy was emitted from the end of one of fiugers. This noise and the heavy current upon the wire disappeared simultaneously with the squall. There was nothing about the switch that could have vibrated so as to produce the sound, and even if there had been, electricity was never before known to make such a noise under like circumstances. Upon calling the attention of the Hartford operator to the fact, [???]e tested, and reported similarly, adding that there must be something peculiar about that wire, for his arm was nearly broken.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/05/archives/news-items.html,,"The Springfield Republican, of the 26th, tells of the following curious freaks played by electricity: ""About 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, during the heavy snow-squall prevailing at the time, a singular phenomenon was observed at the telegraph-office in this city.

"The mails by the steamship Canada, which arrived here last evening from Boston, bring interesting additions to the telegraphic abstract. The prize-fight, still engrossing public attention, provokes continued discussion in the London papers; the English party persisting in the claim of a victory for SAYERS. Testimonials of every possible description, with no end of money, sent to the English champion, attest the popular conviction of his success. In the House of Commons on the 19th inst., an interesting discussion upon the Continental relations of England was provoked by a motion and speech of Mr. HORSMAN. Lord JOHN RUSSELL took occasion to review the recent history of British diplomacy, justifying the scope and details of the commercial treaty; and while regreting the acquisition of Savoy, referring to the possible results of an approaching Conference to remedy any mischiefs the act might involve. From Naples, we have abundant evidence that revolt is a-foot throughout the rural districts of Sicily, while the royal troops are shut up in the towns, not daring to leave the shelter of the walls. Rumors were generally current, but not credited in proper quarters, that GARIBALDI was about to pass into Sicily to place himself at the head of the insurgents. In their present unorganized condition, they can hardly hope to make headway against the large forces which the Government are flinging into the island. Gen.

"Another of those interminable ticket-swindling cases which invariably occur prior to the sailing of every California steamer, came up yesterday before the City Marshal. The victim was a Buffalo gentleman, who probably has not yet availed himself of the new facilities for getting early New-York papers via the Newspaper Express, consequently he met a confiding friend, who, in consideration of an instantaneous attachment, agreed to procure him a steerage passage in the Northern Light, notwithstanding that the regular office was closed.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/07/archives/the-papal-question.html,,"We translate to-day from our foreign files a correspondence which the future historian of our times, let us hope, will peruse with half incredulous amazement. Thanks to the liberal and open spirit which roles in the domestic as well as in the foreign policy of the Sardinian Government, the letters exchanged between PIUS IX. and VICTOR EMANUEL II on the subject of the annexation of the Roman Legations to Sardinia, have been fearlessly published to the world. The Roman Pope and the Italian King stand forth in this correspondence, each in the light of his own ideas, to be judged by the present age and by posterity. The vague and paltering generalities of denunciation behind which Pope PIUS shrouds his notions of justice, propriety, and public right, in his preposterous Bull of Excommunication, find no place in these direct communications with the Prince whose conduct he assumes to judge. VICTOR EMANUEL and COUNT COVOUR, by the firm and dignified clearness with which they put the whole case of the Legations before the Papal Government, drive PIUS and ANTONELLI into the necessity, so dreadful to the wily clerical mind, of answering flatly to the point. And we repeat, that in the faith which no lover of his race can willingly resign -- that those who pretend to represent the ""author of justice"" and the religion of truth may one day be shamed by the enlightened intelligence of the world out of the lust of earthly power and the hypocrisies of temporal ambition -- we find ground for hoping that it will be difficult for our children to believe that the name of the ""Vicar of Christ"" was ever subscribed to these epistles from the Vatican. Anything more intemperate in tone, more shameless in its disregard of simple historical truth, and more insolently scornful of human rights and their political guarantees, than the letters of PIUS IX., it would be hard to find, even in the medjaeval archives of the Papacy. VICTOR EMANUEL sets before the Pope, in language equally explicit and respectful, the absolute necessity which the position of Italy imposes upon every Italian sovereign, of consulting the irrepressible wishes and yielding to the legitimate demands of the Italian people. He reminds the PIUS of 1860 that the PIUS of 1847 was the first Italian Prince who recognized this necessity; and urges him, by every consideration which ought to move a Christian and patriot, to throw the weight of his authority with and not against the righteous movement of the times. The Pope in reply has nothing but insolence for the sovereign who counsels him, and contempt for the people in whose name that sovereign pleads. He will roll back the tides of the ocean, stop the sun in mid-heavens, thwart the glorious crystallization of Italy into a great Power lighted by libery and ruled by law[???] and he will excommunicate anybody and everybody who dares to interfere with him in these feasible and laudable enterprises. BONIFACE himself, flying before the Colonnas whom he had outraged, was not more obstinate or more insane; but the world was quit of BONIFACE with no great damage to the Church which he misruled. PIUS IX. is dragging the chair of St. Peter down with himself into that most hopeless of all abysses -- the abyss of universal contempt. In the great days of the Roman Church, the Popes maintained themselves against earthly monarchs because their temporal weakness was strengthened by the stand they took for the laws of heavenly justice against the superstitions and the brutality of military force. VICTOR EMANUEL and PIUS IX. reverse the picture. The temporal weakness of the Papacy is married now to a moral corruption and a political ignorance which it is hardly safe to exhibit to the Nineteenth Century, in open contrast with the armed loyally and the powerful moderation of a great people and their elected king.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Papal Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Papal Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1ce5a130-ab72-5c47-8601-4b7181af92e0,1456,nyt://article/1ce5a130-ab72-5c47-8601-4b7181af92e0

Looking around the ward we noticed two patients whose condition was unusually interesting; the one, PATRICK FOLAN, convalescent from a frightful wound, which many at the time considered fatal. He was at work int he Bergen Tunnel when a rock gave way from above and struck his right shoulder taking away his arm. Being of an excellent constitution he survives, -- perhaps to add still more to the number of his escapes. He has been confined several times within a year for broken ribs, legs and arms. He says at one time his knee-pan �was broken in three halves,"" an expression which will indicate his nationality. The other, GEO. BAKER, with fracture of the spine, producing paralysis of the lower parts of the body. He was mate of the brig Benjamin Delano, and on April 12th was in the top overhauling the signal hailiards, when he fell over, striking the rigging in his descent. He is in pretty good spirits, though his friends scarcely hope for his recovery. In the same ward is OWEN KELLY, who dislocated his hip six months ago, while in the Bay of Biscay, without having it set. The surgeons of New-Orleans told him that the socket of the hip had been filled up in consequence of the long time that had elapsed since the accident occurred, and that there was no remedy. He has been in the straight apparatus here for live weeks, and now uses the limb, which is gradually resuming its natural place and appearance. In the main house, Dr. DELL informs us, LETITIA KNEE, who was accidentally shot by a pistol on the morning of April 10, will save her finger, though it will be much shortened. NERONIQUE MARCHAND, a bright child of 13 years, is the only one of the sufferers by the Elm-street catastrophe now remaining in the Hospital. She fell from the fifth story, and received a compound fraction of the thigh. She is still confined to the bed, though the limb is in a prosperous condition. Of the others of her friends who left the fifth story with her, FRANCIUS VOPEL left the Hospital as soon as her burns were healed, and a few days ago she left for Paris, where she hopes to recover from her extreme nervous irritability. Mr. BERNARD, who received no external injuries by the fall, having no means to enable him to remain in the Hospital, has been living with acquaintances at No. 192 Mulberry-street, on credit. He still suffers much, but is now earning a little by his trade, the needle.

"The annual sermon of the American and Foreign Christian Union, preparatory to the anniversary meeting on Tuesday next, was preached last night a the Tabernacle Church, (Dr. THOMPSON's,) corner of Thirty-fifth-street and Sixth-avenue, by Rev. Dr. HAGUE. The reverend gentleman announced the subject of his discourse to be ""God's covenant against Paganism,"" and read his text, Psalm xxv., 14: ""The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his covenant."" A cloud of gloomy mystery, the preacher said, overhung the moral con. omy of the world, but Christianity was uplifting the veil. It was, indeed, strange that a new and even a worse Paganism should have arisen upon the ruins of the old, and that after a pure religion had been specially revealed at Bethlehem, the majority of our species should be slaves of a degrading superstition -- of an ""oppressive Churchianity"" of the dominant Church of Rome. Under a new name, a worse than the old Pantheon was restored in Rome. Instead of a Pagan Pontifex, there was a Papal one. Far nobler was it to adore the demigods of old Rome than to bow down to an image which was called God's mother. God forbid that one should cast censure on the splendid mythology of Greece and Rome, and look with an eye of commendation on that modern Paganism taught in the Papal Church. The Mahomedans were, in the score of morality, superior to Catholics, and the Empire of Japan stands higher, to-day, in the scale of civilization than Italy, Spain, or Portugal. The Pope's power was gone. He excommunicated Sardinia, but VICTOR EMANUEL laughed at the foolish old man, and bade him mind his own business. The reverend preacher eulogized the American and Foreign Union, and said that in Italy the people were crying for Bibles. A great field was before them, in which to work, and the secret of their strength was that God was with them. After prayer and benediction by Rev. Dr. CAMPBELL, the audience separated. The anniversary meeting of the Society will be held at St. Paul's Methodist Church, in Fourth-avenue, on Tuesday evening, when the report of the Secretary will be read, and several influential ministers, among whom is Rev.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/08/archives/how-to-improve-our-rulers.html,,"For whatever color of truth can be found in the charge brought against the ""institutions"" of the United States by Earl GREY, that the great mass of the people never know who their member is in any legislative body, the City of New-York, as now administered, is mainly responsible. There are very few decent citizens of New-York who can tell without referring to a �Manual� who is their representative, either in the Board of Aldermen, in the Common Council, in the State Legislature or at the Federal capital. We venture to say that two-thirds of the constituents of any member of either branch, are in blissful ignorance of the splendid figure which these municipal statesmen are making in public life. Each citizen knows, as a matter of fact, that he lives in a certain Ward, and he presumes that those provisions of the Charter are regularly carried into execution, which direct the election of a certain number of Aldermen and Common Councilmen to represent it in the City Government. But more than this he does not often know; and his ignorance has now lasted so long that in the majority of instances he has ceased to care. Who selects the candidates -- who works to secure their election -- what their antecedents are -- what are their claims and qualifications -- who it is that showers �tickets� into his house on their behalf for a week before the election, -- he cannot pretend to guess, and rarely takes the trouble to inquire. And when the Booles and the Bagleys, immediately on entering office, begin to rig out roving sanitary commissions, lavish �municipal hospitalities� on Turks and Japanese, accept proposals to pilot the Great Eastern, build monuments to national heroes, and release ruffians from station-houses, fully two-thirds of the population are utterly unable to say what quarter of the City it is to which these great men owe their appearance in public life.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How to Improve our Rulers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How to Improve our Rulers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01020814-0398-5bb3-9701-120c80ec5b14,1339,nyt://article/01020814-0398-5bb3-9701-120c80ec5b14

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/08/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- ROSSINI's opera of ""Moses in Egypt"" was revived here last evening, after a long and undisturbed slumber. The work is by no means a novelty in New-York, having been played by the Seguin Troupe at the old Park Theatre, and subsequently in Italian by the forces under MARLI. In another shape -- as an oratorio -- it has been illustrated more or less successfully by almost every choral society in the City. The special merit of the present version is its excellent stage dress. Good scenery, good dresses, and much general propriety of mise-en scene have been expended on it, and successfully as regards all that related to the eye. We doubt very much if a greater degree of general excellence in these very satisfactory respects could be attained in any theatre of Europe. The success of ""Moses,"" however, does not rest entirely on such matters. The music, without being difficult, demands careful treatment at the hands of artists who must possess all the facility of ROSSINI's exploded school, with some of the vigor of the modern one. There are moments when it approaches to declamation, and when vocal force and dramatic intelligence are as much needed as the mere ability to sing triplets, or any other purely Rossinian conceit. Sufficiently cast, therefore, the opera is not an unfruitful one in its opportunities; successes -- at rare intervals -- have been made in it.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cfbd797c-17dc-5637-a06e-c8f955c74d50,575,nyt://article/cfbd797c-17dc-5637-a06e-c8f955c74d50

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/08/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Mr. ANTHONY yesterday presented to the Senate a remonstrance against any alteration in the patent laws, which should take away from patentees the right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner. A bill was passed to settle the titles to lands set apart for the half-breeds in Kansas. The resolutions of Mr. DAVIS, which have already furnished the topic far protracted debate, came up. Mr. DAVIS himself spoke at length in their support. He alluded to cotton as the great bond of Union between the North and South; said the South demanded protection because it was her right, as well as the duty of the General Government to extend it. He thought Congress had the power to establish governments temporarily in the Territories, and declared it as his opinion that the election of a Republican President would be in itself an overt act, which the South would be perfectly right in considering cause sufficient for a dissolution of the Union. Some remarks of Mr. DAVIS brought out Mr. BROWN, who repudiated any sympathy with Mr. DOUGLAS. By way of demonstrating his sincerity, he offered as a substitute for the second and third of the resolutions, of which he is the author, one declaring it to be the duty of Congress to pass such laws as shall extend to slave-property the same protection which other property enjoys. Mr. CLINGMAN followed Mr. BROWN, but before he had concluded, the Senate adjourned. The House passed, without debate, a bill reported by Mr. BURLINGAME from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, authorizing the appointment of a full Minister to Sardinia, at a salary of $12,000, with a Secretary, at $1,800 per annum. On the motion of Mr. GROW, the debate on Territorial affairs was postponed until Thursday, in order to take up the Tariff bill, that some of the members of the House might set themselves right on that question before leaving for Chicago. It was also resolved to close the debate at 1 o'clock to-day. Messrs. SHERMAN, GROW, BLAIR and STEVENS spoke at length in favor of the measure. Mr. SCHWARTZ, of Pennsylvania, took occasion during the course of the debate to defend himself from the attacks of the Constitution.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f292b4e3-dc06-5bd3-bad2-af8a6f0b42b4,1978,nyt://article/f292b4e3-dc06-5bd3-bad2-af8a6f0b42b4

In particular he takes stand against those two old dogmas which inculcate the hygienic necessity of rising from the table hungry, and from bed sleepy. He says, never rise from table unsatisfied; never get out of bed so long as you have any inclination to lie there. And the Doctor's prescription is not only pleasant but sensible. If one is to rise from eating hungry what use of sitting down at all? And in relation to early rising, our sympathies have always been with the boy, who, when his father attempted to cut off his morning nap with that rusty old saw about the bird and the worm, replied that it served the worm right -- he hadn't any business to get up so early. As regards the distinguished author of the saying that four hours of sleep were enough for a man, five for a woman, six for a child, and seven for a fool, we have always inclined to think that he was entitled to avail himself of the latter clause and sleep a good seven, for which reason he felt no compunction in curtailing the sleep of others.

While the commercial centre creeps towards Union-square, the residential quarters stride by the half-mile towards the Central Park. And as population and business increase in a much greater ratio than the means of transit, the demand for some radical improvement in our City locomotion is becoming imperative. The average time occupied in getting down town, including that wasted in waiting for vehicles, or going afoot in default of a chance to ride at all, can hardly be less than three-quarters of an hour. In a few years the distance will be doubled, and since the speed of horses is limited by nature, while that of steam in the streets is limited by law, the time is likely to be doubled also. Two hours and a half to three hours in getting to and from business! One could better go fifty miles into Jersey. The entire upper part of the island offers every advantage to residents, except accessibility. Any respectably-rapid means of communication would give it the highest advantage in this regard also, over the Long Island and New-Jersey suburbs, since these only communicate with the business centre by a most dilatory and disagreeable transhipment in ferries and omnibuses. A Long Island Railroad bridge over the East River, and a New-Jersey tunnel under the North River, would indeed remedy the difficulty, but we do not anticipate immediate relief in these directions.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How to Get Down Town.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How to Get Down Town.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/479cf819-7c7f-5d60-b889-094fceb8115f,932,nyt://article/479cf819-7c7f-5d60-b889-094fceb8115f

Mr. CLINGMAN subsequently resumed his remarks in opposition to the resolution of Mr. DAVIS, commenting on the schism in the Democratic faith, but predicting an early return to unity. For himself, he was ready to support any good Democrat, whether it be DOUGLAS, HUNTER or JOHNSON. Mr. BENJAMIN, of Louisiana, made a speech advocating generally the principles enunciated by the Mississippi Senator, but dissenting from some of his extreme inferences. Mr. DOUGLAS expressed his desire to reply to Mr. DAVIS as soon as practicable; and after the friends of the Homestead bill had vainly endeavored to bring that measure to a vote, the Senate closed its deliberations in Executive Session. The House, in Committee of the Whole, listened to Mr. HOUSTON, of Alabama, in an argument against the Tariff bill. Mr. HOUSTON declared that the act of 1857 had not been sufficiently tried; that its revenue was annually increasing, and that in another year it would meet the economical wants of the Government. Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont, explained the leading provisions of the bill; and Messrs. TAYLOR and MILLSON endeavored to amend it by increasing the duty upon sugar. A desultory conversation ensued upon the demand of the Republicans that a vote be taken. They urged the necessity of the vote on the ground of the approaching Convention at Chicago calling away large numbers of that party. The Democrats resisted the vote because but few of their party were present, and because but two had yet spoken against the bill. Every attempt at a call of the House resulting in the want of a quorum, at 8 o'clock the House adjourned.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90ec5f44-e180-55e4-86c9-8bc03bb7e90f,1169,nyt://article/90ec5f44-e180-55e4-86c9-8bc03bb7e90f

The attendance was not very large, and there were certainly more ladies than gentlemen present. A letter from G.M. BRIGGS, the President of the Society, was read, in which he regretted that sickness prevented his attendance. Mr. CORNING, in consequence, was called to the Chair. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. CHEEVER, and, after a brief address from the Chairman, who regretted the failure of the Maine Liquor law, but saw in recent legislation in this State, and in the rapidly-onward-marching progress of public opinion, decided cause for hope that the traffic in rum was drawing near its end, the Annual Report was read by the Secretary, Dr. MARSH. This report represented the Society in being in a most flourishing condition. During the past year, 5,000 drinking houses had been closed, and donations exceeding in amount $1,400 had been received. The cause of Temperance was everywhere progressing. Gen. SMITH offered a resolution that the report should be published, and Dr. STEPHEN H. TYNG seconded it in a long and characteristically humorous speech. The fight of the advocates of Temperance with the rum-sellers, he said, had been from the beginning like going down to the wolf's den to murder him, or to bring him up alive. In that beginning it was not thought inconsistent for those who denounced the rum-seller -- ladies as well as gentlemen -- to drink their port wine and Nayau after dinner. Then came those who denounced the drunkard, who would not drink the port wine, but had nothing to say against cider and beer. The question before the Society now was, how to overturn the power of the enemy, and dispose of all the wolves of the flock. The question must be met in its broadest aspect, and, as that noble mother in the time of the Revolution told her son, that if he was wounded in battle the wound must not be in his back, so there must be no wound in the back parts of the members or friends of this Society. There must be no going back, no reversing. Onward and ever onward, and, if to fall was inevitable, to fall nobly fighting. True it was that the enormity of liquor-selling seemed greater every day, and yet never, in the thickest of the fight hitherto, did victory seem so near. The foes of the cause were men of vast rotundity, lager-bier sellers, corpulent persons, whilst its friends were ""snivelling persons,"" Independents, Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, and other individuals who agreed with them, that intemperance was a crime and a curse. But a thousand of these rotund enemies could be scared to death by one of these ""sniveling parsons."" If politicians were left to deal with the matter, the rum party would have its own way -- Republicans and Democrats being alike corrupt in such an instance, but honest men had also to talk about it, and by-and-by the rum party must go down. The last year was the heaviest year of warfare they had seen. The license system was such that a man who would pay ninepence might kill his (the speaker's) son, and if the father knockep the fellow's teeth down his throat, he might, for this act, spend six months in the Tombs. The fellow need not take out his license, but he can get his essential oil, or if he takes out his license, he may scatter his infernal poisons wholesale on the authority of that license. The day would come when LYMAN BEECHER's six sermons, preached in 1806 or 1807, which roused the nation then, would be looked upon within veneration. It was a fact which had come to his (Dr. TYNG's) knowledge, that distillers of liquors, who owned princely houses, owned also one hundred rum shops, and placed green young men in them to scatter poison over the City. Their retribution was sure to come, for to doubt it was absolute atheism; otherwise everything would really be going to the devil.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The American Temperance Union.; MEETING AT DR.

The Eighth Company of the National Guard, and the officers of the First Division, in full uniform, marched to the house of Gen. SANDFORD, in Twenty-second-street, and escorted the remains to the church. The pall-bearers were officers of the Major General's Division Staff. The chapel was nearly filled with the military and the friends of the deceased. The services of the Episcopal Church were read by Revs. Dr. HIGBEE and MORGAN DIX, of Trinity Church, assisted by a chair, who chanted the anthem in a most impressive manner. The coffin was made in the English fashion, covered with black cloth, with elaborately chased silver mountings. The military cap, accoutrements, and sword of the deceased were placed on the lid, and a simple inscription on the plate gave the date of his birth and death. At the conclusion, of the services, the body was taken to Trinity Cemetery, accompanied by his relations and immediate friends only, the military presenting arms as it was borne from Trinity Chapel. Among those present we noticed Gen. PAEZ, and Generals Hall, Spicer, Ewen and Gates, with Colonels Van Buren, Lefferts and Portley, and Majors Hallock and Pond, and Lieut. Stone all of the State Militia. The respect paid yesterday at the obsequies of Col.

"HOW DEMOCRATS STEAL SLAVES. -- The Boston Atlas and Bee, of yesterday, states that a fugitive slave came as a passenger to that city by the S.R. Spaulding, which brought the Democratic Delegation from Charleston. The Atlas says his name is NORRIS; he is about 35 years old, is decidedly African, and belongs to the estate of THOMAS DIXON, Georgia, of Mason and Dixon's line fame. He was second engineer on a tow-boat running between Savannah and the River Tiber, South Carolina. He was regarded as a good hand, reliable, safe and all that, and had performed a great amount of hard labor for his masters. NORRIS looks as though he could do much service ye, even in a northern atmosphere, where he proposes to spend a few years or more, having taken his liberty in his own hands. Though not as bright looking as some negroes we have seen, he is yet sufficiently smart to have successfully played a card or two that will not be thought to be so bad. The tow-boat, it seems, had extended somewhat its regular trip and visited Charleston, in the harbor of which city it remained for a while. NORRIS, no doubt, had the freedom of the city, after a fashion. He appears to have made a practical use of the privilege extended to him. It is pretty certain that he went on board the Spaulding several times; that as a boatman he was a sort of boon companion with the crew and hands for the time; that he concluded to take passage, and finally that he did take passage. It seems that he got a good position on board, (in the fore part,) that he was not discovered, and that he arrived in Boston without putting the captain or anybody else either to the trouble or expense of stopping other vessels bound South or elsewhere. For his quiet conduct he is to be commended, and his example should not be forgotten by those who in the future take passage, under similar circumstances, from a Southern port.

The band, composed wholly of the b[???]nd, played better than they have done for some years, showing excellent proficiency. Its members continue under the instruction of Mr. REIFF. The teacher of vocal music is Mr. LASON, who has tutored the children in the performance of difficult choru[???]es. In his absence, owing to illness, Mr. TIMM played the accompaniment.

The meeting was very thinly attended, not more than thirty persons being present. Tne services were opened with the customary forms of Episcopalian worship; Rev. Dr. WELLS, of Boston, and Rev. GEO. LEAKIN, of Baltimore, the officiating clergymen. The discourse was delivered by Rev. THOS GALLAUDET, Rector of St. Ann's, his text being a portion of the 17th verse of the 2d chapter of 1 Peter, ""Love the brotherhood."" Dr. GALLAUDET considered this injunction one of the most important given by the apostles. Love to God and our neighbor should always temper our regard for our own welfare. It was to further this object that this organization was devised. He represented this Brotherhood as being simply a body of young men gathered together to visit the sick, succor the needy, invite those who otherwise would be disposed to violate the Sabbath to attend divine service, and other wise to advance the cause they had e[???]sed. The body should consist of at least 500 young members; they should number a proportion of those who labor for bread where God has placed them, It should be conducted upon the mutual-benefit system, but not so much so as to lead to selfishness. It should rather be made a sort of Church Exchange, where all may mingle together and communicate freely. Such organizations should be established in all the larger cities; they should always bear the noble objects of their creation in view, and so labor as some day of attain grand results. Dr. GALLAUDET said that, despite all obstacles, they had steadily held on their way for ten years. The existence of the Brotherhood was a proof that young Christians desired to work, were willing to leave [???] speculations, and enter the working ranks. The Christian Church is the one grand society that outstrips and overshadows all others. Jesus is its corner stone, and it is for his glory that all should chiefly labor. The Brotherhood should love the ministers of the Church and endeavor to support their efforts; they should also love the sacraments of the Church, and disseminate clear views in relation to these sacraments, doing away with the idea that communion is only meant for those who have nearly reached perfection. On the contrary, it is meant as an aid for those who are struggling on. Again he enjoined upon the Brotherhood to so love each other as to cause the unconverted in all parts of the earth to exclaim: ""See how those Christians love one another,"" and to go forth from this day determined to make this organization more perfect than ever as a means for glorifying God and doing good to men. The services closed with the administering of communion.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Brotherhood of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States.; TRIENNIAL CONVENTION SERMON BY REV.

"Joel W. Foote, residing at No. 174 West Twenty-first-street, and Cornelius Totten, a real-estate broker, having an office at No. 12 Wall-street, were yesterday arrested and detained for examination on a charge of having been engaged with Charles G. Thompson, Charles P. Thompson, Smith Wilcox, Albert S. Wells, Hamilton W. Shipman and Thomas Lawson in the recent alleged fraudulent sales of up-town lots. Within a few days, Emiliano Bergomini and Dominico Cella, both Spanish gentlemen, who formerly were joint owners of a farm in Orange County, New-Jersey, have sworn to the fact that during the month of last January they were induced, by an advertisement in the daily papers, to visit the office of Charles G. Thompson, who represented himself to be a real-estate broker, for the purpose of disposing of their property. At the interview, Thompson agreed with Mr. Bergomini to exchange the farm for certain lots in Ninety-fifth and Ninety-sixth streets, which he said belonged to Lawson, whom he represented to be a person of vast wealth, nearly connected with George Law, and an intimate associate of Ex-Senator Wescott. Subsequently Thompson visited the farm in question, appraised its value at $6,000, and the necessary papers required in a legal transfer of the up-town real estate were made out and furnished by Thompson, Lawson and Shipman, who in turn received from the Spaniards a deed of the Jersey farm. Mr. Bergamini not long afterwards ascertained that the lots in Ninety-fifth and Ninety-sixth streets, which had been with such facility deeded to himself and friend, were the property of the Messrs. Van Henvel, and that Thompson and Company had not the shadow of a claim to them. So frequently has the farm which Mr. Bergamini once owned passed from one sharper to another that, so far, he has failed to discover the original deed. Another gentleman, also an owner of property in New-Jersey, has been victimized in a similar manner, and he is now preparing the necessary affidavits against the accused, who in this instance disposed, it is said, of the real estate of F.B. Cutting, Esq., without that gentleman's assent. The younger Thompson is also made the subject of a charge of perjury, preferred by the District-Attorney. It is alleged that he lately went bail for his father, who had been arrested on a complaint for false pretences, and swore before Justice Quackenbush that the house and lot No. 96 East Twenty-sixth-street, valued at $12,000; was his property. It has since transpired that the owners of the house and lot are Messrs. Nunns & Clark, piano-forte dealers, and that Thompson had no claim to the property. The case is still under investigation by Justice WELSH, and the testimony against the parties in custody is said to be very strong, while many others are suspected of complicity in the transactions.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/11/archives/police-reports-more-speculators-in-city-lots-arrested.html,,"Joel W.

It is a crime to fight a duel, even if it prove a bloodless duel, or to assist another in fighting one; but when the conflict eventuates in a very cool and deliberate murder, the offence receives the last degree of aggravation. The guilt of causing BRODERICK's death rests, of course, in the first instance on TERRY, but in the second on BENHAM, who seems to have assisted in the matter with a very hearty good will, and to have hated BRODERICK with a very hearty hatred. He stands at this moment, in the eye of the law in California, in the position of an accessory to a murder. That he may not be tried for it, and will certainly not be convicted of it, is a circumstance which, though it may furnish consolation to himself, does not in the least improve his position as a candidate for public employment. And if there is any position in the public service for which his antecedents render him peculiarly unfitted, it is that of an officer whose duty it is to put the laws in force against criminals. Mr. CALHOUN BENHAM could not enter a Court and appeal to a jury to punish willful offences against society without either amusing them by his impudence, or enraging them by his hypocrisy; and any community which could witness such a spectacle without shame, would be much too far gone in iniquity for either Courts or laws to do it much good.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Flagrant Official Outrage.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Flagrant Official Outrage.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/99bec3dc-fe6e-542b-8034-3cc26aedf14c,585,nyt://article/99bec3dc-fe6e-542b-8034-3cc26aedf14c

A full Board present -- Mr. VERPLANCK, the President, in the Chair. Mr. VERPLANCK asked how much was owing to different counties of the State for supplies furnished emigrants, and the care of them during detention by sickness, in passing through their counties. It was stated in reply that on the 1st of January the indebtedness was $19,600, and that the present indebtedness was probably one-half more. It was urged by Mr. VERPLANCK that the entire amount ought to be ascertained at once, and the debts paid. No action was, however, taken in the matter. A communication was received from Dr. GUNN, the Health Officer, renewing his application for $1,200, to cover the amount incurred by him for house-rent. He takes the ground that, inasmuch as his predecessors in office were furnished with a house free of rent, he should be relieved from rent-paying. The communication was laid on the table. An application was submitted by Commissioner CRABTREE to send back to Galway, at the expense of the Commission, an emigrant recently arrived, who was sick with consumption. It was suggested that, in case of granting the application, there would soon come pouring in all sorts of petitions from all sorts of emigrants, complaining of all sorts of diseases, as pretexts for getting home again. The application, notwithstanding this fling of opposition, was referred to the Vice-President with power. The weekly statement gives the number of emigrants arrived during the past week as 5,277, making the total arrivals since the 1st of January 19,005 -- an increase of 5,554 over the arrivals for the same period last year. The present number of inmates on Ward's Island and in the Marine Hospital is 719. During the past week there has been received for commutation of passengers $8,754, making the aggregate receipts for commutation since the beginning of the year $93,501 67, leaving, after deducting total disbursements, the present balance in the treasury $24,508 53.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a3fe63ae-6c98-50cd-a2ae-67a4d2f56daa,2118,nyt://article/a3fe63ae-6c98-50cd-a2ae-67a4d2f56daa

Mr. GOODRICH was a native of Connecticut, and was born in 1793, -- though no one would have judged from his appearance that he was so nearly seventy years old. He had a vigorous constitution, which he preserved to the last by care and regularity in his mode of life. He began life as a publisher, first in Hartford and afterwards in Boston, -- and edited in the days of Annuals one of the most celebrated of them, the Token, from 1828 to 1842. His greatest success, however, was achieved in compiling books for children, -- designed to convey instruction in natural history, travels, biography, and various branches of science and art, by simply-written narratives and anecdotes, copiously illustrated by engravings. He wrote as ""Peter Parley"" telling stories to children, and for many years the series of works thus published, extending to over forty volumes, had an enormous circulation, both in this country and abroad. They introduced a class of books which have since become universal. In 1841, he established a periodical called Merry's Museum, based upon the same general plan, which he continued until 1854. In 1857, he published two volumes of Recollections, -- containing an immense amount of exceedingly interesting memoranda concerning men and events in Connecticut, and forming one of the most readable books of the day. Mr. GOODRICH was appointed American Consul at Paris under Mr. FILLMORE, and held that office for several years. He performed its duties with great fidelity, and enjoyed the respect and esteem of all with whom he came in contact. He published several works while there calculated to diffuse a more general knowledge of America and its institutions, and upon his return prepared an elaborate and admirable illustrated History of the Animal Kingdom, which was issued last year in two large and elegant volumes. He was a man of great diligence, and continued to prosecute his literary labors to the latest period of his life.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of S.G.

About 250 children, male and female, including a small sprinkling of colored juveniles, represented the good work which Mr. PEASE, with his coadjutors, has been doing for the City during the past year. A very admirable sight they were, cleanly in apparel, though a few of them disdained the conventionalism of shoes and stockings. A raised platform, of very slight construction, had been erected in the rear of the stage, but as soon as they were seated thereon, and before the commencement of the exercises of the evening, it gave way with a crash that alarmed the audience, and sent the children pell mell to the floor. Fortunately none were hurt, though all were a good deal frightened. The officers of the Society, and the police in attendance, soon restored order, cleared away the ruins, and made new seats for the little ones, who, when their alarm subsided, seemed to enjoy the accident. The smallest children, who speedily became very sleepy -- their ages ranging from three to six years -- were displayed in semi-circular order, near the footlights, and detained there in opposition to their desire to retire into private life. The ceremonies were commenced by a lively clapping of five hundred little hands, at a signal given by a lady teacher, followed by a hymn sung by half the number of little voices. Of all the singers who have sung on that stage -- PICCOLOMINI, GAZZANIGA, PATTI, will forgive us -- no one has ever more deeply touched the hearts of an audience than did one little girl, who led the rest, and when the chorus, ""I'll be a good child, indeed I will,"" was given more heartily than artistically by the infant crowd, there were many moist eyes among the auditors. Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. GANST, after which the annual report was read by Mr. ARCHIBALD RUSSELL, the President. It was quite encouraging. After the expenditure of $2,612 for the Society's farm in Westchester County, the current expenses of the Institution, amounting to $16,981, and the payment of the principal on the debt of the building, amounting to $20,311, there remained cash in hand $116. Of meals given gratuitously, there had been in the last year no less than 276,862. Of articles of clothing given away, 12,000; pairs of shoes, 1,200; sent to situations, 372; to their friends, 130. The meeting was addressed by Rev. COTTON SMITH, of the Church of the Ascension, in Tenth-street; Hon. JAS. A. BRIGGS, of Ohio, and Hon. HENRY J. RAYMOND.

The Chair was occupied by GEO. W. BLUNT, Esq., who filled it on Tuesday evening last the occasion of the annual meeting -- at which time the consideration of the matter in question had been postponed. A proposition to amend the by-laws to the effect that the yearly dues of those who did not come within the category of ""merchants' clerks"" should be increased, was debated, and voted down by a heavy majority. Mr. WOOD offered a resolution asking the appointment of a committee of seven, with power to examine into the fiscal condition of the Association, and report at a next meeting to be held two weeks hence, as to the necessity of increasing the annual dues. It gave rise to a long discussion, and resulted in not passing -- the prevailing expression evincing a want of faith in the ability of any committee to harmonize the extremely conflicting sentiments on the subject, and a desire to arrive at a decision then. A motion followed, proposing that the dues of regular members be increased $1 per year. This resulted in a long and spirited debate in the course of which it became evident that the friends and opponents of the measure were pretty equally divided as to numbers, and the question having been taken, it was found to have been lost by a constitutional vote -- 142 having declared in its favor and 128 against it.

At no period within twenty-five years has there been so complete a rupture of all the bonds that usually hold parties together, or such an entire uncertainty as to the prospects of a pending Presidential election. The Democratic Party which has preserved a form of nationality longer than any other, has at last been rent asunder by the same influences which have destroyed all other political organizations. Whether it can come together again, even in form, is a matter of great doubt: but even if it does, it cannot fail to lose nearly all the moral strength which it derived from its former union. It is becoming evident that the Southern Democrats do not intend to abandon their ground, or to waive their demands upon the party at large. The tone and language of their leading organs and their public men, show conclusively that they will insist upon the distinct recognition of slaves as property under the Federal Constitution, and upon the duty of all departments of the Federal Government to protect that property wherever it may be. We see nothing to indicate a purpose on their part to waive this demand. They may possibly consent to say nothing of it in their Platform, provided the candidate shall be a man sufficiently pledged by his life and opinions to its recognition. But the Northern wing of their Party cannot concede such a candidate, or such a platform, without the certainty of disaster and ruin in every Northern State.

"There is nothing more agreeable than being in no way responsible to anybody for anything you do. Next to this in comfort is being responsible only to those who either do not care what you do, or, caring, cannot conveniently call you to account, or are not likely to do so immediately. Any man who can treat himself to either of these luxuries, has the world at his feet, and may turn life into a carnival. A thorough-going despot, after he has been doing something peculiarly outrageous, always calls attention to the fact that he is responsible to nobody but God and his own conscience, and thus leaves his fellow mortals no sort of pretext for desiring an inspection of his accounts. He does not, of course, pretend to be certain that there will not prove to be a balance against him at the final reckoning; but to a worthy man whom he has robbed or bastinadoed, or an innocent woman whom he has publicly flogged, this affords only a modified consolation. In fact, it would require human nature to be very much more malignant and fanatical than it is for it to find comfort, under an odious tyranny, in looking forward to the confusion of the tyrant at the Judgment Day. A Sicilian, or Venetian, of enlarged views and strong faith, may possibly find his misery lightened by reflecting upon the sorry figure which FRANCIS JOSEPH or FERDINAND will cut when report of the various acts of their administration to the only court from which there is no appeal; but, in the meantime, the mass of the people would prefer a constitution and a responsible ministry.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/12/archives/dieu-et-mon-droit.html,,"There is nothing more agreeable than being in no way responsible to anybody for anything you do.

After partaking of refreshments, the Ambassadors reembarked on the Philadelphia, and steamed up the Potomac. Off Mount Vernon the vessel stopped, and while the band played plaintive music, the interpreter told them to whom the honors were paid. About 11 1/2 o'clock, yesterday morning, the Philadelphia appeared in sight of the multitude which thronged the Navy-yard at Washington. Mayor BERRETT, in accordance with the precedent which allows municipal courtesies to be tendered before national, went on board the vessel and welcomed the distinguished guests to the city. Then the treaty-box was passed to a small boat, and the Japanese followed. On landing at the Navy-yard, Capt. BUCHANAN welcomed them in the name of the President. No formal reply was made, and a procession was immediately formed to escort the Ambassadors to their quarters. First of all was the President's mounted guard; then came the Japanese in hacks; then the treaty, and last of all the marines and the District militia.

GEO. H. WHITE occupied the Chair. Rev. Mr. BLANKMAN being entitled to the floor, proceeded to read from manuscripts a lengthy address, evidently prepared with great care, in support of the Anti-Cheever side of the controversy. He repudiated the idea, to which the friends of Dr. CHEEVER had given currency, that the cause of the opposition to Dr. CHEEVER was that he had preached against Slavery. This, he said, was not so. The true origin of the difficulty was in the appeal of Dr. CHEEVER and his party for foreign aid to sustain the Church. He commented very severely upon the letter of Dr. CHEEVER to Mr. SPURGEON, and the egotism of the writer as therein displayed. Dr. CHEEVER had said that the cause of Zion throughout the world did not rest upon the Tract Society in Nassau-street, and yet one would suppose from the tenor of this letter that it did rest upon the Church of the Puritans and upon the preaching of Dr. CHEEVER. The course adopted by Dr. CHEEVER, and his friends tended to the establishment of a perfect despotism. On the principles laid down by them, there was nothing to hinder a pastor who should turn Roman Catholics, from transferring the whole property of the Church over to the Papish Hierarchy, while the congregation were turned out of doors.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.; THE CHEEVER QUARREL.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/15/archives/the-irish-exodus.html,,"The Irish emigration to this country which it was supposed, a year or two ago, would abate under the influence of great prosperity at home, has again set in with such violence that the English Press begins to prophesy the total transfer, at no distant period, of the Celtic population to America, and the filling up of their ancient seats by a new ""plantation"" of Englishmen and Scotchmen. The London Times contemplates this result with great apparent satisfaction, and seeks to reconcile the departing exiles to their change of residence by the comforting assurance that America is the real home of their race. Considering what the condition of Ireland now is, as compared with what it was forty years ago, and considering, especially, the enormous advances it has made in material prosperity within the last ten years, the phenomenon which we are now witnessing, of this emigration of an entire people, famous for their strong local attachments, is one of the most remarkable in history. It is rendered all the more remarkable too, by the fact that, no matter how much political considerations may have done to set the stream flowing towards our shores fifty years ago, they have had little or nothing to do with the fullness and rapidity which mark it in our own day. We can no longer learn from stump orators or debating societies the real reason for the Irish peasant's quitting his home in the ""old country."" The political condition of the Irish Catholic has for some years ceased to be a whit worse than that of the English Protestant Dissenter. In some respects it is even better. He has supplied to him by the Government a good system of secular education for his children -- a luxury which the Methodist and Congregational masses of Great Britain are not likely to enjoy for many a day; and of late he has enjoyed an amount of Government patronage which the English Dissenter need not hope for. A large proportion of the Irish Judges are Catholics, as well as the representatives of the present Government at the Bar. The best legal appointments in the colonies, still in the gift of the Crown, have been for the last ten years bestowed on Irishmen. Irish Catholics muster largely on the rolls of the local magistracy. They have begun to muster largely at the mess tables of the army. They fill the corporations of the cities almost exclusively; they are represented in the House of Commons by a compact and clamorous body, which knows how to make itself formidable to the strongest ministry that now-a-days ever finds itself in office. In fact, the tendency of all the liberal Administrations of England for many years past has been to visit on the Irish Protestants those measures of proscription from which their Catholic countrymen once suffered. It is well known in Dublin that with Whigs, or Peelites, or Radicals in office in Downing-street, a Protestant's chances of a ""berth"" or of promotion are almost as small as a Catholic's used to be forty years ago. The tremendous power which the Emancipation Act raised into existence -- the power of a turbulent and ill-educated clergy over hosts of ignorant and fanatical voters -- is a power which has to be conciliated at any cost. Even the ""Protestant Conservatives,"" under the ""chivalrous"" Earl of DERBY, have succumbed to its might. At the general election which preceded the peace of Villafranca, the combination between the priests and the Tories, for the purpose of bringing about a coalition with Austria against France, for the protection of the Pope and the concordat, was made manifest at every hustings from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear. In short, as far as the relations of the Irish Catholic with the Government are concerned, he has only the Church establishment to complain of; and this burden, as we have said, is one which presses with equal weight on the shoulders of the English Dissenter. In all other respects he stands on the same footing as any other British subject. Habeas corpus and trial by jury are now his birthright; and as to the liberty of the Press, the Dublin Nation is astounding evidence that the Irish Press is the freest Press in the world. In no other country would a newspaper be allowed, as this is, to preach insurrection every week, and to make common cause, on every possible opportunity, with the bitterest foreign enemies of the Powers that be, without either receiving any notice from the law or the mob.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Irish Exodus.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Irish Exodus.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Ireland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Immigration and Emigration', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d99f95f0-362e-54dd-87ab-603d32b98379,1237,nyt://article/d99f95f0-362e-54dd-87ab-603d32b98379

No tidings of the whereabouts of Mr. FOWLER have yet been received, and the United States Marshal, who has a warrant for his arrest, has thus far been utterly unable to obtain any clue to his movements since he left the Post-office at 8 o'clock on Saturday evening. Various rumors are afloat as to his having fled to this or that locality, comprising the whole territory from the ""beach of Rockaway"" to ""John Brown's tract;"" while other reports have it that he has not left the City at all; -- out whatever may be his place of concealment, it is pretty certain that he is in the ""hands of his friends,"" and that he will remain there until the issue of the movement, which is said to be making among his intimate personal and political associates, to compromise his difficulties by a settlement of the Government claims, shall have been determined. That a compromise with the Government could be thus effected would hardly seem probable in any event, but in this case, and in this stage of the case, if the statements of those who represent the prosecuting branch of the Government are to be relied on the thing is utterly impossible. The additional developements that are making by those officers sent on from Washington to investigate the affairs of the New-York Post-office, are said to indicate such an extensive series of peculations and frauds, and to implicate so many others in the guilt of the defalcation, that any compromise of the matter is out of the question. Among the chief of those implicated is the Assistant Postmaster, Mr. CALDWELL, who, yesterday, resigned his position. It is said that his duties, as Cashier, rendered it impossible that the frauds could have been perpetrated without his knowledge. A deficit has also been discovered in the department for the sale of stamps, but the exact amount has not yet been ascertained. It is somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000; but as the clerk of this department has been off duty at various times, and is not therefore known to be the guilty party, his name is for the present withheld.

That such a doctrine should have ever secured recognition in the United States, the country of newspapers par excellence, is, perhaps, one of the oddest and most unaccountable of the oddities of Anglo-Saxon law. It would be natural and reasonable enough if promulgated in Austria or Russia, where newspapers rank as unavoidable nuisances, the general use of which it is one of the first duties of the Government to discourage. But in America every man reads the newspapers who knows how to read at all, or who is fit to take part in any judicial proceeding. When a great crime is committed which causes a general sensation, everybody reads the report of it -- if he knows how to read; and if he does not know how, he is not fit to sit on a jury. So that the question with which every man on the panel is assailed in the State Courts, on a criminal trial, by the prisoner's counsel, as to whether he has read the newspaper reports touching the prisoner and his offence, is in reality equivalent to asking him: ""Are you so stupid and ignorant that, living in New-York, you cannot read or understand a daily paper? Or if you read one, are you such a piece of eccentricity, as without any motive in the world, carefully to avoid perusing any allusion it contains to a subject of which every man and woman around you is talking?""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Jury and the Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Jury and the Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1b774ecc-e7d3-5211-8153-cc53457d8fc7,865,nyt://article/1b774ecc-e7d3-5211-8153-cc53457d8fc7

Testimony to the correctness of our supposition is daily turning up.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/16/archives/the-common-council-and-the-japanese.html,,"We ventured, in commenting some weeks ago upon the approaching reception of the Japanese by the Municipal authorities, to conjecture that the fame of our Common Council and their ""hospitalities"" had spread through Eastern Europe and Asia, and had perhaps reached the ears of the Japanese, secluded though they have been from the rest of the world. Testimony to the correctness of our supposition is daily turning up. We have always doubted, and doubt still, whether MOHAMMED PASHA would say much when he got home about the humiliating treatment which he received at the hands of Messrs. BOOLE and VAN TINE, but some of his retinue have doubtless been blabbing about the ham sandwiches and sherry; and the malignity of the New-York ""Medjlis"" towards foreigners must long ere this have become a common topic in every village from Anatolia to the shores of the China sea. It only needs very little familiarity with Oriental life to know how gossip of this sort flies from tribe to tribe, carried sometimes by caravans, sometimes by couriers, sometimes by strolling dervishes or bashi-bazouks, sometimes no man can guess how. Instances occurred in the Russian war of 1828, of news reaching Constantinople in this way from places a thousand miles off, two days in advance of the Tartar express, riding as fast as horse could gallop. The various incidents of the late mutiny in Hindostan were the subject of common chit chat on the shores of the Caspian and the Black Sea, long before the news was flashed from Marseilles by the Overland Mail. The tale seems to travel in the air -- and none know whence it comes and whither it goes. We presume it must be in some such way as this that the fame of our Common Council has reached Jeddo, unless, indeed, Lord ELGIN, finding himself baffled in his efforts to induce Japan to send an embassy to England first, was malicious enough to forward reports of ""BOOLE, his proceedings,"" with short biographies of the members of the Council, to the sacred Emperor. However it be, the Washington correspondent of the Tribune testifies that the Ambassadors know all about the New-York Common Councilmen, and will be prepared for Mr. VAN TINE and his colleagues. We hope this is true. ""Forewarned, forearmed."" If Amphitryon BOOLE be engaged in looking up ""hospitalities"" of a more than usually disgusting sort, as some article of food which no Japanese can touch without instantly disemboweling himself, we advise him to desist. The known readiness of the Japanese to resort to the ""happy dispatch,"" in case of flagrant insult, renders it doubly necessary for the public to keep an eye on the ""Committee of Reception."" It is an extraordinary proof of the politeness of our Oriental guests, that none of them should have opened their abdomens, when they were hustled and jostled, and pushed and squeezed by a mob of gaping idiots, on their arrival at the enlightened capital of the Union. They will go through a good deal more of this sort of thing before they make their escape from Washington, and may find their natural instincts of decency grow less tenderly sensitive under the experience. But there is a peculiar pungency in the flavor of our Common Council which must infallibly penetrate their nerves with a new, and perhaps irresistible impulse of disgust; and we should bitterly regret the necessity of sending back the illustrious Kamis of Nipon, not only drawn in the illustrated papers, but quartered by their own princely hands.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Common Council and the Japanese.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Common Council and the Japanese.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/33f3e21d-7ff6-5a95-8ad9-ac66871f3872,588,nyt://article/33f3e21d-7ff6-5a95-8ad9-ac66871f3872

"At the meeting of the Polytechnic Association last week, Prof. SEELY, Chairman of the Committee to whom was referred for consideration JOHNSON's new patent gas burner, reported in behalf of the majority of the Committee, unfavorably to the invention.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/16/archives/polytechnic-association-economy-in-burning-gas-interesting-report.html,,"At the meeting of the Polytechnic Association last week, Prof. SEELY, Chairman of the Committee to whom was referred for consideration JOHNSON's new patent gas burner, reported in behalf of the majority of the Committee, unfavorably to the invention. The report was of considerable length, and of a scientific character. The points of chief interest to the public are as follows: Gas, in New-York, is not burned economically; and without any material cost to the consumer, the light from gas burned may be increased about twenty per cent. The burners commonly in use have such narrow orifices that the gas issues in a thin sheet, mingles rapidly with the air, and the carbon, to which the light is chiefly due, is consumed too rapidly. The apertures of the burner therefore should be made larger. But the size of the aperture must be carefully limited, or the flame will smoke. The test of the most economical burning is the yellowish hue which a flame has just at the point of beginning to smoke. The objections to such a light are that it is unsteady, and very liable to smoke. These objections may be obviated in a good degree, however, by spreaders and chimnies. The Johnson burner is one of a pretty large class, which has wide orifices, and contrivances within the burner to check the flow of the gas. The Committee believe that no contrivance in these burners is so convenient and effective for checking and adjusting the flow as the ordinary stop-cock.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Polytechnic Association.; ECONOMY IN BURNING GAS INTERESTING REPORT EXPANSION OF IRON, ETC.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Polytechnic Association.; ECONOMY IN BURNING GAS INTERESTING REPORT EXPANSION OF IRON, ETC.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6d68efd-ea71-5cfc-930e-0905375bf446,883,nyt://article/f6d68efd-ea71-5cfc-930e-0905375bf446

We commented two days ago upon the delay in bringing MACDONALD to trial, caused by what we must regard as the remissness of this same official. Mr. WATERBURY pleads that he has not time to take the ordinary measures for bringing even murderers before a jury, and yet he has time to go to Charleston to attend an electioneering Convention, and stays away so long that the Courts have to adjourn over, and lose a term, without doing any business at all. If it be really true that one District-Attorney is not sufficient to bring criminals to justice, all that is to be said is that we must have as many as will be sufficient, because criminals must be brought to justice somehow. The matter is not one upon which we can economize, or which we can afford to postpone. We may remark, however, that we think Mr. WATERBURY's experience would hardly furnish a good reason for making any such change, as he, by his own account, in his letter to the Board of Supervisors two months ago, charges himself, in addition to his duties as public prosecutor, with the task of reforming criminals and pardoning them before trial. He says it is his duty to make such inquiry into each case as will enable him to judge whether the culprit will be improved by having his offence hushed up, or in other words by being ""let off,"" and he mentioned several cases in which the exercise of this discretionary power had been attended with the happiest results.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The District-Attorney and the Law's Delays."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The District-Attorney and the Law's Delays."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3340b74e-1724-58e9-85bb-30834f1ddd69,807,nyt://article/3340b74e-1724-58e9-85bb-30834f1ddd69
"The Republicans at Chicago already show, in the tenor of their preliminary proceedings, how much more fortunate they have been in the choice of their place of meeting than were the Democracy at Charleston. The genial influence of a free, active and sympathetic popution is making itself felt upon the delegates. Processions by day, dinners and serenades by night -- the perpetual flutter of banners, and music of military bands -- the glare of torchlights, and the fragrance of flowers -- these are the accompaniments of the Republican councils. They cannot fail to excite the enthusiasm of the delegates, to make them feel that a great population is with them in their work; and by elating them with fresh hopes of victory in the contest upon which they are entering, to make them more forbearing about personal preferences, and less disposed to risk the glittering prize which seems within their grasp by any extravagant devotion to this or that particular leader. There is no danger that the Convention at Chicago will break up like the Convention at Charleston. The strongest candidate of the Democracy at Charleston represented a principle upon which the political existence of his party absolutely depends; and to sacrifice him, therefore, would have been for those who supported him an act of political suicide. The strongest candidate of the Republicans, on the contrary, stands out from his competitors rather on a question of phraseology than on any peculiarity of convictions essential to the success of Republicanism. The individuality of Mr. DOUGLAS was his main strength at Charleston. The individuality of Mr. SEWARD is his main weakness at Chicago. The Democrats could not take Mr. DOUGLAS without his measures.

Numerous witness were examined, and their testimony developed the following facts About 12 o'clock on Saturday night, the woman was addressed by a drunken man in the Bowery, near Rivington-street, when GERBER, who was passing by, interfered to protect her from violence, and subsequently he accompanied her home. Soon afterwards the tenants on the same floor heard a violent rapping on the door of the woman's room, but before its cause was ascertained, the attention of some of them was attracted by a crashing of the window-sash, and a man clinging to the sill, struggling to retain his hold, and breaking in his frantic efforts the glass in the window below. Before assistance could be rendered he was either forced from his position by some person inside, or his strength failed, and he fell, meeting an instant death. The accused states that she was in an adjoining apartment procuring a light when the circumstance transpired, and that she can only account for the action of deceased in going to the window by the supposition that he became alarmed at the rapping on the door, and sought to escape or conceal himself in that way. A lad nice years of age, named George Nallinger, residing in the apartment directly over that of the woman, deposed that having been awakened by the noise of the breaking glass, he looked down, and saw the arm of a person who was striking the deceased with a hammer. As all the witnesses were unanimous in giving a very bad character to the woman. Coroner SOU[???]ER decided to commit her for the Grand Jury to act in the [???]a[???]er.

We think that so much as this leaves the Baltimore Convention very little to do. They have but to nominate these gentlemen and adjourn. We hope, however, the Ex-Governor will be able to get along without New-York, as we greatly fear there may be some difficulty in securing this State for him. There is a small knot of miserable fanatics here, who are possessed with the idea that Gov. WISE is wanting in common sense; in fact, some of them go so far as to say that he has, in his public capacity on divers occasions, behaved in a manner strongly indicative of downright lunacy. The influence of these men at a general election is likely to be very great in spite of their individual insignificance, and we candidly confess we believe that their views of the ex-Governor, in spite of the present admiration for him, would prevail in the long run, and lead to his losing the State. As we are loth, however, to have a person of Mr. WISE's tact, taste, judgment, discretion, eloquence, and military genius consigned to the shades of private life without a struggle, we are willing to give the Enquirer a hint, which we trust it will take in good part. We strongly recommend the substitution on the ticket of FERNANDO WOOD for JOSEPH LANE for the Vice-Presidency. Mr. WOOD is the great leader of the New-York Democracy. He has the State under his thumb. Nothing but his love for the office of Mayor has prevented his being Governor half a dozen times. We feel pretty confident the Vice-Presidency would tempt ""His Honor"" to abandon his beloved municipal duties for a wider sphere of usefulness; and with WOOD as his colleague, Gov. WISE would sweep the State. The rural districts are to a man enthusiastic admirers of the Mayor, and that admiration has, if possible, been increased by his imposing attitude at Charleston, and his commanding eloquence in Connecticut. We of the City should be reluctant enough to have ""His Honor"" go, but we are geometricians enough to know that the whole is greater than a part, and that when the Union demands him, it is the duty of New-York to deliver him up.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Wise for the Presidency.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Wise for the Presidency.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2de429f-bb5b-53a0-a77d-c7cdcd5be3eb,434,nyt://article/e2de429f-bb5b-53a0-a77d-c7cdcd5be3eb

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/18/archives/construction-of-a-willwidows-right-of-dower.html,,"Abigail Dodge Vs. Ezra Flagg et al. -- This was an appeal to the General Term of the Supreme Court from a judgment at Special Term, directing an ad- measurement of the plaintiff's dower in four houses and lots situated in West Eleventh-street, in this City, valued at $40,000. The facts in the case are as follows: The houses in question were owned by Josiah Dodge at his decease, March 20, 1855. By his will he devised to his wife -- the plaintiff -- his homestead in New-Hampshire for life, and in addition, gave her an annuity of $400 for life, which he charged as a lien upon such houses, to be paid in proportion to their assessed value. Subject to this annuity, the testator devised two of the houses to his daughter, and to two sons one house each. The testator directed that the house devised to his eldest son should be held in trust by a trustee to be appointed by the Court, and. further directed that the rents of all the houses be applied to the payment of the annuity and other incumbrances upon the property; and until such incumbrances were thus paid, the devisees were not to enjoy their use. Executors and trustees were appointed by the will. The plaintiff, after receiving her annuity as it accrued, and after the lapse of one year, commenced this action to recover dower on the houses in Eleventh-street. From the Special Term order defendants appealed, and their counsel contended that although the testator did not in express terms give the widow the annuity and other benefits provided by the will, in lieu of dower, nevertheless, as such was his manifest intention, her dower was barred by statute, as she had not, as thereby required, elected within one year from the testator's decree, which she would take; and that the decisions which upheld the arbitrary rule that such intention of the testator would not be adjudged, unless dower would subvert some provision of the will, were unsound, Conceding the rule heretofore applied to be correct, then it was claimed, that a set-off of dower would subvert the annuity, inasmuch as each, house was charged with its share of the $400; and if the widow entered into possession of a third, she must sink so much of her annuity as her third should bear in proportion. Such inconsistency, therefore, demonstrated the testator's intention to bar dower and put the widow to her election. A further reason which was urged in support of the testator's intention to her dower, was the power conferred upon the trustees to lease all of the houses, which power could not be exercised if the widow entered into possession of one-third. It was also claimed that the grant of a valuable homestead and an allowance of annuity were a greater consideration than her dower, and that they would afford her an ample support for life. For such reasons the widow ought not to be allowed, to frustrate the obvious intentions of the testator.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Construction of a Will--Widow's Right of Dower."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Construction of a Will--Widow's Right of Dower."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9de272a9-d413-54cd-aa89-12dc51c803a5,598,nyt://article/9de272a9-d413-54cd-aa89-12dc51c803a5

"THE POSTMASTER OF NEW-YORK. -- An explanation of defalcations in the New-York Postoffice may perhaps be found in the miserable meagreness of the salary attached.

This miniature navy is composed of young gentlemen who have the leisure and means, as well as the inclination to cultivate the ""manly art of"" -- rowing. It was organized in October, 1859, at which time the Atlanta, Aurora, Waverley and Atlantic Boat Clubs constitued the infant navy.

The elegant boats, each decorated with its proper flag; the neat uniforms of the rowers, and the officer-like bearing of the various commanders, were the theme of much admiration.

"The Rebublican National Convention succeeded yesterday in clearing away all the formal and preliminary business before it, leaving nothing to be done but to ballot for a Presidential candidate.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/18/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The Rebublican National Convention succeeded yesterday in clearing away all the formal and preliminary business before it, leaving nothing to be done but to ballot for a Presidential candidate. The several Committees made their reports, which the Convention acted upon with the utmost promptitude. That on Business reported a number of rules to govern the balloting. Among these were the following: That four votes be cast by delegates at large, and two for each Congressional District; that 304 votes shall be considered a majority of the whole number of votes when all the States in the Union are represented, and that the Convention on this ratio be required to nominate candidates. The first of these, with the amendment that no more votes shall be cast than there are delegates present, was adopted. The second elicited a minority report in favor of a simple majority of the whole number of votes being sufficient to elect; and the minority report was accepted by the Convention. The Committee on Credentials reporting in favor of the admission of Southern States to full votes, a warm debate sprung up, the anti-Seward interest endeavoring to exclude or reduce the influence of these delegations, and the friends of SEWARD advocating its unreserved admission. The point was finally compromised by the apportionment of 23 votes each to Virgian and Kentucky, 11 votes to Maryland, 6 to Texas, and 5 to Oregon. The Platform was then reported from the Committee on Resolutions. It is eminently conservative in tone; declares for the immunity of sovereign States from interference with their domestic institutions; condemns the treason of JOHN BROWN, and advocates au exalted tariff, and a relaxation of the naturalization laws. The tariff clause gave great satisfaction to Pennsylvania, while Massachusetts protested angrily against the concession to the foreign element contained in the naturalization provision. The platform, with a trifling amendment proposed by Mr. CURTIS, of New-York, was adopted. Our Special Correspondent remains of the opinion that the strength of Mr. SEWARD in the Convention is such that he will, in all likelihood, be nominated on the 10th or 11th ballot to-day. The elements of opposition remain incoherent; a last effort to concentrate upon Mr. LINCOLN having failed last evening. Mr. BATES is now abandoned. The Pennsylvania delegation still assert that Mr. SEWARD cannot carry that State; while Massachusetts and Connecticut regard the naturalization clause as fatal to the party in New-England.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e91d0a76-1320-5a37-8ba7-c17976cbd58a,1595,nyt://article/e91d0a76-1320-5a37-8ba7-c17976cbd58a

His visit was kept stricily private, so that no manifestation took place on his behalf, and even the persons in the hotel were not aware for some time of the presence of the farfamed Benecia Boy. He was accompanied by two American friends, said to be his backers in the recent contest for the championship. So careful was the American pugilist to avoid recognition, that he moved about under an assumed name. On Wednesday evening and Thursday forenoon he visited several places in the town, and amongst others made a call at the Clayton Hall, where he remained a short time, and [???]ad an interview with some friends he had known in America. Whether he received the subscription said to have been raised for him by a number of American captains belonging to this port, we have not been able to learn. In fact, the inquiries which we have institute incline us to doubt whether any subscription bas been made in this town for the American champion. In the afternoon HEENAN and his two friends proceeded to London by the 3:40 P.M. train. The party occupied a first-class carriage. HEENAN having teen recognised by one or two of the railway officials, the fact of his presence was made known to several persons who happened to be in the station at the time, aid they immediately, sought to gratify their curiosity by attempting to get a sight at the ""fighting man."" Some were successful, but others were denied the gratification, for the party, on finding themselves recognised, drew up the blinds of the carriage to protect themselves from the public gaze.

"Hon. ABRAM LINCOLN was born in Hardin County, Kentucky, on the 12th of February, 1809. His opportunities for obtaining an education were but limited, but he worked his way to the bar and for some time practiced law. During the Black Hawk war he was Captain of a company of volunteers. Subsequently, and it may have been as a reward for bravery displayed in his campaignings, he was appointed postmaster of a small village in Illinois. From this position he advanced to a seat in the Illinois Legislature, to which he was four times elected. In 1847 he went to Washington as a representative in Congress, and on the 15th of June. 1858, was nominated by the Republican Convention held at Springfield, Illinois, as a candidate for the United States Senatorship, in opposition to Hon.

"On Sunday, April 22, at twelve minutes before 2 o'clock P.M., a prolonged shock of an earthquake, lasting eighty seconds, was experienced in Lima, Callao, Chorrillos, Canete, and in other places in the vicinity of Lima, which caused immense damage. The shocks continued at short intervals, so that fifty of them were experienced within the space of seventy-two hours. In Lima the greater portion of the buildings have received more or less damage by falling of walls, roofs, cracks, &c., and many buildings and outhouses have been totally destroyed. Most of the public buildings, the palaces, churches, convents, carcels, colleges, &c., have suffered by the falling or inclination of their towers. In Callao, the damage has been comparatively slight. In Chorrillos, the watering place of the Limenos, several fine buildings have been destroyed, all or nearly all are badly injured, and several persons were killed. Canete has suffered severely, nearly the whole town having been thrown down. The shocks continued, but were slighter and of less frequent occurrence, no to the time of the sailing of the steamer on the 27th. The people of Callao, fearing that the sea might recede, and returning, drown the whole population, as it did in 1749, fled by thousands to Lima, which is situated six miles from Callao and is 309 feet higher than the latter place. The people and visitors of Chorrillos also flocked to Lima. In Lima thousands of persons were encamped in the Plazas and on the Alameda, fearing to occupy the houses. The losses in Lima are estimated at $1,000,000, and it is computed that $200,000 will cover the losses, so far as heard from, in the neighboring towns. Callao is only, damaged about $30,000 and Chorrillos loses $40,000. The dead do not probably comprise over a dozen persons, but a great number have been wounded. In Manta trees were rooted out of the ground, and one of the hills in the vicinity was split in twain, hot foetid water issuing from the fissure. The panic among the people still continued when the steamer left. The priests were carrying images of the Virgin and the Saints through the streets, followed by long processions of the frightened people. Some of the most frightened and bigoted at Callao took from the church of Bella Vista an image of our Lord of the Sea, and, accompanied by a band of music and a guard of honor on each side of the image, marched in procession to the seaside and set it up to stay the waves that they feared would overwhelm them.

"W. Hislop, F.R.A.S., in view of the near approach of the great solar eclipse of July, suggests the construction of a heliograph, as follows. He says: ""I propose to take a view lens of about 26 inches focus, and of a diameter sufficient to insure accuracy in the figure. This should be furnished, at the proper distance in front, with a series of stops, say from 116th of an inch to the larger size, at which the lens will work without sensible spherical aberration. These apertures should be so arranged as to be readily changed, and may be either holes pierced in a plate of brass sliding in front of the lens, or be arranged in a circular disc, turning on a centre, similar to the diaphragm of a microscope. The lens so fitted should be fixed at the end of a telescope tube of the proper length, and the image of the object, instead of being received upon a screen, or impressed upon a sensitized plate, should be received by another photographic lens, adjustable at the proper distance to magnify the image. The best lens for the latter object would probably be one on the orthographic principle, which construction would also increase the means of correction in combination with the front lens, so as to obtain the utmost amount of accuracy of picture.

The work men were engaged on the tower of the church, and it was sought to make the contactor liable, because he did not cause to be erected a scaffold to protect those below from falling implements or materials",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Damages for Personal Injuries.; LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Damages for Personal Injuries.; LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3dd63009-dbeb-5d56-9282-47c7ff1a09c6,229,nyt://article/3dd63009-dbeb-5d56-9282-47c7ff1a09c6

They had been informed by the Republican organ, in the morning, that the opposition to Mr. SEWARD could not be united, and that therefore his prospect of receiving the nomination was very good. Therefore, many of them were unprepared to hear of his defeat soon, if at all, they had not anticipated such a result until after a protracted struggle. The result was that the nomination was not received with enthusiasm. During the morning, the only Republicans who seemed pleased with the result, who were inclined to talk, were those of the old friends of HENRY CLAY, who had joined the Republican Party. Some of them showed great delight, not so much because Mr. LINCOLN had received the nomination, as that Mr. SEWARD had been defeated. They claimed that in his defeat he had received full pay for having defeated HENRY CLAY in the very same manner and under similar circumstances. The Democracy appeared jubilant. They said they saw in the action of the Republican Convention the same unfortunate element that destroyed the old Whig Party. The old doctrine of availability had ruled, they said, and it would ruin, as it had dove before. They pretended great indignation that the Republicans should have sacrificed their representative man in the present campaign, as the Whigs did in the case of HENRY CLAY and of DANIEL WEBSTER, and resolved to punish them by electing a Democratic Present in November next. Later in the day many of the Republicans came to speak of the nomination as a very good one, although they coupled with the remark an expression of regret that Mr. SEWARD had not been made their candidate. At about 4 o'clock one hundred guns were fired in the City Hall Park, and some of the several hundred present spoke cheeringly of the nomination of Mr. LINCOLN.

As, however, his army does not yet amount to 20,000 men in all, and as it is extremely doubtful whether it will ever be any larger, and as it is in the main composed of mercenaries, adventurers, and chevaliers d'industrie from every country in Europe, while the army of Sardinia musters 200,000 men in arms, with the entire population of Central Italy behind them, the world will be somewhat slow in appreciating His Holiness' magnanimity in not laying violent hands on the Romagnoles. In fact, we fear most people will come to the conclusion that the want of a will is simply due to the want of a way, and that if the Prince of Peace could muster 300,000 men of war he would treat most of the cities of AEmilia to a dose of that ""grace, mercy and peace"" which he showered, by the aid of Swiss bayonets, upon the obstinate sinners of Perugia. His forbearance is somewhat similar to that of the brigands, who permitted the regiment of Zouaves to circulate along the loneliest roads in Italy without once molesting them. If there is one thing more than another which the enemies of the Papacy sincerely desire, it is an onslaught of the faithful few who have congregated under the Papal banners upon the Sardinian army. The worst service the ""young men of good family,"" who are said to be flocking to his Holiness' banners, could possibly render him, would be to win their spurs in conflict with his revolted subjects. In a military point of view, the attempt would be all but ridiculous. Its political results would pretty certainly be a revolt at Rome, another in Naples, and the departure of his Holiness and the ""young men"" in question for parts beyond the Tyrrhene or the Adrian Sea. In a moral point of view, it would be more disastrous still. His Holiness' best friends concede to his spiritual sovereignty a far greater importance than that of his temporal dominion; and a civil war with carnal weapons -- a war accompanied by horrible bloodshed and disorder, such as a war between the Italian Pope and the Italian people would be sure to be -- is something which, if undertaken by Christ's Vicar on Earth, would administer a greater shock to the moral sense of mankind than anything which has occurred since the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The civilized public of modern times can stand a great deal, but the spectacle of a hired Swiss sticking a bayonet into the heart of an Italian citizen for demanding his civic rights, at the command of a minister of religion who claims to represent the Apostle rebuked by his Master for drawing his sword upon the high-priest's servant, is something which the nineteenth century will not endure. A few fanatics may aver and believe that God would look down approvingly upon the whole matter -- and that the angels in Heaven would rejoice over the dead carcases of the slain upon the storming and sacking of Bologna and Ferrara; and that the blood on the Pontifical robes would smell sweetly at the judgment bar, when PIUS the Ninth presents himself for approval, -- but these are things the civilized world, even the Catholic civilized world, will not believe. Ninety per cent. of all Christian men and women baptised in the Roman communion would shudder over the bloody tale, and whatever their lips might say, their hearts at least would wander from their allegiance to the author of so hideous a crime. It is useless for bishops to bewail this state of the case, for all their wailing will not alter it. There was a time when the Pope was above the moral law, but in this century he lies under it, and there is no safety for him or for his authority in trifling with its majesty. One of the disadvantages of his Holiness' position is that it is a little more unseemly for him to order women to be massacred than for a lay prince to do so. If his advisers are at all rational, they will, however, remind him that this little inconvenience of the Papacy is counterbalanced by advantages which had better not be sacrificed to remedy it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pope and His People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pope and His People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ca43653-40c0-563d-836b-b553fd0e2550,757,nyt://article/8ca43653-40c0-563d-836b-b553fd0e2550
"The old and well-known site of Athens continues to offer as rich a field for exploration as the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. You cannot dig a trench anywhere within a mile of the citadel without coming upon some fragment of an ancient edifice, and every spadefull of earth is sure to contain a dozen bits of old pottery, often with a name or a design of some kind upon their sides. Some localities are particularly rich. Such was a spot on which the Athenian Archeological Society chanced to light a few years ago; where was found a collection of inscriptions all more or less mutilated, but some of them of remarkable interest. Within a comparatively short time the Government has begun a thorough search for the relics of antiquity which might yet be discovered on the platform of the Acropolis, in the vicinity of the Parthenon and Erechtheum. Some extracts from the last report of the General Superintendent of Antiquities, Mr. PITTAKES, contained in the Journal of the Studious published at Athens, may be read with pleasure by the readers of the TIMES: ""During the months of October, November and December, the archaeological excavations in the Acropolis were prosecuted on the southern side of the inclosure. This entire side was uncovered, and everywhere appeared the upper courses of the Cimonian Wall. This wall is built of stones of tufa laid in six rows, so as to form a wall five French metres in breadth. The empty space within the wall, and between it and the descending rock, the ancients filled with chips of scene and ruins of various old edifices. Having made a very slight excavation here, I found a fragment of a bas-relief of ancient AEginetan workmanship, representing horses drawing a chariot. Its execution, like that of all works of Archaic sculpture, is stiff, sinewy and harsh. It resembles closely the pas-relief of Ceres placed at the entrance of the Acropolis, and seems, indeed, to have formed a part of it. After the conclusion of the examination of the vicinity of the Erechtheure, I design making a more thorough search in the spot I have just mentioned, where I anticipate rich and curious discoveries. For, as I have said, it was filled with relies of the time before the Persian wars, with remains of ancient temples, altars, and other works of sculpture and the plastic art, and architecture, -- works which they deemed useless, but which we, in our lack of the wealth of ancient art, in which they abounded, consider extremely valuable."" Next, Mr. PITTAKES tells us, workmen were employed on the northern side of the citadel, beginning with the temenus of the Ereentheum. On the very second day, some votive tablets and three decrees of the people rewarded their tolls. These were followed by the disclosure of the pedestal of a statue of CAIUS JULIUS, son of NICLAS LAMPRRUS. But the most valuable result attained was the discovery of a colossal female statue, clad in a long tunic, and seated upon a rock, which it is easy to see was intended to be a miniature representation of the Acropolis itself in its original state. It is therefore conjectured to have been a Minerva Poleouchus, or ""Guardian of the City,"" and to have served as a sort of guide to the devotee who approached the revered shrine of the goddess.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/21/archives/meum-and-tuum.html,,"Crimes, like sorrows, rarely come ""single spies,"" but rather whole battalions. The present year, both in Europe and America, has been already signalized by a most remarkable series of defalcations and breaches of faith. They have occurred alike in public and in private life. The highest official rank has proved no guarantee against the same temptations to which obscure responsibility has suc- cumbed. The proudest ministers of absolute sovereigns have fallen into one gulf of felony with the servants of a free people. The honor of the soldier and the probity of the banker have disappeared in one crucible. The Catholic General, Baron VON EYNATTEN, and the Protestant cashier PULLINGER, have stricken hands over one common compact with shame. The finances of an Empire have been shaken by the dishonorable suicide of a world-renowned statesman in Vienna; and the credit of a great commercial company reels in New-York at the disappearance of a common-place accountant. So frequent have acts of administrative dishonesty become of late years, that the first explanation which occurs to the public mind, of any irregularity or interruption in the financial processes of a public or private corporation, is now at once attributed to fraud, and the values vested by governments or by commercial companies are consequently held constantly liable to the most sudden and alarming depreciations, at the mercy of a hundred accidents. The case of the Pacific Mail Company's stock on the New York market, at the end of last week, is the latest and not the least striking illustration of this state of things. It has already begun to appear that the sudden evasion of one of the officers of that Company is attributable rather to despair at his incapacity of correcting accounts, which he had kept without sufficient order or method, than to any malversation or dishonesty on his part. It is more than probable, even, that no damage to the property of any holder of the Pacific Mail Stock will accrue from this evasion. Yet how instantaneous and how severe was the depression produced by the first appearance of any disorder in the Company's affairs! Men's minds, not yet recovered from the shock of recent disclosures at the National Post-office, ran back at once to the calamities which ushered in the crash of 1857, and to the guilty machinations of ROBERT SCHUYLER. The hypothesis of crime comes most quickly into every mind, when trouble overtakes any institution dependent on the integrity of individuals for its credit and its currency. This is certainly sad enough; and as certainly it marks our own age with a peculiar emphasis. There have been frauds always, and malversations in office, and abuses of confidence. Possibly it might be shown by a competent statistician to be true that in proportion to the enormous extent of modern financial transactions, modern financial probity need really fear no comparison with the probity of bygone times. But the special feature of our current crimes of this kind is to be found in the facility with which everybody admits their existence, as a sufficient explanation of all sorts of financial disasters; and this feature deserves the most thoughtful attention. A thousand subtle philosophical reasons might easily be given, we dare say, for this prevalent temper of the day, and as many moral remedies for it suggested as there are preachers in the land. But without entering upon the profounder metaphysics of the matter, it is tolerably plain that the intense competition and the vast personal opportunities of modern society have sorely disturbed the ancient limits of meum and tuum in the current conscience of mankind. Turn where we may, we can light upon no case of national or commercial malfeasance which cannot be radically accounted for, at the root, by the weakening in men's minds of the barriers which divide ""mine"" from ""thine "" -- the barriers so happily described by SCHILLER as ""the holy bounds of property."" Devotion to ends begetting indifference to means, runs throughout the enterprise of the world. It is constantly veiled under fine names and sounding forms of words, but it amounts in substance to a very vulgar offence, as old as the Decalogue, and common alike to the Tahitian savage, who covets the brass buttons of the European middy, and to the American million-aire, who risks other people's investments to assure his own objects. ""Scratch a Russian,"" said M. DE CUSTINE, ""and you will find a Tartar."" ""Scratch a defalcation,"" we say, ""and you will find a theft."" Of course, in nine cases out of ten, the civilized defaulter does not recognize this true nature of the deed that he is doing. But it is precisely because they do not or will not thus look it in the face, that the nine do the deed. The Government officer who lends the nation's money intrusted to himself to his friends, would no doubt shrink from taking his neighbor's watch to give it to his wife; and tie consents to the first act because it never so much as occurs to him to see in it precisely the same qualities which would make the second loathsome in his eyes. The tolerance, the indifference, the condonation, silent or expressed, of half the busy world, confirms him in this blindness; and so from step to step he hurries down the abyss. The railway functionary who takes the names of stockholders to bribe legislators into passing acts which he thinks advisable to be passed, never dreams that he is committing a positive breach of trust; the Board of Directors who declare dividends that have never been earned, out of money borrowed on the strength of dividends previously declared, would shrink with horror from the flat truth which brands them as practical swindlers. The names of things have taken the place of things themselves, and men having fixed the names of certain crimes upon certain varieties of those crimes, gradually lose the power of perceiving the real and unvarying nature which underlies all varieties of crime alike -- identical in intrinsic baseness and in the mischief it is sure to work, however covered up and concealed it may he under the specious forms and habits of men's minds.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Meum and Tuum.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Meum and Tuum.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e0464a6-4e88-5846-a4fa-9c515050d0b2,1359,nyt://article/1e0464a6-4e88-5846-a4fa-9c515050d0b2

The facilities on the El Paso line for an enterprise of that character are very superior; their stations and employes at regular intervals along the roads, already afford means of running an express at a trifling cost, compared to the expense that any other Company would be subjected to. The calculation is to go from Fort Smith to Los Angeles in five days; and starting as it appears, there is nothing in the undertaking to stagger a Company that has put through a stage coach from Syracuse, in this State, to San Francisco in sixteen days -- a distance of twenty-seven hundred miles. The space between Fort Smith and Los Angeles is about fifteen hundred miles, and three hundred miles per day would be the maximum speed required to overcome it in fire days. This is at the rate of 12 1/2 miles per hour, and as their stages frequently go 13 miles in a single hour, it is supposed that over these favorable places, horses, with relays every ten miles, could be put through at the extraordinary speed of twenty miles per hour, which would leave ample margin for the rough places in the mountains, and for stops along the route. Even admitting that the trip is capable of being made in six days, it at once takes the lead in the annals of fast traveling. Nothing short of a race-course could surpass the speed shown in the grand race between the two oceans. The Pony Express, by the central route, would, undoubtedly, contest the palm nobly, and between the two, the speed, would become positively terrific.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Fast Line to California.; OPPOSITION TO THE PONY EXPRESS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Fast Line to California.; OPPOSITION TO THE PONY EXPRESS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e92ed64-11ef-5cc8-a6c3-1150aecfad58,315,nyt://article/9e92ed64-11ef-5cc8-a6c3-1150aecfad58

Both were aware of the notice alluded to in our last, and both suggested that the fight should take place outside of England; but whether SAYERS will agree to this remains to be proved. A day has been named, but, as by the articles, the men are bound to fight in England; and as the authorities are determined, we cannot see a way out of the difficulty unless SAYERS waives the articles entirely and goes abroad to continue the contest. We had not seen HEENAN since the fight until Friday, and were glad to perceive that, beyond a scar and a few discolorations, he had entirely recovered from the punishment he had received. He, of course, expressed his anxiety to have the matter settled in one way or the other, and made no objection to give the proper time for SAYERS to be placed on an equal footing with himself. He announced that he will shortly take a benefit, but that there had been some difficulty as to a place, which prevented him at present fixing a day. All we can say is, let him lose no time, but ""strike the iron while it is hot."" The excitement at present is very great, and if he fixes upon a spot within a few days he must realize a large sum. If he tarry too long, public interest will be on the wane, and his receipts will be diminished by one half. Of TOM SAYERS we have heard but little during the week. He has been at Chester and Liverpool, at each of which places he has had most rapturous receptions, and received large subscriptions. His arm is progressing favorably, although, of course, the cure must be very slow. We have received a message from Mr. HOGG, of the Angel, Stratford, (the Mr. H. alluded to in our last,) stating that he was not a friend of HEENAN's, and knew nothing of him beyond seeing him with MACDONALD, and that he was sent to the referee by the latter to request him to return to the ring and allow the battle to go on, and not for the purpose of putting an end to it. If Mr. HOGG sends us a letter to this effect we will insert it; but we may inform him at once that his memory must be some what at fault if he imagines he put his request to the referee in the way stated. Before concluding these remarks, we have only to repeat the recommendation that the men should shake hands and settle the matter in an amicable manner. The feeling throughout the country, it we except certain of the betting fraternity, is so decidedly in favor of a draw, and the opinion so universal that both men have done enough, that we do not hesitate to adopt this course. We have no doubt many will be found ready to throw suspicion upon such a recommendation, as tending to imply a doubt in our minds as to the capabilities of the Champion, out they will not be found among a class to whom it is of any importance to us to explain our motives. We feel quite confident that those whose good opinion alone we care for will all be ready to justify what we have said and done. Our correspondent is wrong in supposing TOM SAYERS can claim the belt without fighting out the present match with HEENAN, supposing it does not take place previous to the 16th of June. The match once made must be decided one way or the other, unless the men agree to a draw.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GREAT BRITAIN.; THE FIGHT FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

"Last evening Dr. CHEEVER delivered a discourse to a large congregation in his own church, on the ""Rights of conscience towards God in the people of the United States, and the violation of that right in the illegal imprisonment of Mr. HYATT by the United States Senate.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/21/archives/the-rights-of-conscience-a-sermon-by-dr-cheever.html,,"Last evening Dr. CHEEVER delivered a discourse to a large congregation in his own church, on the ""Rights of conscience towards God in the people of the United States, and the violation of that right in the illegal imprisonment of Mr. HYATT by the United States Senate."" Before commencing his discourse he announced that on next Sunday evening he would speak of the relation of the Church to the Society, and assert the entire independence of the Church of the Society. He took for his text the 12th verse of the 16th chapter of Luke -- ""And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"" Speaking of the importance of faith in God, he said it was as necessary to a nation as to an individual, to save from wrong and oppression. And, when a Government persisted in doing wrong, he held that it should be overturned -- the rule of action in all such cases should be revolution. The law of God was the foundation of all just law, and a violation of His law by a nation, was just as sure to bring punishment as when the violation was by an individual. Thereupon the nation that looked upon man-stealing as law and rightousness, would surely come to punishment. The piety of a nation that judged of manhood by the color of the skin, was not even skin deep, while its wickedness reached to the bone. Against such a nation, and against bad laws, he considered it to be the duty of the minister to preach. It was his duty to preach God's law against bad laws. Coming to speak more directly to the case of THADDEUS HYATT, he said Mr. HYATT's conscience would not let him answer such questions as a Committee of the United States Senate chose to ask him; and that his declaration of a conscience towards God caused contempt and rage. He was declared in contempt and thrown into prison, because he dared to place conscience before God higher than a Senatorial Committee with power. The speaker, in continuation, over and over again, said that it was nothing but the association of a conscience toward God that caused Mr. HYATT to be imprisoned; that there was no other charge brought against him and that for that, and that alone, he was cast into a filthy dungeon -- simply because he spoke of a conscience toward GOD, and [???]enied that the Senate had any of the attributes of GOD. Thus was Mr. HYATT imprisoned without law; and he, repeating what he remarked at the Cooper Institute meeting, held that the people were bound to go to Washington and, in the name of GOD, take Mr. HYATT out of prison.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.; A SERMON BY DR.

It was at first suspected that Patrick Mockler, the steward of the vessel, was the thief, and he was arrested, but an investigation resulted in causing suspicion to rest upon the accused, who arrived from Mobile last Saturday. In searching the Captain's premises at Forked River, Monmouth County N.J., the officers discovered a large trunk, filled with various packages of merchandise, buried in the garden, and yesterday afternoon another trunk, containing dry goods, was dug out of a sand-bank at Staten Island. In each instance the trade-marks had been left upon the property, so that little difficulty will be experienced in identifying it.

"CABS AND THE CENTRAL PARK. -- There is a snarl twisting up between the Central Park Commissioners and the proprietors of business wagons as to the right of entry into the Park, which some good citizen might unravel, and at the same time do the public a great service, by establishing near the Park a stand of light one-horse carriages, to be let out at a cheap rate, by the hour or otherwise, to persons desiring a drive in the grounds. At present everybody who does not possess either a private carriage or a grocer's wagon must charter one of the antediluvian coaches, with two horses, known to Aldermen and livery stable keepers as the common domestic ""hack,"" at a cost of from five to ten dollars, if he wishes an hour's ride in the Park. Why, in the name of cheapness, common sense and comfort, cannot the mass of decent citizens be enabled, after riding to the Park in the cars, to find there a passable vehicle, with a single horse, in which they may make the circuit of the grounds for a quarter, or a half, or even a whole dollar? What has become of that mysterious Corporation which regularly every session takes out a charter authorizing it to furnish New-York with cheap cabs, and yet never starts them?

"BROADWAY IN DISORDER.-- The prudent gardeners who supply our hungry City, take pains to sow different plats successively, in order that a succession of crops may furnish a constant supply.

The builders in Broadway seem generally to adopt a similar plan, and manage somehow to keep that street [???]umbered with rubbish in one or two places at a time the year round. They very seldom begin operations in more than two peaces at once, and in these the new building goes up while the old one is coming down, and the sidewalk in front is thus obstructed simultaneously with old ruins and new materials. The genius of destruction, however, has during the past week devoted itself with unparalleled activity to the demolition of old buildings, in apparent disregard whether newer fabrics shall rise from the ruins or the sites be left blank. Between the City Hall and Grace Church there are no fewer than a dozen houses undergoing the process of entire demolition. The safety of the thousands of pedestrians crowding the side-walk renders, equal care, necessary in taking down old materials as in carrying up new. And hence though gravitation offers its cheap services to the tearers down, those worthies refuse to contract with it, and employ a hod and Celtic muscle instead for taking down the street walls.

Past experience furnishes no ground for hope that Broad way will ever hear the last of the builders' hammer. But it is at least a consolation to observe so many houses rebuilding at the same time, as to warrant the expectation that when these are completed we may enjoy a temporary lull of the dust and rubbish which at this moment barricade the street at almost every block, and that the variformed fronts on either side may remain without change while Mr. ANTHONY has time to take an instantaneous view for the historical edification of the next generation.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/22/archives/article-10-no-title.html,,"BROADWAY IN DISORDER.-- The prudent gardeners who supply our hungry City, take pains to sow different plats successively, in order that a succession of crops may furnish a constant supply.

Miss PHIPPS, from Tennessee, who has been an inmate of the institution for some time, had requested of Mr. ABBOT, the Principal of the Institute, that Gen. BYNUM, who, she affirmed, was from the same State as herself, might be allowed to visit her as a relative. Her request was granted, and Gen. BYNUM had seen her once in public, and once in private, when suspicions were aroused that his visits were of a different character from those which a relative would pay. Inquiries at the St. Nicholas, where he was stopping, confirmed these suspicions, and Gen. BYNUM was requested to discontinue his visits. This he not only promised to do, but volunteered a written pledge to that effect, and gave his word that he intended to leave the City immediately. On Saturday afternoon, notwithstanding these assurances, he called again at the Institute, and sent up his card to Mrs. ABBOT. This visit was made, as is alleged, at a time when it was known Mr. ABBOT was habitually absent. Mrs. ABBOTT responded promptly, however, and almost at the same moment that she made her appearance Miss PHIPPS entered the room. Mrs. ABBOT requested the young lady to withdraw, as she desired to see the General alone, but this he protested against, affirming that he had no secrets from Miss PHIPPS. Mrs. ABBOTT replied that all conversation between them must be in her presence. Gen. BYNUM immediately stepped up to Miss PHIPPS and addressed her a few words in a whisper. Miss PHIPPS then turned to Mrs. ABBOT and said, ""I must bid you good bye."" To such summary proceedings as these Mrs ABBOT objected, and attempted to take out a writ of habeas corpus by throwing her arms around her pupil and holding her. Gen. BYNUM finally succeeded in releasing Miss PHIPPS from Mrs. ABBOT's e'mbrace. Mrs. ABBOT instinctively turned and seized the General, but he threw her from him in a violent, and as is charged, almost in an insulting manner, and started for the door in company with Miss PHIPPS.

"THE UP-TOWN MOVEMENT. -- Somebody relates of the grampus a remarkable mode of fighting, the result whereof is bloodless alike to victor and vanquished. Two of these animals no sooner meet, than, like two irate Congressmen, they retire from the gaze of the world to some sheltered spot, and there engage in quite as harmless strife as a Congressional duel generally proves to be. Grampus number one opens the contest by stretching out his neck to an unusual length. His opponent endeavors to raise his own head higher still, and succeeding, is in turn outdone by his ambitious rival. The strife continues till one of the creatures breaks his neck, when the victor returns to his accustomed haunts. To this eccentric type of rivalry we think a parallel is furnished by the eagerness which some of our business men display to outstrip each other in the up-town race. No sooner does Smith forsake his long-occupied stand for one above Brown's, and fairly ensconce himself therein, than Brown strikes his tent and pitches it further up than Smith.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, corner of York and Gold streets, asked to be excused from paying taxes upon their building adjoining the Church used as a parsonage.

The Committee recommend that the Counselor be directed to compel the late Commissioner to return the missing records of the Department; that the Finance Committee be directed to report some way in which to provide for meeting the expenses of the Department for the balance of the year, where the appropriation has been exhausted, and that a Special Committee be appointed to draft an ordinance regulating this Department so as to prevent any future squandering of the City money by the holder of this office.

NEWMAN, NO. 41 Court-street, was entered, and a coat and a pair of pantaloons were stolen. On Friday the stolen articles were found at the house of JAMES MCCRILLIS, No. 377 Harrison-avenue, who was discharged from the police force about two years ago, on a suspicion of his having been connected with the robbery of a store. Since his discharge from the police he has been keeping a disreputable house on Harrison-avenue. It is said that the police were informed that the stolen property was in the possession of MCCRILLIS by his wife. He was arrested on Friday evening by Deputy Chief HAM and detective officer WRIGHT, and lodged in the Tombs. Mr. HAM had an interview with him, and questioned him about the robbery. MCCRILLIS owned that it was committed by members of the police department. Mr. HAM had suspected this, as he had been cautioned by some person to be on his guard. MCCRILLIS would not make any statement in regard to the matter, and Mr. HAM arrested ISAAC B. HUTCHINS and JETHRO H. GOODWIN of the second station, when they came in from their beats that night at 1 o'clock' on suspicion, and kept them in custody until morning. They were then taken to the Chief's office, and searched in separate rooms. They found on HUTCHINS a bunch of skeleton keys and a loaded pistol, with which he threatened to take his own life. The Chief of Police told him that his case was bad, and HUTCHINS pretended to make a clean breast of it, implicating many other officers, who, he stated, had been for several years in the habit of entering stores with false keys and in other ways, and stealing all kinds of merchandise in small quantities. Nothing was found on GOODWIN, and he refused to make any statement. An investigation before the Mayor and Committee on Police -- Aldermen ATKINS, AMORY, and C[???]ANE -- was had on Saturday, and all the officers implicated by HUTCHINS (twelve at the second station, and one at the first and eighth) were ordered to appear at the City Hall. The investigation was commenced in the morning at the Mayor's office, and lasted until about 11 o'clock on Saturday night.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Robberies in Boston.; DEPREDATIONS BY POLICEMEN POSTPONEMENT OF THEIR TRIAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Robberies in Boston.; DEPREDATIONS BY POLICEMEN POSTPONEMENT OF THEIR TRIAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2794c1d-ec2b-5153-83c0-9235b26bbcfa,888,nyt://article/e2794c1d-ec2b-5153-83c0-9235b26bbcfa

It moreover releases naval officers from-their present liability in an action for damages, in case they make a mistake in overhauling a vessel suspected of being a slaver; substitutes imprisonment for life for the death penalty, and raises the prize-money on every captured negro from twenty-five to one hundred dollars. These are the principal provisions of Mr. WILSON's bill, and they are supported by a large number of minor clauses which will give the act, if faithfully carried through, a fair prospect of real efficacy. Mr. WILSON ought, however, to add still another clause, adopting Mr. BUCHANAN's recommendation in his late message on this subject, and establishing depots for the negroes captured by cruisers, in which these unfortunate people can remain until returned to their own country.

Dr. FRANCIS VINTON, before the graduating law class of Columbia College. President KING and Profs. MCVICAR, NAIENE and DWIGHT occupied seats in the chancel. The lesson of the evening, in part, was the reading of the Decalogue. The introductory services being concluded, Dr. VINTON ascended the desk on the left of the altar, and announced as the text of his sermon the 52d verse of the 11th chapter of Luke: ""Woe unto you lawyers, for ye have taken away the key of knowledge."" After expounding the context, and the circumstances under which this language was addressed, by Christ, to the scribes of his day, because they had perverted the law, instead of teaching it in its purity, he gave, as the leading doctrines deduced from the text first, the majesty of the law; second, the dignity of the legal profession; third, the liability of lawyers, from misinterpretation of the law, to mislead and hinder both themselves and others from duty; and, fourth, the penalty denounced against the perversions of the law. The concluding portion of the discourse was a review of the safeguards thrown around the purity and impartiality of the Judges, in both the English and American Constitutions, and a strong denunciation of the dangerous lapse of this state by the adoption of an elective Judiciary. The sermon was one of great eloquence and power, and produced a profound impression upon the audience.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d1e33146-c069-500c-9df4-58855e676e60,667,nyt://article/d1e33146-c069-500c-9df4-58855e676e60

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/24/archives/brooklyn-intelligence.html,,"ANNUAL SABBATH SCHOOL PARADE. -- The annual parade of the Brooklyn Sabbath schools, postponed from Tuesday, on account of the rain storm, came off yesterday. Nearly every school in the city turned out with full ranks, under the immediate care of their teachers -- the whole comprising a force of nearly twenty thousand. More than one-half of this number marched on Remsen-street and streets in the vicinity; between four and five thousand paraded on Clinton-avenue, and the remainder of the schools formed in the Eastern District. Each division had music, and, after counter-marching, the schools filed off to the different churches, as indicated in the programme, in each of which short addresses were made, followed by refreshments. The day was pleasant, the children were all neatly dressed and each school carried one or more appropriate banners, and nothing occurred to mar the pleasures of the occasion. From the annual report of the ""Union,"" which includes only the schools connected with churches in the Western District, we obtain the following particulars: During the last year, two additional church schools have been organized, and six new mission schools, while one, hitherto a mission school, has matured into an organized church, with its dependent S. school. The increase of scholars over the past year is 1,913, and of teachers 80. Of these scholars, 710 are in the mission schools. The reported number of conversions is 394, of which 324 are pupils, and 70 are teachers. The total number of schools (only including the western division of the city) is 109, of which 76 are church, and 33 mission schools. The total number of scholars is 22,982, (average atteadance 13,603) of teachers 2,611. The mission schools have 2,964 scholars.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/017d78f2-0064-5984-afa1-3da8a1a9211c,460,nyt://article/017d78f2-0064-5984-afa1-3da8a1a9211c

There can be no doubt now that GARIBALDI, after maturely weighing the actual chances of the rising in Sicily, has once more drawn his sword in the cause to which his whole life has been given. With a well-organized force-of two thousand volunteers, partners of his splendid campaign in the Lombard Alps, and devoted, like himself, to the standard of Italian unity and Italian independence, the defender of Rome and the hero of Varese has sailed from Sardinia, to kindle into a wide and devouring flame the scattered fires which threaten the throne of the dull tyrant of Naples. As to the gallantry and generosity of this act of the great Italian guerilla, there can be hardly two opinions among men worthy of the name, be their political opinions what they may. The Press of England and France, of course, pay public law the easy tribute of pointing out that GARIBALDI, arming troops in Sardinia for-the invasion of Sicily, is really a fillibuster; but this recognition of the legal nature of his expedition is accompanied by none of those denunciations which our foreign contemporaries can always pour forth in such overwhelming profusion whenever our American ""sympathizers"" go crusading across the frontiers of Canada and Mexico, or hover, magnanimous eagles of liberty, over the tempting shores of Cuba. They all admit that GARIBALDI has done a very incorrect thing; they all take the Government of VICTOR EMANUEL more or less gently to task for its failure to find out what the General was at, and to do their duty by young King BOMBA, with whom the Sardinian Sovereign maintains the usual diplomatic relations.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Garibaldi in Sicily.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Garibaldi in Sicily.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3baa6ec5-185a-5d45-ac64-2874180ae7a6,1752,nyt://article/3baa6ec5-185a-5d45-ac64-2874180ae7a6

Storer, Capt. TRASK, between the officers and the seamen. Early in the morning the vessel's crew were shipped and she was hauled into the stream near Bedloe's Island, preparatory to her departure for Liverpool. The seamen, as is invariably the case, were partially intoxicated at the time they embarked and their frequent potations in the interval before the vessel was ready to go, rendered them very disorderly. In order to secure their services, the officers nailed up the forecastle where the sailors had secreted their liquor, and at 3 o'clock the anchor having been raised, a steam-tug started down the Bay with the ship in tow. Soon afterwards some of the crew came aft and demanded of Capt. TRASK that the forecastle should be opened, but on his refusal to comply with the request, the men declared that they would not work, and immediately inaugurated a disturbance. Marlin-spikes, belaying-pins, and other missiles, were thrown at the officers upon the poop deck, until finally the captain had to fire several times upon the mutineers, who returned the shots without doing any damage. Meantime, the captain gave orders to have the vessel towed back again, and anchored. This was done, and a signal of distress was displayed, but the battle was kept up without intermission, and the steward of the ship, who had been assisting the officers to keep the rebels from the poop, received a shot in the head which laid him insensible on the deck, and which is believed will speedily result in his death.

This was an important matter, not so much as relates to the relations of those States themselves with Great Britain, but as to the settlement of the long-vexed question of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. When the late Government went out of office there were three questions under consideration -- namely, the settlement of the boundary line, the cession of the Mosquito protectorate to the Nicaraguan Government, and the cession of the Bay Islands to Honduras, on conditions insuring the safety of Her Majesty's subjects in those islands. The discussion of these three subjects had been commenced by the late Government and he should like to know the progress made in the negotiations. He had read in the newspapers the other day that the Bay Islands had bean ceded to Honduras. If that were so, and if it were done on the condition laid down first by Lord CLARENDON and afterwards by himself, he thought it would be a subject of great congratulation, that condition being the complete and entire recognition of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty by the United States, and the entire security of Her Majesty's subjects in the Bay Islands against any interference from the United States or any other State whatever.

The news is of interest. The departure of Gen., GARIBALDI for Sicily with three vessels and some 2,200 men, is confirmed. Every precaution had been taken by the Sardinian Government to defeat the attempt, but so skillfully had the plans of the troops been laid, that they escaped without molestation. The vessels had subsequently touched at a Tuscan port for additional stores, and then put to sea, for what immediate destination was not known. It was rumored that a landing in Calabria, by way of a diversion in favor of the Sicilians, was contemplated by GARIBALDI. Much apprehension was felt lest the gallant leader and his chivalrous band should fall into the hands of the Neapolitan steam-cruisers. VICTOR EMANUEL had returned to Turin amid the liveliest demonstrations of popular joy. The Papal troops were rapidly organizing, with a view to opening the campaign on the Romagna. The intelligence from the rest of the Continent, beyond an improbable rumor that the French Government had inquired at Berlin the reason of the extraordinary armament of Prussia, is without importance. In the British Parliament, Lord MALMESBURY had obtained from the Ministry an explanation of the state of Central American diplomacy. The information elicited was already current here. Mr. HALIBURTON had called attention to French aggressions in Newfound land, declaring that the recent fortifications and naval stations of that Power controlled the entrance to the St. Lawrence. Lord JOHN RUSSELL said the subject had been examined by the law officers of the Crown, who discovered no infraction of right on the part of the French. Spirited correspondence had passed between Earl GREY and Lord JOHN RUSSELL relative to the course of these statesmen upon the reform question. It is one of many evidences of misunderstanding existing in the Cabinet.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/25/archives/obituary.html,,"DEATH OF PROF. WILSON, THE ORIENTALIST. The death of HORACE HAYMAN WILSON, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Sanscrit in the University of Oxford, is just announced. He was born in London, in September, 1796. At the age of fifteen he was taken from the Soho-square school, where he had received an excellent education, to be initiated into the mysteries of the counting-room. It took but a few months to prove to young WILSON that the desk could not develop those powers which he felt conscious that he possessed, and he left it to devote himself to the study of medicine. In 1805 he passed as a member of the College of Surgeons, and soon afterwards received an appointment to an office in the Calcutta Mint. While on his voyage to India he commenced the study of the Oriental languages. The works of Sir W. JONES, which fell under Mr. WILSON's eye soon after his arrival at the scene of his labors, induced him to commence the study of the Sanscrit. At every turn he found himself crippled by the want of a good Sanscrit-English Dictionary; and as the most satisfactory and speedy way of supplying his necessity, he turned his attention to the preparation of such a work. It appeared in 1819, and met with a hearty reception from scholars. After having accomplished this task, Mr. WILSON devoted himself to reorganizing the Benares Sanscrit College, which had fallen into decay. In 1821 he returned to Calcutta. Contributions from his pen, which appeared in the Arabic Researches and the Oriental Quarterly Magazine, testified to his continued industry. The Sanscrit College, at Calcutta, was a[???]o greatly indebted to his efforts for a revival of its efficiency. The appointment to the Boden Professorship of Sanscrit in the University of Oxford, which was offered Mr. WILSON in 1833, induced him to return to England. All the learned societies with which he had been connected expressed their regret at his departure in complimentary addresses. Prof. WILSON landed in England after an absence of a quarter of a century, and immediately entered himself as a member of Exeter College, where be was admitted to the degree of A.M. He was, about this period, elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and became a member of the Numismatic and Philological societies soon after their formation. He was L[???]orarian to the East India Company, Visitor to the East India College of Addiscombe, and President of the Royal Arabic Society. The scholars on the continent displayed their appreciation of his eminent services by electing him a member or the Imperial Institute of France, and of the Imperial and Royal Academies of St. Petersburgh, Vienna, Munich and Berlin. He had a membership in numerous other societies besides these. Besides writing miscellaneous works, illustrating the mythology, history and traditions of the East, he supervised and corrected an edition of Mills' History of India. Prof. WILSON's wife was a daughter of GEORGE SIDDONS, Esq., of the Bengal Civil Service, youngest son of the celebrated SARAH SIDDONS.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/07d5657b-0f06-521b-8e69-0cf500b37389,687,nyt://article/07d5657b-0f06-521b-8e69-0cf500b37389

STERNDALE BENNETT is hardly so well known in America as his merits ought to have made him. He bears, as a composer, a very close relation to the school of MENDELSSOHN, under whose supervision he made his debut in Germany in 1836; bat he does not belong to the Germans in the same sense, for instance, in which his countryman ONSLOW must be called a French composer. More than any living Englishman BENNETT deserves the praise of a specially English and original quality of mind. His ""Wood Nymphs,"" and his ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" laid the foundations of an English popularity of the highest order, which has been enhanced by the brilliant success of the ""May Queen,"" a cantata essentially national alike in theme and in treatment. Mr. BENNETT is a thorough master of harmony, but the lyric traits of-his genius make their way constantly in bursts of light and melody; and as the ""May Queen"" is to be performed under the direction of that accomplished virtuose Mr. G.F. BRISTOW, the musical public will expect to hear full justice done to the English composer's masterpiece.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0bcbe65a-5e48-59c7-86ce-34f4da23fdeb,326,nyt://article/0bcbe65a-5e48-59c7-86ce-34f4da23fdeb

The plates however, at that time, were restored, when the accused learned from a journeyman in the office that Mr. Ackerman did not own them, but on Monday morning the prisoners reappeared at the printing-office, and after breaking open the door, carried away all the property, including $3,000 worth of Mr. Dodworth's plates, which they secreted. Hurley subsequently called upon Mr. D., and stated that he was a constable, but offered to restore the property. His proposal did not meet with an acceptance, and a complaint was lodged against both Brown and himself. The claim of Hurley to being a constable is not admitted, not withstanding the fact that he was elected to the office at the last election, as he failed to comply with the law in filing his securities within the specified time.

"AMERICANS IN JAPAN -- AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT. -- An incident has occurred in Japan, which, though trivial in itself, may be productive of serious consequences.

"PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN. -- A meeting was held last night at Scott's Exchange in Montgomery-street, Jersey City, for the purpose of organizing a Lincoln Club. A. GRIERE was appointed Chairman, and WM.B. DUNNING Secretary. Ex-Mayor GREGORY, one of the delegates to the Chicago Convention, was present and made an interesting report of the proceedings during the several days that the Convention was in session. From conversation with gentlemen from various sections of the country, and the enthusiasm manifested on the nomination of Mr. LINCOLN, Mr. GREGORY believed that the opposition would be triumphantly elected. A Committee, consisting of two from each Ward, was appointed to present a plan of organization.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/25/archives/a-cloud-in-prussia.html,,"The persistent efforts of English alarmists to frighten the good people of Prussia into expecting a French army on the Rhine, have not thus far been very successful; for it seems to be gradually dawning upon the German, and particularly upon the Prussian mind, that the domestic relations of the German States are matters almost as important to German statesmen and the German people, as the foreign policy of Great Britain. England has always found it very convenient to use Germany as her army. Strong by sea and weak by land, English Governments, planning Continental wars, cannot dispense with a Continental ally, powerful enough to supply the bayonets which England lacks, and just not independent enough to pursue a policy of her own. No such ally now remains to England, unless Prussia will accept the duty; and it is quite touching to see with how much pathos and eloquence English orators and journalists have of late been urging Prussia to beware in time of the stealthy advances of the Napoleonic power. This pathos and this eloquence, we will not say, have been utterly wasted upon their object; but they have certainly failed to elicit the grateful and immediate response which such disinterested devotion perhaps deserved. Prussia is indeed, agitated, as she has not been since 1848; but neither her anxieties nor her hopes are of a kind to satisfy her British advisers. It is not by the fear of France, but by the determination of ruling a united Germany, that the actual Government of Prussia seems now to be controlled. Prussia, under M. DE SCHLEINIT[???] and the Prince-Regent, is less concerned to protect the Rhenish frontier against a problematical French invasion, than to annihilate the influence of Austria in the Federal relations of the German Powers, and to make herself the representative and head of all truly German interests In the pursuit of this double aim, it is not impossible that Prussia may suddenly come into collision with France; but there is as yet no sort of valid reason for anticipating such a catastrophe. A very few words will suffice to explain to our readers the elements of a political situation which is now dividing the attention of diplomatic Europe with the position of FRANCIS II. in Naples.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Cloud in Prussia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Cloud in Prussia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Germany', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca4e5309-5df0-567e-a46c-bdcbda5ff4c7,1211,nyt://article/ca4e5309-5df0-567e-a46c-bdcbda5ff4c7

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/25/archives/religious-hatreds-of-england-and-ireland.html,,"The recruiting of Irishmen for the service of the Pope, which is said to be now progressing very steadily, is a curious illustration of that strange political perversity which seems to be one of the hardiest products of the long course of oppression which Ireland has undergone. The earlier struggles of the native population with their conquerors, were simply the struggles of two hostile races. It was not till the English had embraced Protestantism that their animosities became religious. The hatred of the Irish was no longer lavished on the Saxon but on the Protestant, and the Saxon in his turn transferred his loathing from the ""wild Irishman"" to the ""Papist."" It was the Catholics, and not the Irish, who were routed at the Boyne, and foiled before Londonderry, and it was against heretics, and not English, that SARSFIELD made his last stand at Limerick. In 1700 the distinction of race was no longer heard of, but the distinction of creed was a flaming sword. The more intensely Protestant England became, the more intensely Catholic Ireland became. The more English Liberals shrank from contact with foreign Ecclesiastics, the more fondly the Irish turned towards Rome. Whatever the one hated, the other with unconquerable pugnacity began instantly to adore. Hardly one of the great political principles for which the Whigs of 1688 contended, ever took the least root on the Irish side of the Channel. The more the British clung to representative institutions, the more the Irish bowed to priests and kings. While SOMERS was busy over the Bill of Rights, the ideal Government of the Irish people was the despotism of a gentlemanly Catholic, regular at mass and confession, and in good standing at the Vatican.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Religious Hatreds of England and Ireland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Religious Hatreds of England and Ireland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-05-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ceac26e4-c47e-5be1-be4b-b5fe00112a44,1038,nyt://article/ceac26e4-c47e-5be1-be4b-b5fe00112a44

"Mr. SCOTT RUSSELL recently read a very interesting paper on the shape of vessels, before the Institute of Naval Architects. His experiments as to the shape of sterns of vessels showed that they should have a cycloidal curve, in order to prevent the adverse action of the ""replacing"" or following waves.

In an article on merchant steam marines, which appeared not long since in the French Moniteur de la Flotte, this line was deservedly credited with all the best attributes of being a passenger navy; and being expressly excepted from the rather sweeping criticisms bestowed upon the management of American steamers in general, was recommended as a model, in all essential respects, to the attention of the new French Company now engaged in organizing a transatlantic steam line between the west coast of France and the Brazils.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Sea-going Steamers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Sea-going Steamers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5052585-29f3-5721-a2b9-7badec787633,459,nyt://article/a5052585-29f3-5721-a2b9-7badec787633

Instead of accepting the obvious and uniform interpretation given by their supporters, and recognized by our Courts, or of discriminating as to their practical operation, it has been maintained by both American and German journals, within a week, that ""the Sabbath is not a political, nor a civil, but a religious institution;"" and that ""the Sabbatarians intend to make the civil power subservient to the Church, and will soon compel every man to go to church on that day, or mulct him in a penalty for his disobedience."" Reams of paper have been spoiled in asserting the ""unconstitutionality"" of all such statutes. Were the laws what they are represented to be, or were the Constitution the mutilated, perverted thing claimed, there might be ground for the clamor against both. But in truth, both the laws and the Constitution have been shamefully misrepresented. And in point of fact, the constitutional objection has been almost universally based on the first clause of Art. I., sec. 3 -- ""The free exercise and enjoyment of religious professions and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this State to all mankind;"" -- -- without any reference to the concluding clause of the same section, which, of itself, nullifies every claim for Sunday license on the score of religious freedom. One honorable exception to this rule we find in the able leader of the Staats Zeitung of a recent date; and this leader is worthy of examination, both as a specimen of German logic, and because of its relation to the conflict of the Sunday theatre gentry with a recent law of this State.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Sunday Law and the German Press.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Sunday Law and the German Press.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4aef7717-fce3-5388-aa54-4931761268ec,1992,nyt://article/4aef7717-fce3-5388-aa54-4931761268ec

The water ran with great volume down the steep grade of Hicks into Fulton-street, doing much damage to the sewer being constructed on the former street. The contractor for this sewer, Mr. PATRICK DILLON, has excavated for a distance of nearly four blocks to a depth of fourteen feet. The water very speedily washed the dirt away from the bracos erected to prevent the banks from caving in, when at several points the earth caved in, carrying with it and breaking the water-pipes -- at this point nine or ten inches in diameter -- and with this additional supply, the sewer, street and many basements of houses were soon flooded. The Superintendent of the water-pipes in this district was promptly on the spot, and in a short time had the water shut off, the disjointed pipes suspended by means of derricks and readjusted, and the water was turned on again yesterday morning. So that the residents in the district experienced no great inconvenience from the accident. The sewer contractor's loss is estimated at between one and two thousand dollars. No serious damage eras done by the rain on sewers constructing in other districts; but the new streets, exposed to a sweep of water from the hillsides, were all more or less injured.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b211bd4e-7a69-5237-b65c-acb6127c4684,777,nyt://article/b211bd4e-7a69-5237-b65c-acb6127c4684

"The arrival of the Palestine at Quebec, and of the Arabia at Halifax, furnished us last evening with news from all parts of Europe to May 20, making the unusual, though not unprecedented time for the transmission of transatlantic news, of eight days. The intelligence is of the utmost importance. GARIBALDI, with his volunteers, had effected a landing at Marsala, in Sicily, leaving his vessels in the hands of pursuing Neapolitan frigates, but securing his arms and munition. Other arms and aids for the insurgents had been previously landed at another point. All the important points of Sicily were reported to have already fallen into the hands of the gallant leader, who had rallied all the disaffected to his ranks, and was quite sure to sweep the royal troops from the Island. A subsidiary expedition had effected a landing in Calabria, and Naples itself was threatened with insurrection. So great was the consternation of the King of Naples that he had invoked the aid of foreign Governments. There were also rumors of a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, just concluded between the Courts of Vienna, Rome and Naples, with the adhesion of the exiled Dukes. In Central Italy affairs were also assuming threatening appearances. Gen. LAMORICIERE was concentrating his forces on the frontier of the Romagna, and to oppose him Sardinia was throwing additional troops into the AEmilia. Austria, yielding to the pressure of events, has at last met the demands of the Hungarian Protestants with liberal concessions. From Prussia, we learn that the Chambers by a vote nearly unanimous, had sanctioned the Ministerial project of a war budget; while from Russia we have the official announcement that the demands of that Power upon Turkey, which provoked the war of the Crimea, are to be renewed and urged with unrelaxing importunity.

The adjustment of the prize-fight difficulty is the principal topic of English news; the champions having fixed upon a compromise, in accordance with which SAYERS surrenders the existing belt, which is to be hung up at the office of Bell's Life, subject to the demand of any worthy champion; while two new belts are to be made for the present contestants; and SAYERS, to close the negotiation, is to retire at once from the Prize Ring.

BODIE, Secretary of the At lantic and Pacific Ship Canal Company, was found dead at No. 28 Broadway, under circumstances which induced the belief that he had taken poison. When he came to the office in the morning, Mr. BODIE noticed a strange excitement in his manner, which led to the supposition that he had been indulging too freely in the use of intoxicating liquor. He accordingly advised him to walk in the open air, by which Mr. BODIE supposed he would be relieved. Mr. HALL left the office, apparently with the intention of following the kind suggestion of his employer. In about one hour afterwards Mr. BODIE found deceased lying in the hallway, apparently dead. He immediately sent for a physician, but the unfortunate man breathed his last before medical aid arrived. Mr. HALL is about 30 years of age, slightly built, and of genteel appearance and address. He was a student or graduate of the Law School at Cambridge, and has respectable connections in Massachusetts or New-Hampshire. He has spent considerable time at the West, where he contracted fever and ague, from which he suffered much. A small paper was found in his bosom containing a few blades of grass, and bearing the inscription: ""From her dear grave, for LUCIUS."" This simple tribute of affection probably sent to him from a distant friend, has suggested sudden grief as the cause of the act of self-destruction. It is believed that deceased has an acquaintance in Flushing. Coroner O'KEEFE adjourned the inquest to this morning; meantime the body remains at the dead-house of the Bellevue Hospital.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; SUPPOSED SUICIDE IN BROADWAY.

"The reappearance of the ""Turkish difficulty"" upon the political stage in Europe, with an aspect almost as menacing as that which it wore when MENSCHIKOFF displayed his paletot at the Porte, in 1853, is a signal illustration of the folly of trying to mend or patch up political organizations that are not founded either on justice or on the popular will. If the relations of the Turkish Government with its Christian subjects had been settled finally at the close of the Crimean war, so as to prevent the recurrence of fresh complications, instead of being settled temporarily for the mere purpose of making peace, we should not have, as at present, commerce deranged and manufactures half paralyzed, by the imminent renewal of a quarrel which has, for half a century, kept the three greatest Powers in Europe in hot water. The remonstrances made by Russia, on behalf of the Turkish Christians, were, as the world knew, perfectly well founded. The grievances she complained of were substantial and notrious. They were disregarded by the Sultan and by France and England, from a very reasonable conviction that they were put forward as a cover for schemes of territorial aggrandizement on a great scale. Russia asked the Porte for justice for her co-religionists in order that she might herself take the place of the Porte as their ruler; and the Allies aided the Sultan in resisting them through fear of seeing the Czar enthroned at Constantinople. There is nothing in the least unreasonable on the part of the Western Powers, in deprecating the addition of 30,000,000 subjects to an Empire already so powerful as that of Russia. The fear that a power which would stretch from Lapland to the Bosphorus, over some of the finest countries in Europe, and would add the command of the Mediterranean to the complete possession of the Black Sea, and support a navy manned by the maritime population of the Archipelago and Dalmatia, by an army of nearly a million and a half of regular soldiers, would prove dangerous to the liberty and independence of other European nations, is not a fear that can be fairly called chimerical.

Smith, the President of the Union Ferry Company, Mr. Hays, President of the Dry Dock Bank, who was understood to act for Geo. Law, and Mr. C.K. Garrison. The lease is for ten years from the 1st of May, 1861, and includes all the ferries now owned by the Union Ferry Company, viz.: Fulton, Catharine, Wall, South and Hamilton-avenue. The price paid now is $56,000 per annum, and, according to the terms of the advertisement, no bid was to be received less than the present rates. The first bid -- $56,000 -- was made by Mr. Smith, and from this point they ran up rapidly at an advance of $5,000 each bid, to $85,000. Mr. Hays here stopped bidding, and from this figure the advance was $1,000 each bid, until it reached $103,000, when it was knocked off to Cyrus P. Smith, who acted on behalf of the Union Ferry Company. A man named Blake, who claims to own the landing of the Hamilton-avenue Ferry on the Brooklyn side, was present, and gave formal notice that the purchaser would not be allowed to use that landing without his consent.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER.; SALE OF THE BROOKLYN FERRY LEASES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER.; SALE OF THE BROOKLYN FERRY LEASES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aaf42a45-cdfe-58f2-92e1-31b83c49b416,351,nyt://article/aaf42a45-cdfe-58f2-92e1-31b83c49b416

"The Hon. W.H. SEWARD appeared in his seat yesterday in the Senate, and was warmly received by Senators of both parties. Mr. SLIDELL, in the Senate, reported back the bill for the acquisition of Cuba, and gave notice that he should call it up at the next session. Mr. LATHAM offered an amendment to the Overland Mail bill, authorizing the Postmaster-General to contract with the contractors on the routes between St. Joseph, Mo., and Great Salt Lake, and between Salt Lake and Placerville, for a semi-weekly, the distance to be done in twenty days, at not more than $462,000 annually; also, to contract for a daily mail by coaches from April 1 to Dec. 1, and tri-weekly for the rest of the year, from Sacramento to Portland, Oregon, at not more than $100,000 per annum; also, to contract for a weekly mail from St. Paul, Minnesota, to the falls of Oregon, at not over $200,000. Mr. LATHAM referred to the great interest felt in this subject by the people of California, which was of more importance to them than the Pacific Railroad. In reply to objections as to the cost of this Overland Mail-service, he remarked that if the postal system was to be considered solely with a view to the amount of money received by it, it would be better for the Government to abrogate the entire Post-office Department, and surrender the carriage of the mails to private enterprise. The House bill for admitting Kansas being taken up, Mr. COLLAMER, of Vermont, spoke at great length in favor of the admission of that Territory; there was 100,000 inhabitants there. Was there ever before a Territory with so large a population? Oregon was admitted when she had only 50,000 inhabitants. Kansas, he was assured, would before this have been admitted, if she could have come in as a Slave State. But the question would always be a bone of contention till it was settled. On motion of Mr. LANE, the bill was postponed till Monday. The Oregon war debt was taken up, and an amendment by Mr. HUNTER, authorizing a loan to pay the amount was lost. In the House, yesterday, Mr. HASKIN, of New-York, called up the special order, providing that hereafter no person shall be elected Printer, either to the Senate or the House, who is not a practical printer of skill and ability; that he shall give bonds as security for $25,000; and that the present prices shall be reduced 40 per cent. He spoke of the gross abuse of the present contract system, which had proved a complete failure. Considerable debate ensued. The minority report, signed by Messrs. HINDMAN and CLOPTON, was read, declaring that the office of Printer to the House was vacant. Mr. CLOPTON, of Alabama, was opposed to a public printing-office, because he thought it would increase the Executive patronage, and not effect a saving of money. Millions would have been saved to the public treasury if years ago the public printing had been let to the lowest responsible bidder. He defended the President from the charge of usurpation of power and violation of law, and thought the charges of corruption against the President and Attorney-General came with bad grace from the party who supported for Printer a man who offered, if elected, to give half the profits of the printing for Republican electioneering purposes.
