"Within a few days Capt. WALLING, of the Detective Police, has been in the receipt of information which satisfied him beyond a doubt that an extensive business in the way of altering bank-notes was conducted at the house No. 41 King-street, occupied in part by two brothers, both young men, named ANDREW and SAMUEL ROBERTS. He accordingly obtained a warrant authorizing a search of the premises and placed it in the hands of Officers BENNETT, MCDOUGAL and WILSON, who on Tuesday afternoon executed the commission with which they were intrusted. Having entered the house, Officer BENNETT determined upon taking a position in the rear yard to prevent the egress of any person in that direction, and turning the knob of the door which he supposed led to the yard, he was surprised to find that it opened into an extension-room where ANDREW ROBERTS had been apparently at that very moment engaged in the manufacture of the worthless bills. His arrest was immediately effected, and a search of the apartment resulted in the discovery of several packages of counterfeit notes, mostly of the denomination of tens, upon Southern banks, in various stages of manufacture. In addition to the bills, two copper-plates were found, with engravings upon them corresponding to impressions upon some af the unfinished notes, which were still damp and had evidently been recently taken from one of two presses, used for printing bank-notes, which also were found in the room. The notes, plates and other implements were seized, and, with the prisoner, taken to head-quarters, after which the other suspected forger, SAMUEL ROBERTS, was apprehended at a saloon called the Oyster Bay, at the corner of Spring and Mercer streets, of which he is said to be the propietor. A further search of the house in King-street was then prosecuted, and more of the counterfeits were obtained, as well as four Savings' Bank books, in the name of ANDREW ROBERTS, representing sums, the aggregate of which amounted to between $5,000 and $6,000, and other valuable property. It is supposed that the prisoners have been engaged for many years in the pursuit of altering genuine bills of broken banks to supply the demand of professional operators for forged papers of this description, and the notes seized bear testimony to the fact that they were altered by a skillful hand. Upon counting the paper it was found that it represented nearly $4,000, most of which required only a few touches of the manufacturer to make it ready for use.

Every American citizen who has interests at stake in foreign countries knows perfectly well that they receive but slender protection from the United States Government; and Mr. SANDFORD, who has just returned from Panama, furnishes us with a fresh example immediately in point. That Isthmus is the most important highway of travel between the Atlantic and Pacific States. It is estimated that fifty thousand American citizens, six hundred tons of United States mails, a hundred millions of American bullion, and many millions of dollars' worth of American merchandise are annually conveyed across this transit; -- yet when an outbreak like that of 1856, was recently threatened by the savages that infest the isthmus, protection for the lives and property of American citizens could only be obtained at a heavy cost to the Railroad Company.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Protection Abroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Protection Abroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/240e56af-7589-5e21-8be2-5d12264d3983,520,nyt://article/240e56af-7589-5e21-8be2-5d12264d3983

PHELAN and KAVAGNAGH were warmly applauded upon entering the arena, and also at times during the game. Great interest was shown by the audience during the fluctuations in the game, which for the first two hundred points was greatly in favor of KAVAGNAH, PHELAN seeming out of practice. As the game progressed, both came out within a few points of each other on completing each hundred, up to the sixth hundred, when PHELAN took a decided lead and kept it, winning the game by 60 points, out of a total of 750. In his play Mr. PHELAN showed some splendid combinations, by which he made most difficult caroms after taking four or five cushions. His ability to nurse the balls, and when they had separated, of bringing them together again was astonishing in many instances. KAVANAGH made a fine display also, in every point of the science of billiards. Thirty innings were played, averaging 25 points. PHELAN's highest runs over 40, of which there were several, were 61, 46, 75, 54, 60, 68, 51 and 58. -- Total, 750. KAVANAGH run 49, 148, 43. -- Total, 690.

Judges and Inspectors, who are sworn to compliance with the instructions of the Election law are exhorted to commit this snug tit-bit of Union-saving perjury. Why not? Has not the United States Supreme Court decided that negroes are not citizens of the United States; and what right, we are asked, has an individual State to qualify negroes as voters, that would not extend equally to ""dumb brutes"" -- oxen, asses, or dogs? The only reply is, that the entire subject of the electoral franchise and its basis, has been left by the Constitution to the several States. Each State has to say who shall vote for Presidents, just as it says who shall vote for Governors, or other local officers; it is one of those reserved powers of which so much is just now heard from the other side of Mason's and Dixon's Line. Should, therefore, the extreme case of the quadrupeds be urged seriously, it would be sufficient perhaps to say, the whole matter belongs to the individual State; and, it would certainly not be for a party, who, upon a question of State rights, is actually dissolving the Union, to press the matter further. But the Constitution offers something more than negative testimony in the case. At the South these very negroes are notoriously classed with the brutes; are described by political orators and authorities as subject to the same conditions, and exposed to transfer and treatment as brute property; and yet they are permitted by the Constitution to have great and mischievous weight in the control of the Federal Government. That equality of States, so constantly appealed to, would seem, therefore, to demand, logically, that the ""brutes"" who are good enough to send members to Congress from the South, are good enough at the North to take part in the choice of a President -- a view that will probably be reduced to practice on Tuesday next.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ONE WAY TO REDUCE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.; JORITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ONE WAY TO REDUCE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.; JORITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1860', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-11-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5295ea9-e026-50a5-8dc5-18c1f5e05eee,555,nyt://article/c5295ea9-e026-50a5-8dc5-18c1f5e05eee

"It has usually been the custom on the evening of election day, for citizens who have found it impossible to get standing-room at the newspaper offices, to congregate at Police Head-quarters in hopes of learning the result of the canvass, but as no measures have heretofore been taken for the collection of the returns on the part of the Police authorities, the information obtained from this source has not been very satisfactory.

A general order in reference to the matter, the substance of which is as follows, was yesterday issued by Superintendent KENNEDY: The police telegraph instruments, after sundown of Nov. 6, inst., will be used exclusively in transmitting election returns, making exceptions only in case of the occurrence of any serious disturbance requiring aid, giving the locality of a fire, and informing of the detention of lost children. No communication must be made from one Station-house to another during the period of the transmission of the returns, unless by order from the Central Office.

At present he is staying at West Farms, Westchester County, where, with judicious care, we trust his energies will be recruited. He is to preach next Sabbath in Dr. ELMENDORF's church, Brooklyn.

The windows of public and private buildings, notwithstanding the unseasonable hour, everywhere on the route of the procession, and the sidewalks on either side, were filled with people, and many houses were brilliantly illuminated. One of the most prominent of these was the house of Mr. CROWLEY, on Bedford-avenue. The Wide-Awakes were in the best of spirits, and were everywhere most heartily welcomed, the sterner sex manifesting their good will by frequently cheering, and the softer sex expressing their sentiments by waving their handkerchiefs. The line was interspersed with transparencies, principally illuminating the names of the different candidates for office, American flags, several banners, -- but there were none of the least objectionable character.

Since his conviction strong efforts have been made to have him pardoned on the ground of insanity, and wretched dogerel which he has had published in a paper at Three Rivers would seem to indicate that he was far from being in his right mind. A correspondent of the Montreal Gazette sketches the closing scene of Ms life. He writes: ""Shortly before 11 o'clock a door leading to the convict's cell was closed and the hangman proceeded to pinion his victim in the dimly-lighted dungeon, screened by the closed door from the looks of the people in the jail hall. The constables who accompanied him state that while being pinioned BRAINERD requested Sheriff OGDEN to convey his body after execution to Melbourne in the Townships for burial, and that the twenty dollars in gold among his effects be appropriated for the purpose. The Sheriff promised to comply with his request. He also said to the hangman, ""You are pinching me, you are beginning to murder me too soon."" The convict pinioned, a rope was placed round his waist and the party led by the Sheriff proceeded up the two flights of stairs to the room leading to the drop. BRAINERD walked up the steps coolly and more unconcernedly than any of the spectators. In the room the executioner took his hand off BRAINERD's neck and drew back the bolts of the door, outside which was the drop. As he did so the crowd, which now amounted to about 2,000, and in which many women were to be seen, simultaneously exclaimed, ""Le voila, le voila,"" and swayed to and fro for a few moments, eagerly looking up at BRAINERD, who stood calmly gazing out into the rain. The hangman stepped out on the drop and pulled down the noose, Rev. Mr. CARON said, ""BRAINERD, humble yourself, repent; in ten minutes you will be no more, and facing your Creator."" Words to this effect he repeated twice, but still BRAINERD made no sign, and looked down at the crowd. Precisely at 11, the preparations completed, BRAINERD was led out on the drop, and the executioner placed the noose around his neck, having previously partly drawn the black cap down over his face and removed his hat. BRAINERD saying that the wind would blow it off. He stood facing cast, and exclaimed, in low tones, to the people outside, ""Strangers, they are going to commit murder. I am innocent.""",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXECUTION OF A MATRICIDE', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EXECUTION OF A MATRICIDE', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8733e904-0d09-56d8-9755-c96f35c4f253,558,nyt://article/8733e904-0d09-56d8-9755-c96f35c4f253

It was designed to hold the meeting in the open air, and a stand had been erected in the above locality for that purpose, but owing to the violent rain the meeting was held in a hall near by, where it was organized by the election of BRADISH JOHNSON, Esq., as President, and a number of Vice-Presidents from each of the Wards comprised in the District. Mr. JOHNSON, on taking the Chair, said that he was born in Louisiana, but he stood there as a national man, knowing no North, no South, but only the whole country, one and indivisible. The South had always stood by the Union, and he believed she would stand by it now, but it must be such a Union as our fathers framed, with all its guarantees and conditions; a Union founded on the equal rights of all the sovereign States, and not a Union dependent upon the caprice of a sectional majority. After alluding, in glowing terms, to the brotherly feeling that animated the North and South during the Revolution, and to the common hardships, dangers and trials through which they passed in that struggle for independence, he expected his hearers to preserve intact that glorious Union, cemented by the blood of their fathers, and to transmit unimpaired, to their descendants, the precious legacy bequeathed to them.

Throughout the afternoon the City and surrounding country was deluged with the heaviest rain-fall of the season, putting an end to all out-door business, and, generally, to travel. The cars and stages furnished comparatively little accommodation, when everybody wished to ride, and multitudes without umbrellas and overshoes went home drenched by the storm.

The two foreign steamers which left at noon, as well as all the Southern steamers, came to anchor below, and awaited the return of better weather.

It was discovered, between 4 and 5 o'clock, issuing from the wholesale cooperage establishment of Messrs. SLEIGHT PAULDING, at the foot of Dutchess-avenue. The fire department were soon at the spot, but by this time the flames had gained fearful headway, rendering the attempts of the firemen to extinguish the fire futile. By their efforts, however, the flames were confined to the burning buildings, which raged fiercely for nearly two hours, illuminating the country for a considerable distance around. Shortly after 6 o'clock, the whole lay a mass of blackened ruins. Nothing was saved. The loss is estimated at $12,000. In the building were some fifty or sixty boxes of tools, belonging to those employed. Some of them were worth from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars. A large amount of stock piled on the outside of the building also caught fire, and was consumed. There was but an insurance of between $2,000 and $3,000 upon the building, the rest being a total loss, amongst which were the tools belonging to the workmen. These, numbering about fifty, are thrown out of employment by this unfortunate occurrence. Shortly before the fire was discovered, some boatmen who were on the dock state that they saw a light in the upper part of the principal building, but that they took no further notice of it, supposing it to be one of the workmen on business. In fifteen minutes after, the flames burst forth, when the alarm was given. This fire was also he work of an incendiary.

A large portion of this morning's TIMES is devoted to the news, which is of considerable interest. It is reported from Warsaw that the Imperial Conferences had been satisfactory to the illustrious personages concerned, and that the principle of a European Congress had been agreed upon. The promulgation of a new Constitution at this time by the Emperor FRANCIS JOSEPH is deemed significant, though, as far as Hungary is concerned, it is not believed that the restoration of a portion of her ancient privileges will quell the spirit of insurrection and revolution that is gaining ground there every day. We publish, among our extracts, the Prussian and Russian protests against the intervention of Piedmont in behalf of the revolution in Italy. Russia only has recalled her representative from Turin. There was a rumor that Great Britain was committed to the same policy, but the London Times indignantly denies its truth, and in an article, not very ""complimentary to Prussia, declares that England would not follow in the lead of any despotism. An article in the Paris Constitutionnel, under the head of ""French Policy in Italy,"" is supposed to have emanated from the Emperor himself. It shows that the proper course for France is non-intervention, and explains the impossibility of her interfering either in behalf of despotism against Italy on the one hand, or in behalf of revolution against constituted authority on the other. The London Times speaks of the article as ""Napoleon's quiet reply to the divine-right demonstration at Warsaw."" From Italy the news is not of an important character. According to a telegram from Naples, dated the 23d ult., hopes are entertained that Capua will soon be evacuated by the Royal troops. We are once more assured th[???] the Pope has no intention of leaving Rome. The Austrian war preparations in Venetia are being carried out upon a stupendous scale, and the impression strongly prevails that she will soon actively interfere against the Revolution. Our English.

The procession then marched down Park-row, headed by the banner, and marching to the tap of a drum. When they had reached a position opposite the Astor House, several rowdies broke into the procession and tore down the banner, while one of the party, at the same instant, struck one of the Wide-Awakes a heavy blow upon the mouth. This was the signal for a general fight; clubs and stones were freely used by all parties, and one of the rowdies, finding himself overpowered, drew a knife and made a rush at those nearest him, swearing that he would murder every Wide-Awake that he could get a hold of. Another drew a revolver and threatened to blow the first man's brains out who approached him. These actions and threats kept the Wide-Awakes at some distance, when one of the party shouted, ""What, shall three or four loafers frighten us?"" and instantly a rush was made, and before either party could use their weapons they were disarmed and badly beaten. Another of the assailants drew a heavy club, while the two parties were fighting at the corner of Broadway and Vesey-street, and struck one of the Wide-Awakes a severe blow upon the head, felling him to the ground. Hardly had he committed the assault, however, than he was seized by a number of the Wide-Awakes and most unmercifully pummeled.

The result in this City, where the Anti-Republican interest has obtained a plurality slightly exceeding twenty-seven thousand, has, in connection with such meagre returns as reach us from the counties, demonstrated the triumph of LINCOLN in this State; while in Pennsylvania, where a serious reduction of the thirty thousand majority of CURTIN in October had been looked to by all parties, that majority in favor of LINCOLN is swollen to an incredible figure, little less than a hundred thousand. From Connecticut we also have large Republican gains, evincing the astonishing growth of the Republican sentiment.

A steady stream poured in and out of the hall, which, from the confined state of the inside atmosphere made it almost impossible to breathe it. The meeting finally overran, and a large concourse blocked up the sidewalk in front of the building. It was not long before straggling returns from the Wards began to come in, and, as they were announced from the platform, a scene of the wildest excitement ensued. They shouted and cheered, waved hats, clapped hands, stamped, whistled, crowed and then cheered again. The crowd pressed up towards the platform, and mounted the benches, which gave way, one after another with a crash, precipitating the perchers to the floor amid derisive shouts and laughter. The announcement that APPLETON had beaten BURLINGAME in Boston created a furore of delight, and the whole company gave themselves up to yells, shouts and huzzas which were perfectly deafening. The announcement that New-Jersey had given eight thousand majority for fusion, and that ""PENNINGTON was defeated,"" created another paroxysm which vented itself in a long, strong, and tumultuous pow-wow, which would have startled a tribe of Narragansett Indians. A motion was immediately made and carried, to receive New-Jersey into the Union. The news that the Ninth Ward had polled 1,000 majority for Fusion, brought out another prolonged and ear-splitting round of cheers, given after the most approved modern style, ringing the changes first on ""U-n-i-o-n -- Bell-Everett -- tiger,"" and then with their ""One-two-three-four-five-six-seven -- t-i-g-e-r!"" In some cases the official returns were read as they were handed in, and at others the President would state that he had learned from an ""authentic source"" so and so. A transparency quoting the 1,000 majority in the Ninth Ward was finally brought into the hall, which appeared to set the whole meeting crazy with excitement, and for a time the din and confusion was perfectly appalling. The excitement had now reached a pitch which it was difficult to control, and it took the President, with the aid of several assistants, by signs, gestures, and grimace, to bring them to listen to what he wished to communicate. Seizing the transparency aforesaid, with one of the Union banners, they rushed out of the hall, and for several minutes flaunted it before the eyes of their astonished neighbors, the Republicans across the way. They then marched up and down Broadway, shouting with all their might and main. A statement that Niagara Falls had voted by a small majority, the Union ticket, brought out another torrent of the customary demonstrations.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BELL AND EVERETT HEAD-QUARTERS.; Great Enthusiasm,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BELL AND EVERETT HEAD-QUARTERS.; Great Enthusiasm,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/52c4d1fa-4fd8-5fc4-b4af-2ea5fb942bfb,575,nyt://article/52c4d1fa-4fd8-5fc4-b4af-2ea5fb942bfb

"A VESSEL HALF AS LONG AGAIN AS THE GREAT EASTERN. -- An official report has been published, in England, of a river steam vessel belonging to the Oriental Inland Steam Company, and intended to navigate the shallow rivers of the East, which possesses peculiar scientific interest from the fact of this composite vessel being the longest vessel ever yet constructed, being nearly half as long again as the Great Eastern. It appears that on trial this great vessel, or train, was found to be easily manageable, and attained a satisfactory rate of speed; and its success solves the important problem how to carry a very large cargo on a very small draught of water against a rapid stream. The train consists of a steamer and five barges, of the collective length of 900 feet. But these barges, instead of being, towed asunder like common barges, are joined to one another by circular joints, like a hinge, so that they constitute one long flexible vessel, with only one bow and one stern. The purpose of this arrangement is to obtain the necessary displacement with small resistance, and without the risk of damage, should the vessel get aground, and all these conditions are effectually fulfilled by the arrangements adopted. The train is 30 feet broad and 7 feet deep. At a draught of water of 3 feet it will carry about 3,000 tons of cargo.

There Mr. DANIEL D. CONOVER took the Chair, and, with Gen. J.H. HOBART WARD and Mr. CHARLES SPENCER, received the returns, and from time to time computed the probable result. Mr. CONOVER read the figures, and every time he read the people cheered or jeered, according to the complexion of the news. The enthusiasm,"" which was wild, as soon as it was known how much below the estimate of the Fusionists was the result in the First Ward, increased steadily as the night wore on, and was incontinent at last. Never were there gathered together so many persons in so excellent a humor. While they were waiting for news from some Ward not yet heard from, all were talking and laughing at once; some were giving lusty cheers for LINCOLN and the whole Republican ticket; some were cracking jokes at the expense of the Opposition; those without were endeavoring to elbow their way in, and some within, half suffocated, were trying to force their way out. It was just such a hubbub of hilarity, in short, as you would expect to hear in the Republican Head-quarters on the night of the Republican victory. One, more enthusiastic, was incessantly proposing three cheers for somebody. He proposed three cheers for Gen. WARD; they were given with gusto. He proposed three more for Mr. CONOVER, and three more for Mr. SPENCER; they were given. Then he proposed ""Three cheers for me."" They were not given. Then, by way of variety, he proposed three cheers for Mr. CONOVER again. Here that gentleman interposed and requested that less noise should be made, and that men would stand still; he did not know how long the floor of the room would support such a mass of enthusiastic people. A man mounted a chair at the remote end of the room and shouted out the name of a friend, whom he said he wanted to go to a fire that was raging not far off. ""There's a fire every where,"" said Mr. SPENCER, and that brought down the house -- almost the floor -- again. Loud as the din was during these interludes, as soon as the Chairman announced more returns, quiet was immediately restored -- to be lost again amid a storm of cheers as soon as they were read.

"One of the finest races of the season took place at Poughkeepsie on Monday, between WILLIAM BERGER, of that city, and JOSHUA Ward, of Newburgh, the acknowledged champion of America, for $500. BERGER challenged any man in the country to row him a distance of five or ten miles for a sum of money and the championship, and the friends of WARD at once persuaded him to accept the challenge. The race was agreed between the parties to come off at Poughkeepsie, and the course to be rowed was twice around that recently rowed at the late regatta at that city. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the signal was given, BERGER gaining the advantage of a boat's length in the start. This slight difference was soon, however, overcome by WARD, and the men rowed for miles nearly side by side. Nearly two thousand persons, from all parts along the river, were present to witness the race. A barge, filled with persons, steamed up and down the river. This was mostly filled with ladies. The Poughkeepsie crew, in their four-oared boat, rowed alongside of their champion, and cheered him on, while the Newburghers were provided with a small steamboat, which easily kept alongside of the rowers. The course was about ten miles. On the home stretch BERGER was slightly ahead, and would probably have won the race, if he had not made a mistake in crossing the river to the opposite side of the stake boat, to that which was agreed upon by the judges as the winning side, and before this difference could be regained, WARD had passed him and won the race by only 3 1/2 minutes.

This is in accordance with the usual rule in all large cities. During the year 1859, the proportion of the sexes who died in New-York was 116 males to 100 females. But in the living population of this City there is constantly an excess of females, the proportion in 1855 being 92 males to 100 females.

Suspicion was directed against SETH SMART, an Indian, and his sister, MARY SMART. After a tedious pursuit, for they left the vicinity soon after committing the deed, the two were [???] at Branford, C.W., a few days since. On Friday, the prisoners were brought before Mayor JONES and a bench of County Magistrates. Sergeant-Major CUMMINS, after relating the particulars of the capture of the prisoners, stated that while on their way down from Toronto to Picton, the male prisoner after being duly cautioned that anything which he said would be used against him at his trial, acknowledged to him that he was present when the murder was committed. He had, he said, only come out of the Penitentiary about a month, previously, having served a period of tour years for cattle stealing. During his incarceration, his wife had decamped with another Indian, and he left his mother's house on the night of the murder for the purpose of stealing a cow in order to procure money to go in search of the missing wife. He had no intention to commit murder when he started, but while in the vicinity of Mr. PETERSON's residence, he met two men and a boy whom he had never seen before. They entered into conversation, and it was then decided to murder Mr. and Mrs. PETERSON and rob, and afterwards set fire to the house in order that evidence of the crime might be obliterated. The boy entered the house and killed both, and then took possession of several articles and set fire to the house. The fire burned through the floor and then fell into the cellar and was extinguished.) He (Sergeant-Major CUMMINGS) asked SMART who these parties were, and he replied that he had seen them in Toronto jail while he was confined there on his way down, but immediately added. ""Oh, never bother about them, I will be hanged and that is enough"" Various articles which belonged to Mr. and Mrs. PETERSON and which were found were SMART was known to have hidden them, where produced, and the evidence being conceded sufficient against him, he was committed for trial.

"A SMALL EXCITEMENT IN THE CITY HALL. -- In the absence of any news from the various City Departments, the components of which were engaged, yesterday, in cyphering up the grand result, a small excitement was created in the City Hall by way of affording an item for the reporters. It appears that Mr. JOHN CALLAHAN, who ran for and claims to be elected as member of Assembly from the lower district, was violently opposed by THOMAS BYRNES, Superintendent of Lands and Places, long a resident of the Fifth Ward, and who, claiming the right of free speech, had expressed very openly his opinions as to Mr. CALLAHAN's qualifications for the office to which he aspired. These not being remarkably favorable, aroused the ire of the member elect, and yesterday afternoon, while CALLAHAN was surrounded by friends, Mr. BYRNES was discovered approaching the City Hall, in the vestibule of which the party were standing. Mr. BYRNES, unconscious of any premeditated attack, entered the Hall on business, when he was accosted by Mr. CALLAHAN, and angry words ensued, the result being that Mr. CALLAHAN was caught by the throat and so tightly squeezed, that he called for some friend to cut his cravat. Mr. BYRNES got off with a torn coat. The fracas caused, for a time, much excitement in and about the City Hall, but it gradually subsided after the belligerents had separated. The greatest damage done during the affray, was the blacking of the eye of an innocent porter who chanced to witness the affray, and who was unguarded enough to express his disapprobation of the proceedings.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/08/archives/general-city-news-police-reports.html,,"A SMALL EXCITEMENT IN THE CITY HALL. -- In the absence of any news from the various City Departments, the components of which were engaged, yesterday, in cyphering up the grand result, a small excitement was created in the City Hall by way of affording an item for the reporters.

We publish, however, this morning, a great variety of interesting matter indicating the manner in which that result has been received, especially in the South. Sentiment is varied, but the preponderance seems to be against any immediate movement looking to disunion, and in favor of awaiting some ""overt act"" on the part of the incoming Republican Administration which may justify such action. South Carolina, of course, -- if we are to place reliance upon the dispatches received, -- is in favor of an immediate movement towards secession, and her prominent public men, well known for their advocacy of a Southern Confederacy, are urging it with all their eloquence. It is announced that a State Convention is to be called at once. Gov. BROWN, of Georgia, sent a special message to the Legislature of that State, yesterday, in which he disapproves of the idea of calling a Convention of the Southern States, and declines to recommend the appointment of delegates. He thinks, however, that the constitutional rights of the South have been violated, and suggests a measure of retaliation in the shape of reprisals. In this connection he points particularly to the State of Massachusetts. The Governor contends for the right of secession -- not, however, while each State of the Confederacy fulfills, in good faith, its constitutional obligations -- and that the withdrawal of one State virtually dissolves the whole compact of Union. In Virginia and Maryland, there is comparatively very little excitement. It is not probable, judging ""from the telegrams of our special correspondents, that a movement towards disunion will be countenanced by the majority. At the National Capital there appears to be considerable alarm at the position of affairs, and serious difficulty is apprehended from the resignation of Federal office-holders, especially those engaged in the collection of the revenue. The Collector of the port of Charleston, as we yesterday announced, has already resigned, and it is feared his subordinates may follow his example.

"The public were invited to attend the anniversary meeting of the Academy of Medicine, held on Wednesday evening, at the Hall of the Historical Society. The attendance was far less than the occasion and the very interesting nature of the exercises deserved. After an appropriate prayer, Dr. JOHN WATSON, the President of the Academy and orator of the evening, was introduced at precisely 8 o'clock. He spoke for nearly an hour and a half, but the attention of the audience never flagged for a moment during the whole of this time. His main theme was ""the character of the true physician,"" and he discussed the requisites, both natural and required; the duties and the mission of the medical practitioner in all the varied relations and circumstances arising from his position. Dr. WATSON vindicated the character of the profession in this country, insisting that although there were, perhaps, fewer examples of (as it were) concentrated or monopolized learning in America; compared with Europe, yet the mass of our physicians were more than equal in knowledge and practical tact to the mass of the physicians in other countries. He also dwelt at length upon the manners and general conduct of a physician to his patients; and spoke of the mental and moral influences that he should be ever ready to exert in his practice; to gain and preserve the confidence and respect of his patients, to aid in the discovery of disease, to enter largely into the treatment, to advance the cause of honor, science and human justice and to soothe and comfort the sufferers from irremediable ills. He illustrated the facts, principles and suggestions in his address with innumerable anecdotes and sketches which, however familiar they may have been to the well-read of the professional gentlemen present, were exceedingly apropos to the subject, occasion and general audience, and displayed an inexhaustible fund of medical lore of all times and all nations. After he had concluded, Dr. JOS. M. SMITH moved that the thanks of the Academy be tendered to Dr. WATSON for his elaborate and valuable address, and that the latter be requested for publication, and diffused widely among the students and profession generally, as well as the public.

Mrs. Hunter determined to purchase it, and to accommodate her the young men offered to let her have it for $5 cash, and the balance in two days. The bargain closed, Mrs. Hunter showed her acquisition to her friends, one of whom, having heard of the circumstances under which she had procured it, told her it must have been stolen. She therefore called at Grover & Baker's store and inquired about the matter, and an investigation showed that she had bought a machine which had been stolen from the store a few days before. Measures were therefore adopted for the arrest of the young men should they apply to Mrs. Hunter for the balance of the money, and on Thursday John Sharkey, one of the individuals in question, having presented himself with that object, he was arrested. Subsequently Officer Colfax arrested his confederate, a man named James Fitzsimmons, and both prisoners were committed by Justice CONNOLLY for trial. It is believed that the accused are in league with one of the employes in the store, and that a clue has now been obtained to the recent theft of several machines.

Even in South Carolina, according to our latest accounts, the people are not so ready for extreme measures as we were led to infer from the first intelligence following the knowledge of the success of Mr. LINCOLN, and, of course, unless South Carolina takes the lead, it is not probable that any movement towards a disruption of the Union will be made in any other quarter. A dispatch from Columbia, received yesterday, announces that a bill had passed the Senate providing for the calling of a State Convention to consider the subject of secession, but fixing the 8th of January as the day for electing delegates thereto, and the 16th of January for the assembling of the Convention. The House may insist upon an earlier day, but there is evidently a disposition not to be too precipitate. From Washington we learn that the President and Cabinet held a meeting yesterday, at which the condition of affairs in the South was discussed. President BUCHANAN, according to the dispatch of our correspondent, is confident that South Carolina with leave the Confederacy, but not during his term of office. Should the issue, however, be precipitated before that time, he believes it to be madness, to attempt coercion, as that would have the effect to disrupt the whole Union. It is understood that Secretary COBB alone excused the extreme position of the Palmetto State. The hope was generally entertained that, even in case she saw fit to secede, the cool judgment of the best men of the South would prevent any such action on the part of other States. At any rate, should South Carolina annul the resolutions by which she adhered to the Federal Constitution, she will be let alone by the present Administration. It seems that the rumor of the resignation of the Collector of the Port of Charleston was untrue, but that the Federal Judge has resigned, as stated. No effort will be made at present to fill the vacancy, as the only embarrassment occasioned will be felt by the South Carolinians themselves.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cf5478f-a404-5dc0-a14d-2a30647a0f75,1340,nyt://article/8cf5478f-a404-5dc0-a14d-2a30647a0f75

Little people seem to enjoy the favor of these latter gentlemen amazingly, and books are showered for their benefit as plentifully as kind nurses are wont to scatter bons-bons. These little clear-paged volumes are as indicative of the coming of Christmas as are the first flakes of snow which begin to drift downward through the air. The APPLETONS have prepared for their delectation New Fairy Stories, for My Grandchildren, translated from the German of GEORGE KEIL by S.W. LANDER. Germans are always at home in Fairy Land. They can move their goods and chattels, pipes and philosophy, into the clouds at a moment's notice, and discourse with shadows and sunbeams as familiarly as with old acquaintances. It is safe to commend any fairy tale of German origin. Even though a thin haze of transcendentalism and misty irreligion may be discernible, it is powerless to fog a child's mind. Children generally get at the kernel of a nut, and reject the bitter husk, more readily than grown people. If you give them a sugar-coated pill they are sure to nibble off the sugar and discard the bitter balance of the globule. KEIL, however, deals only in moral fairies, and is perfectly unobjectionable. The same publishers give their young friends an opportunity of spending A Year with Maggie and Emma, which book is edited by Miss MCINTOSH. The young ladies whom Miss MCINTOSH introduces to the world of jackets and short frocks are very pleasant indeed, and will probably become favorites. But the crowning blessing which the munificent APPLETONS vouchsafe to family circles is The Young American's Picture Gallery, containing five hundred wood-cuts of everything in and out of nature, including Gen. WASHINGTON on his celebrated white horse, the Great Eastern, Gen. PUTNAM and JULIUS CESAR.

Not, indeed, with the good will or the conscious participation of the Imperial Government, for the same hand which signed the new charters of the provinces confirmed the appointment of a strictly military martinet to the highest civil authority in Venice, and the gorges of the Tyrolean Alps are resounding with the rattle and roar of trains crowded with troops hurrying to Verona and Mantua, while the bells of Pesth and Comorn are ringing in the restoration of Hungarian institutions to the Hungarian race. The defiance flung down to FRANCIS JOSEPH so haughtily at Naples by the King of Italy has been taken up as haughtily at Vienna, and all Europe awaits in apparent anxiety the collision now deemed by half her wisest diplomats inevitable, between the liberator of the Peninsula and the despot of the Northern Adriatic. In the tone, the temper, the language and the official acts of the Viennese Government, Venetia is still more sternly than ever claimed as an inalienable appanage of the Crown of the Hapsburgs. All official Europe beside, from ALEXANDER II. and Prince GORTSCHAKOFF at Warsaw, to VICTORIA and Lord JOHN RUSSELL at London, agrees at last with the far-seeing Emperor of the French in regarding the Austrian dominion at Venice as an impossibility, to be tolerated, perhaps, provisionally, in the hope that toleration may lead to a settlement of the question otherwise than by war, but not at all to be entertained as a permanent element in the European system. So much has been won for common sense and common justice in the diplomatic world by the courage, the genius, and the good faith of the great Sovereign who spoke at the Tuileries in the hearing of all mankind, on the first of January, 1859, those memorable words, which have proved to Italy the ""Open Sesame"" to a once seemingly hopeless future. It is now an easy common-place of European opinion that Venice belongs naturally to the Venetians. Eighteen months ago it was revolution to hint the thought, and NAPOLEON was denounced as the enemy of mankind for putting the thought into deeds.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Austria and Venetia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Austria and Venetia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-11-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8243183-cf3d-571f-88c0-460bc1b182f8,1430,nyt://article/d8243183-cf3d-571f-88c0-460bc1b182f8

"On Saturday evening the discovery was made at the New-York Hospital, of a plot on the part of some one to poison Capt. ISAAC GILLY, master of the coasting schooner Sea Bird, who, for some time past, has been a patient in the institution, under treatment for intermittent fever.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/12/archives/supposed-plot-to-poison-and-rob-a-sick-man-three-patients-at-the.html,,"On Saturday evening the discovery was made at the New-York Hospital, of a plot on the part of some one to poison Capt. ISAAC GILLY, master of the coasting schooner Sea Bird, who, for some time past, has been a patient in the institution, under treatment for intermittent fever. The circumstances of the occurrence, as narrated by the officers at the Hospital, are as follows: Capt. GILLY occupied a bed in the same ward with three men named H.W. JENKINS, CHAS. BROWN and JOHN KEIGER, and a few days since in their presence he took from his person a leather belt, containing $200 in gold, and having counted the money, he replaced it about his waist. The exhibition of this little hoard seemed to have excited the cupidity of the three patients whose names have been mentioned, and a plot was concocted by them, as subsequent developments appear to indicate, by which they were to obtain possession of the money. Accordingly on Saturday last, at dinner time, some Croton oil was poured into the soup which had been served to Capt. GILLY, but the unpleasant taste which was thus imparted to the mixture, induced him to leave it almost untouched. During this time it is said that the man JENKINS had narrowly watched the action of the Captain, and, having observed what disposition had been made of the broth, he took occasion to overturn the bowl which contained it upon the floor, as if by accident, hoping in this way to destroy the evidences of the plot. Capt. GILLY had not entertained any suspicion that the nauseous compound contained poison, therefore he made no statement of the case to the nurse in charge of the ward. Later in the day he obtained permission to take a walk, and while down-town he placed his money in one of the savings' banks, returning to the Hospital in time for tea. At tea-time he and another patient, named MAHONEY, were each supplied with a bowl of milk. Its appearance, however, was very dark, and, although the matter was made the subject of remark between them, it did not deter either from swallowing a large draught. Soon afterwards both were taken ill, with symptoms of having been poisoned, and the peculiarly unpleasant taste of the milk led them to believe that the dose had been administered in that. Mrs. REYNOLDS, the nurse, was informed of their suspicions, and to satisfy herself, she tasted some of the mixture which GILLY had left in the bowl. The result was that her lips became blistered, and Dr. HARRIS, the house surgeon, was made aware of the matter. After tasting the milk, the doctor unhesitatingly stated that it had been tinctured with Croton oil, and immediately Superintendent DARRAGH was sent for. Meantime GILLY and MAHONEY had become so sick that fears were entertained that they would not survive the night, and a messenger was dispatched to the office of the Detective Police, asking assistance to investigate the circumstances. Detectives BENNETT and MCDOUGAL were detailed to inquire into the case, and having done so, they took JENKINS, BROWN and KEIGER into custody, a linen coat which had been worn by the former having been found partly saturated with Croton oil. The prisoners were taken to headquarters, where all of them are now detained pending an investigation by a magistrate of any charge which shall be brought against them. JENKINS admits that the poison was placed in the soup and milk by himself and the other accused parties, but states that it was done for a ""lark,"" and with a desire to ""physic"" Capt. GILLY. This story, however, is not fully credited. It has not yet transpired whether the prisoners obtained the oil from the Hospital dispensary or from a drug-store, but in either case it is not probable that they could have been ignorant of its poisonous properties. At a late hour last night the patient MAHONEY had recovered sufficiently to be considered out of immediate danger, but Capt. GILLY's symptoms were still unfavorable.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SUPPOSED PLOT TO POISON AND ROB A SICK MAN.; Three Patients at the New-York Hospital Arrested for Mixing Croton Oil with the food of Another Patient--One of the Prisoners States that it was Doue by way of a Joke.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SUPPOSED PLOT TO POISON AND ROB A SICK MAN.; Three Patients at the New-York Hospital Arrested for Mixing Croton Oil with the food of Another Patient--One of the Prisoners States that it was Doue by way of a Joke.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29bbc02d-4d86-5898-8080-397331fc0f31,675,nyt://article/29bbc02d-4d86-5898-8080-397331fc0f31

Notwithstanding the storm on Friday night, the entire delegation were out at a late hour, witnessing the practical working of the machines on Broadway. At their request the machines were operated upon a few blocks of cobble-stone pavement, being the pavement in use in Philadelphia. The merits of the machines were freely discussed, several of the party expressed their agreeable surprise, having had no idea that the machines had power or capacity to sweep such mud and slush as they were then doing. The inclemency of the weather prevented their stay to witness an extended trial. As it was, they got a thorough soaking from the rain, which fell in torrents during the whole time. On Saturday morning they called upon the Mayor, who gave them some information in regard to our municipal affairs and the subject under consideration. At the Mayor's suggestion they called upon City Inspector Col. DELAVAN. During the conference with that gentleman, the present or old plan of cleaning streets, &c., was regarded as a costly farce, unworthy of such cities as New-York and Philadelphia. Col. DELAVAN furnished the Committee with a variety of useful information in respect to the sanitary regulations of New-York. In reference to the sweeping machines, the City Inspector freely declared his opinion of their usefulness and economy. In the afternoon the Committee visited the stables in Twenty-eighth-street, and thoroughly inspected the machines, two of which were operated before them at their desire on Twenty-eighth-street, between Seventh and Eighth avenues. The work was done quickly and thoroughly.

""If,"" we are told, ""South Carolina does not desire the Federal Courts, the President thinks no one should complain."" On this point, as on some others, people will be met with who dissent from the Administration view. Those, for instance, whose bills upon South Carolina Banks and merchants have returned protested, may fairly complain if they are precluded from the only medium of collection which, in the actual condition of things, can be made available. It is needless to say that to sue upon such claims in the local courts, would subject the litigant to personal hazard, uncompensated by any possibility of success. The United States District Court is the only tribunal accessible; and if, Judge MCGRATH having declared that court finally closed, the President does not reopen it, he will exhibit an indifference to two or three provisions of the Constitution, remarkable even in that Old Public Functionary. One collector, we are informed, returned yesterday to this City with $700,000 of bills due from South Carolinians, not a dollar of which could be had. If the holders of these obligations he appealed to, we suspect the President will find a strong disposition to complain, if there be no judicial authority maintained to aid in their enforcement.

Not many weeks since we recorded the action of the the Common Council granting to GEORGE LAW the privilege of constructing a bulkhead north of pier No. 1 East River, to correspond with the enlargement of the Battery, and as a consideration for the enormous expense which such a work would entail upon that public-spirited citizen, they kindly added the grant of a perpetual ferry franchise to and from Staten Island, which franchise, by the way, Mr. LAW had enjoyed gratuitously for many years. Mr. HAWS, the Comptroller, notwithstanding his ardent admiration of Mr. LAW's desire to advance the interests of the City, could not find any Law which warranted the donation of such a privilege, slight as it was, and he took the only means at his command to remedy the error into which our municipal Solons had fallen; he closed up the ""right of way"" to the ferry by means of heavy stone posts and iron chains.

LOVELL, went to Fort Hamilton yesterday for the purpose of target firing with sea coast artiliery. The excursion was made on the ferry boat Peconic, which had been generously furnished for the occasion, free of charge, by the Union Ferry Company. Among the invited guests were Brig. Gen. HALL, Maj. J.C. BURNHAM, C.P. SMITH, Esq., President Union Ferry Co., Col. BOSTWICK, of the Eleventh Regiment, Col. LANSING, N.Y.S.M., Col. SWEENY and Seargt. JOHNS, U.S.A., J.M.B. LOVELL of Savannah, Ga., Hon. Mr. TOWNSEND and many other distinguished military gentlemen. The Guard numbered about fifty-six muskets, and were accompanied by Dodworth's full military band. On arriving at Fort Hamilton it was found that the greater portion of the target, which lay at a distance of over a mile from the shore, had been cut away during the morning by a schooner, leaving merely a low black line on the water which was illy adapted for the purposes intended. It was resolved, however, to use this, and seven of the heavy barbette guns of the fort, thirty-two pounders, were at once manned and prepared for action. Four rounds of seven guns each were fired. In the first round, the best shots fired were the first and fourth, each of which, it was judged, struck within fifty or sixty feet of the mark. The second shot was also a fair one, and all were excellent line shots. In the second round, the first two shots fired each struck the target, cutting it loose from its moorings and starting it floating down the Bay. The sixth was a fair shot, but all the others in this round were very wild. In the third round, the sixth gun again fired a good shot, but the target was moving so rapidly now that great difficulty was experienced in getting it in range, and all the others in this round were wild. In the fourth and last round the best shots were the third, fourth, and seventh, which struck, as near as could be judged, at a distance of from 50 to 100 feet from the mark. The target had now floated so far down as to be out of the range of the guns, and the firing was stopped. The gunners of the two guns which struck the target were Messrs. C. HUBBARD and L. BURKE. The gunner of No. 6, which also did some very fair shooting, was Dr. MCNEIL. The officers of the Fort who were present admitted that the firing was generally much better than that of the regular soldiers. On the return to the City a bountiful collation was set out, and after it had been disposed of speeches were made, songs sung, etc., until the boat landed at the foot of Wall-street, whence the Guard proceeded to their Armory.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'City Guard Artillery Target Practice at Fort Hamiltion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'City Guard Artillery Target Practice at Fort Hamiltion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8b373141-30d9-59b7-9480-e54a34ff76a9,475,nyt://article/8b373141-30d9-59b7-9480-e54a34ff76a9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/13/archives/obituary-the-earl-of-dundonald.html,,"The death of Lord DUNDONALD is announced this morning in our European news. Few men have had so eventful a career, and have been permitted to reach the advanced age of 85 years. The deceased, THOMAS COCHRANCE, tenth Earl of Dundonald, and better known to tame as Lord COCHRANE, went to sea in 1793, and in 1795 fought his first action with the French, whom be defeated off the North American coast. In 1799, as commander of a party sent to relieve the Lady Nelson cutter, then surrounded and attacked off Cabritta Point by several French privateers and Spanish gun-boats, he displayed that desperate gallantry for which he became remarkable in after life. In 1800 he captured the French 74-gun frigate Le Genereux, and was appointed her acting captain Thence he was promoted Commander of the sloop-of-war Speedy, and during the ten months that he held this appointment he took 14 of the enemy's vessels. On the 8th of August, 1801, Lord COCHRANE received his commission as Post-Captain. The Speedy herself ultimately fell into the hands of a French 74-gun frigate, but during the action Lord COCHRANE displayed such conspicuous courage that the conqueror refused to accept his sword, requesting him to wear what he had so nobly used. During the next five years Lord COCHRANE distinguished himself in a variety of ways. Among the Spanish prizes that he captured was one from the La Plata, with nearly a million in specie. He destroyed the semaphores along the Trench coast carried by storm the battery at Pointe l'Equilon, and during January, 1807 -- some days, short of a month -- he took and destroyed fifteen of the enemy's ships. In 1868 Lord COCHRANE cooperated with the Spanish patriots of Catalonia, against NAPOLEON, and was engaged in many brilliant enterprises on shore and at sea. In April, 1809, he was selected, from his daring intrepidity, to command a fleet of fire ships intended for the destruction of the French fleet, then lying at anchor and blockaded by Lord GAMBLER, in the Basque Roads. On the night of the 11th of that month he went on board one of the explosion ships containing 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, and performed the hazardous service confided to him most effectually. For this act he received the Knighthood of the Bath. At this time the illustrious sailor was member of Parliament for Honiton. It is to his political course and his continued opposition of the Ministry, that the ruin of his own prospects of promotion is, in the first instance, attributed. His stock-jobbing operations, in 1814, did him more serious injury. Early in that year a false report was circulated that NAPOLEON had fallen, on which the funds suddenly rose, and Lord COCHRANE and several of his friends sold out to a large amount. He was tried and found guilty of being implicated in the fraud, and was sentenced to a heavy fine, a year's imprisonmment, and to stand in the pillory. He was also deprived of the Order of the Bath, of his rank in the navy, and expelled from the House of Commons. The sentence to the pillory was remitted. The electors of Westminster again chose him for their representative, and, under circumstances of extraordinary daring, he broke out of prison and reappeared in his place in Parliament. In 1818 Lord COCHRANE accepted the command of the Chilian fleet, and mainly contributed to the success of the Chilian war of independence. The cutting out of the Esmeralda from the guns of the Castle of Callao, has always been regarded as one of his most celebrated exploits. In 1823, Lord COCHRANE gave his services, to Brazil, and was appointed by the Emperor to the command of the Brazilian fleet, and created Marquis of Marenham. In 1827 and 1828 he served in Greece. In 1830 he was reinstated in his rank in the British Navy, and in 1847 the Order of the Bath was restored to him. He became Vice-Admiral of the Blue in 1841, of the While in 1851, and Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom in 1854. Lord COCHRANE was the possessor of various foreign orders of merit and distinction. As a scientific man his reputation stood high, and the projectile which he invented for blowing up fleets, is said to be overwhelmingly destructive. A pamphlet written by the Earl, entitled ""Observations on Naval Affairs,"" attracted considerable attention at the time of its publication. Lord DUNDONALD was engaged, at the time of his death, in writing his personal memoirs. Two volumes have already appeared, and it is to be hoped that the others are sufficiently advanced for publication.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.; The Earl of Dundonald.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.; The Earl of Dundonald.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'DEATHS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c22fea8f-91c1-5313-a6e2-077cef59f9dc,773,nyt://article/c22fea8f-91c1-5313-a6e2-077cef59f9dc

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/13/archives/new-presbyterian-church.html,,"-- Ground was broken, yesterday afternoon, at the corner of Lafayette-avenue and Oxford-street, for a new church edifice for the Park Presbyterian Society, which now worships in a small building on the corner of DeKalb and Carlton avenues. The new church will be of the Romanesque style of architecture, of plain brown stone, with a front of 84 feet on Lafayette-avenue, and extending back 144 feet on Oxford-street. The front tower will be 75 feet high, and the one at the rear 111 feet with a spire reaching 190 feet. The auditorium will be 90 feet by 76, and will be finished in a similar style to Plymouth Church, and will contain 285 pews, with seats for 1,650 grown persons. If necessary, seats for 350 more persons can be added. The lecture-room, which is to be located at the rear of the church, will be 90 by 29 feet. The building complete, it is estimated, will cost $50,000. At the breaking of ground, yesterday, there was a large attendance of people. Rev. Mr. ELMENDORF read a portion of Scripture; Rev. Dr. BUDDINGTON made a prayer; after which, Rev. Mr. CUYLER, the pastor, made an address, and formally commenced the excavation by throwing up a shovel-full of earth.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6cdf968-fbd5-5587-a996-b47266df28f4,355,nyt://article/d6cdf968-fbd5-5587-a996-b47266df28f4

The more conservative portion of the population of the Slave States are at last waking up to the necessity of making some movement to stay the tide which might otherwise overwhelm them, and the result is seen in the altered tone of the advices from all quarters. At Henderson, Ky., a mass meeting was held yesterday of men of all parties, at which strong Union speeches were made by Douglas, Breckinridge and Bell men, and resolutions were adopted expressive of the abhorrence felt by all sensible people at the idea of a separation of the States. Arrangements were also made for holding a great mass meeting of the whole country at Louisville at an early day, having the same purposes in view. From Washington, we learn that it is the intention of the Administration to make no move towards coercing South Carolina, excepting in a certain contingency. She will be allowed to take any position she pleases -- to suspend the Courts and to stop all the mails if she will -- but not to interfere with the public revenue or to open a port. The moment this is done a man-of-war will convey a revenue officer to Charleston, to see the laws enforced. It is stated to be the purpose of Virginia to attempt the office of mediator between South Carolina and the Federal Government in case secession actually takes place, and that an effort will be made to effect a rearrangement on a basis which will prove satisfactory to all sections of the country.

"MR. RAREY's FAREWELL TO ENGLAND. -- On Saturday, Oct. 27, the great American horse-lamer, took final leave of his English friends at the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. The exhibition presented no feature of novelty, beyond the fact of its being a leave-taking, and the numerous audience which it attracted. The whole of the immense Handel Orchestra was crammed to the roof, and presented a most imposing appearance. The same may be said of every portion of the transept that was not railed off as an arona, whilst the first, second, and even third galleries, exhibited each its dense and eager rows of human faces. The Russian Ambassador and a numerous suite, occupied the Queen's gallery, and there were also scattered amongst the lower crowd an exceedingly numerous and conspicuous sprinkling of Orientals, Mr. RAREY began with Cruiser, who is now a model of docility and patience. Like Col. Crockett's squirrels, he comes down without the trouble of firing. He bends his knee for the strap, and falls, with case, if not with dignity, the moment it becomes his cue to do so. He looked thin on Saturday, and his coat was rough, but neither of those symptoms is uncommon with horses at this season of the year. Cruiser, who is now the property of Mr. RAREY, goes with him to America, to assist in disseminating the new philosophy of horse-taming. After him came a chestnut, which was, if possible, still more docile; but here the harmony of the arena terminated. When the chestnut had been duly hobbled, tumbled, and otherwise done for, the whole transept suddenly became vocal with the unearthly screams of the Irish mare, who was about to receive her first initiation into the restraints of a civilized manege. This animal and another horse of fierce disposition were brought into subjection, and then Mr. RAREY delivered his farewell, in a few simple, manly words, full of friendly regrets and good feeling. He acknowledged the unfailing kindness he had always received from the people of England, and the fair hearing which had been given to his rather novel theories. He hoped he had done some good in the cause of humanity, by pleading as he had done the cause of our best friend, the horse, and by showing, to the best of his humble ability, the means by which its usefulness might be preserved without those protracted and brutal systems of training which at present caused cruel and needless suffering. He (Mr. RAREY) was about leaving England, perhaps forever; but he should to his last moment retain a grateful recollection of the friends he had made and the kindness he had received during his rather protracted sojourn in the old country.

"Some facts in regard to a seduction have come to our knowledge, which may be of interest to our readers. A few months ago, a traveling agent for one of the heavy dry-goods merchants in New-York City formed the acquaintance of the only daughter of one of the New-York bankers. The lady was young, accomplished, beautiful, but too susceptible. The traveling agent was smitten, as he avowed; took his ""ladye-love"" to the Opera, the theatre, and Japanese ball, and finally proposed an elopement. The lady objected, but, like many others, consented at last, and one evening, leaving the paternal roof with her lover, under the pretence of attending one of the theatres, they took the cars, and continuing their journey without delay, arrived in Detroit on the 14th of last month. Instead of going, as the lady desired, direct to a clergyman, to have the matrimonial knot tied, the seducer took his victim to a house in which he declared a relative of his resided, and there the ruin of the girl was consummated under promise of marriage. For nearly two weeks the young girl plead, but in vain, that her seducer should marry her, but he being relentless, she wrote to her parents, and on the morning of election day they both arrived, and, seeking the lost one, found her, and without a word of reproach took her to their arms and forgave her all. The next thing was to find the seducer, but he having heard of the arrival, fled, and has not since been seen in this vicinity. On Wednesday morning the reunited trio departed for New-York, and ere this the deceived but contrite girl is again surrounded by home influences. -- Detroit Tribune, Nov. 10.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/14/archives/a-runaway-desertion-and-reclamation.html,,"Some facts in regard to a seduction have come to our knowledge, which may be of interest to our readers.

"JAMES COLLYER, a farmer residing near the Cyprets Hills Plank Road, about one and a half miles east of East New-York, in New-Lotts, Queens County, was found dead in his own barn at an early hour yesterday morning, with his skull badly fractured, and there were other evidences that a murder had been committed. The deceased took a wagon-load of produce to the New-York market Monday afternoon, and returned home at about 6 o'clock in the evening, with between $100 and $200 in his pocket. Soon after supper he went to the store of Mr. J. TIERNEY, in the vicinity, where he transacted some business, had a pitcher filled with beer, and left for his stable. He paid a bill at the store, and, while doing this, exposed considerable money, when a man present remarked, ""COLLFER, you are flush to-night."" This attracted the particular attention of two German laborers present, -- father and son -- and it is said that they stepped forward and looked at the money. As soon as Mr. COLLYER left the store, the two Germans went out also, and as this was the last seen of Mr. COLLYER alive, it was at first supposed that the Germans had committed the murder. Detectives FROST and DENTON, of Brooklyn, yesterday afternoon arrested the two Germans in Williamsburgh, on suspicion, and committed them to the cells of the First Precinct Station-house; but the officers do not believe that they participated in the murder. They gave their names as JAMES and HENRY SPRATT. Late Monday evening. Mrs. COLLYER, the wife of deceased, feeling envious at me long absence of her husband, went to her door and looked towards the barn, which is about two hundred yards distant from the house, but seeing no light concluded that he had been detained at the store, and she retired for the night. She was much surprised at not finding her husband at home in the morning, and immediately went to the barn to ascertain if his team was there. The first object that attracted her attention upon entering the barn -- the doors of which were wide open -- was the dead body of her husband lying in a pool of blood. Her shrieks brought to her side several inmates of the house, and she was removed in a swoon to the house. The alarm was at once given, and the Coroner of Queens County (Mr. WOOD) was soon there. Upon examining the body, it was found that the skull was badly fractured -- evidently by a blunt instrument, such as the head of an axe, or something of that kind. His pockets were turned inside out, and all of his money and a gold watch were gone. The book attached to the chain of the watch was still remaining in the buttonhole of his vest, the murderes, in their hurry, evidently having broken the chain.

WOODS, of Maschusetts, had repaired to Charleston to fill a pedagogical engagement in the Barnwell District, but with that keen scent for men of his sort, which distinguishes the owners of souls, his mission was detected, and with astonishing lenity, considering the gravity of his contemplated offence, Mr. WOODS was merely returned to Boston by the following steamer. It is, indeed, high time that some check should be put upon the incendiary attempts of Massachusetts to enlighten those who sit in the shadow of the palmetto. From the time Commissioner HOARE was gently dismissed by the chivalry, notwithstanding the subversive nature of his errand, to this moment, more or less activity has existed upon that track of the underground railroad, which returns to the South in exchange for its runaway negros, fugitive school-masters from New-England. What the teaching and example of these men have bean, may be seen from a glance at the present attitude of the northern-most Slave States, who instead of sustaining South Carolina in its daring and defiant posture, disclose a painful willingness to wait and make sure what there is to dare, and what to defy. Such are not wanted in South Carolina.

"Thomas Reilly vs. Chas. G. Cornell, Frederick Johnson and James McMann. -- The trial of this action now came on before Justice MONCRIEF at Special Term of the Superior Court. The particulars of the case were given in the TIMES of 23d March last, at which date it was before the Court, at Special Term, on a motion for an injunction against the defendants. The plaintiff was the owner of the property known as Hermitage Hall, situated on the corner of Houston and Allen streets, which is estimated to be worth $25,000. The defendant, Gornell, who was the late President of the Board of Aldermen, now holds an instrument which he claims is a deed of the property in question, pursuant to a purchase from a referee in a foreclosure suit. The plaintiff sets forth his case in a lengthy complaint, showing that, in March last, this property was sold under a foreclosure of mortgage thereon, and that by an agreement with the parties, he was to have the fight of redemption. He subsequently obtained a loan from the defendants. Cornell and Johnson, of $5,600, with which to discharge he foreclosure decree. As security for such loan, and security only, he alleges that he gave these gentlemen a transfer of the bid upon the sale of the Hall, and a deed absolute from the Referee, which they agreed by parole to hold as a mortgage only.

Plaintiff, in conclusion of this series of extraordinary charges, avers that he has since tendered the defendants the entire loan, with interest, which has been declined by them, they claiming absolute title, under the Referee's deed.

The feelings of her settlers toward Mr. BUCHANAN are those of positive personal hatred, and that, too, of an intensity that could have been produced only by long-continued injustice. They bear no resemblance in their nature to the disapproval of his general policy which is so universal in the Free States, nor to the chagrin of his life-long friends whom, when in power, he has forsaken and maligned, nor even to the somewhat intense enmity of the Forney and Saunders type; they are more akin to the feeling which PERIO and his compatriots maybe supposed to entertain for BOMBALINO, than anything for which the history of this country furnishes a parallel.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Treatment of Kansas by the Administration.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Treatment of Kansas by the Administration.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9a903e1c-eeb5-5095-b45b-1fbcc2b4e56a,969,nyt://article/9a903e1c-eeb5-5095-b45b-1fbcc2b4e56a

And if there be one point upon which Northern sentiment is well settled, it is in regarding Slavery as the creature of local law, in the absence of which it can have no legal being; and Slavery, it is needles to say, has never been established by law in Nebraska. The distinction is not unnecessary; for in the dearth of any rational apprehension of the order of things to be established next year, this occurrence, following so soon after a Republican victory, may be absurdly and mischievously misinterpreted by the indifferently provided casuists of secession.

"The idea that a State can secede from the Union whenever a majority of its people see fit, for any cause, or for no cause, and with the passive acquiescence of the Federal Government, is the strangest folly of the day. Those who maintain this proposition, seem to overlook the fact that the President of the United States has taken an oath to support the Constitution, and see that the laws are faithfully executed. Among the duties of theExecutive, as defined in the second Article of the Constitution, it is declared that ""he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.""

To meet the wants of this numerous class of boys, another dormitory has just been fitted up, capable of accommodating sixty boys, in addition to seventy in the oriental bed-room; but the humane and considerate friends of these unfortunate children will do well to help them by contributing, what will be of inappreciable service to humanity, warm and comfortable bed-clothing, to make the Winter pass them less drearily than it has been their wont to experience in former years. By referring to the report of the Institution, it will be seen that nearly twenty thousand lodgings have been provided for these poor boys within a year, and that about fourteen thousand meals have been given to them. Several hundreds are now happily located in country homes, and many who have made the Lodging-House their permanent abode have acquired settled habits of industry and morality, which will subserve the future interests of society as well as their own.

"Rebecca's dress was not quite ready, so ""La Juive"" has been postponed at the Academy from the 12th to the 26th or 30th, sooner or later, perhaps later. To-morrow and to-morrow. Precision in opening and shutting opera houses in Europe, where a manager would as soon leave the gay and festive world by suicide outright as to leave it in the lurch by a broken promise, is not calculated among the moralities of the Irving-place Muse. A general looseness of action, comporting with the indifference of the public, marks there the days and dates of harmonious matters and things. Mr. ULLMAN says he will begin such a date, and parades titles and singers, and much rhetoric, to set off his diamond stock; but the singers who have to cross the broad Atlantic may not arrive, or, having arrived, give a fresh turn to the financial screw, or wish for a little more security, or some serpent or other gets into the Paradise of music, and there is the devil to pay. Certainly, with the uncertainty of musical supplies from a distant transoceanic land, speaking a strange tongue and full of home-sick fancies, operatic management is no sinecure. Then again, the reserved right of prime donne and primi nomini to fall ill, to have liver and lights most dreadfully diseased at the shortest notice, interferes sadly with the managerial precisions, a thing not practicable abroad -- for when singers try to sham to that tune persistently, they go to Sing Sing until they recover. With these comparative anatomies, and this interpretation before us of the several effects of republican and monarchical institutions on the larynx, pharynx, glottis, epiglottis and lungs, we may appreciate the condition of a manager here as to ability or inability to get his troops into action with given certainty at any time.

After some remarks on the general subject, Mr. LAURENS took occasion to explain his position as an officer of the Federal Government. Many of my fellow-citizens, said he, view the Custom-house as an institution for the purpose of collecting the revenue of Government. This is true, as far as it goes; and if it were the sole object and duty of the institution, then the Custom-house might be closed, now and forever, without detriment to the State; but it has other and higher responsibility than this. If the port of Charleston were declared a free port of entry, that all goods might be landed on her wharves free of any taxation, still there would be a necessity, an absolute necessity, for a Custom or Clearing House. It is the law of all civilized nations that the nationality of a vessel must be proven by the official papers and seal of the Government under whose flag she sails, or else, by the said law, she is viewed as an unlawful cruiser, herself and cargo a lawful prize, her captain and crew pirates. Close the doors of the United States Customhouse before South Carolina establishes one of her own, and you blockade your own port more thoroughly and effectually than all the combined navies of the world could do. The cotton, rice, and other produce now on our wharves, in storehouses, and elsewhere, must seek another port; all vessels not cleared must rot at our wharves, or run the risk of confiscation in another port. It was in view of this embarrassment to our city -- the emporium of our State -- that my letter of the 7th November was written and published.

The proprietors of German theatres determined to test the constitutionality of the statute; but with a seeming prescience of the failure that would crown their efforts against it in the legal tribunals, they resorted to a very silly subterfuge, and established a new religious order or sect, the public devotional exercises of which consisted of theatrical performances on Sunday, while the individual virtues it inculcated were smoking tobacco in meerschaum pipes, and the copious guzzling of lager-beer. Infatuated with a belief that the profanity, which christened such folly with the name of religion, would secure them immunity from the penalties of the law, the proprietors of various beer-gardens and theatres continued their Sunday performances in defiance of the enactment.

The Piedmontese and Garibaldian army, under the command of King VICTOR EMANUEL, crossed the Garigliano on the 3d, and attacked the Royalists, gaining a most complete victory. The Royalists dispersed, and left baggage, ammunition and an immense number of prisoners in the hands of the conquerors. They were pursued to Gaeta, and, at latest accounts, the Piedmontese had occupied positions commanding that town. King VICTOR EMANUEL was to enter Naples on the 6th inst. It is now said that the Austrians have suddenly ceased to send troops towards the Lombard frontier, and it is surmised that, since his failure to obtain promises of aid from Russia and Prussia at Warsaw, the Emperor has relinquished his aggressive designs. Count RECHBERG has addressed to the representatives of Austria abroad a circular, note, in which he makes it clearly understood that non-intervention in the affairs of Italy was agreed upon, and that the three Northern Courts would do nothing which might provoke a war. An official decree, signed by GARIBALDI, confiscates the property of the Ex-King of Naples.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/20/archives/the-election-in-california.html,,"-- The first advices from the election on the Pacific shore came to hand yesterday. They announce a most unexpected development of the Republican vote in California, rendering the contest an exceedingly close one between the Douglas and Lincoln tickets; though the latest reports accord the State to the former. Mr. BRECKINRIDGE lags sadly behind his leading competitors, while BELL might as well be dropped from the count. The result, beyond its testimony to the growing popularity of the Republican creed, even without the circle of our Eastern influences, is only important in its bearing upon the question of the United States Senatorship. The term of Dr. GWIN -- a most active and subservient adherent of the Buchanan Administration -- will expire on the 4th of March next. Determined to compel a reelection, GWIN has stumped the State, and freely spent his fortune, to secure a favorable Legislature -- one that would overlook his delinquencies in regard to the Overland mail and Lime Point, and in defiance of a distinctly-uttered public opinion give him another prolonged opportunity to misrepresent the State. The attempt has failed. The Legislature will be controlled by the Douglas party, who, there is reason to believe, will prefer to make a selection as agreeable to the Republicans as the choice of Col. BAKER in Oregon, rather than alienate so powerful a minority as the Republicans will be in that body. At all events, the suppression of GWIN is a victory in itself.

We must say this is peculiarly graceless on the part of Texas. It was only the other day we incorporated that Commonwealth in the Union, at the cost of a war, which has left its monument in a debt of more than sixty millions of dollars, upon which we are faithfully paying, and are likely to continue to pay, a quite formidable interest. We also assumed the debt of the new comer; took its navy off its hands; adjusted its boundary to its satisfaction; gave it lands for its railroads; and have connived at a snug little business in the way of Slave-trading, among the islands and bayous about Indianola. Having secured all these advantages from its Federal relations, now to step out of the Union bearing them along, and leaving the widowed sisterhood remaining to foot the bill, smacks strongly of ingratitude; and, we repeat, Texas in merely proposing such a course, ought to be deeply ashamed of herself. The fact casts suspicion upon her motives in originally seeking admission to the Union.

It is good of its kind, but not the best. When it is revived once in three or four years, it is played often enough. But when a great actress appears in the part of Juliana, all habitues of the theatre are sure to be there, and novices, who have never seen the comedy, cannot resist the temptation to judge for themselves. Consequently, notwithstanding the rain, we were not surprised, last night, to find the Winter Garden crowded. As nearly as we can recollect, it is about seven years since that Miss CUSHMAN, at the Broadway Theatre, last sustained the part of Juliana. In this character, as in all others she has played during her present engagement, she has not improved -- that were out of the question -- but she has shown herself to be equal to her best self in her best days. And in proof of that assertion it needs only to be stated that her present engagement, which will close with this week, is the most successful since her return from that first engagement in England, fifteen years ago, which gave her the renown of being then the finest actress in the two countries. She will play Meg Merrilies to-night, and repeat the part of Juliana in the ""Honeymoon"" to-morrow.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/588bd454-24f6-5bfc-9346-1329be5a3cd2,298,nyt://article/588bd454-24f6-5bfc-9346-1329be5a3cd2

A telegram from Charleston states that the report that President BUCHANAN intends to take a decided stand against seceding States, is generally regarded as a joke. Judging from the tenor of our correspondent's letter from Washington, however, the Charlestonians will find it rather a serious joke. Our dispatches assert that a distinguished Southern Senator now at the National Capital -- possibly Mr. SLIDELL, of Louisiana, -- not only denies the right of secession, but thinks that the President is to blame in not giving the refractory States to understand immediately that the whole power of the Federal Government will be used against them in the event of any attempt to place the Federal laws at defiance.

The errors of public men are not of the kind that slumber; they are incessantly in motion, parading up and down the columns of newspapers, or swelling to yet greater, proportions amidst the heat and exaggeration of partisan assemblages. It must be willful and deliberate blindness which fails to see the point of departure from the right road; it must be criminal and determined obstinacy which refuses to retrace any steps in a wrong direction once taken. The American people are liberal, almost to a fault, in their judgments of public men. At the first evidence of repentance or a desire to pursue a juster course in future, it would seem as if a popular Act of Oblivion were suddenly passed, and the illustrious wrong-doer becomes a recipient of gratitude from those whom he no longer harasses. These truths are now likely to receive illustration from the closing scenes of Mr. BUCHANAN's term. On all sides there would appear a disposition to forget his share in producing the dangers which threaten and the injuries which afflict us. Let him but now be true to the Union, which four years ago intrusted him with its destinies, and it is yet possible that his name may live in our history as that of a President who, despite some grave and protracted errors in the commencement of his official career, atoned nobly for all mistakes towards its close by his firmness and wisdom in suppressing the greatest danger which has ever threatened our national existence.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The President and Secession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The President and Secession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89d8170a-64ab-527e-a65b-e4342d32213a,1170,nyt://article/89d8170a-64ab-527e-a65b-e4342d32213a

The result is simply amazing. The entire vote is 475,000, a figure so slightly exceeding that of 1856, as to supply a just basis of comparison. The majority of LINCON over the Fusion ticket is a fraction less than ninety-three thousand; over DOUGLAS, 251,168; over BELL, 255,764; over all opposition, 62,518. The majority against the Republicans in 1856 was 165,011; and we therefore learn that at least 175,000 voters who were opposed at that time to the Republicans, have united themselves to that party, and assisted in raising Mr. LINCOLN to the Presidency. So extraordinary a change, embracing as it does little less than one-half the voting population of the State, has no precedent in political history.

People wereprivileged to drink gin in palaces, but compelled to worship art in ""garrets."" Mr. H.W. DERBY, a gentleman well known to the public as proprietor of a collection of paintings, commonly called Mr. Dusseldorf's Gallery, shrewdly guessed at this want, and determined to meet it. Opposite to Laura Keene's Theatre, and lettered No. 625 Broadway, stood an old tumble-down building; around this Mr. Aladdin DERBY drew a magic circle of dollars; waved his hand once, twice, thrice; whispered in an architect's car, and lo! the old bricks took unto themselves wings, vanished like pebbles in water, or dew in air, and in their stead arose a marble palace, several stories in height and running back in the rear to a fabulous length. Into this wonder of a night, Mr. DERBY whisked Mr. Dusseldorf's Gallery, along with Mr. JARVES' collection, and now these pictures have a local habitation as well as a name. Not only this, but New-York has an Art Exchange and a literary lounging-place for all time. It is pleasant to go thither in these troublous times and hob-a-nob with the unruffled countenances that gaze from the velveted walls. There Othello, unmindful of the additions to his audience, stirs Desdemona's blood with tales of the dangers he has passed; and grand JOHN HUSS, with clasped hands and face upturned in prayer, kneels to receive the crown of martyrdom, sending a prayer to Heaven for his murderers, before his soul is borne thither on the winged flames to accuse them. Turning from Mr. Dusseldorf's collection, which occupies the main body of the hall, we enter an octagonal vestibule, and are in the presence of the old masters. Those queer, quaint pictures in fantastic frames, many of them limned on wood, and with back-grounds of gold, were painted long, long years ago, when Art was in its infancy and Venice was in the hands of the Doges. Many of their figures in their angularity look as though they might have been drawn by Egyptian or Chinese artists, yet they are the work of the old Italian masters, and that little 6x6 thing which you were scarce willing to hang in your parlor would be cheap at 15,000 francs. Just notice the tints; as warm and fresh as though laid on yesterday, and yet their backs are dim with the dust that gathered on them when WILLIAM the Conqueror was King.

Opposite to Laura Keene's Theatre, and lettered No. 625 Broadway, stood an old tumble-down building; around this Mr. Aladdin DERBY drew a magic circle of dollars; waved his hand once, twice, thrice; whispered in an architect's car, and lo! the old bricks took unto themselves wings, vanished like pebbles in water, or dew in air, and in their stead arose a marble palace, several stories in height and running back in the rear to a fabulous length. Into this wonder of a night, Mr. DERBY whisked Mr. Dusseldorf's Gallery, along with Mr. JARVES' collection, and now these pictures have a local habitation as well as a name. Not only this, but New-York has an Art Exchange and a literary lounging-place for all time. It is pleasant to go thither in these troublous times and hob-a-nob with the unruffled countenances that gaze from the velveted walls. There Othello, unmindful of the additions to his audience, stirs Desdemona's blood with tales of the dangers he has passed; and grand JOHN HUSS, with clasped hands and face upturned in prayer, kneels to receive the crown of martyrdom, sending a prayer to Heaven for his murderers, before his soul is borne thither on the winged flames to accuse them. Turning from Mr. Dusseldorf's collection, which occupies the main body of the hall, we enter an octagonal vestibule, and are in the presence of the old masters. Those queer, quaint pictures in fantastic frames, many of them limned on wood, and with back-grounds of gold, were painted long, long years ago, when Art was in its infancy and Venice was in the hands of the Doges. Many of their figures in their angularity look as though they might have been drawn by Egyptian or Chinese artists, yet they are the work of the old Italian masters, and that little 6x6 thing which you were scarce willing to hang in your parlor would be cheap at 15,000 francs. Just notice the tints; as warm and fresh as though laid on yesterday, and yet their backs are dim with the dust that gathered on them when WILLIAM the Conqueror was King. You have a framed history of Art, in its dawn and progress, in the pictures which hang upon those octagonal walls.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Opening of the Institute of Fine Arts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Opening of the Institute of Fine Arts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e90dc2b3-3e09-5d3a-9604-88e443e16bc1,825,nyt://article/e90dc2b3-3e09-5d3a-9604-88e443e16bc1

Mr. TRUMBULL's speech, a synopsis of which we also give, was listened to with the most eager curiosity, as it was conceived to be an exposition of the policy which would govern the incoming Administration.

The people of Maryland, it will be seen from our dispatches, are beginning to move in this matter, and the feeling that South Carolina has no right to secede, without a consultation, will probably assume the form of a demand that she shall respect a wish so generally expressed. Virginia, too, is striving for the same end, and may possibly be successful. A rumor prevailed yesterday, in Baltimore, that a conference recently took place between prominent South Carolinians and Virginians -- one of the latter said to be Senator HUNTER -- which it is hoped may result in the attainment of the desired end -- especially as several distinguished Georgians and Alabamians are said to be in the secret. A letter from Gov. LETCHER appears in one of the Richmond papers of yesterday, in answer to a somewhat impertinent one from a gentleman in Pennsylvania, which is generally conservative in its tone. He insists, however, that the only way by which disunion can be prevented is through the repeal of obnoxious laws', in Northern States, which are intended to conflict with the Fugitive Slave law. A bill has unanimously passed both branches of the Georgia Legislature which provides for the calling of a State Convention -- at what time does not appear. From South Carolina, of course, the talk is still of secession. Meantime, the money stringency continues, and bank suspensions are becoming common. Following the lead of the Farmers' Bank, all the others in Richmond, and also those of Petersburgh, suspended yesterday; and those of Baltimore have taken the same course.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d95dedea-c230-5458-a63a-fbadb051d332,1665,nyt://article/d95dedea-c230-5458-a63a-fbadb051d332

It is announced that the Banks of Washington and Philadelphia, following the lead of those of Richmond and Baltimore, have suspended specie payments. This movement is generally commended in the localities immediately interested, and has had the effect to give more confidence in business circles. The Banks of Baltimore yesterday discounted to the amount of nearly a million dollars, and the merchants were correspondingly relieved. The suspension of the Banks in Philadelphia was on account of a run commenced upon them, and is in direct contravention of a State law. The hope is expressed, however, that the Governor will convene the Legislature in order that a special law may be passed to meet the exigency. One suspension took place in Charleston, South Carolina, yesterday -- that of the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank. In Virginia, further suspensions took place in Norfolk, Portsmouth and Wheeling. From Boston we learn that should the emergency require it, the Banks there propose to discount to the extent of five millions. The sensation dispatches published in this City relative to the condition of the Cabinet on the question of secession, are now flatly contradicted on the very best authority. There may be, of course, differences of opinion relative to the right of a State to secede, but the propriety of the President's course in enforcing his own views, will not be questioned by any Cabinet officer. An evidence of the fact that Georgia is not disposed to blindly follow the lead of South Carolina, may be found in the fact that the Legislature of that State to-morrow, at the suggestion of Gov. BROWN in a special Message, will proceed to choose Presidential Electors. South Carolina maintains her extreme position of hostility towards the North, one evidence of which may be seen in the announcement that all the steerage passengers which reach Charleston on board the steamers from the Northern ports are immediately sent back. Meantime it is stated as an interesting fact, in our Washington dispatches, that no census returns have been received from that State -- they having all been withheld.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8e5348f9-142e-51bc-83c1-2421654f1a13,1425,nyt://article/8e5348f9-142e-51bc-83c1-2421654f1a13

The Coroner was unable yesterday to procure the attendance of the witnesses in the case, and the investigation was postponed until to-day. The circumstances of the assault are said, however, to be as follows: Both men worked for Mr. J.

His employer remarked to him that he had been drinking, but he denied that he had, and accused CROWLEY, who stood by, with having carried tales to Mr. GILHOOLEY, when angry words passed between them. CROWLEY presently became very much excited, and picking up a mallet, he struck BUND a severe blow upon the head. Mr. GILHOOLEY then interfered to prevent further violence, after which BUND went to the grocery-store, No. 80 Nassau-street, and called for a glass of beer. Before he could drink it, however, he tottered to a chair and sunk down insensible, remaining in that condition for at least 24 hours, at the expiration of which time the matter was reported to the Second Ward Police, and the injured man was removed from the grocery to the Hospital, where it was ascertained that the base of his skull was fractured. The efforts made to restore him to consciousness proved unavailing, and his death resulted as stated. Meantime, CROWLEY, having heard that BUND was likely to die, fled, and so far he has escaped arrest.

"The additional suspensions which we have to report this morning are those of the two Banks in Trenton, New-Jersey, the Pittsburgh (Pa.) Bank, and the long-established private banking-house of SAMUEL HARRIS & SONS, in Baltimore. Relative to the secession movements, there is very little new of importance. Our advices partake of much the same character as heretofore. As an indication of the condition of sentiment in Georgia, a series of resolutions offered in the Legislature are telegraphed, which insist, as the condition of the State remaining in the Union, upon the repeal of those laws in the Northern States, nullifying the Fugitive Slave law, and the enactment of laws by Congress, enabling Southern men to carry their Slaves into the Territories. Retaliatory measures against the North, it seems, have already commenced, and the first demonstrations made are against the free negroes who visit Southern ports in the capacity of sailors. A dispatch from Savannah states that six have been taken from one vessel at that port, and three from another at Fernandina, Fla., and conveyed to parts unknown. The refusal of South Carolina to assent to the proposition of Virginia and other Southern States, that a Convention should be held for the purpose of discussing calmly the question of secession, is severely commented upon by the Virginia journals. The opinion seems to be gaining ground that the South Carolinians are altogether too fast in their proposal to drag all the Slave States after, them whether they are inclined to go or not. A significant commentary upon the outcry against the North for refusing to enforce the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law, may be found in the fact that two Deputy Marshals arrived in Richmond on Wednesday from New-York, having in their custody a runaway from Kentucky, whom they took measures to deliver to his master. A dispatch from Norfolk states that Gov. WISE has offered his services to Gov. GIST, of South Carolina, in case they are not wanted by Virginia. Some people may consider this an indication that the report relative to his insanity was very near the truth. From South Carolina, we have a reiteration of the assertion that a prominent military man has offered the services of himself and his command to Gov. GIST, in case any fighting is to be done. The name is not given, but the individual may be sufficiently indicated by the statement that he is a distinguished graduate of West Point, and that his father has been a Captain in the United States Army.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/24/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The additional suspensions which we have to report this morning are those of the two Banks in Trenton, New-Jersey, the Pittsburgh (Pa.)

Retaliatory measures against the North, it seems, have already commenced, and the first demonstrations made are against the free negroes who visit Southern ports in the capacity of sailors. A dispatch from Savannah states that six have been taken from one vessel at that port, and three from another at Fernandina, Fla., and conveyed to parts unknown. The refusal of South Carolina to assent to the proposition of Virginia and other Southern States, that a Convention should be held for the purpose of discussing calmly the question of secession, is severely commented upon by the Virginia journals. The opinion seems to be gaining ground that the South Carolinians are altogether too fast in their proposal to drag all the Slave States after, them whether they are inclined to go or not. A significant commentary upon the outcry against the North for refusing to enforce the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law, may be found in the fact that two Deputy Marshals arrived in Richmond on Wednesday from New-York, having in their custody a runaway from Kentucky, whom they took measures to deliver to his master. A dispatch from Norfolk states that Gov. WISE has offered his services to Gov. GIST, of South Carolina, in case they are not wanted by Virginia. Some people may consider this an indication that the report relative to his insanity was very near the truth. From South Carolina, we have a reiteration of the assertion that a prominent military man has offered the services of himself and his command to Gov. GIST, in case any fighting is to be done. The name is not given, but the individual may be sufficiently indicated by the statement that he is a distinguished graduate of West Point, and that his father has been a Captain in the United States Army.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ab92a5b-cb84-58fc-b5ad-370a56145e1f,1131,nyt://article/9ab92a5b-cb84-58fc-b5ad-370a56145e1f

The plaintiff, ALFRED BEARDS  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/26/archives/brooklyn-news-the-beardsley-divorce-case.html,,"This case, which has been on trial in the Supreme Court before Judge LOTT and a jury for several days past, presents some curious,features. The plaintiff, ALFRED BEARDSLEY, and defendant, MARY E. BEARDSLEY, were united in marriage in 1849, and lived together until about 1855 without anything special happening to mar their married life. In 1854, it is alleged, Mrs. BEARDSLEY formed, the acquaintance of Dr. FRANCIS MAHAN, under the following peculiar circumstances, as drawn from the Doctor himself, on the witness stand: One pleasant afternoon he was seated in Thompson's Saloon, Broadway, New-York, when he saw defendant, in company with a Miss GREENWOOD, seated at an opposite table. The Doctor and defendant cast furtive glances at each other. Smiles and nods were interchanged. The ladies soon left the saloon. The Doctor followed them. Mrs. BEARDSLEY dropped a flower upon the sidewalk; the Doctor rescued and preserved it until reaching Barnum's Museum, where they all entered, when he restored the lost treasure, and received the smiles and thanks of its fair owner. Suffice it to say that ""the acquaintance"" thus auspiciously commenced ripened into friendship, and there being but one step from friendship to love, that was easily taken, and resulted in a private marriage in 1855. The ceremony was performed by Rev. Father MALONE, of St. Paul's Church, E.D., under a dispensation granted by Bishop LOUGHLIN. This was rendered necessary by the fact that the parties desired -- for reasons which will hereafter appear -- that the usual bands should not be publishen. Dr. MAHAN swears that up to the marriage he only knew Mrs. BEARDSLEY as MARY EVELINE SEYMOUR, daughter of Admiral SEYMOUR, of Nova Scotia, and it was not until they had been married several months that he discovered she was the wife of another man. She represented to him that she resided with a relative on Brooklyn Heights, and wished their marriage to be kept a secret until after she was twenty-one years of age, because if it was known before that time, she would forfeit a large amount of property to which she would then be entitled. The marriage was consummated at the Brandreth House, International Hotel, at the Drs. office in Wooster-street, and at various other places.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; THE BEARDSLEY DIVORCE CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; THE BEARDSLEY DIVORCE CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d4dc1a4-873f-5797-9390-0fe4c90221a8,682,nyt://article/2d4dc1a4-873f-5797-9390-0fe4c90221a8

A number of fire companies were at the moment passing through Broadway, on their return from a fire in Front street, and as quickly as possible they got to work. The intense cold, however, made their operations exceedingly difficult, as the hydrants had frozen, and considerable time elapsed before water could be obtained. Meantime the flames had burst out of every window in the upper story of the building on Church street side, and had thence communicated to the adjoining premises on Warren-street, from which it extended to the building in the rear, fronting on Murray-street, making an area of fire two hundred feet in length by fifty in width, upon which the firemen had to work. In addition to the labor of working to subdue the flames at those buildings, the high wind threw masses of burning cinders and pieces of burning timber upon the roofs of stores in the vicinity, making it necessary for the exercise of great precaution to prevent the destruction of the buildings which were thus endangered.

She brings over a million in treasure and the San Francisco mails of the 1st inst. Her California advices, however, have been anticipated by the Overland Express. Later news is received from the Isthmus and South America. The long-threatened diplomatic rupture between Peru and the United States has at length occurred, and Mr. CLAY, our Minister, has received his passports. He was to leave Callao on the 12th inst. for New-York, via Panama. We have already given in detail the merits of the dispute, and present to-day the Peruvian version, which appears in the form of a circular sent by the Peruvian Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Diplomatic Corps on the occasion of the suspension of diplomatic intercourse between the two countries. The general news from Peru and Chili is unimportant. From Bolivia we learn that the brief tranquillity which the Republic has lately enjoyed is again disturbed by attempted revolution, and that a more serious danger to the actual Government exists in a threatened invasion by Peru. Fresh fuel has been added to the revolutionary fire in New-Granada, and all hopes of peace seem to have been quenched for the present. The usual number of skirmishes are reported, and the Revolutionists, of course, claim to have been successful; but the truth is that neither party is strong enough to overcome its adversary, and so the resources of the country are being gradually exhausted by this ruinous and reckless civil war. There is a report, indorsed by a Carthagena journal, that the cargo of an American can vessel at Santa Martha had been seized by the authorities for the support of the troops, and also that an American citizen, formerly United States Consul at Carthagena, had been arrested and imprisoned. It is extremely probable that the stories are true, as American interests, here and elsewhere, are entirely without protection. The attempt to find a practicable route for a railroad across the Isthmus, between Chiriqui and the Gulf of Dolce, has been a total failure.

I went there July 13, 1856; lived with him to Nov. 13, 1859; I took care of the garden, grapery and horse, went to market to bring things for the house, &c., first became acquainted with Mrs. Burch in October of that year, on her return from the East; know David Stuart; have seen him at Mr. Burch's house; the first time I saw him there was in January, 1657; saw him first in the parlor; I went in the parlor -- some things came by express and Mrs. Burch sent for me to come up stairs to unpack them; when I went to the parlor door Mrs. Burch said I was to unpack those things, and Mr. Stuart would help me which he did; it was a clock and some bronzes; Mr. Stuart kept telling me what to do all the time in unpacking the things and taking them out -- which way I was to do it; when we were putting the clock on the mantel-piece, he told me to lift my end of the clock up, and I told him to lift his up, and that he was not my employer; Mrs. Burch told me not to speak to him so, and I said he should not talk to me so; Mrs. Burch told me to go down stairs, which I did; I say him there in the evening when I shut the house up; I could see Mr. Stuart in the room; my habit was to shut up the house at ten o'clock when there was no company there; if there was company, I was to wait until they were gone; I went up a second time, and Mrs. Burch called to me, and told me I could shut up the house, and go to bed, which I did; Mrs. Burch and Mr. Stuart were playing checkers or backgammon with a board on their knees; my bed is on the second floor from the main floor; the back of the front door was such that being opened in the ordinary way it could be heard at any part of the house; at that time Mr. Burch was away East, at least he was away -- I do not know where; [witness described the process of shutting up the house:] it would take fifteen or twenty minutes to shut up the house; saw Mr. Stuart at the house I think the next evening; would not be positive think he went away while I was shutting up the house; there were no other persons in the room with Mr. Stuart and Mrs. Burch on this or the previous evening when I shut up the house: Mr. Burch was gone three or four weeks at this time, I think, during which time I should think I saw Mr. Stuart there five or six times; two other; times he was there when I closed up; on one occasion they were playing checkers in a bedroom; and another time they were sitting in the library side by side reading; did not hear them say anything; do not know at what time Mr. Stuart left when I went to bed leaving him there; should have heard the front door close if shut before I went to sleep; one night Mrs. Burch told me to shut up the house, that I need not wait for Mr. Stuart, but if anyone else was there I could wait until he had gone; after Mr. Burch's return did not see Mr. Stuart there; the first time he came and brought some rose bushes; Mr. Burch was there then; I took them out in the yarn, or in the grapery; the next occasion he came on some railroad business, talking with Mr. Burch in the library; I heard them mention railroads; this was the fore part of 1857; the next time I saw Mr. Stuart there was either in the forenoon or afternoon, when Mr. Burch was not home; he came in that way two or three times alone in the Spring of 1857; think I saw him come once or twice from down-town with Mr. Burch in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock; I saw him there in the library; one time I went into the grapery, and found some one had been breaking the laterals off the vines; I saw somebody had been breaking them off, and I knew no one could get in; I asked the girl, and she told me that Mr. Stuart and Mrs. Burch had been there; I asked, who had been breaking the vines, and Mrs. Burch said Mr. Stuart had; I told him that it was none of his business; that when the vines wanted pruning I would do it, and that if I caught him at it I would put him out of the place; do not recollect that Mr. Stuart said any thing; Mrs. Burch told me to go down stairs, and I did; I went into the room in a great hurry; Mrs. Burch and Mr. Stuart were standing up against the library table; Mr. Turner came down stairs when he came home to dinner, and said -- [objected to;] Mr. Turner was Mrs. Burch's brother; this was in 1857; saw Mr. Stuart next there at the time of the bank panic, in the latter part of the Summer of 1857; Mrs. Burch came down and told me that I need not tell Mr. Burch about the vines; that she would tell him herself; I told her that I would tell Mr. Burch, and I did so; when Mr. Burch was gone three or four weeks, I think I saw Mr. Stuart there as many as five or six different times; I think the same night or the next after Mr. Burch went away; think he was in the library with Mrs. Burch alone when I finished closing the house; saw him there on Sunday evening; think they were in the parlor; Mr. Turner was living in the house at that time; I know I saw Mr. Stuart there during Mr. Burch's absence two or three times when I shut up the house; saw him there one time when Mr. Burch was gone to Michigan; he was sometimes in the parlor, or the library, alone with Mrs. Burch; recollect the two young ladies (the piece and Miss Spaulding) coming from the East early in 1858; the night of their arrival Mr. Stuart and Mrs. Burch were in the library playing bacgammon or checkers; Mrs. Burch told me to go down and receive the young ladies at the midnight train; I noticed that Mrs. Burch had on a different dress than usual; thought she looked redder than usual last evening; when I came back from the depot, about 10 A. M., Mr. Stuart had gone; Mr. Burch was away; Mrs. Burch had changed her dress, and told the young ladies that she had been sitting up waiting for them; on the evening of Mr. Stuart's visit, when the young ladies arrived, I heard the servant, Margaret, make a remark; it was right away after she came down stairs; she had been up to the door (when Mrs. Farnam called.)",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE BURCH DIVORCE CASE.; Testimony of Charles Laytoa, Mr. Burch's Man of All Work.

We had no thought of disparaging its influence or of hurting its feelings.

Instances of such self-depreciation are sometimes met with in other walks of life. A man who creates a temporary panic in the Fire Department, and sets all the fire-bells in the City ringing a general alarm, by the mere use of a lucifer match, seldom obtrudes his ""power"" and ""influence"" upon public notice. The man who throws a Ward into commotion by committing a murder in it, is quite apt to hide his great faculties in retirement -- and even that great artist who dispatched Dr. BURDELL, and threw the whole community into an excitement which the Herald's finest efforts have seldom equaled, has modestly put aside all public recognition of his greatness, and claimed neither the honors nor the rewards which the public would gladly pay.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HERALD AND THE PANIC', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE HERALD AND THE PANIC', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-11-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be2052fa-f671-5c82-98cd-7b45e511408c,584,nyt://article/be2052fa-f671-5c82-98cd-7b45e511408c

Accordingly, on Saturday, the various Police Captains were summoned at Headquarters, and informed that as their present efforts for suppressing the Sunday liquor traffic had resulted in no good whatever, in future the other method was to be enforced.

"we have always held tne ""Personal Liberty laws"" and other leged obstructions thrown in the way of the rendition of fugitive slaves to be useless and pernicious. To present this view now may be misinterpreted into a pusillanimous yielding to Southern clamor.

The fact that the South is not altogether given over to the Secessionists will be gathered from our dispatches this morning. Hon. ALEXANDER H.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/27/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The fact that the South is not altogether given over to the Secessionists will be gathered from our dispatches this morning. Hon. ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS, it will be seen, has been unanimously nominated by the citizens of Taliaferro County, Ga., as Delegate to the State Convention which is soon to meet to discuss the grave questions now agitating the country. Those who read his speech, published in the TIMES last week, will have no difficulty in believing that at least one conservative voice will be raised in warning against precipitation. In Baltimore, yesterday, the secession spirit was rebuked in a significant manner. A palmetto flag was displayed by an association calling themselves the ""Southern Volunteers,"" and it provoked only groans and hisses from a large crowd which collected around it. And the captain of a vessel in the harbor, who displayed the same flag at his masthead, was rebuked immediately by the display of the stars and stripes from all the other vessels in port. Hon. EDMUND RUFFIN, of Virginia, as we learn from our Richmond correspondent, has returned from South Carolina, having failed in his efforts to identify the ""Old Dominion,"" with the secession movement. From Washington, we continue to receive rumors relative to changes in the Cabinet. It is now somewhat positively asserted that Secretary COBB, and probably Secretary THOMPSON, will soon resign their places. There seems, however, to be no certainty about it yet. A report that Judge TANEY had resigned his seat on the Bench of the Supreme Court, is pronounced to be premature. He will not vacate his seat until the question of his successor is definitely settled. He has no idea of allowing the appointment to go into the hands of the Republicans. The steamship Columbia, which arrived yesterday from Charleston, brought back forty-seven more steerage passengers, and -- what is somewhat unusual -- a consignment of $16,800 specie.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d0179add-f168-5b66-a04e-b2743ac30bba,1251,nyt://article/d0179add-f168-5b66-a04e-b2743ac30bba

The husband of deceased testified that he left his home about 10 o'clock on Saturday morning last to go to his place of business; his wife, when he parted from her, appeared to be in a cheerful frame of mind and in perfect health. About 6 o'clock in the evening he returned home, and on going to his apartment he was surprised to find the door locked. Receiving no response to his repeated calls for admission, he procured a duplicate key from the landlady and unlocked the door. On entering the room, the first object that he saw was his wife, who lay upon the floor, her head beneath a chair, and her body perfectly cold and lifeless. A physician was called but he said Mrs. OLMSTEAD had been dead several hours. Witness further testified that a few years ago his wife had frequently threatened, when laboring under fits of despondency, to poison herself, and on several occasions he had taken laudanum from her, which he believed she had purchased with the object of committing self-destruction. Recently, however, she seemed to be more easy in her mind, and he had not heard her make any threats against her life. He knew of no reason which could have prompted the act, except that deceased had recently felt greatly mortified because one of her brothers had been convicted of an offence and was in prison at the Tombs. Dr. GEORGE B. BOUTON made a post-mortem examination of the body and found in the stomach a quantity of stramonium seeds, which, in his opinion, had produced death. The jury rendered a verdict to that effect. Deceased was a native of this City, 26 years of age.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; Evacuation Day. THE PARADE OF THE MILITARY.

We trust that in this  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/28/archives/musical.html,,"repetition he may be happily enabled to include the splendors of the audience as well as the effects of the stage, for not the least striking feature of the performance of ""La Juive,"" in Irving-place, on Monday night, was the holiday appearance of the house, crowded from pit to gallery, and with a distinctly operatic monde. Let us add that this audience was thrown into unusual and exhilarating relief by a really brilliant illumination. The lights of the Academy commonly serve to make visible the darkness of the boxes. They discourage fresh toilettes among the ladies, and new gloves among the gentlemen, and in this way dampen very considerably the legitimate atmosphere of the Opera, which is, or ought to be, that of a refined social Capua, winning men and women both away, for a few brief hours, from the excitements, passions and anxieties of the ""garish day."" Under the blaze of Monday evening, the whole house assumed a festive air, altogether unexpected by the oldest habitue, and the new proscenium boxes, which complete the tier of the lower balconies, and most agreeably replaces the hideous vomitoria of the old regime, with their oscillating hordes of lounging Philistines, were inaugurated most successfully. Never did the New-York Opera House seem so truly a house of opera as on Monday. The management, perhaps with delicate eye to future economies, announce that the luminous magnificence of this occasion, was only a reminiscence of the Prince of Wales' ball, intended to delight the souls of all the uncivilized thousands who found no favor in the sight of the ""four hundred"" elect on that auspicious occasion. We must urge it upon them to alter all this, and to erect the lights of Monday into a permanent institution.

MEMMINGER last year, and declares that it is now too late to attempt to assemble a Conference of the Slave States to consider the propriety of the pending movement. He cannot permit himself to believe that an attempt will be made by the present or the incoming Administration to coerce the State after she shall have seceded, by a refusal to surrender the harbor defences, or by interfering with the imports and exports; but if it shall prove that this view is wrong, the State must accept the issue presented, and fight her way to the best of her ability. He does not seem to consider that the establishment of new postal arrangements throughout the State, after the Federal Postmasters shall have resigned, will be a difficult matter, but in the meantime he proposes to use Adams Express for the distribution of correspondence. The reports which reach us from other Southern States present no feature of special importance.

The meeting, however, is represented to have been in the main harmonious, though there were differences of opinion on the subject of secession. Secretary COBB was not present. Excitement increases at the National Capital as the time for the assembling of Congress approaches, and fears are expressed that some unwise thing may be said or done which will result in a serious collision between the members. An editorial article has made its appearance in the Kentucky Statesman, recognized as Mr. BRECKINRIDGE's home organ, which is alleged to have been written by Mr. BRECKINRIDGE himself. A strong appeal is made in it to the conservative element of the South. If Mr. BRECKINRIDGE had spoken sooner, it might have had a better effect. In Virginia, meetings in favor of and opposed to secession are held daily. There appears to be a strong disinclination among her public men to come forward at the present time and give expression to their views. Gov. HICKS, of Maryland, has peremptorily declined to convene the Legislature of that State in special session. He is ready, he says, to go as far as any man in demanding the rights of the South in the Union, but refuses to place Maryland in the position of seeming to countenance treason.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/11/29/archives/fall-of-a-storage-warehouse-defective-architecture-the-cause-narrow.html,,"Shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morning a great deal of excitement was occasioned in the First Ward, by the bulging outwards, and fall of a large portion of the rear wall of S.A. MELLICK's five story brick storage warehouses, Nos. 36 and 38 Whitehall-street, causing the destruction of several hundred barrels of flour and jeopardizing the lives of many persons. The structure had only recently been completed, and it had not been occupied more than a couple of months. It comprised three large stores, having a frontage of 50 feet on Whitehall street, running back a distance of 75 feet, and connecting with an extension building, 40 feet deep, forming what is called an L, fronting on Pearl-street, where it was numbered 22. The warehouses were guaranteed by the architect who superintended their construction to bear the weight of all the flour that could be packed into them -- some 20,000 barrels -- but the buildings had never been filled to their utmost capacity because of the recent date of their occupancy. However, 12,000 barrels of flour had been distributed throughout the various floors, and Mr. MELLICK, confiding in the representations of the architect as to the strengh of the building, was still receiving the merchandise as fast as it could be brought in. Yesterday morning his laborers had just commenced operations in the way of ""snugging up"" the barrels on the top floor, when they were startled by a crashing noise and the instantaneous disappearance of the rear end wall of the Pearl-street extension, the whole of which fell out from the eaves to the third story, and the unsupported-end of the roof settled upon the flour barrels in the form of an inclined plane. The laborers by running to the front part of the building escaped injury, and hurrying to the street an alarm was given. Capt. SILVEY, with Sergeants SNODGRASS and CHERRY, happening to be in the neighborhood with a squad of men, at once formed a cordon about the dangerous premises, which were almost concealed by the cloud of dust and flour which had been raised, and prevented persons from parsing by. An examination was men cautiously entered upon, and it was found that the wall had fallen into the yard of an old four-story tenement house, No. 20 Pearl-street, occupied by fourteen families, numbering nearly eighty persons, all of whom, excepting CATHARINE CAIN, a girl fifteen years of age, escaped with no further injury than a terrible fright. The girl CATHARINE was in the yard, and hearing the cracking of the wall, she jumped down the cellar steps, but before she had time to recover her footing some of the bricks had fallen upon her. Fortunately, however, the mortar caused the wall to adhere, and it lay across the cellar-way, forming a vault in which the girl lay concealed. As quickly as her perilous position was discovered, several Policemen and others, regardless of the danger to which they were necessarily exposed if any other part of the wall should become detached, entered upon the task of removing the rubbish, and after half an hour's careful labor, their efforts to release her were successful. She was found to have received no other injury than a few severe bruises. Orders were at once given for the removal of the families from the tenement house, as if was feared that another portion of the wall might topple over upon the roof, and jeopardize the lives of the inmates. Many of the poor people in their distress had nowhere to go for shelter, and some desired to remain and take the risk, but the Police compelled them all to leave the place in spite of their dissatisfaction. Later in the day a builder examined the premises, and gave it as his opinion that the disaster had resulted from the weakness of the wall which separated the Whitehall-street buildings from that on Pearl-street, it having been cut through in several places with arched doorways for facility of communication. The case is very similar to that which happened a year ago this month in Broad-street, when KENT, LOWBER & CO.'s warehouse fell from over-crowding, causing the death of Mr. WM. ELY, of Brooklyn, and Policeman STEWART, who were buried in the ruins. The owner of the premises is Mr. JOHN T. JOHNSTON, President of the New-Jersey Central Railroad Company, against whom a warrant of arrest has been issued on the complaint of Sergeant LORD, of the Sanitary Squad, who reports the building to be in an unsafe condition. It is said that the loss upon flour and damage to the building will amount to $60,000.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fall of a Storage Warehouse.; DEFECTIVE ARCHITECTURE THE CAUSE NARROW ESCAPE OF SEVERAL PERSONS FROM INSTANT DEATH FOURTEEN POOR FAMILIES HOMELESS LOSS ESTIMATED AT $60,000.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fall of a Storage Warehouse.; DEFECTIVE ARCHITECTURE THE CAUSE NARROW ESCAPE OF SEVERAL PERSONS FROM INSTANT DEATH FOURTEEN POOR FAMILIES HOMELESS LOSS ESTIMATED AT $60,000.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-11-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da5495d4-fbb5-58a3-a285-e1b03d422da8,774,nyt://article/da5495d4-fbb5-58a3-a285-e1b03d422da8

"STEALING FROM AMATXUR GYMNASTS. -- For a long time past the gentlemen attending the Oriental Gymnasium, No. 48 Bayard-street, have been losers to a great extent by the operations of an adroit thief, who was in the habit of stealing watches, money and clothing from the dressing-rooms. THOMAS CORBETT, a young man who has frequently visited the place, but who had never joined the gymnasium, was suspected of being the depredator, but he managed his movements so skillfully that none of the thefts were ever fixed upon him. On Friday evening, however, a watch worth $50, was stolen from Mr. JOHN J. SHAW, one of the pupils, and it was determined to take CORBETT into custody. He was arrested by Officer GOLDEN, of the Sixth Ward, and at first he denied his guilt, but after spending some time in prison, he confessed that he had, within a few months, robbed the gymnasium students of property valued at $1,500. A large part of the money that he thus realized he expended in the purchase of presents to bestow upon a respectable young lady in Brooklyn, to whom he had engaged himself in marriage, and she, upon hearing of his roguery, made such restitution as was in her power. A quantity of pawn-tickets, representing some of the stolen watches, was found at the prisoner's boarding-house, No. 240 Broome-street, and the timepieces were recovered. Among the losers were WM.J. HUCHES, of No. 49 Wall-street, who had a watch and chain worth $70 stolen; WM.G. BELL, of No. 13 Rutgers-street, lost $130 in cash; RODNEY N.
