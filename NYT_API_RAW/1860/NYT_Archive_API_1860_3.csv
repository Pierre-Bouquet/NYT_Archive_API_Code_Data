"LECTURE BY MR. WH. CURTIS NOYES.--Mr. NOYES del vered his second lecture to the students of Columbia College Law School and a crowded audidience, upon ""Criminal Jurisprudence in America before the Revolution,"" on Tuesday evening.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/01/archives/city-intelligence.html,,"LECTURE BY MR. WH. CURTIS NOYES.--Mr. NOYES del vered his second lecture to the students of Columbia College Law School and a crowded audidience, upon ""Criminal Jurisprudence in America before the Revolution,"" on Tuesday evening. The lecture was mainly devoted to the State of the [???] law in England before our Revolution, and the principles of law which the Colonists brought with them. After giving a sketch of the early writ of habeas corpus and the act of CHARLES II., he proceeded to speak of the writ ""de homino replegiando,"" or the writ for replevying a man. This was in the nature of a private writ, and was applicable when an individual was illegally imprisoned by a private person, while habeas corpus properly appertained to an unlawful imprisonment by public authority. The question whether a man was a slave, could be tried by a jury through the medium of this writ. A husband could also in this way claim the custody of his wife. The lecture spoke of a case in his own early practice, in which he had successfully used the writ for this purpose. The proceeding was very dilatory and technical. This remedy still exists in New-York, not having been abolished by the Code. This was originally the only mode of determining the question of Freedom and Slavery, and as such is to be held in grateful remembrance, as in some of the counties of England there were only three or four hundred free-men to forty or fifty thousand slaves. The Bill of Rights of 1688 was next noticed, and the fact that Massachusetts had secured a Bill of Rights forty years before, though not so full as the English Statute of William and Mary. The Colony bad the benefit of both. Trial by jury was spoken of, and the fines arbitrarily imposed by the judge upon jurymen for bringing in a verdict in accordance with their convictions. BUSHELL's case, reported in Vaughan's Reports and else where, established the rule that this practice was illegal and contrary to the fundamental law of England. The right to give a general verdict in criminal cases was established in 32d year of George III., chap. 60. Torture was unknown to the common or statute law of England, but existed in Scotland and other countries governed by the civil law till 150 years ago. The guillotine was in use in Scotland long before it was in France, under the seductive name of the Scottish maiden. It was fortunate for us that the law of Scotland was not brought to America. But something akin to torture prevailed in the common law, in order to extract a plea of guilty or not guilty when a prisoner was mute, (peine forte et dure.) This horrible punishment, which was graphically described, was inflicted in .Massachusetts, in the case of GILES COREY, a man of 80 years of age, tried for witchcraft. The Massachusetts Sheriff is said to have treated the prisoner most barbarously. This is believed to have been the only case in which this punishment was inflicted in America. New-York had the honor of establishing the humane rule, in 1788, that muteness was to be regarded as a plea of not guilty, while in England the rule was adopted in 1772, that muteness was equivalent to a plea of guilty. Peine forte et dure was not formally abolished in England till 1828. This lecture was evidently listened to by the audience with great gratification. The course is to be continued.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38250ff4-1b95-5b4c-8656-636f939efcf6,2669,nyt://article/38250ff4-1b95-5b4c-8656-636f939efcf6,

Although past eighty-six, he seems vigorous still, conversing in his own eloquent way of times past and gone, when he was young. To hear him describe the first Napoleon as he has seen him in his youth, with a face 'round and olive, like that of a Greek girl,' and to see him stand before his exquisite portrait of Petrarch's Laura, discoursing all the while, as one would suppose the author of Imaginary Conversations ought to discourse, on such a subject, you will allow must hare been a great treat. The old man, with silver beard and hair, looks like one of the grand portraits he has always loved to see on his walls. I found him sitting at his writing table to-day before a splendid 'Salvator Rosa.' His collection of pictures was made with brains that knew how to choose from the world's treasury of art. Among his gems there hangs an Allori worthy to be set in gold. He is at present living in Florence, with comparatively few pictures about him, but at his villa near the city there are three or four hundred fine things, the collection of a long lifetime. You should hear him talk of Washington, whom, of all the sons of men that ever lived, he ranks first. Schlegel, whom he knew intimately, and of whom he tells capital stories, he places very high as a critic, giving him almost the highest niche as a commentator. He misses very much his dear old friend John kenyon, whom he loved and by whom he was beloved greatly. Mr. and Mrs. Browning are his constant correspondents from Rome, where they are spending the Winter. The world has not forgotten him, by any means, and one of the greatest privileges accorded to lovers of genius, as you may well suppose, is a visit to the sunny chambers of Walter Savage Landor.""",11,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY AND ART ITEMS.; A correspondent of the Boston Transcript writes:', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY AND ART ITEMS.; A correspondent of the Boston Transcript writes:', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38f17ad2-77f5-5dcc-b413-3b48a1ac5dc6,2091,nyt://article/38f17ad2-77f5-5dcc-b413-3b48a1ac5dc6,

Its tone is eminently dispassionate and statesmanlike, and indicates a desire to allay agitation and remove unfounded prejudice from the public mind, rather than to stimulate the zeal or arouse the enthusiasm of partisan followers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Seward's Speech."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Seward's Speech."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b39ca1a-f2ec-50e4-a2e3-777bc67e82cb,1337,nyt://article/3b39ca1a-f2ec-50e4-a2e3-777bc67e82cb,

When the special order, the Kansas Admission Bill, came up, Mr. SEWARD arose and having presented a memorial of the Kansas Legislature demanding admission, proceeded to speak on the general subject of Slavery, and its place in politics. Having reviewed the history of the question, as a conflict between Southern capital and Northern labor, he referred to the coming Presidential campaign and to the Republicans holding to the principle of preventing the, Territories, by constitutional means, from becoming houses for Slavery and Polygamy. He said the policy of the Republican Party was to stand by the freedom of speech and of the Press, the speedy improvement of the public domain by homestead laws, and to encourage mining, manufactures and internal commerce, with needful connections between the Atlantic and Pacific States. He alluded to the fact that many Southern men are not willing to see the inauguration of a Republican President because it is a sectional party, and passed on to prove that the Republican is not a sectional organization. He asked, is it easier for us to bear your sway than for you to bear ours? Is it unreasonable that for once we should alternate? He said the real principles of the Republican Party were national. He was no assailant of States. It was well and wisely arranged that the states were sovereign on the subject of Slavery within their own borders. He said JOHN BROWN and his associates acted on earnest, though fatally erroneous convictions. He pronounced the act an act of sedition and treason, and criminal to just the extent that it affected the public peace and was destructive of human life. He did not think anything serious would grow out of the oft-repeated threats to dissolve the Union. After Mr. SEWARD's speech had closed, there was a long debate, in which Messrs. DOUGLAS, DAVIS, TRUMBULL, DOOLITTLE and WIGFALL participated, when the subject was postponed till Monday. In the House, Mr. RUFFIN having succeeded in causing the journal of Monday to be amended, by the insertion of his vote for Mr. GLOSSBRENNER as Printer, the Speaker declared the election of Mr. FORD invalid; and an attempt of the Republicans to postpone action for the present failing, another vote was taken without result, and the subject laid aside. There was an immediate fight of members to the Senate Chamber, to hear the Senator from New-York. The remnant, twelve in number, was edified by a discourse from Mr. REAGAN, of Texas, in defence of Southern institutions.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Pennsylvania', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Ships and Shipping', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4fefd27f-b5db-564c-b135-0c457abae00b,1831,nyt://article/4fefd27f-b5db-564c-b135-0c457abae00b,

FORD, so fairly elected printer to the House of Representatives, has been unseated and sent about his business by that merciless RUFFIN Of the Carolinas. Not that we have any special interest in the baffled man; but then his transient success terminated, as it seemed, a condition of affairs in the House which no rightly-judging man can desire to see renewed. The name of that audacious individual who so far forgot the loyal respect due to national legislators as to christen Congress a bear-garden, has escaped us. But whatever claims he may have had to greatness in other respects, that he well knew how to appreciate the propriety of epithets has often been demonstrated by the acts of Congressmen, and in a special manner by this growling fight over the printer. No political principles are at stake in the choice; it is solely a strife for spoils, and the eagerness of each party to secure the loaf for itself, has begotten a paltry squabble, in which various members, we grieve to say, forget that they are elected to forward the interests of the public, and seem bent only on securing the public plunder for their own party. So dominant were the selfish passions, that even when the contest was apparently ended, it was difficult for some time to proceed with important business, on account of personal bickerings and fretful complaints at newspaper paragraphs. If VAN AMBURGH's collection is noisy and full of fight, it is -- with the occasional exception of the elephant, ultra for the abolition of his own confinement -- properly restrained. In the national bear-garden, however, all restraints and checks of animal ferocity are scouted, and the proposition presented by a member from this State, to provide for the better protection of personal safety in the District of Columbia, is ignored without a hearing, though the necessity of its adoption was probably corroborated by the tell-tale revolvers peering from the numerous Representative pockets. The truth is, the real quadrupedal bears would doubtless enjoy the sympathy of the public in an attempt to imitate their biped types so far as to ""rise to a question of privilege,"" and utter with ursine fervor their protest against a comparison which likens them to fellow-creatures which no muzzle can restrain from mischief save that of a Colt or Derringer.

"Sir WILLIAM NAPIER, K.C.B., whose death is announced by the Edinburgh, was born at Castletown, in Ireland, in 1785. His father was Colonel the Honorable GEORGE NAPIER, and his mother the celebrated SARAH LENNOX, daughter of the second Duke of RICHMOND. When but fifteen years of age, Sir WILLIAM entered the army. He served at the siege of Copenhagen, followed Sir JOHN MOORE to the Spanish Peninsula in 1808, and was in command of the Forty-third Regiment at Salamanca, Neville, and Nice. The wounds which he received in the battles in which he was engaged, were emphatic proof of his daring and bravery as a soldier. For six years, from 1842 to 1848, when he was created a Military Knight, and became Colonel of the Twenty-seventh Regiment, Sir WILLIAM was Governor of Guernsey.

A singular race they certainty are, in aims, ingenuity, perseverance and abiquity. They all possess these qualities in common, from the little girl in summer, whose [???] compass, ranging from the radical stress on the penult to the final squeal on the ultimate of ""red-ish-i-e-i-s,"" might be the song of a Lind or a Patti -- to the hogshead-sized roar of ""Fine Princes' Bay Oysters,"" that rattle the shutters in narrow streets like a Winter blast. Between the two extremes, the costermongers' cries range in infinite variety, yet always with an element of sameness. All seem charged to the mouth with murderous malice against the purity of the English tongue. True disciples of HORNE TOOKE they are, whose famous answer, to the question how far a man might proceed in murdering the King's English without being hung for treason -- ""I don't know; lam trying"" -- seems to be the constant guide of their utterance. Oftenest their cry is like the inarticulate bray of beasts, though sometimes it gives utterance to absurdities; as when the newsboy cries -- ""STEPHEN A. BRANCH, one saint"" -- a character which even the distinguished ""martyr"" would not claim for himself. And if their cries are varied, the merchandise they vend is more so. In the lower business streets they supply fasting mouths with refreshment, in that great torrid zone of hunger which belts the day between the morning and evening meal that our long drawn out City affords its busy sons. Beneath booths, on sidewalk tables, and from baskets suspended from the neck, every variety of food is catered and prepared, even to the last stage of buttering and sugaring, for the stirring, busy throng. [???]etive New-York can't always stop to eat its lunch, but walks and eats at once. Mingled in monger medley with apple-stands and candy tables, are boxes of stereoscopic views, blank-books, pocket cutlery, and volumes from nobody's ""great library,"" whereof ""you may take your choice for fifty cents,"" and enjoy the pleasing certainty of having bestowed your money in unrequited charity.

Beacon lighting also necessitates exposure to night air, and loss of sleep. Besides which, as a means of diffusing intelligence it is clumsy and inefficient, as compared with the electric telegraph, which is in every respect a useful invention for such purposes. We advise Mr. ASHMORE to try it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Real Crisis.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Real Crisis.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87b2eac6-18ea-550e-9d81-760fae11a8c3,353,nyt://article/87b2eac6-18ea-550e-9d81-760fae11a8c3,

I have mourned over this error in occasional determinations with exceeding sorrow -- longing to see every child and youth in the Church in actual, constant connection with blessings which I have been perfectly convinced could elsewhere never be supplied. I would entreat Christian parents to feel and to consider rightly upon this subject; and while in their prayers and efforts at home and in secret, they seek for the highest spiritual welfare of their children, to perceive and acknowledge how blessed and valuable is that helpful agency which the good providence of God has prepared for their aid and success in the Sunday-school.""",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RELIGIOUS.; Notices of Religious Movements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RELIGIOUS.; Notices of Religious Movements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7461c83-d9f0-53e5-89f1-f0a5c5d03ea6,1795,nyt://article/c7461c83-d9f0-53e5-89f1-f0a5c5d03ea6,

The question of Savoyard annexation had been mooted in the House of Commons, where Lord JoHN RUSSELL had answered in terms, which only found a sensible interpretation, in a paragraph printed in the semi-official Post of the following morning. It was therein stated, that with the annexation of Central Italy to Piedmont it was no other than proper that Savoy and Nice should assume their geographical affinity with France; but that the French Government had expressed its willingness to refer the subject to the judgment of the Great Powers. When interrogated in regard to the proposed measure of ministerial reform, Lord JOHN RUSSELL announced that March 1 had been fixed upon for the introduction of the bill. He had also responded obscurely to an inquiry touching American coastwise navigation, as affecting the transhipment of goods at Panama. Sir WILLIAM NAPIER, the historian, was buried with unusual honors on the 17th ult. The news from the Continent embraces nothing more important than the circular reply of the French Foreign Minister, M. DE THOUVENEL, to the encyclical letter of the Pope. This paper reviews with excellent skill the various defects in the Papal administration, and indicates their tendency to impair the spiritual authority and efficacy of the head of the Church; and shows that while it might have been possible, when his Holmess was first advised to mitigate his rule in the Romagna, to have saved that portion of his States, it is now too late to do so. The reply, as well as a second document of similar purport, transmitted. directly to Rome, has won great applause for the new Secretary. There is nothing of moment from the seat of war in Morocco. Italy remains tranquil, awaiting the result of the election in the central provinces. Rumors to the effect that a note of M. DE THOUVENEL had been sent to Vienna, urging upon that Government the fulfillment of its engagements in reference to ameliorations to be introduced into the administration of Venetia, were circulated.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dfdf928-7473-59bc-aceb-4ca7bc19a298,1214,nyt://article/4dfdf928-7473-59bc-aceb-4ca7bc19a298,

The coffin was of plain oak, uncovered, and without even a nail to relieve its simplicity, and no sable plumes nodded above the hearse which bore it.

The procession left Scinde  House, at Clapham, in the vicinity of the metropolis, at 11 o'clock, and arrived at the cemetery a little after noon. The day was remarkably fine, but few strangers were assembled, and the whole number present, the mourners included, did not probably exceed fifty. The grave was an ordinary one, near the church, which is situated on the most elevated portion of the grounds; and no sermon was preached.

An immediate rush was made for the roof by the women and children living in the upper part of the house, where, finding no means of escape, they stood scream ing frantically for help, while many of those in the lower floor ran into the street, without waiting to inqu???e if there was cause for the panic. An investigation finally resulted in the discovery of smoke issuing from the back apartments on the third floor, occupied by JOHN G. FISHER, a German tailor. The door of the room had been locked, but it was at once broken open and a pile of furniture, papers, books, and other inflammable stuff, that had been saturated with alcohol, was found in flames. The fire was speedily extinguished with trifling damage, and as nothing was seen of FISHER, it was at first supposed that he had escaped. On looking into the adjoining room, however, the body of the man was discovered, suspended from the bars of a ventilator by a thin cord fastened to his neck. He was quite dead, but life could not have been long extinct. Coroner JACKMAN was summoned to hold an inquest, at which it appeared that deceased had resided in the same house over seven years, but had refused to hold any communication whatever with his neighbors He is represented to have been exceedingly morose in manner, not permitting even his brother, who resides in the neighborhood, to visit him. It the children in the house made a noise, it is said that he would rave with anger, and on one occasion, having caught in the hallway a little girl who had thus offended him, he set fire to her hair, burning her seriously. He was a widower, 35 years of age, and, by ??? and industry, had amassed several hundred dollars. It is supposed that he was insane when he committed his double crime, and a verdict of suicide by hanging was rendered.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CORONERS' INQUESTS.; A TAILOR ATTEMPTS TO BURN A BUILDING AND AFTERWARDS HANGS HIMSELF.

"-- Two steamers left this port yesterday for Aspinwall with the California passengers and mails -- the Baltic, Capt. A.G. GRAY, from the old Collins pier, foot of Canal-street, at 4 o'clock P.M., having been detained by low water, which left the steamer aground at the usual hour for her departure, and the Vanderbilt steamer Ariel, from the Warren-street pier. Each carried a fair complement of passengers, the popularity of the Baltic securing much the larger share. The price of passage having been increased on both steamers by mutual agreement, there was a corresponding decrease in the demand for tickets, and a total absence of the bustle and excitement which have been observable heretofore on the departure of these steamers.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/06/archives/present-aspect-of-the-mclane-treaty.html,,"From the Mexican accounts to-day, via NewYork, there are symptoms that the Liberal Party are regaining a little strength. Should this change in their prospect continue, it will increase the chances of the American treaty being ratified by the Senate at Washington, and of a vote being obtained from the Lower House for the 800,000 essential to its fulfillment. As Congress, however, has not yet organized, and there are only four months of the session remaining, great doubts may be entertained of any definitive settlement. As far as the foreign creditors are concerned, the uncertainly, perhaps, need cause little regret. When JUAREZ held sufficient power to afford other Governments some reasons which they might consider valid for dealing with him as the representative of the Mexican people, and when it was clearly believed that Mr. BUCHANAN would hold to his pledge that no purchases should be made from Mexico by the United States without due stipulations on behalf of the foreign bondli???ers there was good ground to regard the McLan??? treaty with favor. But the revelations since made have been calculated to excite dissatisfaction. It has been boldly avowed that of the �800,000 now proposed to be paid to JUAREZ �400,000 is to be returned to the United States in the shape of indemnities to American citizens, and that the whole of the remainder is to be appropriated by the Mexicans. And this is not all. The same organs congratulate the American people that the contemplated surrender of rights of way by Mexico to the United States will preclude any necessity for the American Government to commit themselves to the task of restoring order in Mexico generally, or indeed of taking any steps that would involve liabilities on their part either to the Mexican Government or to foreign nations. The power of transit and the command of eligible ports on the Atlantic and Pacific will, it is averred, fulfill every want that the American people can for the present entertain. Having military sway over these points, they can extend their operations at pleasure, and avow or disavow them as may be found expedient. ""Sonora,"" it is remarked, ""separated from the rest of Mexico by our transit line, can be occupied from California without trouble, and that province, from its mining wealth, is the one to be desired, while the southern districts, with their factions and their involvements, would bring nothing but annoyance."" This doctrine would leave the Mexicans still to tear themselves to pieces, and to dishonor all their foreign obligations on the plea that they have no responsible Government. The argument resorted to in favor of the breach of faith with regard to the �800,000 is, that the purchase of rights of way is not a purchase of ""territory,"" and that Mr. BUCHARAN's promise was intended only in the latter sense. If England were to sell to the Emperor of Russia the right of way from the Punjab to Calcutta, the Americans would probably question the logic that might pretend she had not parted with territory. Mexico must have sold something, because the Americans are not people to pay for an idea, and she has nothing to sell, except by consent of her creators. The bondholder have a claim on all the rove???ues of Mexico, and the �800,000 now to accrue is revenue of some land, either ordinary or extraordinary. Moreover, the retention of the �400,000 to meet the demands of American citizens, while the prior claims of British. French and Dutch citizens are disregarded, would stamp the whole arrangement as one of the most unjust upon record. At the same time it must be repeated that, although the friends of Mr. BUCHANAN have not disowned the intentions thus publicly attributed to his Cabinet, they have not formally admitted them. There is, consequently, room to hope that the respectable policy originally set forth by those who were entitled to express his views in this country, will yet be adhered to even in the face of popular clamor.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Present Aspect of the McLane Treaty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Present Aspect of the McLane Treaty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times City Article, Feb. 15', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Feb', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2f1191c-10be-5829-9488-e30f57ea8752,668,nyt://article/e2f1191c-10be-5829-9488-e30f57ea8752,

"Fire Companies furnish a great safety valve through which much of the superfluous element of noise and riot escape, that otherwise might disturb the public peace even more seriously than the firemen themselves do. Your real fireman is a man of iron bones and India-rubber muscles, whose altar is his ""tub,"" who snuffs the scent of smoke on the breeze from far, and on the instant becomes unconscious of every duty he owes to the world but that of reaching the conflagration with his machine in advance of any rival company.

It seems that Mr. LONGWORTH, of Cincinnati, has sent some baskets of his famous Catawba wine to our Minister at the Court of St. James for his private use, accompanying them with a liberal supply of samples, to be distributed by him to those who could appreciate it and aid in its circulation. This Mr. DALLAS declines to do, saying that he ""cannot reconcile the duties of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States with those of a commission merchant."" Such a reply, the Tribune asserts, Mr. LAWRENCE when Minister at the same Court would never have made. On the contrary, ""not only Mr. LAWRENCE, but Mrs. LAWRENCE and Mr. BIGELOW LAWRENCE, and all attached to the Embassy, would have been more than happy to undertake the affair, which would have made quite a family piece of business."" The editor accounts for this difference of the two men by the fact that, although the latter did not, in his youth, attend ""for a single term a dancing school,"" and the former ""was probably introduced to the mysteries of pigeon wing at a tender age,"" ""Mr. GEORGE DALLAS is not a gentleman, and Mr. LAWRENCE was one.

The first thing tried was the canvas bag, which was similar to that used at a former trial at the City Hall, and which was then fully described. Mounting to the third story by means of their portable ladders, this instrument was hauled up by means of a cord, which was dropped for the purpose, and fastened to one of the open windows. One person after another, both adults and children, was then placed within its open mouth, and safely descended through It to the street, the lower end being held out at an angle which gradually retarded their velocity until they reached the ground. Various articles of furniture were also sent down in the same way without injury. The second were the story-ladders, strongly but lightly built, with a large curved hook at one end. Standing on the ground these ladders were raised by one man, who placed the hook over the window-sill of the second-story. He then mounted it, closely followed by one or two comrades, each having a strong canvas belt around his waist, attached to which, by a hook, was a roll of stout cord. While one held on to his companion by the belt to prevent his fall, the same ladder was instantly transferred to the third story, to which the two again mounted, entering the window, where they were supposed to be ready to rescue any person whose escape had been cut off, and pass him unharmed to the street by means of the canvas bag or he ladders.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fire-Escape Apparatus.; EXHIBITION OF VARIOUS METHODS OF SAVING LIFE AT FIRES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fire-Escape Apparatus.; EXHIBITION OF VARIOUS METHODS OF SAVING LIFE AT FIRES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a3c90ad-0b2b-572f-b1c3-a0e251f766e0,830,nyt://article/6a3c90ad-0b2b-572f-b1c3-a0e251f766e0,

In the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth avenues, and in some of the cross streets, piles of blocks for the Belgian pavement are accumulating, ready to be laid as soon as permission arrives from head-quarters. It is amusing, and possibly suggestive, to observe the different manner in which the stone is disposed of, according to the locality. In the Sixth-avenue, as in the Fourth, inhabited, it is to be presumed, only by the profanum vulgus, the blocks are discharged at the side of the carriage-way, where they have been left for weeks to collect the dirt and dust, and impede the current of water through the gutters, thus affording the finest facility for the filth to accumulate. In the Fifth-avenue, they are not only carefully but neatly piled in small, compact parcels, on the edge of the sidewalk, not at all impeding pedestrianism, even for crinoline, and leaving the entire width of the avenue free for the vehicles belonging to the monde who throng it. It is to be regretted that so much valuable time has been lost during the late pleasant weather, when our streets and avenues so much need repairing; but we learn from high authority that if any citizen of acknowledged responsibility will come forward and enter into proper bonds for a continuance of the present state of the weather, the high contracting powers will authorize their subjects to commence immediate operations.

It is no doubt necessary when a new building goes up, to occupy for some  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/08/archives/street-obstructions.html,,"What title half the length of Broadway has to any other appellation than that of a rubbish yard, it is difficult to understand. It is no doubt necessary when a new building goes up, to occupy for some time the street in front for depositing building materials. But who can explain the necessity of leaving the regulation of the sidewalk until after every nail in the house has been driven? Yet this is the course that builders on Broadway almost universally pursue. If a new house is to be erected, first the sidewalk is torn up, as an earnest of the builder's intentions; and there it remains, an impassable barrier to the current of public travel, till the house is finished and furnished even to the last nail and serew. The Reade-street widening operations have just broken out into Broadway, and among the earliest results is the commencement of an Egyptian pyramid of bricks across the sidewalk and half the street. If the obstruction were likely to be only temporary, it might be endurable in view of the advantages that will result from the widening of the cross streets. But an accumulation of this sort once begun is a chronic ill, so far as the present generation is concerned. Some of those new living, when in coming years they pass this spot, may say to their children's sons, reviving the memories of their youth, I remember when over the very piace where this huge pile now stands ran a busy thoroughfare, crowded with an active throng, a condition of things which possibly the youngest of his listoners may live to see renewed. If the evil occurread in but a single place, it might be proper to require builders to clear the sidewalk within a reasonable time after its first obstruction. But with a renewal of the nuisance in almost every block, and every week, the public passage is so seriously impeded as to render it highly necessary that permission should be extended to erect new buildings only on condition of continuing the obstruction the shortest possible time.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Street Obstructions.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Street Obstructions.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/475c3fae-cd96-58a9-b99d-74101a9fab65,347,nyt://article/475c3fae-cd96-58a9-b99d-74101a9fab65,

T.L. BRECKENRIDGE, of Indiana, before the Christian Young Men's Lyceum, at the First Baptist Church in Broome-street. After repudiating the announcement in the Tribune of Tuesday, that those who went to hear him would hear the last lecture of the season he proceeded to say that some twenty years ago', while on a horseback journey from Zanesville, ohio, to Marietta he fell in with a gentleman of education, who claimed to be also a philosopher. The conversation turning upon religious subjects, his companion astonished him by the assertion that there were no thoughts in the Bible calculated to make a man, and that TOM PAINE was the greatest man that ever lived. He replied that he professed to be a Christian, and to believe in the Bible. His friend retorted by repeating his assertion that there were no thoughts in the Bible, and by asking whether it was not reasonable that God, if he intended to give a revelation to man, would not present it in such form that every man could understand it. To this question he was obliged then, to give an affirmative answer; but since that time he had learned something, and he now believed that there was not a thought of any human creature but what was in the Bible. Much of it was hard to understand, and that, to his mind, was the best proof of its authenticity and divinity. After reading PAINE or VOLTAIRE, one could understand all that the writer understood, but not so with the Bible. The speaker then proceeded to specify a large variety of things contained in the Bible, that were hard to be understood, such for instance as the existence of God, his attributes, purposes and decrees; the creation of matter, the Trinity of the Godhead, the regeneration of the human soul, the resurrection of the body, &c., &c. � all of them hard to be understood, but none the less true. We were not asked to understand these things, but to believe them. Many anecdotes were related illustrative of his argument, one of which relating to DANIEL WEBSTER was as follows: A disbeliever lin Divine Revelation once addressed him saying ""Mr. WEBSTER, you are a man of too much intellect to believe that one is three, or three is one."" ""Sir,"" said Mr. WEBSTER, ""the Bible teaches me that there are three persons in the Godhead, and I am not vain enough to profess to understand the mathematics of Heaven."" The speaker closed by saying that many of his hearers might be disposed to ask why he had made a public lecture approach so near to a sermon. He would tell them why: Public lectures, in his opinion, had become a nuisance, a disgrace, and a curse; and the reason they had become so was because they had too too often trampled upon the sacred precincts of the Word of God. He believed in science, in education, and in the diffusion of knowledge, � but it must all be based upon the word of God; if not, it was useless, and worse than useless � it was untrue.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88980cb1-7ad0-5b5f-8caf-f134385a5a07,2182,nyt://article/88980cb1-7ad0-5b5f-8caf-f134385a5a07,

He, however, successfully eluded their search until yesterday afternoon, when Detective Eustace surprised him at his house, corner of Eighth-avenue and Thirty-seventh-street, and managed to secure his arrest. The prisoner was brought down to head-quarters, where numbers of sporting men soon congregated to sympathize with him and devise means for his release. Finally Judge RUSSELL happened to come in, by chance of course, and was prevailed upon, at the earnest solicitation of Kelly's friends, to open Court and admit the prisoner to bail. The accommodating Judge fixed the surety at $l,000 for Kelly's eppearance, on Monday next, before the Court at Buffalo, and Peter Hamill, of No. 387 East Tenth-street, became his bondsman. Other devotees of the ring have also been indicted by the Buffalo authorities for participating in the same fight, and some of them, including John Morissey and Tom O'Donnel, have been arrested, tried and fined in sums of $200 and $300 upon conviction of the offence.

We care not who succeeds Mr. PILSBURY in the post, unless this is done the Police will never be what it ought to be. It is as ridiculous to attempt to govern it by the direct orders of three persons as it would be to command an army by the same means. The supreme power; from which there should be no appeal, must be lodged in the hands of some one man. To giving it to the Mayor, as under the old system, there is the standing and insurmountable objection that the Mayor is generally a professional politican, occupied during the whole of his official term either in intriguing for reflection or for some other species of political advancement. To expect him, under such circumstances, in a City like New-York, to religiously abstain from all at tempts to use a body of 2,000 men for the ad vancement of his own ends, is to expect him to be a much nobler animal than any that has yet figured on the political stage, in this part of the world at least. The commanding officer of such a police as New-York is entitled to have should be well paid and hold his office during good behavior. He should have no hopes or fears outside the line of his duty, and he should be removed after trial and conviction for any interference, direct or indirect, in politics; and his control over the men should be similar to that exercised over a regiment of the line by its Colonel.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Police System.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Police System.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dcb6ca9-b566-53e3-93ca-17132b849d1c,374,nyt://article/4dcb6ca9-b566-53e3-93ca-17132b849d1c,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/09/archives/mob-law-in-london.html,,"If there be one thing upon which our British kinsfolk pride themselves more particularly than upon another, it is the innate reverence which is supposed to be felt by every well-constituted British mind at once for the majesty of the law and for the sanctity of private rights. Bland and persuasive British publicists do not hesitate to assure the world, whenever Spain winces at the sight of the meteor flag floating from the Rook of Gibraltar, or the isles of Greece, ""where burning SAPPHO loved and sung,"" lift up their Phil-Hellenic outcry against the protecting Lion, that the freedom of the seas would never be safe for a moment if England were not its absolute mistress; and that the great objection which Englishmen feel to the increase of the maritime power of other nations is founded upon their disinterested conviction that no other people in Christendom can be trusted to rule the waves on principles of universal equity. Political philosophers, reasoning in the classic shades of the Whig ""Athenaeum"" and the Tory ""Carlton,"" upon the secrets of Government, are continually lost in amazement over the fact that countries like the United States should continue to preserve even the semblance of civilization, surrendered over as they are to the passions of the populace, and the fickle impulses of the vulgar mind, with no ballast of solid personal privileges or venerable vested wrongs, grown almost rights by the sheer force of time and habit. It is not astonishing, then, that publicists and philoso-phers both should be slightly staggered � not to say confounded � whenever a sudden turn in the wheel of the national fortune brings them face to face with something merely human and imperfect in the constitution of British society. Just as Walcheren calamities, Crimean blunders, Chinese catastrophes, Great Eastern failures sorely try the true Briton's faith in the immeasurable superiority of the ""practical Anglo-Saxon "" over less favored races of men in dealing with the details and facts of life, so must Bristol mobs and Gordon riots sharply test his equally solemn faith in the lawabiding genius of his people. There is, therefore, nothing very surprising in the down-right dead-lock to which the Home Administration of England has just been brought by the orgies of a crew of bacchanalian Protestants in the heart of the great metropolis. Things on the whole run so smoothly in London between the authorities and the people, the law gets itself executed in the main so steadily and unconcernedly, that when the Home Secretary, and the Commissioner of the Police, and the Magistrates, un-expectedly find themselves confronted with a horde of howling rowdies shouting out their husky anathemas against golden candlesticks, green silk chasubles, intoned prayers, and the apparatus of Puseyism generally, crowding into churches where the rites of unpopular clerical craze are carried on, singing comic songs during divine service, plucking choristers by the coat-tail, and pelting parsons with peas-it is the most natural thing in life that the dignitaries of order should be brought up, in the slang of the road, ""all standing."" Yet we of New-York who do duty so constantly in the British Press as the model ""bad boys"" of Christendom, and who have gradually wrought ourselves up to the belief that ours is a kind of Topsy among cities, ""so wicked"" that it is useless for us to try to mend our ways, may be forgiven for finding a mild satisfaction in the discomfiture and humiliation of our stately cousins, who are so very liberal of their moral lectures whenever our patriotic youth undertake to criticise a foreign actor with brickbats in Astor-place, or to settle a political difference with revolvers over a Dead Rabbit barricade.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mob Law in London.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mob Law in London.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'CHURCH OF ENGLAND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b82d68bd-e9de-5423-8c54-187fb442de77,1593,nyt://article/b82d68bd-e9de-5423-8c54-187fb442de77,

This Company proposes to carry a single passenger any distance in this City within the limits bounded by the North and East Rivers and Forty-second-street, for twenty-five cents; each additional passenger to pay fifteen cents. The same rates of fare are to rule in Brooklyn, and transfer tickets will be issued so that one paying fifty cents on this side of the river may take a cab belonging to the Company in Brooklyn, and be carried immediately, and without added charge, to his destination. These rates are so low when compared with the extortionate prices which the law permits hackdrivers in general to ask for their services, that a doubt arises as to whether they would be remunerative. The doubt, however, hardly constitutes a ground of objection to the organization of the company, and if Mr. A.A. MYERS, who introduced the bill, will only give it a gentle shake occasionally, that it may not slumber too soundly on the Speaker's table, steady its feeble steps until it manages to totter through the lower House, and then consign it to the mercy of some gentle Senator, who shall ultimately send us the bantling for further training, he will secure the gratitude of a long suffering community.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Plea for Cabs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Plea for Cabs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d87f9553-4f0c-58c1-acc4-bdace58e4f4a,747,nyt://article/d87f9553-4f0c-58c1-acc4-bdace58e4f4a,

I never before found in him so much warmth of expression, contirming all that you have heard from me as to the value he attached to the English alliance, which is, and has ever been, the corner-stone of his political aspirations. I believe the information I gave him on many subjects will essentially help the good work, which progresses in spite of all opposition, and which will be a security of peace and mutual prosperity, such as nothing but an alliance of common interests could ever afford. I was invited to dine with the society of political economists, which consists of about a hundred members who have been the apostles of free trade, among whom are the soundest and most influential statesmen of France. They favored me with marked attention while, at their request, I drew a sketch of the beneficent influences of emancipated commerce upon our social and political condition; in truth, we are entering upon a great era which has been ushered in by the unflinching courage of a great man, and I venture to hope that as all liberties are brothers and sisters.

If the day should be fine there will be a gathering such as is seldon witnessed even in Fourteenth-street. And the occasion really justifies the enthusiasm that prevails concerning it. In the first place the object is a laudable one, and appeals to the kindly sympathies of every one who can appreciate the miseries that sudden death brings to a family of unprovided little ones; in the second place, the entertainments are of the most varied and extraordinary character; in the third place, the price of admission is put at the very low standard of fifty cents. The Matinee opens with the comedy of ""Everybody's Friend,"" performed by all the prominent members of Mr. WALLACK'S admirable company; after this comes the Protean piece called ""In and Out of Place,"" with Mr. and Mrs. BARNEY WILLIAMS; then the Musical Extravaganza of ""Jenny Lind,"" with Mrs. JOHN WOOD, Mr. JEFFERSON, Mr. DAVENPORT, and other members of the Winter Garden Company. These pieces, it will be perceived, embrace the names of nearly all the dramatic celebrities now in the city. The Festival concludes with a miscellaneous soiree, commencing (at 8 o'clock) with the 4th act of ""I Trovatore,"" in which Mme. ALBERTINI, Signor BEAU CARDS, Mme. D'ORMY, and Signor ARDAVANI will sustain the principal roles. Signor MUZIO conducts the orchestra. After the opera there will be the first pait of a concert, in which Mrs. C.M. BRINCKERHOFF Mr. S.B.

GRAEVER-JOHNSON will assist; then an act from the ""School for Scaotdal,"" with Mr. BLAKE as Sir Peter, Mr. JORDAN as Charles Surface, and Mrs. KATE BUCK-LAND as Lady Teazle. The famous screen scene will be given. This will be followed by the second part of the concert, in which Mr. SAAR, Mr. COOK, and Mr. HENRY DRAPER will assist.

It is free, however, from the heat and passion which sometimes characterize works of its class, and so far as its tone and temper are concerned, is eminently candid and judicial. The author is a lawyer of considerable distinction, and has filled various public positions of trust and responsibility. He was trained a Baptist, and became a member of that Church in 1840. His first impressions in favor of the Catholic Church were received while attending High Mass as spectator in 1843, at Fort Vancouver, where he was temporarily located. The fervor and devotion of the worshippers and the character of the service touched him profoundly, and directed his studies to an inquiry into the validity of the claims of the Catholic Church to be the only true form of Christian society. He first read the discussion between CAMPBELL and PURCELL, and was not at all satisfied with the arguments there adduced in favor of Protestantism. He resolved, therefore, to pursue the investigation for himself, which he did for about a year and a half � the result being his full conversion to the Roman Catholic faith. In this volume he sets forth at length the reasons which led him to this conclusion. The habits of a lawyer are manifest in his mode of examining testimony, and occasionally there is an appearance of technical adherence to legal rules which does, not seem quite appropriate to such a discussion. The work evinces marked ability, and will undoubtedly exert a decided influence.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PATH WHICH LED A PROTESTANT LAWYER TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PATH WHICH LED A PROTESTANT LAWYER TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'By Peter H.

It appears that Mr. Cobden, when on the point of starting for Paris, some time ago, had an interview with Lord John Russell, to whom be suggested the importance of binding England and France still more closely together by the bonds of trade and commerce. His lordship gladly took up the proposal, and the member for Rochdale proceeded to the French capital, and lost no time in placing himself in communication with M. Rouher. Mr. Cobden acted in a private capacity during these preliminary negotiations, but, as soon as the bases of a treaty were drawn up Lord Cowley, in consequence of conversations he had had with the Emperor and Count Walewski, forwarded a dispatch to Lord John Russell on the subject, in which he urged that if the proposals for a treaty were to be prosecuted, the matter ""could not be intrusted to better hands than those of Mr. Cobden."" The result was that, on the 17th of January, Lord Cowley and Mr. Cobden were appointed joint plenipotentiaries, and six days afterwards the treaty was signed. On the 31st of January, Lord John Russell conveyed to the two plenipotentiaries, ""Her Majesty's entire approval of the able and judicious manner in which they had carried to a successful issue the important negotiations for placing the commercial relations between England and France on an improved footing.""",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2fc0ec4c-fc22-57ab-b4c8-514e19adad19,4562,nyt://article/2fc0ec4c-fc22-57ab-b4c8-514e19adad19,T

MACOMB and RILEY. Mr. THADDEUS HYATT was brought to the bar of the Senate, where he replied in writing to the questions heretofore propounded to him. He took the ground, which he endeavored to sustain by numerous citations of parliamentary and legal precedents, that the Senate possesses no power to compel his attendance, and that while he might consent to answer the interrogatories of the committee, he should do so under protest. The answer occupied two hours in the reading, and was frequently interrupted by motions on both the Republican and Democratic sides, to refer the papers to a Committee. At the close, Mr. MASON moved a resolution, which was adopted, that HYATT be placed in the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms until the Committee should be ready to take his testimony. The Speaker of the House announced the Special Committees upon the Pacific Railroad, and Mr. COVODE'S Investigation into the abuse of Executive Patronage. Mr. CARTER endeavored vainly to obtain a hearing in reply to Mr. ADRAIN upon the Seventh Regiment Entertainment. Mr. GURLEY'S bill reforming the Printing coming up at a subsequent stage of the proceedings, provoked a violent discussion, in which the Democrats took a leading part, declaring that the measure had nothing reformatory in its character; that it was in fact an attempt to coerce the Senate Printer into a bargain with the Printer of the House, and to enable the latter to acquire plunder otherwise beyond his reach. The bill was finally, on motion of Mr. BARKSDALE of Mississippi, laid on the table by a vote of 98 to 65.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/593b8d9a-ca5a-5370-8951-fd7f54136460,1239,nyt://article/593b8d9a-ca5a-5370-8951-fd7f54136460,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/10/archives/a-run-through-the-departments-street-commissioners-office-office-of.html,,"Yesterday was the day appointed for the opening of the bids for the working of the Eleventh-avenue from One Hundred and Seventh to One Hundred and Forty-fourth street, and also for the building of two steam fire engines, to be placed in charge of the members of Southwark Company No. 38 and Engine Company No. 29. With reference to the Eleventh-avenue contract, to which allusion was made a day or two since, there were nine bids, ranging from $13,-719 to $21,931, and the contract has not yet been awarded, though Mr. WALKER will undoubtedly claim it, if, by some mathematical or astronomical process, he can get rid of twenty-four hours, for it is a remarkable fact that in two bids involving an amount of $14,000 (nearly) there is only a variation of seventy-five cents, and it occurs in this wise: the bid of GEO.A. BUCKINGHAM &Co., amounting to $13,719 75. In drawing up the specifications, the quantity of rock to be excavated, of earth to be carted away, and of filling, is estimated by surveyors, on whose report the specifications are drawn up. In addition to this is to be estimated the pay of an inspector at $2 per day for the time fixed on by the contractor. Messrs. BUCKINGHAM & Co. agree to complete the work in six months. Mr. WALKER does not specify any length of time, but this by usage, and as well understood by contractors, means 12 months, or 312 days, and is so construed invariably. But here come the mathematical and astronomical calculations. The year 1860 happens, thanks to his Imperial Highness NAPOLEON I, to contain 366 days, therefore Mr. BUCKINGHAM, actually gains twenty-four hours on his opponent, as there are 314 working days in this year, and thus, though the mean of his contract is seventy-five cents higher than that of Mr. WALKER, he will probably secure it by the difference in time, to which of course he is entitled, as that will reduce the inspector's pay by one day, or two dollars, making his bid the lowest by twenty-five cents. This is probably as close calculation as ever came under the observation of any offcial, and we recommend to high contracting parties who may hereafter put in bids for Corporation jobs, not to forget that every fourth year contains 366 days. The Street Commissioner, who, as every one knows, is an accomplished scholar, and a graduate with high honors at West Point, intends to devote his attention to this problem, thus singularly presented, and when we shall have received his decision, it will, we doubt not, whichever way it may tend, teach contractors to look more carefully at the almanac. The contract for building a carriage for Hose Co. No. 2, was awarded to C.E. HARTSHORN, the only bidder, and we emphasise this because the opening of the bids for the construction of the steam-engines for Nos. 38 and 29, was postponed for the reason that there was but one bidder. But � and everything has its but � Messrs. LEE & LARNED, who own the patent for the rotary-pump, which is the main feature of the steam fire engines, of course control that patent, and were about to put in a bid, but under the circumstances, and in view of the fact that they were the patentees, and of course could be the only bidders, th Street Commissioner withdrew the proposals before the hour announced for the reception of bids.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""A RUN THROUGH THE DEPARTMENTS.; STREET COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.

These sculptures are evidently the remains of the tempie of Triptolemus. Only three personages have as yet been discovered. The bas-relief, of which they form the subject, is supposed to have been the frontispiece of the temple. Ceres is bestowing on Triptolemus the grain destined to spring up in the plain of Rharius, that sacred field where the first seed was sown, and where the first fruit was gathered. Nothing can be more graceful than the figure of Triptolemus, just verging into manhood, and combining the bashfulness of youth with the determination not to shrink from the obligation of homage to the goddess, which her bounty has bestowed upon him. While extending one hand to receive the sacred deposit, he gathers up with the other the folds of his dress with a gesture so graceful and full of dignity, that every artist who beholds turns away in despair. Proserpine, meanwhile, standing behind the youth, places her hand upon his head to bestow upon him the mystical gift of genius, and completes the group.

The estate now belongs to their fair and indefatigable Association, and on Wednesday afternoon they went down from the capital to inspect their purchase. They had invited Congress to accompany them, but that patriotic and intelligent body, after making its arrangements to go, was unfortunately detained by stress of talk: ""an earnest debate,"" says one of the Washington journals, in true nautical style, ""unfortunately springing up in both Houses."" So but thirty representatives and a single Senator (possibly the bachelor Mr. CLINGMAN) were found to do honor to the occasion, to the ladies and to the Father of his Country. Conspicuous among this little band, however, we are happy to say was Mr. JOHN COCHRANK, of New-York, who appears to have been decidedly the hero of the day. Before leaving the wharf this gallant gentleman signalized himself by a successful defence of the liberty of the Press. The steamboat captain having conceived frantic ideas of his own importance, undertook to suppress the scribes of journalism, no doub[???] regarding them as very suspicious Pharisees and more than probable Sadducees. Mr. COCHRANE interfered, saved the reporters from expulsion and the Captain from a thrashing; pacified the warring parties, and so built himself, let us hope, like GODIVA, ""an everlasting name."" On the way home, after what appears to have been a cheerful kind of pic-nic, Mr. COCHRANE again came forward, and made a most affecting and appropriate speech � full of "" bated breath,"" of ""sombre thought,"" and of ""patriotic emotions."" The aim of this speech, so far as we can apprehend it, was the eminently creditable one of paying honors due to the female sex for its triumphs that day consummated over the selfishness and indifference of male America. In attaining this object, Mr. COCHRANE threw out a few rather astonishing observations. For instance, he declared that the voices of the women of America ""came up from the vast deep crying for aid,"" which fact we confess was new to us; and added the very natural remark that on hearing these submarine calls for help from drowning beauty, the fathers and brothers of the involuntary mermaids ""felt the electric spark.""

"When Mr. CONKLING, a member of the Assembly of New-York from this City, undertook, the other day, to drag the Central Park into an arena of partisan squabbles and personal conflicts, by vague and general assaults ...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/10/archives/mr-dillon-on-the-central-park.html,,"When Mr. CONKLING, a member of the Assembly of New-York from this City, undertook, the other day, to drag the Central Park into an arena of partisan squabbles and personal conflicts, by vague and general assaults upon the character and conduct of the gentlemen composing the Park Commission, we stigmatized the proceeding as utterly and indecently inconsistent with his position and his duties. The Assembly evidently took the same view of the matter, and inflicted upon the offending member the chastisement of throwing out his ""motion of inquiry,"" based on these indefinite and impertinent charges, by an overwhelming majority. Nothing has since been heard from Mr. CONKLING, but a person whose name was freely used by him at the time, and from whom he professed to have received accusations against the Commissioners, which he declined to produce, has recognized the extremely undesirable character of his own position in this matter, and attempts, in a letter which we this morning publish, to put himself right upon the record. This person, Mr. ROBERT J. DILLON, was for a short time a member of the Central Park Commission, but resigned his position and retired to private life at a time when, according to his own statement, he was convinced that a majority of the Board were violating their oaths of office and wasting the public money. That Mr. DILLON, in these circumstances, should have left the Central Park Board, is certainly to be regretted, since any intention he may have cherished of protecting the public interests against his fellow-Commissioners, could have been much more efficiently and honorably carried out had he appeared in the attitude of an active Commissioner, defending the public right, than it can be now when he occupies the always dubious position of a disappointed man, criticizing the conduct of his former colleagues. However, quit the Commission Mr. DILLON certainly did; and, as he is now simply a private citizen, he has suffered his angry enthusiasm to run away with him a little, in his imagination that the TIMES has ""charged him with a responsibility"" for anything whatsoever in connection with this matter of the Central Park at Albany. What we said was, that Mr. CONKLING, who, as a member of the Assembly, is in a position to make his statements of importance to the public, had ""foisted upon Mr. DILLON an indirect responsibility for his own insinuations."" We called not upon Mr. DILLON to produce himself, but upon Mr. CONKLING, who had evidently employed Mr. DILLON to collect and prefer charges against the Commission, to produce Mr. DILLON as his authority for ""open and specific"" accusations against this important board of public officers. Mr. CONKLING has not responded to our summons. Mr. DILLON has volunteered to do so, and ""takes the responsibility"" of a certain letter which Mr. CONKLING read in the Assembly as proceeding from his pen. To this we have no sort of objection. We trust that Mr. DILLON, like Mr. JOHN SMITH, or Mr. JABEZ BROWN, will always �take the responsibility"" of his own letters; but it exhibits a curious confusion of ideas in Mr. DILLON'S mind, that he should suppose it to be his duty to take this responsibility on the present occasion in any distinct and defiant manner before the public. The public has really no sort of concern, at present, either with Mr. DILLON or with Mr.DILLON's letters. His charges against the Commissioners of the Central Park are simply attacks made by one private citizen occupying no public post upon the character of other private citizens filling public stations of importance. The gentlemen whom he accuses of ""violating their oaths,"" and whose ""removal for malfeasance"" he therefore demands, may deal with him in their private capacity. The public can pay no attention to the matter until some officially important person shall ""take the responsibility,"" which Mr. CONKLING so completely shirked, and which Mr. DILLON, we regret to say, cannot be allowed to assume, however eagerly he may desire to do so. Thus much for the relations of Mr. DILLON with the public and with the Park. So far as the TIMES is concerned, Mr. DILLON has a right to our opinion upon the charges which he advances for our consideration. He favors us with an account of the letter which he wrote to somebody, and which Mr. CONKLING having read, declined to indorse.

"From the extensive currency which has been given to the eloquent extract from Mr. EVERETT's Dudley Observatory Oration, and like personal experiences, an impression prevails in the public mind that this bold headland, which lies directly in the path of vessels making passages to and from Europe and this country, is an unlighted rock Such is not the case. There is a fine white light exhibited on this Cape, which can be seen at a distance of 17 miles seaward from the deck of a passing ship.

"The most important incident of the past fortnight was the murder of Capt. LIONEL LAMBERT, of her Britannic Majesty's war steamer Vi[???]en. On the 8th of February, at 3 o'clock, P.M., Capt. LAMBERT was playing at billiards with some of the officers of his vessel, in the ""Hotel de Europa."" At a little past [???] he left his companions, saying that he was going to take a bath, and would meet them so as to take the 6 o'clock train to Callao. It appears that he went to the river, and must there have been attacked by several persons and foully murdered. His skull was broken in two places, the blow on the back of t he head apparently having been made by an axe or hatchet. His forehead was badly cut, and his arms and wrists were black and scarred, as if he had had a fearful struggle with his murderers. When Capt. LAMBERT was found in the river in front of the Carnal, about half a mile from where he was preparing to bathe, he had on only his pantaloons and shirt, both torn and bloody. His pantaloons were cut in various places; his vest was found near where he was undressing; his watch, finger-rings and gold shirt-buttons and any money he might have had were missing. On his person, or near where the body was discovered, was only found a closed dispatch addressed to Capt. MILLER, and an English novel. Capt. LAMBERT was only 26 years of age, and distinguished himself in the Crimean war. He was a kind-hearted, convivial man, and probably had not an enemy on the coast. His remains were interred on the 10th, in the English cemetery of Bellavista, near Callao, the cortege being swelled by the diplomatic corps, the officers of the various men-of-war and of foreign merchant-vessels in port, by all the leading British merchants in Lima and Callao, and by an immense concourse of foreign sailors and ar[???]sans. Several persons, cholos, have been arrested for the murder, but no evidence had as yet been elicited of their guilt, except that one of them had the Captain's cap in his possession. And if found and convicted unless the British Government interferes, the murderers will only be punished by a short imprisonment, and then an amnesty or revolution will set them free to do more murder. Capital punishment in Peru, where, of all countries pretending to civilization, life is less secure, has been abolished, and murderers have con[???]quently but little fear of punishment. Three distinguished foreigners have been murdered in Lima within the past two years, and nobody has yet been punished for the crimes.

On the 20th of February, Mr. DISRAELI, as the organ of the Conservatives -- who on this occasion, and not for the first time, proved themselves to merit their title only in the fashion of the Latin groves, by the destructiveness of their policy -- moved that the House of Commons should refuse to go into Committee on the Customs acts required by the new treaty with France, until it should have first considered and assented to the engagements made in that treaty. The object of this motion, which was thrown forward under the guise so captivating to the British mind, of a ""precedent"" drawn from Mr. PITT's manner of subjecting to discussion his own Commercial Treaty, negotiated with France in 1787, was simply to force upon the House a general political discussion of the political bearings of the treaty. Mr. DISRAELI and his followers, representing the most accomplished panic-mongers of Great Britain, of course expected, in the event of their success upon this issue, to evoke all manner of frightful phantoms where with to scare the nation into Anti-Gallican convulsions strong enough to topple down the Palmerston Ministry. The spectre of the annexation of Savoy -- the supposition of a sacrifice by the Treaty of the belligerent rights of England, so absolute that even in time of war with France the colliers of Newcastle and Cardiff would find themselves compelled to coal up the imperial steamers, these were the matters which Mr. DISRAELI wished to drag at once into the foreground, before the sound commercial principles embodied in the treaty, and the vast commercial benefits which it involves for the future of both countries, could have time to impress themselves profoundly upon the mind of Parliament and of the country. The notion was sufficiently astute, and quite in the usual vein of its author -- whose theory and practice of Parliamentary tactics do not, we are sorry to say, very materially differ from those which find an unfortunate degree of favor at Washington. And it was executed with not less than Mr. DISRAELI's usual courage and cunning, and more than his usual condescending charity, since he blandly assured the Government that he was convinced they had only ""inadvertently"" violated the proprieties of Parliament, and that they might therefore accept his motion ""with honor and with dignity;"" which was as much as to say that he would not think of forcing them to resign, because, they had tripped on a question of precedent and form.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Napoleon Treaty in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Napoleon Treaty in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/537ebbad-8107-5733-8ae0-a96acc2f8470,896,nyt://article/537ebbad-8107-5733-8ae0-a96acc2f8470,

There seems to be no other assignable cause for this lame consummation than that CASTILLA found he had undertaken a task he was not equal to, and, therefore, backed out in as decent a manner as he could under cover of the cringing concession on paper made by FRANCO. On his departure, CASTILLA issued the usual bombastic bulletins to his army, in which he praises them for their gallant conduct in the occupation of the suburbs of Guayaquil, and finally of Guayaquil itself, as if torrents of blood had flown instead of the rivulets of champagne, in which FRANOO drowned the memory of his treason in peaceably admitting him to take his quarters in the town.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ECUADOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ECUADOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a66f3296-0662-50fa-b023-758a9d44d498,350,nyt://article/a66f3296-0662-50fa-b023-758a9d44d498,

He spoke of the wide field lately opened up in the Chinese Empire for missionary labor, and promise of a rich harvest to the patient and energetic laborer. The Church of Rome bad been there 200 years, and by a clause in the late treaty, inserted through the influence of France, annulling all former edicts against Christianity, that church would come in possession of immense wealth, by regaining possession of property formerly confiscated, thereby giving them an immense advantage over other sects; yet the Protestants had the advantage of them in this -- that they were new comers, not like the Catholics, objects of suspicion, and their open and above-board mode of doing business was much more congenial to the Chinese character; for if there was anything that the Chinese abhorred more than another, it was secrecy. For this cause they detested the Jesuits. He gave a flattering account of the success of the Methodist Mission at Foo-Chow, the central field of their labors, and said that during the past two years he had baptised sixty-two converts, all of whom were able to give a reason for the faith that was in them.

"The Boston Traveller records the death of Deacon Ebenezer Clapp, a direct descendant in the fourth generation of the Pilgrim stock. He died at Dorchester, Mass., of old age, a few days since. The Traveller says: ""He was born on the 25th of August, 1771, and was a son of Noah Clapp, who graduated at Harvard in 1735, and was for forty-one years town clerk of Dorchester. His grandfather, Deacon Jonathan Clapp, was born in 1673, and was the son of Nathaniel Clapp, born in 1640. Nathaniel was the son of Nicholas Clapp, one of the first settlers in this ancient town. Thus the recently deceased gentlemen was only the fourth generation from the first settlers, and probably was the last person of that generation.

We can purchase ""Canton teas"" in the market, where the proportion of genuine tea plant leaves to other shrubs and herbs and leaves, is about as 1 to 10.

"THE VICTIM OF A WINDFALL. -- WILLLIAM BROWN, a fruit-peddler, residing at No. 37 Park-street, was apprehended on Saturday, on suspicion of having stolen a silver-plated tea-service and two dozen silver-plated knives, the whole valued at $100, which were found in his possession.

He commenced by saying that the average duration of human life depended upon the sanitary conditions which surrounded us -- the air we breathe, the food we eat, &c. The health reports of Boston and Providence proved that those who lived in crowded tenements did not live so long by 20 years as those who lived in spacious and well-ventilated houses. The reports of Mr. CHADWICK, the English statistician, proved the same fact. The blood which is impelled through the system is constantly carrying off the decayed particles of the human organism, at the rate of from six to seven pounds daily, about three pounds of which is carbonic acid, and the remainder decomposed animal matter.

They were taken in charge by the U.S. Marshal, and, upon the papers attested by the Consul, the Captain and witnesses were temporarily committed. Yesterday, the U.S. District-Attoraey having examined the papers, a regular commitment was made out, and the examination of the case was set down for this forenoon. The ship John Cuttle sailed from New-York en the 10th of August last, with a cargo of coal for Acapulco for the Pacific Mall Steamship Co. The voyage was a long and some what harassing one on account of adverse winds and weather, and the ship did not arrive off her port of destination until the 8th of February, 165 days from New-York. The Captain and mate had occasional differentiates during the latter part of the voyage, the cause of which does not appear. On the 7th of February the Captain exhibited strange conduct, challenging the mate to a fist combat on the main deck, which the crew were invited to witness. As the mate would not strike the first blow -- so states one of the witnesses -- the fight was dropped, and the captain became calm. The same evening the mate went off duty, calling the crew to witness the fact. On the following morning he resumed duty, again calling the men as witnesses. In the afternoon some words arose about the bearings of the land, the captain walking the poop-deck, athwart ships, in an uneasy mood. The mate advised him to get some sleep, but the captain said he could not sleep. Afterwards, about 3 1/2 o'clock, it being the mate's watch, the captain appeared on the deck smoking a pipe, and saying he ""felt queer."" The mate told him if he would put his pipe away he would feel better. The captain went below, the mate remarking that too captain was crazy. Shortly afterwards he came up with a loaded revolver, emerging from the after companion way, and fired at the mate, who ran below, followed by the captain, who continued to discharge his pistol at him. The mate ran through the cabin, going forward on the main deck, where a fourth shot was fired, the mate falling near the forward house. The captain then gave up the charge of the ship to the second mate, and on the following day he was placed in irons by the crew. The ship reached Acapuleo on the 10th of February, where the facts were reported to the American Consul, who took the captain into custody.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""U.S. Marshal's Office.; AN AMERICAN CAPTAIN CHARGED WITH KILLING HIS MATE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""U.S. Marshal's Office.; AN AMERICAN CAPTAIN CHARGED WITH KILLING HIS MATE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b529ff85-8100-5585-b162-3ed9b4939a4f,553,nyt://article/b529ff85-8100-5585-b162-3ed9b4939a4f,

There are now in active service seven Steam Engine Companies, and two Hook and Ladder Companies.

There is no more lawless rioting, they say, arising out of the bitter feuds of rival companies, but with good feeling, harmonious action, and generous rivalry, the firemen perform their duties. The total cost of the Department is less, in proportion to its service and efficiency, than that of any other fire department in the country, and is a less tax on the City and citizens than the old volunteer Department. Experience proves that the Paid Steam Fire Department can be supported at a [???]ess cost than that which it has superseded. The total cost of the Department since its organization to Jan. 1, 1860 -- a little over a year -- was $123,185 33. including the outlay for construction and purchase of all the property now belonging to the Department. The total current expenses were $32,131 14, and the estimate for the present year is $47,500, of which $36,000 is for salaries. The reformation in the discipline of the department and morals of its members has been followed by a corresponding diminution of the number of fires and of the loss of property. The insurance companies have made a reduction in consequence: the public pay, probably, on an average twenty-five per cent, less on insurances effected since the organization of the new Department.

It is not, as people have supposed, an adaptation from THACKEHAY'S novel, but a clever version of a French piece. The title is a good one, locally and generally. The scene, although laid in Paris, might as well be in NewYork, and the two words "" Vanity Fair"" convey closely an idea of what the plot Illustrates. Mr. BOURCICAULT, in his ""tag"" at the end of the play, called it ""a poor unpretending comedy."" We are disposed to regard it as something more. It is poor, undoubtedly, in plot, but the characterization is frequently forcible, and the language always terse and epigrammatic. In these days, when the attention of the author is directed more to the stage carpenter and the scene painter than to the public, it is refreshing, at least, to have a piece with some pretensions to literary merit. There are passages of quiet humor in the work which would not disgrace an author of greater reputation than Mr. BOURCICAULT; but they are, we fear, too fine and subtle to take deep hold of a miscellaneous audience. A public accustomed to gloat over sensation pieces can scarcely be expected to enjoy the comparatively sterling merit of a play like ""Vanity Fair."" Whatever its positive success with the public, we have no hesitation in recording our opinion that it is, so far as dialogue and characterization are concerned, one of Mr. BOURCICAULT's best recent successes.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'THEATRE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/25ec1577-c42a-552e-8b1f-9748f962ed9c,813,nyt://article/25ec1577-c42a-552e-8b1f-9748f962ed9c,

Although the Southern market was overstocked last year, the merchants of the Slaveholding States have purchased quite as largely as ever of the New-York importers this year. The predictions of the members of the leading drygoods firms, made before business had fairly opened in January, as published in the TIMES of that date have been completely verified. While trade has, in some instances, been diverted from its former channels, so that our importers have been brought into more immediate contact with buyers from the other side of Mason and Dixon's line, without the intervention, to so large an extent, of the New-York jobbers, the quantity of goods sold and shipped, or crowded together now awaiting shipment to Southern ports, is in the aggregate quite as large as was sent to the same places of destination last year. It is with the greatest difficulty, and only by paying their carmen extra rates of compensation, that the merchants succeed in transhipping their dry goods to the South. The unprecedentedly large cotton crop of the past season, and the ready market which the staple has found this year in Europe, (with an increasing demand from the New-England mills,) has given the Southerners -- especially those of the cotton-growing States -- the means of making extensive purchases; and the agricultural States of the South, such as Virginia, Kentucky, parts of Tennessee and Missouri are financially prosperous only in a less degree. Had not the money-market been so easy, and had there in consequence been Jess goods sold to Southern purchasers than usual, the organs of disunion would not have failed to ascribe the falling off in the trade to the Harper's Ferry affair, and to the political sentiments of the people of the South. We have been assured by merchants of standing in this City that their contact with Southerners, in the course of their business transactions with them the present season, has convinced them that the sentiments of the great mass of the people in the slave-holding Statesare very much misrepresented, not only by newspapers in the interest of party, but by their own Senators and Representatives in Congress. A customer from the region of Red River, in Arkansas, as asked the other day by a member of a very extensive cloth-importing firm, with which he was trading, whether he had hesitated at all to come North to buy goods, in consequence of the aspect of political affairs. He replied that the sentiment of the people he dwelt among was not at all that of the politicians who undertook to speak for them; that it was well understood that the present excitement was purposely aroused for political ends; and that politics and trade had nothing to do with each other, even if this were not so. We have heard similar statements repeatedly, that tradesmen from the Southern States, except in isolated instances, do not inquire into the political sentiments of those whom it is to their advantage to deal with. That they, indeed, transact business extensively with those whose sentiments are known to be Anti-Slavery, the every-day experience of the last month furnishes abundant evidence. A week ago Mr. BOWEN, of the extensive firm of BOWEN, HOLMES & Co., a gentleman whose political proclivities are decided and have never been concealed -- was conversing with a Kentuckian who visited him for the first time, and desired to purchase a heavy bill of goods, when a gentleman entered the store and asked to see a member of the firm. Mr. BOWEN looked up and told him what his name was. The gentleman wanted to buy a sik dress for his wife. Mr. BOWEN told him that they did not sell at retail. ""Well,"" said the gentleman, turning to go, ""I'm sorry. I wanted to buy of a firm that sells its goods and not its principles!"" Mr. BOWEN immediately referred him to one of his partners, and the dress was sold him. The Kentuckian sat still and heard all this, yet apparently not at all disturbed by it, resumed his negotiations, and before he left the store had made arrangements for the purchase of a large assortment of goods.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SOUTHERN TRADE.; Continued Activity in the Trade of New-York with the Southern States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SOUTHERN TRADE.; Continued Activity in the Trade of New-York with the Southern States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e676ba8-a2be-5219-aa2f-1ce1c14c87a7,966,nyt://article/6e676ba8-a2be-5219-aa2f-1ce1c14c87a7,

A tremendous gale had again visited the British coast, doing much damage to shipping, American vessels not escaping. In relation to the rumor received by the America, via Queenstown, of a new Austro-Russian alliance, the Morning Chronicle, with which the story originated, had reaffirmed it, and found an indorser in the Morning Herald. Our latest dispatches state that, while the tale was authoritatively denied by the Paris Press, and at Vienna, it is as strongly reiterated by the Chronicle. M. DE THOUVENEL, in explanation of the views of the Emperor upon the latest developments of the Italian question, had addressed a note to the Ambassador at Vienna, stating that, while France might regard the present moment as improper for a dissolution of the Papal States, it would insist upon the question adjusting itself without external intervention. The project of a General Congress appeared to be finally abandoned. The Russian Ambassador at Turin, in the course of an interview with Count CAVOUR, had warned the Sardinian Premier that his master could not regard with indifference any steps Piedmont might, in the present threatening state of the Continent, take to hasten the absorption of Central Italy. The French Foreign Secretary had addressed a note to the same Government, containing similar language. The condition of Venetia was distressing. A change of Governors had taken place, and an order had been issued obliging all persons supposed to be disaffected toward the Austrian rule, to be enrolled in the army, and subjected to strict military discipline. The proceedings of the British Parliament had been interesting. On the 27th ult., the budget was discussed by the Comons in Committee of the Whole, when Mr. GLADSTONE and others spoke upon the new tariff, and the resolution relative to wine and spirits was adopted by a decisive majority. From Morocco, we learn that the Spaniards had bombarded the towns of Larache and Arcilla, inflicting great damage.

He gave them tickets for New-Orleans instead, and even those were good for nothing, and some good-hearted friend brought them before the Marshal for relief. The guilty parties, for there were three or four engaged in the swindle, were arrested and compelled to disgorge, and from the difficulty experienced in raising the money, the inference would seem fair that a portion of it at least had found its way into some other than a legitimate channel. It was, however, raised and paid over, and all parties left the office -- the Frenchmen rejoicing in the recovery of their money and ready to shout Vive L'Amerique -- the swindlers exceedingly crest-fallen and dejected. This office, by the way, is run down by female operatives and servants who have been defrauded out of their hard-earned wages, and who think the Mayor has the power to redress their wrongs. There were over twenty cases of this nature yesterday, swindling sums of from fifty cents to two dollars and a-half, and each for fairly-earned and hard-earned wages. It seems to us that when our legislators have finished off their Railroad, and other bills which involve amounts as immense as their interests, they might find a little leisure to devote to that portion of their constituency, about whom so much is said, and for whom nothing is ever done. Some of them would sleep better if they would place in the power of the over-worked and wretchedly-paid female operatives some means to collect their miserable wages without the expense and delay which now attend any attempt at enforced collection through the aid of the law.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CITY INTELLIGENCE.; THE DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE LIQUOR DEAL FATAL BLASTING ACCIDENT DETERMINED TO DIE.

"The steamship Circassian of the Lever line, from Galway March 3, called yesterday at St. Johns, N.F. The news transmitted thence by telegraph is important. On the 1st inst. the Ministerial Reform bill was brought forward in the House of Commons by Lord JOHN RUSSELL. It makes a ten-pound qualification in the counties, and six pounds in the boroughs; and, conceding only one member to each of the smaller boroughs, leaves a residuum to strengthen the representations of large towns. Two additional members are given to Ireland, and two to Scotland. The Liberals are said to be much dissatisfied with the bill. On the same day the French Corps Legislatif was opened by the Emperor in a speech of momentous interest. Referring to Italy, he declared that Tuscany could not be annexed to Piedmont, but must be erected into a separate kingdom. Modena and Parma should be left at liberty to consolidate with Sardinia, and, under certain contingencies, the Romagna also. The safety of France, he said, required the addition of Savoy to her boundaries, a measure which the great Powers, he trusted, would upon reflection find no reason to oppose. The effect of the speech was to cause a trifling decline, both on the Bourse and on the London Stock market. The English journals are loud against the Savoy scheme. Prince LUCIEN BONAPARTE, of poetical antecedents, is spoken of as the Napoleonic candidate for the Etrurian crown. From Italy we learn that while the Pope begins to see the necessity of concessions to his rebel subjects, he had just threatened the King of Sardinia with excommunication. There is nothing new from Morocco. The conditions of peace presented by Marshal O'DONNELL are regarded by the Spanish journals as exorbitant, especial objection being made to the contemplated extension of conquered territory.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/16/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"The steamship Circassian of the Lever line, from Galway March 3, called yesterday at St. Johns, N.F.

The ordinance regulating the construction of vaults in front of stores and dwelling-houses limits them to the outer edge of the sidewalk, except by special permission from the Croton Department, and this on payment of a speci- fied fee for the permission. Of late, however, and especially since the mania for marble stores and broad vaults has seized the merchants of New-York, the owners and builders have gradually encroached upon the streets, or rather the substratum of the streets, until, in one case at least, the walls of the vaults on either side of the street approach within four feet of each other. This may seem, to the casual reader, very unimportant, but when it is taken into consideration that sewers, gas-pipes and water-pipes must be laid or repaired, it will readily be seen how much wrong may be done by this encroachment upon the underground rights of the City. In one case -- we do not choose to name the street, lest some of the Insurance Companies might demand a cancellation of their policies -- the vaults are so far extended beneath the street, that it was found impossible to place a fire-hydrant at the point designated; and in another case, a party now about erecting a marble store, had the conscience to ask permission to build a vault twenty-nine feet wide, which is exactly half the width of the street. There is now more than one street running across Broadway and below Reade-street, where, if any accident should happen to the gas or Croton pipes, immense damage might be caused by reason of the vault mania.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CROTON DEPARTMENT.; THE UNDER-STREET VAULTS PROGRESS AND EXPANSION OF THAT DESCRIPTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CROTON DEPARTMENT.; THE UNDER-STREET VAULTS PROGRESS AND EXPANSION OF THAT DESCRIPTION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f1fcf5b-2da2-51ee-82a8-8ba1a58f2c93,1210,nyt://article/2f1fcf5b-2da2-51ee-82a8-8ba1a58f2c93,

Neither the Pope nor the Kaiser, then, will learn anything new from the language which NAPOLEON has now used.

After a most successful rial trip to Alexandria, she made the voyage to Australia, carrying the mail down the Red Sea. Having unfortunately lost the mail contract, through inability to fulfill its terms, the Company for which she was originally constructed went into liquidation, and the steamer returned to England under canvas, making the trip in ninety days, during twenty of which she was becalmed. Soon afterwards she was purchased at private sale by the Cunard Company, and placed in their line of screw steamers between Liverpool and New-York. She is of great strength, and is fitted with every modern improvement, having accommodations for 211 first-class passengers, and cargo and store space for 1,050 tons, besides room in her bunkers for 1,500 tons of coal. Her cabins and saloons are fitted up in the most elegant and substantial manner, with particular reference to ventilation, as the vessel was intended for navigation in the tropics. For officers and crew, which number 113, there is ample provision as regards rooms. The length of keel and fore-rake of the Australasian is 320 feet, being 331 feet over all; breadth 42 feet 1 inch, depth to spar deck 31 feet 6 inches. Tonnage -- gross register 1,760, or 2,010 tons of builder's measurement. The engines are direct-acting, of 700 (nominal) horse-power, with inverted cylinders of 90 inches diameter, and 3 1/2 feet stroke, fitted with THOMSON's patent expansion valves.

"Mr. D.H. TETU, of Kamarouska, Canada, who has been exhibing two of the species of the white whale from the St. Lawrence, last evening made a statement before the Polytechnic Club of the American Institute. The name, he said, given to this fish by the French Canadian is ""White Porpoise,"" but is denominated in all the works on natural history that he had consulted, the ""White Whale."" We find the white whale in the St. Lawrence River opposite the Village of St. Rochs, situated sixty miles below Quebec, and as far down as Father Point, a distance of about 200 miles. It is also found in immense quantities in the rivers emptying into Hudson's Bay This cetaceous animal became, soon after the discovery of Canada, an article of commerce which entitled the first colonists, who engaged in catching it, to a special protection on the part of the French Government. In 1707 there were no less than eight companies established at different points of the river for carrying on this business, whom the inhabitants protected by their edicts and ordinances. The oil of the white w halt was then worth only a franc a gallon. Its skin was somehow considered of little value, but owing to the facility with which it was taken, the quantity alone sufficed to make it sought after, and to render the pursuit profitable to those engaged in it, among whom a company of six farmers, at River Orielle Point, was particularly distinguished. During the year 1710, this Company took eight hundred. Some years later it killed thousands; but the number gradually diminished every year, and, whether from the increasing navigation of the river proving a cause of alarm to this valuable fish, or from some of those hidden causes which the depths of ocean veil from us, they ceased to live together in large shoals, and dispersed into all parts of the river. It cannot, however, be said that they are less numerous in the St. Lawrence than heretofore; on the contrary, the number is much greater, and their species belongs exclusively to that river. It is the largest and most profitable of those which live permanently in Canadian waters. This fish was formerly taken in inclosures made of light and flexible poles fixed in the beach. Stakes are now used to make the inclosures only at Point Orielle, St. Anne and Isle-aux-Coudres. But, for some years past, another method has been adopted, and no doubt if it had been on a more extended scale it would have yielded immense profits. Mr. TETU had for several years past adopted the system of taking this fish in nets near the River Saguenay. After repeated experiments he discovered the proper manner to clarify the oil, and to manufacture leather out of its skin. This oil is extremely pure and inodorous, and gives a brilliant light, only surpassed by gas. It is superior to any other for the use of light-houses, because it does not coagulate even in the most intense cold, and its limpidity renders it invaluable for greasing leather, and for lubricating machinery. Appreciated as such by the great Exhibition of Paris and London, of Canada and New-York, it has gained testimonials and medals which sufficiently attest the great success obtained.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/16/archives/the-white-whale-of-the-st-lawrence-statement-of-mr-tetu-before-the.html,,"Mr. D.H.

"When Mr. WISE resigned the gubernatorial seat of Virginia to his successor, we hoped that the political Jack Ketch of the Old Dominion might be about to retire from office with her pyrotechnic Palinurus. The country, while it lamented the passionate obstinacy with which the hero of Harper's Ferry had pursued his purpose of putting to death a fanatic whom death was sure to invest with the martyr's aureole, could yet make allowances for the author of this stupendous blunder, and did, in fact, make them. It is not only a Virginian, but, we fear, an American trait to exaggerate every emotion, and to sacrifice the gravest considerations of sense and dignity to the ecstasy of an intense sensation; and when we saw that Virginia had gone simply mad with mingled rage and fear, we could not fairly demand that Virginian statesmen should risk their influence and their future in an attempt to stem the furious torrent of the popular folly. We deplored the infatuation before which those who should have ruled the people felt themselves constrained to bow; but we knew that even a Virginian Governor is, after all, a man of like passions with ourselves, and we felt that it would be neither charitable nor just to expect of a provincial Executive, at such a moment, the courageous discretion which we might have had a right to look for from a statesman of loftier position dealing with a more reasonable because a more powerful community. It is a mere truism to say that all human passions become exasperated exactly in proportion as the circle in which they move is narrowed. A village mob is, of all imaginable mobs, the least amenable to any argument but force; and such is the constitution of society in Virginia that, for all practical purposes, the whole State was converted by the Harper's Ferry excitement into a mere hive of village mobs.

It is designed for use in churches, one of which, in this City, has already adopted it. The funnel-shaped vessel is placed before the pulpit, and catches the words as fast as they drop from the speaker's lips. From the bottom of the funnel, pipes are laid beneath the floor, to the various parts of the house occupied by those whose hearing is defective, and these terminate in ear-pieces attached to the side of the pew. The inventor did not explain whether these extremities are furnished, like gas-burners, with stop-cocks to enable the hearer to ""turn off"" the sermon when the odor of any part thereof becomes objectionable. It is to be presumed, however, that such an arrangement is furnished, so that the amount of spiritual light which each auditor requires may he easily regulated by himself. Of course, in this event, a verb-ometer should be provided for each pew, that no man may be called upon to pay for more preaching than he actually consumes. From this new invention a light seems to dawn upon the progress of church conveniences. For many who now stay away from church, because they are too lazy to go, or too poor to afford fitting apparel, can have the ""gospel brought to their own door."" In fact, the adoption of the new contrivances would save everybody the necessity of leaving home to hear the sermon. The laying of ""mains"" from the various churches through the principal streets would furnish all an opportunity to introduce ""preaching"" into their houses as conveniently as they now introduce water or gas, doing away, perhaps, in some instances, with necessity of the latter element altogether. Not least among those benefited by the adoption of this plan would be the clergyman himself, who could preach the church reservoir full, at his convenience through the week, and hoist the gate at the proper time on Sunday. Nor should so useful an invention be confined to the use of churches alone. Great reservoirs might be made throughout the City, replenished by conduits from Ward-rooms, corner groceries, and other centres of public discussion, and having pipes leading to ear pieces in the Common Council Chamber. Had this plan been in operation during the late two months of mud, the complaining cries that went up from the whole City, centering in the Council Chamber, would have made a din that the City fathers must have silenced by granting the clamorous petition for cleaner streets, before they could have proceeded with their own snug counsels of personal plunder. That the denizens of the City Hall, when once this invention is brought to their notice, will speedily adopt it, no one can doubt who has observed the facilities they extend to the modern political craft of ""pipe layers,"" whose experience in the art of tabular interments would enable them quickly to complete the work.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8ac1eb7-5679-54a7-967d-12263381813d,2709,nyt://article/e8ac1eb7-5679-54a7-967d-12263381813d,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/17/archives/spanish-subjects-and-american-citizens.html,,"Great Britain, France, Prussia, almost all the first-class European States, have recognized the right of their subjects to renounce their allegiance, and to become citizens of the United States; not so Spain. Whoever has the misfortune to be born beneath the banner of Castile and Leon must always remain subject to the Second ISABELLA and her heirs must always be liable to obey their behests, and to share their uncertain fate. Once a Spaniard, always a Spaniard. No matter how early he may forsake her soil, or how long he may absent himself from it -- no matter how solemnly he may have abjured her authority, or how binding may be the obligations which he has contracted to his adopted country -- the Spaniard, nevertheless, becomes a son of Spain once more, the moment he ventures within her borders. A case has recently occurred in Cuba in point of this immutable policy. One GAVINO DE LIANO, born a Creole of Cuba, emigrated to the United States with his parents at the age of nine years, and became in common with them a naturalized citizen of our Republic. Sometime since he had occasion to return to his native island; but hardly had he set foot within the shadow of the Moro when he was summoned by the authorities to render military service to the crown of Spain as a conscript, or to pay a certain sum of money as the price of exemption. Regarding himself as a citizen of the United States, and not as a subject of the Spanish crown, DE LIANO bluntly refused either to render the required service, or to countenance the imposition by purchasing exemption from it. This contumacy led to his immediate arrest, and that again to an appeal in his behalf, made to Mr. HELM, our Consul-General at Havana, who promptly put himself into communication with the Cuban Government touching the particular outrage perpetrated on DE LIANO, and the rights of adopted American citizens in general. But the Consul-General's remonstrance produced no effect. The representative of Spanish royalty, instead of ordering the liberation of the recusant, replied after the following fashion, through Gen. SERRANO, to the application of Mr. HELM. Spain does not release her natural born subjects, who choose to go abroad and become adopted citizens of other States, from the obligation of military service, unless such subjects consent to pay a pecuniary consideration for exemption from said obligation; therefore the party whose case has been laid before the Cuban Executive cannot be released from custody, since he refuses to accept the alternative which the laws of her Majesty ISABELLA the Second offer to him, and to all other persons similarly circumstanced. Gen. SERRANO's response called forth a rejoinder from the Consul-General, in which that functionary manfully protested against the injustice of the Spanish law, and the detention of DE LIANO in prison, declaring at the same time that the United States Government would not submit to such a construction of the natural and acquired rights of its citizens as that propounded by the Cuban authorities. What resulted from Mr. HELM's last reclamation we are not informed, but from the known arrogance and obstinacy of Spanish officials, we may safely conclude that it proved as ineffectual as the first, and that DE LIANO is still in durance vile, unless he has yielded to the pressure of despotism, and at once freed himself from the dungeon and the obligation by payment of the pecuniary equivalent. It the Cuban Executive has continued deaf to the appeals of Mr. HELM, that official has of course nothing further to do with the matter than to forward a report of the case to Washington, where it will doubtless receive the prompt attention usually bestowed by our Foreign Secretary upon cases within this category. Whether DE LIANO remains a captive or submits to purchase his liberty. Mr. CASS' duty, however, will still be the same -- namely, to bring his grievances, through our Envoy in Spain, before the Madrid Administration, and to demand not only their immediate redress, but the total renunciation on the part of Spain of any such pretensions as these put forward against DE LIANO.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spanish Subjects and American Citizens.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spanish Subjects and American Citizens.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d9f5fbb-69af-5896-b5ef-56223304efd8,836,nyt://article/0d9f5fbb-69af-5896-b5ef-56223304efd8,

WISE since he descended into private life is one of the most remarkable events of the present season. During the John Brown excitement he had so many proofs in his possession that the whole North had subscribed for the purchase of JOHN BROWN's outfit, and was anxiously hoping for the success of his enterprise, that his detestation of us knew no bounds. His sacred frenzy reached a climax when the medical students reached Richmond, on their way home from Philadelphia. Their appearance led to the delivery of a speech, which surpassed for folly and profanity anything which has ever issued in modern times from the lips of any man occupying a more dignified official position than the chieftainship of a tribe of savages. He hailed with frantic delight the resolution of the students to shake off Northern dust from the soles of their feet, and quit the polluted nest of Philadelphia; and threatened himself to invade the North and Canada with twelve men. He offered to attack the Cunard steamers with a small boat of his own, and forcibly seize and abduct a negro passenger; then volunteered on behalf of Virginia to declare war against Great Britain, because she did not maintain a large frontier guard in Canada for the arrest and prompt return of runaway Southern slaves. He shortly afterwards brought his absurdity to a climax by formally notifying the Governor of Ohio that, in case he heard of any Abolitionist conspiracy being formed in that State for the violation of the laws of Virginia, he should not resort to legal means for its punishment, but would incontinently levy an armed force and invade it. There were few persons at all solicitous about the credit of Virginia, not to speak of the United States, who were not disposed to veil Mr. WISE's performances during the last two months of his tenure of office, under the charitable hypothesis that his always excitable brain had given way under the pressure of the Harper's Ferry insurrection; that, in short, the perils and the responsibilities of that memorable campaign had proved too much for an organization which was always better fitted for the arduous labors of the stump than for the great exigencies of the battle-field; and they received the speech to the students as the final confirmation of their theory.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Happy Restoration.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Happy Restoration.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/13b0706d-1f9b-595a-89a3-5125eee3e56e,826,nyt://article/13b0706d-1f9b-595a-89a3-5125eee3e56e,

Dr. CAHILL, on the fidelity of the Irish people to freedom and to the faith of their fathers. Long before 6 o'clock, the time for opening the doors of the Academy, a crowd of men and women gathered about the building, eager for entrance; and when, at 8 o'clock, the speaker made his appearance on the stage, he was greeted with prolonged, enthusiastic and boisterous applause from every seat and standing place in the vast theatre. As soon as the audience permitted him a hearing, he began by telling them that he never was so overpowered in his life. He had addressed large assemblies since he had been here, and before he came here, but never before had be spoken in so large a building or to so large an audience as he saw before him. He had been delighted beyond measure as the sights he had witnessed that day. Never had he felt more proud of Irishman than when gazing upon the long procession of his countrymen, marching through the streets with their banners, their caps of liberty, their national emblems, and, above all, the stars and stripes of their adopted country floating by the side of every banner. And when he saw the-men uncover their heads as they passed by the statue of WASHINGTON, thus showing their reverence for the great and good pater patrioe, he felt that as citizens of this land of liberty, they would prove no less faithful and patriotic than they had been in the land of their birth. Although he had seen 200,000 men under arms, yet to his mind, as he looked upon this noble procession, so quiet, so orderly, so befitting the time and the occasion, it seemed the largest and best drilled army he had ever seen. Each man in the ranks, seen through the tears that came unbidden to his eyes, seemed the noblest, the bravest, and the best of human kind. And we have gathered here to night, said he to continue the celebration of this great festival of St. Patrick. All of you will agree with me, that this is a great day for Ireland, and in may estimation it is also a great day for the whole Christian world. It has been the custom of all nations, in all ages of the world, to celebrate the great events in their history, and to honor the birth-days of their heroes, their poets, their artists and their men of science. But what is history, what is poetry, what is art, what is science, compared to Christianity? This is a Christian festival. The anniversary of St. Patrick is the anniversary of the introduction of Christianity into Ireland. The speaker here gave a sketch of the life of St. Patrick; how he was captured on the coast of Africa by Irish pirates and taken to Ireland at the age of 16, and then condemned to tend swine. But what would seem to have been a great misfortune to him, proved to be one of the most glorious event in the history of the world. He entered upon the work of converting the Irish nation to Christianity, and met with astonishing success. From the time of his death, which occurred about A.D. 441, Ireland was for several centuries the seminary of Europe, occupying the highest position in the arts and sciences, and being unrivaled in her religious devotion. About the fifth century commenced the reign of the Kings of Ireland, of whom there were five, and who, he regretted to say, laid the foundations of those divisions that have more or less distracted the Irish people from that time to this. He had often thought what a pity it was that JULIUS CAESAR, when he conquered England, 75 years before Christ, had not also conquered Ireland, and given unity to her people. Why was it that the Irish people, so united in religious faith, should forever be divided in political sentiments? He would tell them why, it was because their religious teachers never betrayed them, while their politicians always did. The divisions fomented by the Irish Kings at length brought on the invasion of the Danes, who became masters of the country, and for two centuries persecuted the people, burnt their churches and libraries -- of which they had the finest in Europe -- and finally reduced them almost to a state of barbarism. At last the aid of England was called in, and she in turn, after having got possession of the country, continued the persecutions of the Irish people; and the truth of history compelled him to admit that the Catholic Kings of England had persecuted the Irish to nearly as great extent as the Protestant Kings. King JOHN, a Catholic, was the great tyrant, and the worst foe to her religion that Ireland ever had. A bad man, a Catholic, was the worst man in the world; to the natural evil of his heart he added a base hypocrisy. The lecturer proceeded to sketch the history of Ireland during the reigns of successive English monarchs, down to the present time -- showing how persistently, and with what unsparing [???]gor she had been persecuted, and trodden down by her rulers; and with what unflinching firmness, patience, courage, and God-like heroism, she had endured it all, and stood up for the ancient faith of her fathers, and for the glorious liberty which was the natural inheritance of that faith. He exhorted his hearers to continue to stand up for the true faith, and as the providence of God had ordained that they should be dispersed over the earth, let every man, wherever he may go, be a missionary in the cause of religion, and a champion of liberty.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ORATION BY DR.

The first is, that, though it is notorious that the Slave-trade is flourishing, our squadron never catches any slavers, and makes no great exertions to do so; and the second is, that, were it ever so anxious to execute the laws, it could not succeed, because the ships of which it is composed are utterly unfitted for the service in which they are nominally engaged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The American Flag and the African Slave-trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The American Flag and the African Slave-trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89464a2d-c6c8-592d-8e2e-56b554fb954f,1367,nyt://article/89464a2d-c6c8-592d-8e2e-56b554fb954f,

"The Society of Friendly Sons of St. Patrick gathered at the Metropolitan Hotel on Saturday evening for the purpose of doing honor to the memory of the patron saint of Ireland, and celebrating the seventy-sixth anniversary of their own organization. The dinner, which was served in the grand banquet hall of the hotel, and, under the immediate personal superintendence of Mr. WARREN LELAND, more than sustained the excellent reputation of this popular house. In the arrangement of the tables there was a change from the usual form, in regard to those intended for the principal officers and guests. The tables were elevated some twelve or fourteen inches above the others, and placed so that those who occupied them filled a square and sat face to face. The table ornaments were, many of them, prepared especially for the occasion and suggestive of the events which the Society had met to commemorate. The statuette of St. Patrick, in sugar, placed temptingly in front of the President, Hon. Judge DALY, excited considerable curiosity, after a remark from the Judge drew attention to the fact that the artist had expanded the robes of his favorite by a hoop of the most fashionable dimensions. Accepting the artist's idea of the style of St. Patrick's dress, it was considered another irrefragable proof that there has never been anything thought, said, sung or done that was not first thought, said, sung or done in Ireland. The Hall itself was tastefully decorated with the flags of several nations,' the most prominent among them being the Green Flag and the Stars and Stripes.

The dinner, which was served in the grand banquet hall of the hotel, and, under the immediate personal superintendence of Mr. WARREN LELAND, more than sustained the excellent reputation of this popular house. In the arrangement of the tables there was a change from the usual form, in regard to those intended for the principal officers and guests. The tables were elevated some twelve or fourteen inches above the others, and placed so that those who occupied them filled a square and sat face to face. The table ornaments were, many of them, prepared especially for the occasion and suggestive of the events which the Society had met to commemorate. The statuette of St. Patrick, in sugar, placed temptingly in front of the President, Hon. Judge DALY, excited considerable curiosity, after a remark from the Judge drew attention to the fact that the artist had expanded the robes of his favorite by a hoop of the most fashionable dimensions. Accepting the artist's idea of the style of St. Patrick's dress, it was considered another irrefragable proof that there has never been anything thought, said, sung or done that was not first thought, said, sung or done in Ireland. The Hall itself was tastefully decorated with the flags of several nations,' the most prominent among them being the Green Flag and the Stars and Stripes. The instrumental music for the occasion was furnished by Dodworth's Band.

She adds no news of special importance to that preciously received. She brings, however, the dispatches of the French Government to its Ministers in Turin and London, of which mention was made by the Asia's news. They are able and decidedly important. The Emperor informs the King of Sardinia that he stands ready to sustain him fully, if he shall see fit to follow the policy which he indicates, -- but that he must rely upon his own strength entirely if he decides to take another course. He thinks that Tuscany should not be annexed to Sardinia, but that Parma and Modena may. The telegraph states that Count CAVOUR has replied to this advice, declining to follow it: -- this, however, is not yet quite certain. The French Secretary repeats the sentiment that the annexation of Savoy is a geographical necessity for France; and we have on the one hand an energetic protest against it on the part of England -- as calculated to arouse the suspicions and menace the peace of Europe; and on the other a declaration from Austria that she will not oppose the measure. The possibilities of trouble growing out of this question had slightly affected the London market; and it is stated that public feeling in Paris was not quite satisfied. Count DE MORNY's speech, at the opening of the Corps Legislatif, discusses the subject of Free Trade, -- saying that it will not answer until Protection has prepared the way for it, and that the new commercial treaty has been carefully adapted to this principle.

By virtue of State laws and ordinances, all of recent date, the streets of New-York have been subdivided into three departments.

If the Croton Board award a contract for paving a street, it can only be done with the assent of the Street Commissioner, who regulates the curbing and guttering, and so on, ad infinitum.

The poem itself possesses a sufficient number of provocations to theatrical industry. It is not all remarkable, therefore, that the right man -- or rather woman -- has been found to do the proper offices for it. Mrs. BATEMAN, who undertakes the task, has discharged it with more than common ability. She has succeeded, undoubtedly, in framing an actable play. The means by which this has been effected are neither startling nor new, being derived mainly from a correct knowledge of the machinery of the dramatic art, rather than fresh invention or piquant characterization. Mr. LONGFELLOW's major poems are perhaps more susceptible of dramatic treatment than those of almost any other writer. The distinguished author of ""Evangeline"" is never neglectful of scenic opportunities, of effective contrasts of individualities, of well-marked domestic groupings -- elements in themselves of dramatic success. The real difficulty in the way of a perfect transcription of his poems is to be found in the sustained narrative tone that pervades them, and to interrupt which involves an operation of much delicacy and danger. Although Mrs. BATEMAN has performed this operation with the commonest of instruments, she has in many respects been most fortunate and happy in the result.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'THEATRE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cce77c2f-4b3b-5b72-8f6a-9a3cdc9271a7,1469,nyt://article/cce77c2f-4b3b-5b72-8f6a-9a3cdc9271a7,

"the Constitution, he intended to commit perjury. [Loud applause and lau[???]er.] I am not exaggerating. If I had stood here to-night, and affirmed in your presence that the great statesman of the Empire State would have obeyed that clause you would have flashed back upon me the epithet -- Standerer!"" I am obliged to believe, judging by the record of his life, by the testimony of his fellow-citizens, that that very Constitution which he has sworn scores of times to support -- that very Constitution which he says comes from hands almost divine -- that when he swore to support it, he intended to commit perjury. Is that a Union to which you can welcome men when they get to be 21 years old? It seems to me not. I would like to vote. I would like to add my quota to the civil influence of my country directly. Show me how I can without jeopardizing my self-respect -- without swearing an oath which you know I would not and ought not to mean to keep -- and I will vote for WM. H. SEWARD for President to-morrow. And yet I would rather see a Democratic President. [Loud laughter ]. And I will tell you why. If there is a Republican President elected in 1860. You will all be looking to the Administration. You will all be waiting to see what law can do -- what L[???]ty fettered can do against Slavery unb[???]. Agitation will be lulled. Everything like free and unuttered action will cease. We shall wait. But let DOUGLAS or any other Democrat be elected, and every man in the Free States will arm himself for the snuggle with the Slave power. Insurrection will break out upon the mountains -- an insurrection of thought in the pulpits -- and we shall make greater Anti-Slavery progress in four years than we should do in forty years under such a programme as under WM H. SEWARD's speech of the last month. Well, again, and I hasten to my conclusion. There is another law of God's kingdom, and it is this: Slavery is an expensive and wasteful system. It cannot be love. God fixed it that justice should be expediency, and that villany should be bankruptcy. He fixed that when he settled the laws of his kingdom. Therefore, the further a man attempts to rob his brother man, in the first place, that brother man resists -- the rights of insurrection. Mark you, I am not asking the slave to rise. I am not urging him to rise. I only say take off your foot. I only take off your foot, and leave the Anglo-Saxon and the African to lay out their own institutions by the vigor of their own manhood. But, in addition to that, there is a pecuniary motive. South Carolina, for instance, stands in the keen competition of the nineteenth century. What is that? All of us are trying to make our living. We get up early, and lie down late. We educate our braine to the utmost. We harness the steam, and send the lightning upon our errands. We do everything. The little child, when he first begins to patter, goes to do something; and the man bending under eighty years contributes his mite. We all work. New-York works, from the Hudson back to the falls; and when she has eaten and clothed herself, about how much does she lay up? Perhaps four per cent. upon her capital. Now, South Carolina has half idle by aristocratic taste and finish. The other half is in chains -- does not work from motive, but from compulsion. Of course the work is performed to disadvantage. The consequence is that there is not more than one man in four in South Carolina working to-day. The other three-fourths live upon it -- three men living upon the work of one's unskilled labor. How much do you suppose they lay up? As the Irishman said, ""They lay up a loss"" [Laughter.] Now suppose, as they threaten, that they should go out of the Union? Suppose to-morrow their purpose was carried out? As LYDIA MARIA CHILDS, you have heard of the town poor separating from the town That is South Carolina's proposition. Suppose they went out? This is a perfectly simple question. There is no mystery about it. They have got to support a general, a president, good police, a navy and an army. They must have the luxuries of government. A domestic government is infinitely more expensive than a despotic one. Russia does not cost halt as much as the Republic of North America. They must have a republican government, which is a very expensive luxury. In order to do that, they must have taxes. What have they to rest upon but labor? Now, if that labor is capable of bearing taxes, it must be intelligent labor. If it is unskilled, and cannot send one pound to Liverpool for less than 18 or 20 cents, what can be done? To day a dispute is going on in Virginia. To make labor worth anything, you must educate the man. ""Educate,"" says a Southerner, -- ""educate that slave, and my throat is not safe."" He is right. You might as well heat a locomotive red-hot, jump upon the top of it, and ride in to a powder magazine, and you would be a prudent man compared with the slaveowner who educates his slave. Yet, South Carolina must do it before she can support the Republican system of the Nineteenth Century. Leave her to the dissolution of the Union, -- to the law of God's political economy. My good friend, the slaver does not ask your rifle. Take your awful Yankee proportions, Republican or Democrat, out of the light. That is all he asks. The light and heat of God's laws and justice will come down and will melt his chains without your assistance. Tear that parchment to pieces that claims -- [Cheers and hisses; the former predominating.] I have a great deal more patriotism than you have -- a good deal. Just look at it. I believe that Washington, Hancock, John Jay, Wyeth, Randolph; -- I believe that when they sat down and made that instrument they intended what they say they intended -- Liberty! [Immense cheering I believe that if you could raise them to-day from their graves, and show them the speech of WILLIAM H. SEWARD, they would say, ""Children, for God's sake, believe that we did not mean it. Tear our mistaken parchment to pieces, and do us the justice to believe that if we could have seen our institution! prostituted to so much injustice, we could have wished them unmade or annihilated."" [Applause.] Do I not do more to call to the memory of '76 than you do? I believe them -- you think them hypocrites! [Applause.] I say tear that parchment to tatters in honor of WASHINGTON! [Low hisses superseded by prolonged applause] Did you ever hear EDWARD EVERETT ring out with those clarioa tones of his that favorite phrase in describing ""WASHINGTON that immortal rebel?"" Well, JOHN BROWN, of Harper's Ferry, was just the same. [Hisses and applause.] You see we do not apply our logic rigidly to the line. You cannot bear justice and logic. But let me go on with what I have to say -- I want to finish my argument -- I am talking too long. [Cries of ""Go on.""] I was speaking of the influence of the Union. Why do I want to separate you from New-Orleans? For the reason, I want to put you, in relation to New-Orleans, just where Liverpool stands to-night. See the difference. The New-York pulpit, to-night, is one end of the magnetic telegraph -- the New-Orleans slave market is the other. That is not true of Liverpool. If I could separate New-York, politically, from New-Orleans, WM. H. SEWARD would care no more for the opinion of South Carolina than he does for PALMERSTON. The New-York Tribune would think as little of TOOMBS or of KEITT as it does of the thunders of the London Times. If you enter the villages of New-England, it is melancholy but it is true, that the pulpit is a vassal of wealth. I rode as I came to you along the railways of Connecticut, and by my side sat a Clergyman who, in the innocent frankness of his heart said to me, ""Mr. SEWARD's speech is an awful disappointment. I wish he could have spoken bolder. If the ministers would only speak out, but then you know that our rich men won't let us."" And I looked into his eyes and thought, are you the representative of the We should have the same language, the same religion, the same advantages, the same literature, the same commerce. But we should have comparative independence, in that our commerce would not poison every thing. To-day go into a factory village of New-England. What is the pulpit? It is only an appendix to the factory. It is only the rich man's kitchen. He buys the minister, and turns him out when he does not preach to suit him. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not mean any disparagement. I trace my lineage to Plymouth through an almost unbroken line of clergymen. I know the services the pulpit has rencered in New-England, and I know this, that the best thing my mother gave me was free lips, and I mean to use them. [Applause] A prostrate race lifts up its hands to us and says, ""White men, free men, loaded with gifts, dowered with thought, give us at least the truth; it is the only weapon that is left us,"" and I mean, so far as I am concerned, that he shall have it. Gospel of the New Testament, and do you act with that unconcerned and verdant frankness, and confess that your soul lies in your pocket?"" I honored him for his frankness -- I could not blame him harshly, and yet I knew he spoke the truth. I do not know, ladies and gentlemen, that it can be altered. I really do not. There is something in the organization of Democratic institutions that seems to render it inevitable that wealth will have a tremendous power, and wealth is chained to the wheel of the steam power. Your mercantile wealth -- your manufacturing wealth -- is but the vassal of an overgrown aristocracy, and beside it stands the moral representative of New-England, the pulpit, the second vassal of a vassal, the slave of a slave. I would separate New-York. That is true of Manchester and Lancashire; it is not true of Liverpool. If I could break the political bonds which bind you, New-York, like a fountain relieved from her mountain load, would look up and be a decent city. [Laughter and applause.] Free speech would not be bullied out of countenance. The pul[???] its would not be filled by dumb dogs at cannot bark. [Applause.] You would not be able to count on your ten fingers the only firms who keep their goods for sale, and not their principles. No; you would see American merchants filling the same spot that the Englishman does. Not independence. I know the weight that New-Orleans and Savannah have, even over the manufacturer. But I would break one of the bonds. Now see what I should gain. Let me count up what we should gain by the breaking of the Union. South Carolina would look at her slaves, saying: ""If they choose to rise I have not the means of resistance."" That is what Mexico said. That is what, the South American Republic said, and they freed them from fear. She would look into the eyes of her unskilled labor and say, ""That way lies bankruptcy. If I want a broad government I have got to educate them.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/21/archives/article-3-no-title.html,,"the Constitution, he intended to commit perjury. [Loud applause and lau[???]er.] I am not exaggerating. If I had stood here to-night, and affirmed in your presence that the great statesman of the Empire State would have obeyed that clause you would have flashed back upon me the epithet -- Standerer!"" I am obliged to believe, judging by the record of his life, by the testimony of his fellow-citizens, that that very Constitution which he has sworn scores of times to support -- that very Constitution which he says comes from hands almost divine -- that when he swore to support it, he intended to commit perjury. Is that a Union to which you can welcome men when they get to be 21 years old? It seems to me not. I would like to vote. I would like to add my quota to the civil influence of my country directly. Show me how I can without jeopardizing my self-respect -- without swearing an oath which you know I would not and ought not to mean to keep -- and I will vote for WM. H. SEWARD for President to-morrow. And yet I would rather see a Democratic President. [Loud laughter ]. And I will tell you why. If there is a Republican President elected in 1860. You will all be looking to the Administration. You will all be waiting to see what law can do -- what L[???]ty fettered can do against Slavery unb[???]. Agitation will be lulled. Everything like free and unuttered action will cease. We shall wait. But let DOUGLAS or any other Democrat be elected, and every man in the Free States will arm himself for the snuggle with the Slave power. Insurrection will break out upon the mountains -- an insurrection of thought in the pulpits -- and we shall make greater Anti-Slavery progress in four years than we should do in forty years under such a programme as under WM H. SEWARD's speech of the last month. Well, again, and I hasten to my conclusion. There is another law of God's kingdom, and it is this: Slavery is an expensive and wasteful system. It cannot be love. God fixed it that justice should be expediency, and that villany should be bankruptcy. He fixed that when he settled the laws of his kingdom. Therefore, the further a man attempts to rob his brother man, in the first place, that brother man resists -- the rights of insurrection. Mark you, I am not asking the slave to rise. I am not urging him to rise. I only say take off your foot. I only take off your foot, and leave the Anglo-Saxon and the African to lay out their own institutions by the vigor of their own manhood. But, in addition to that, there is a pecuniary motive. South Carolina, for instance, stands in the keen competition of the nineteenth century. What is that? All of us are trying to make our living.

He also went round to the neighbors and stated that he thought some person would die, belonging to him, as he had had signs and presentments, stating, at the same time, that his wife was very sick. When his wife died, which was on a Saturday night about 5 o'clock, he stated that he should bury her the next day, as she had died in her full strength, and the body would not keep. The jury considered the case all night Thursday, and could not agree. They were discharged. Ten were for conviction and three for acquittal.

Dr. DAY told me two days ago, that he saw brought into his Missouri prison kidnapped from Kansas Territory a young black man 22 years old, his hands manacled together. He said I am a freeman -- my free papers are in my pocket. The United States officer who brought him in put his felon hand into that pocket, took out those papers, tore them to pieces, and flung them into the fire. The next morning those hands went down melted in the slave population for ever. No remedy -- no redress. Is it a single instance? I have seen the Chief Justice of Massachusetts sitting on the bench of the Supreme Court, with a fugitive slave in front of him, who had proved twice his right to liberty that any of us have. He was born free as, well as we; and he had added a second title by taking his life into his own hand, and by vindicating his worth for Freedom by flying a thousand miles, through all the perils of life and death, to the streets of Boston Which ought to have sheltered him. He looked into the face of the Justice of Massachusetts and said, Have you any refuge for me? And with a voice broken by emotion the representative of the law of Massachusetts said, ""It is a hard case; I cannot vindicate it -- it is right, but I must announce the law."" If that is the Government that you are willing to have your children brought up to live under, -- if the pulpits of thirty States can announce that as a thing almost sacred, -- it the statesmen have no other name for it but swine, although they cannot vindicate it as right, but only announce the law, -- then, I say, ""side with the black man, and record traitor against my name -- side me with the rebel who has no purpose in life but to tear down that government."" I do it in the name of all these 200 years of liberty which our father-thought they were to inaugurate. I do it for the future with the eyes of the race fixed upon us -- the normal school of self-government -- the last hope of humanity -- the great magnificent experiment of how 30,000,000 of people can shape their civil institutions. Mr. SEWARD closes his speech with a recommendation for every man to cultivate a respect for the Union. It you will allow me to close mine it will be impressed upon your own hearts and teach your children to love justice, to respect liberty, to claim free life, to let no commerce, however smiling, bribe them, to let no sacredness of parchment gag their lips, bu to swear on the altar which Christianity holds to every man the oath that the slave whom our fathers forgot, against whom they pledged their physical force -- sixty years of bondage that our fathers fastened upon them -- loss or no loss -- law or no law -- Constitution or no Constitution -- so far as in us lies, we will break those pillars and lift that race to a quality with ourselves.

The United States officer who brought him in put his felon hand into that pocket, took out those papers, tore them to pieces, and flung them into the fire. The next morning those hands went down melted in the slave population for ever. No remedy -- no redress. Is it a single instance? I have seen the Chief Justice of Massachusetts sitting on the bench of the Supreme Court, with a fugitive slave in front of him, who had proved twice his right to liberty that any of us have. He was born free as, well as we; and he had added a second title by taking his life into his own hand, and by vindicating his worth for Freedom by flying a thousand miles, through all the perils of life and death, to the streets of Boston Which ought to have sheltered him. He looked into the face of the Justice of Massachusetts and said, Have you any refuge for me? And with a voice broken by emotion the representative of the law of Massachusetts said, ""It is a hard case; I cannot vindicate it -- it is right, but I must announce the law."" If that is the Government that you are willing to have your children brought up to live under, -- if the pulpits of thirty States can announce that as a thing almost sacred, -- it the statesmen have no other name for it but swine, although they cannot vindicate it as right, but only announce the law, -- then, I say, ""side with the black man, and record traitor against my name -- side me with the rebel who has no purpose in life but to tear down that government."" I do it in the name of all these 200 years of liberty which our father-thought they were to inaugurate. I do it for the future with the eyes of the race fixed upon us -- the normal school of self-government -- the last hope of humanity -- the great magnificent experiment of how 30,000,000 of people can shape their civil institutions. Mr. SEWARD closes his speech with a recommendation for every man to cultivate a respect for the Union. It you will allow me to close mine it will be impressed upon your own hearts and teach your children to love justice, to respect liberty, to claim free life, to let no commerce, however smiling, bribe them, to let no sacredness of parchment gag their lips, bu to swear on the altar which Christianity holds to every man the oath that the slave whom our fathers forgot, against whom they pledged their physical force -- sixty years of bondage that our fathers fastened upon them -- loss or no loss -- law or no law -- Constitution or no Constitution -- so far as in us lies, we will break those pillars and lift that race to a quality with ourselves. And may God help you to keep the oath.

The steamer's hull was seen coming stern on, and before the bark could fall off, she was struck on the weather fore-rigging, carrying away mainsail, bulwarks, staunchions, and doing other damage. The bark, as soon as she could be got clear, was hove to, and during the night the officers and crew, numbering twenty, and three passengers, were taken off. The steamer sunk before the bark got out of sight. The passengers taken from the steamer were M.L. ROUSE and T.W. MILLER, of New-York, and GEORGE KELLEY, of Brooklyn, New-York. Mr. ROUSE, one of the passengers brought to this port in the bark, states that the gale commenced from the northwest on Monday the 12th, at noon, when the steamer was about 130 miles from Cape Hatteras. About 3 o'clock of the same day, the steamer was put about, in consequence of the leaking of one of the boilers. The storm still continuing, the steamer sprung aleak, when the pumps were put in operation, and kept at work during Tuesday and Wednesday, but still the water gained upon them, and about five o'clock, on Wednesday, a gale of wind still blowing, the bark was seen, and a collision took place as described. There was nearly nine feet of water in the hold at the time, and the ship was entirely unmanageable. The passengers saved nearly all their baggage, and a lot of provisions was also transferred to the bark.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Loss of the Steamer Commerce.; THE COLLISION WITH THE BARK DREBERT--NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Loss of the Steamer Commerce.; THE COLLISION WITH THE BARK DREBERT--NAMES OF THE PASSENGERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9cef1065-7d58-5b4a-97aa-b708d4a681b1,379,nyt://article/9cef1065-7d58-5b4a-97aa-b708d4a681b1,

Her bowsprit was gone, her sails and rigging were dragging alongside, and there was no one on board. On boarding her, Capt. SISTAEE discovered that the decks, fore and aft, were bes[???] with blood, and found human hair, matted with gore, scattered here and there, indicating that a murderers affray had probably taken place. Large pools of blood were found on the floor of the cabin, and table, chairs and stove were spattered. Everything was in confusion and disorder. A large hammer was found on which were portions of human hair and blood, showing that the murderous work [???], in part, been accomplished with that instrument. From the cabin-door to the side of the vessel there were marks of blood, apparently indicating that the victims had been drawn from the canon and thrown into the ocean. A pool of blood was visible near the scuppers, and there were traces of it on the outside of the vessel, and prints of bloody hands on the rail. Pools of blood also surrounded the must near the windless, and the red traces of crime were found on the mast and sails. The vessel was taken in charge by the Captain of the schooner, and shortly afterwards the steam-tug Ceres coming along, took both vessels in tow, and brought them to Ful[???]on Market slip. Cor[???] ner SCHIMMER, with his assistant. Dr. BOUGHTON, instituted [???] investigation. The Captain of the sloop was GEORGE BURR [???] slip, L.I., aged about 34 years, and has a family at that place.

The stormking has swept through the City on the wings of the wind and lighted the train of powder that our City authorities had permitted to be laid in every avenue and lane. The dust has curled up like smoke from a battle-field. Ash-carts laden -- the very calssons of the enemy -- rumbling through the streets these gusty mornings, have carried dismay to the hearts and debris to the eyes and nostrils of citizens. Every house has been a beleagured citadel, and servant-maids at the windows, armed with broom-stick and duster, like artillerymen at the port-holes of a fortress, have seemed to touch off pieces of mighty calibre, to the great discomfiture of all who happened to be within range. The washerwomen, our standard-bearers, whose banners had been given to the breeze from clothes-lines on house-tops and in back-yards, early struck their colors lest they should be seized and carried off as trophies by the foe when the sun crossed the line.

Mr. CLINGMAN opposed that provision of the bill which obliged each claimant to work five years before gaining a right to the land. In the course of an argument in favor of the measure Mr. HALE alluded to the strikes now in progress in Massachusetts, and expressed the hope that they would continue until the workmen engaged in them should obtain the highest wages compatible with the public good. Mr. WADE advocated the House bill; Mr. JOHNSON of Arkansas opposed it. Messrs. WIGFALL, PUGH, and JOHNSON of Tennessee, also took part in the debate, and finally the subject was postponed until Monday. In the House, Mr. NOELL spoke on the bill proposing to withdraw from the people of Utah the power of making their local laws through an elective assembly, which, he claimed, could never suppress polygamy. Some tribunal should be constituted which would protect not only the inhabitants of Utah, but the people of the Union. A resolution was adopted declaring it inexpedient to allow Mr. COOPER any further time to contest the seat of Mr. HOWARD of Michigan.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6ab209ad-d4e2-568c-b69f-e551f4291b11,1229,nyt://article/6ab209ad-d4e2-568c-b69f-e551f4291b11,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/23/archives/ventilation-as-influencing-health-and-longevity-lecture-by-mr-ey.html,,"Mr. E.Y. ROBBINS delivered the second of his course of lectures on ""Sanitary Science,"" at Cooper Institute last evening. His subject was ""Ventilation as Influencing Health and Longevity."" He commenced by saying that air was the prime necessary of life; that we could live more days without food than we could minutes without air. The purpose of our breathing was, first, to supply the blood with oxygen, which is the life-sustaining principle of the air, and second, to free the blood from carbonic acid and other impurities. The air which we breathe is found on expiration to have lost a large part of its oxygen, and to be impregnated with carbonic acid gas -- that substance which often proves fatal to persons who descend into wells, and which is the active agent of death in cases of suicide by burning charcoal. It produces death whether retained in the blood or inhaled into the lungs -- the poisoning process in both cases being precisely the same. To produce death by that agent, it was by no means necessary that it should be breathed in a pure state. Dr. CARPENTER had ascertained that air containing five or six per cent. of carbonic acid gas would produce immediate death, and that less than one-half that quantity would soon prove fatal; and Dr. T. HERBERT BARKER had ascertained by experiments with this substance, that an animal in an atmosphere containing only two per cent. of carbonic acid would die In about two hours. Now the air which we exhale from the lungs contains, according to standard authorities, about five per cent. of carbonic acid, and hence If exactly the same air were reinhaled it would quickly prove fatal. It is a substance that is constantly accumulating in the blood, and if it is not as constantly removed it will speedily produce death. The process of breathing is but the instinctive effort of nature to free herself from the presence of this poison. But air which has once been in the lungs will no longer perform this office, being already saturated with carbonic acid. Hence the necessity of inhaling fresh air at every breath. The importance of this was illustrated by Dr. SOUTHWOOD SMITH, who said: ""Stop the respiration of an animal, or confine it to air which has already been respired, and carbon accumulates in the venous blood and mixes with the arterial blood. In half a minute the blood flowing in the arteries is evidently darker; in three-quarters of a minute it is of a dusky hue, and in a minute and a half it is quite black. Every particle of arterial blood now disappears and the whole mass becomes venous, sensibility is abolished, the animal falls down, and in three, or at most in four minutes, the heart entirely ceases its action, and can never again be excited."" Now, if effects are proportioned to their causes, and if an atmosphere impregnated with five per cent. -- or one twentieth part of its volume -- of carbonic acid, will thus produce death in a few minutes, what must be the probable effect of breathing, for twenty or forty years, even the much minuter proportions which must be present in every inhabited room where there is not a. constant ingress end egress of air? It must lower the standard of health and shorten the duration of life. But not only is the air in a close room thus constantly being impregnated with carbonic acid gas to the amount of about 28 cubic inches per minute for each adult man occupying such room, but there is also, according to the best authorities, constantly being discharged by the lungs and pores of the skin, an equal amount, by weight -- that is, about 3 or 3 1/2 pounds in twenty-four hours -- of effete, decaying animal substance, in the form of insensible vapor, which, we often see condensed in drops upon the windows of crowded rooms and railroad-cars. Those drops, if collected and evaporated, leave a thick putrid mass of animal matter. The breathing of these exhalations is believed to be quite us efficient in producing disease as carbonic acid itself. Hut there is still a third deterioration produced in the air by respiration, and that is, the loss of its oxygen. Oxygen is the vital and life-supporting principle of the air, and it is found that, when the air enters the lungs, the blood absorbs about 40 per cent. of the oxygen which it contains. It is upon this we live; and the air that is exhaled being deficient by almost one-half in his vital element, of course can no longer support life. And as we inhale about 500 cubic inches of air every minute, we of course deprive that quantify of air of 40 per cent. of its oxygen each minute. The Creator has provided for the constant and complete removal of these poisonous exhalations by causing the expired air to rise, by its increased warmth and consequent levity, quickly above our heads and beyond the reach of a second inhalation, and by sweeping it away by the winds; but by our impervious ceilings and tight wails we obstruct the operation of this beneficent law, and prevent these poisonous exhalations from escaping. Hence the air of a close room, though occupied but by a single-person, becomes, from the very first moment of occupancy, impregnated with these impurities, which accumulate more and more, the longer it is occupied without ventilation, and the [???] it is crowded. It would certainly be difficult to over estimate the importance to life and health of the purity of the air we breathe, and it would also be difficult to determine to what period of duration human life might be prolonged, did we, and had our ancestors always breathed a perfectly pure atmosphere. A most remarkable, and convincing illustration of the effects of the quality of the air we breathe upon health, is to be found in the experience of the armies of England and France during the late Russian war. England, out of a total force of 93,959 men engaged in the campaign in the Crimea, lost 33,645, of which number only 2,658 were killed in action, and 1,761 died of wounds, while no less than 16,298 died of disease at the seat of war, and about 13,000 were sent home on account of sickness, many of whom, no doubt, afterwards died. To every one taken to the hospitals on account of wounds, twelve were taken there on account of disease. The chief destroyer was typhus fever. M. BOUDENS, Surgeon-in-Chief of the French army, in a letter written home during the war, says of this disease: ""It is engendered by crowding and want, either in hospitals, prisons, or on board of vessels. The disease may indeed be called forth and removed at will."" And he adds: ""The first remedy is pure air and powerful ventilation."" The great mortality in the English army was during the early period of the war. After the Sanitary Commissioners arrived and commenced their operations by securing greater ventilation, the sickness was stayed, and finally disappeared. The great panacea was fresh air. In the French army, where no sanitary reforms were introduced, the great mortality continued and increased, thus showing clearly that the changes made by the Sanitary Commissioners in the English army were the sole causes of the decrease of mortality where they labored. Recurring again to the condition of our buildings here, the lecturer said: In our school-rooms the matter is still worse; while in our railroad cars we have actually less breathing: room than the wretched prisoners in the black-hole of Calcutta -- they having had about forty cubic feet per man, while in our cars we have only an allowance of about thirty cubic feet. In addition to this, the lighting of our rooms in the evening is a source of great contamination to the air -- each gas burner being estimated to generate as much carbonic acid gas as the respiration of four persons, or more than 100 cubic inches per minute. Every gas burner should have a ventilating tube to carry off the products of combustion, and convey them entirely out of the room, as is the case in the Houses of Parliament, and many other public and private buildings in England. In conclusion, he stated his belief, that by due attention to sewerage and ventilation, the mortality of this City would be decreased ten thousand every year. The lecture, which occupied about an hour in reading, was listened to with great satisfaction by all present. When the lecture was concluded, Dr. HARRIS stated that the next lecture would be delivered on Monday evening.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ventilation as Influencing Health and Longevity.; LECTURE BY MR.

"The United States vs. James S. Williams. -- Judge SMALLEY charged the Jury in this case yesterday morning. He said there was no variance between the evidence and the indictment, and that the objection of the prisoner's counsel to the indictment, that there could be no conviction on the charge of having taken from the Post-office a letter containing a promissory note, because the note was not sufficiently described in the indic[???]ment, was not a valid one in this case. It was necessary, in order to convict the respondent, to prove that, at some time previous to the [???]ling of the indictment, and within two years, he took a letter from the Post-office, not addressed to himself, and in violation of law. In the first place, it was necessary for Government to prove that such a letter was mailed and in the Post-office, and regularly under the charge of the officers of that Department. In the second place, it was necessary to prove that it was taken from the office in violation of law and without right. And, in the third place, it was necessary to satisfy the jury that this respondent was the person who thus took the letter. All the evidence introduced subsequent to that period was only important as tending to fix the offence on the respondent. It was proved that a note for $3,000 was made by F.A. Williams, indorsed by Charles Johnson, payable at three months, which was mailed to the bank of Norwalk on the 12th or 13th of December, or sent by Express. There was little doubt that it was received at the Bank. There was no conflicting evidence on that point It was proved that the note was remailed to F.A. Williams, with a letter [???]eiling him that the Bank could not discount the note at three months, but if it was changed to a two months note the Bank would; and that a letter with the words ""From the Norwalk Bank"" printed on it, was received in the Post office in this City, and laid out to be advertised, and that a letter directed to F.A. Williams was advertised on the 23d December, as charged. It was proved that some one brought a note, altered from a three to a two months' note, to Adams' Express Company, and wrote some lines on a sheet of paper, signed it ""F.A. Williams,"" and sent it by the Express to the bank; that the letter and note were received; that the net proceeds of the note, after deducting discount and expenses -- $2,971 -- was, on the 27th of December, sent by the Express Company to the address of F.A. Williams, New-York; ""that it was delivered to the same person who had called before, and his receipt taken; and that neither F.A. Williams nor Charles Johnson took a letter containing the note from the post-office, or saw it after it was inclosed to Norwalk. Therefore the conclusion would seem to be irresistible that some one tortuously took the letter containing the note from the Post-office, and probably there would be as little doubt but that the person who presented the note on the 24th December, at the Express Office, and received the money package on the 28th, was the same person who tortuously took the letter from the Post office. So that it probably came down to this point: Who was the person who presented that note to the Express Office on the 24th of December, and obtained the money on the 28th? The Judge recalled the evidence upon which the prosecution rested; the testimony that the respondent was in the habit of examining the list of advertised letters; that he frequently inquired at the Post-office for letters directed to men named Williams, with different christian names from his own; that he had received one letter there not Addressed to him; and that he was the man who took the note to the Express Office. He presented the evidence brought by the respondent to meet some of this testimony, and commented upon the absence of evidence for the defence in some cases. The Court then adverted to the proof of handwriting, going to identify that on the paper written by the person who called at the Express Office on the 24th of December with the handwriting of Britton and Simpson, [now acknowledged to be the same with the respondent,] and to the circumstance that Williams on the 5th of January deposited $1,000 in the Citizen's Bank, in the name of James Simpson, and $1,500 in the Bowery Bank, on the 30th of December, in the names of John Britton, Henry Britton and Mary Britton. The reason for using feigned names was stated by the respondent's counsel to be that he had received this money from lottery offices and for electioneering purposes, which being contrary to the law of the State, he feared he would lose the money if deposited in his own name. Of this reason the jury should judge, as also of the testimony of Lawson and Doyle, lottery dealers, that they had each paid him in the neighborhood of $500 about this time. These men kept no accounts, and had no means of fixing the time, except from recollection. The jury were to consider whether the defendant had explained in a satisfactory manner his possession of this large sum of money in December and January -- he being shown to have worked as a carver for from $6 to $9 a week. Lastly the Court received the testimony of Messrs. McMenomy and Hewlet, to prove an alibi; and the evidence of the Government in rebuttal. While the experience of Courts had led them to regard that species of defence with great suspicion, yet it was the duty of the jury to consider it and give it whatever weight they thought it deserved. They were to say, from all the evidence, whether they were satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the respondent took the letter, as charged, from the post-office; and if they came to that conclusion it was their duty to find him guilty.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/24/archives/law-reports-united-states-circuit-court-the-case-of-mistaken.html,,"The United States vs. James S. Williams. -- Judge SMALLEY charged the Jury in this case yesterday morning. He said there was no variance between the evidence and the indictment, and that the objection of the prisoner's counsel to the indictment, that there could be no conviction on the charge of having taken from the Post-office a letter containing a promissory note, because the note was not sufficiently described in the indic[???]ment, was not a valid one in this case. It was necessary, in order to convict the respondent, to prove that, at some time previous to the [???]ling of the indictment, and within two years, he took a letter from the Post-office, not addressed to himself, and in violation of law. In the first place, it was necessary for Government to prove that such a letter was mailed and in the Post-office, and regularly under the charge of the officers of that Department. In the second place, it was necessary to prove that it was taken from the office in violation of law and without right. And, in the third place, it was necessary to satisfy the jury that this respondent was the person who thus took the letter. All the evidence introduced subsequent to that period was only important as tending to fix the offence on the respondent. It was proved that a note for $3,000 was made by F.A. Williams, indorsed by Charles Johnson, payable at three months, which was mailed to the bank of Norwalk on the 12th or 13th of December, or sent by Express. There was little doubt that it was received at the Bank. There was no conflicting evidence on that point It was proved that the note was remailed to F.A. Williams, with a letter [???]eiling him that the Bank could not discount the note at three months, but if it was changed to a two months note the Bank would; and that a letter with the words ""From the Norwalk Bank"" printed on it, was received in the Post office in this City, and laid out to be advertised, and that a letter directed to F.A. Williams was advertised on the 23d December, as charged. It was proved that some one brought a note, altered from a three to a two months' note, to Adams' Express Company, and wrote some lines on a sheet of paper, signed it ""F.A. Williams,"" and sent it by the Express to the bank; that the letter and note were received; that the net proceeds of the note, after deducting discount and expenses -- $2,971 -- was, on the 27th of December, sent by the Express Company to the address of F.A. Williams, New-York; ""that it was delivered to the same person who had called before, and his receipt taken; and that neither F.A. Williams nor Charles Johnson took a letter containing the note from the post-office, or saw it after it was inclosed to Norwalk. Therefore the conclusion would seem to be irresistible that some one tortuously took the letter containing the note from the Post-office, and probably there would be as little doubt but that the person who presented the note on the 24th December, at the Express Office, and received the money package on the 28th, was the same person who tortuously took the letter from the Post office. So that it probably came down to this point: Who was the person who presented that note to the Express Office on the 24th of December, and obtained the money on the 28th? The Judge recalled the evidence upon which the prosecution rested; the testimony that the respondent was in the habit of examining the list of advertised letters; that he frequently inquired at the Post-office for letters directed to men named Williams, with different christian names from his own; that he had received one letter there not Addressed to him; and that he was the man who took the note to the Express Office. He presented the evidence brought by the respondent to meet some of this testimony, and commented upon the absence of evidence for the defence in some cases. The Court then adverted to the proof of handwriting, going to identify that on the paper written by the person who called at the Express Office on the 24th of December with the handwriting of Britton and Simpson, [now acknowledged to be the same with the respondent,] and to the circumstance that Williams on the 5th of January deposited $1,000 in the Citizen's Bank, in the name of James Simpson, and $1,500 in the Bowery Bank, on the 30th of December, in the names of John Britton, Henry Britton and Mary Britton.

If there is one proposition better defined and understood than other propositions, it is that a city railway, such, for instance, as the Fourth-avenue, as to track and all our City railways as to accommodations -- is a very great obstacle, and a source of enormous repair expenses to all common vehicles traversing the street; and that the system of furnishing the conditions of discomfort for the price of luxury, is both an unnecessary and an intolerable nuisance to the whole people.

The offender, while at the Princeton Theological Seminary some months since, conducted himself in such a manner as to merit the censure of the officers of the Institution, and when he applied for letters of recommendation to another institution, he was denied them. But he presented a letter, over the signature of Dr. MCGILL, of Princeton, to the Union Theological Seminary, and was admitted. Some dishonorable transactions alleged against him came to the ears of the Faculty, and they began to inquire into the young man's antecedents. They found that, so far from having sustained a good character where he had been well known, he was considered to be ""bad at heart,"" and that his ""letters"" were forgeries. Consequently, Dr. ROBINSON, in the presence of Dr. SMITH and all the students of the Seminary, read the decision of the Faculty that Mr. JAMIESON be expelled.

"In the House of Commons on the 9th, Lord J. RUSSELL said -- Mhe noble lord the member for Durham (Lord A.V. TEMPEST) has put to me some questions on a subject of great public interest, and I feel bound to give him such information as I am able in reply to those questions. He asks me if I have taken any steps -- and if to, what the nature of those steps is -- to obtain the concurrence of Austria, Prussia and Russia in protesting against the rumored annexation of Savoy to France. Now, the course which we have adopted in that respect has been to communicate the correspondence which has taken place between her Majesty's Government and that of France on the subject to the Courts of Berlin, Vienna and St. Petersburg. I may add that we contented ourselves with simply communicating that correspondence, and desiring that a copy of it should be handed to the Governments of each of those countries respectively, without asking them to take any steps or to make any suggestion in the matter, but leaving them to adopt such a course as they might deem expedient on a question which is of importance to the interests of Europe. [Hear, hear.] With respect to the probable result of this proceeding I am quite unable to supply the noble lord with any information beyond this, that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs both at Vienna and Berlin say that they agree generally with the views of her Majesty's Government on this subject. Neither at Berlin nor Vienna, however, is it absolutely stated what steps their respective Governments propose to take in a matter which certainly requires careful consideration. From St. Petersburg I have received no account with regard to it, probably because the dispatch which we sent there was not forwarded so soon as those which were sent to Vienna and Berlin. I may at the same time observe that when any information in answer to the dispatch which we forwarded to St. Petersburg reaches us, we shall be prepared to lay it on the table the moment it is in a state to be thus communicated to the House. We shall, I may add, have some correspondence from Berlin and Vienna to lay on the table on Monday. The noble lord has asked me further whether we are acquainted with the final intentions of Sardinia in reference to the annexation of Savoy to France. Now, in answer to that question, I may state that I had placed in my hands, by a private friend of Count CAVOUR, a document which was said to be a copy of the Sardinian reply to the proposal of France, but I have been since informed that this document is not quite correct, and therefore I cannot, until I receive further information on the subject from Her Majesty's Minister in Turin, lay on the table any paper in reference to this particular point. I may, however, observe that the substance of the reply of Count CAVOUR is to the effect that, if the Parliament of Sardinia should deem it expedient to have re[???]ourse to a vote of the people of Savoy with respect to the question of its annexation to France, the Sardinian Government would take care that that vote should be taken with every form of liberty, so that the people of Savoy might exercise perfect freedom of choice in deciding whether they would continue under the Sardinian Government or prefer a separation from that country. The answer of Count CAVOUR then proceeds to state that, should the people of Savoy be in favor of separation, the Government of Sardinia trusts the question will be duly weighed by the other Powers of Europe, and that care will be taken not only of the interests of Switzerland, but due regard will be paid to the security of the frontiers of the Kingdom of Sardinia itself. So far as Switzerland is concerned, I believe the views of the Government of that country upon this subject remain quite unchanged, as the dispatches which I hope to be able to lay on the table on Monday will prove.

The attendance was fuller than usual, which may be ascribed to the weather or the programme, according to the taste of the reader. BEETHOVEN'S second Symphony opened the Concert, and its quaint beauties were very ably interpreted by the orchestra under Mr. BEEGMANN's direction. A composition by LISZT, called ""Tasso,"" and further described as a Poeme Symphonique, was the attraction of the second part. Like everything else that LISZT has ever written, it is filled with startling effects, displaying rare knowledge of how to produce them. Beyond this technical recommendation and a borrowed theme, we could detect nothing worthy of remembrance. A well informed orchestra might improvise a similar composition, but how a well-informed orchestra can endure such deliberate non-sequences as a matter of choice, surpasses our comprehension. We can account for it only on the ground that any new combination of instrumental effects becomes pleasing after a certain amount of familiarity. The work, considering its excessive tediousness, was well performed. It fell flat, however, on the audience.

Any body but a Gothamite would think remedying this worth one earnest and general effort -- the sacrifice of a little precious business time. But the second nuisance is a sacrifice of precious business time; and as it is exaggerated by the yearly upward movement of residential quarters, the key note of our driving, hurrying, restless American character will be struck, and we may hope for reform. It will soon require double the time now occupied to reach the centre of dwellings from the centre of business. An hour's ride, wedged in a City rail-car, without room enough to open a newspaper, and the reeking air of side streets to breathe withal -- think of it! The New-Jersey monopoly will carry us twenty miles an hour, with defined and incompressible sitting space and under comparative circumstances of Oriental luxury, far into the quiet and wholesome country. If we are to travel by the hour, let us by all means seek green pastures, ample seats, heat, light, air and a show of decency. Could one even read or converse -- could one even exist without annoyance, uncompressed and in a normal posture, warmed in Winter and cooled in Summer, an hour's ride to the Central Park region would not be intolerable. But slow speed and long distances, superadded to present inconveniences, and all this without reduction of fares, or a diminution of taxes by the selling of these money-coining grants to the companies, is rather more than even the State Government can expect to saddle upon us. To render this semidiurnal penance of getting to business and back tolerable -- barely tolerable -- two new features are indispensable: more railroads and better accommodations. New-York groans for more and better railroads. Look at Broadway, with its tangled mesh of creeping omnibuses and its side-walks full of merchandise, garbage-boxes, stumbling-blocks and abominations; look at our few railroads, with their portable pens, more like the holds of slave-ships than the metropolitan conveyances of decent citizens -- and our business and our houses separated by this inevitable Styx.

Capt. WEED deceived the numbers who had gathered about the Station-house, and who, in the excitement of the moment, gave utterance to threats of violence against the prisoner, by removing him in a carriage from the rear of the building, while another vehicle, placed in front of the door, with a number of policemen keeping a passage-way in front of it, gave ground for the belief that the prisoner would leave that way. As soon as the ruse was discovered, which was not until half an hour after it had been carried into effect, the crowd added itself to that which had already gathered around the Marshal's office. All manifested the utmost eagerness to get a glimpse at the alleged culprit. He was conducted into the main office of the Marshal, where he remained for an hour and a half, during which time scores of persons were permitted to enter and gratify their curiosity by looking at the criminal, but no one held any conversation with him. He sat handcuffed in one corner of the room, and met the scrutinizing gaze of his multitude of visitors without betraying the slightest emotion of any kind. In fact he did not appear from his actions to be conscious that he was any more the object of curiosity than any one else in the crowd. He is not vicious-looking, and the universal expression of those who see him, for the first time, is that of disappointment in finding so ""good-looking a man,"" when they expected to behold a monster.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE TRAGEDIES AT SEA.; The Two Alleged Murderers in Custody.

"All day yesterday the excitement concerning the sloop Spray, of Guilford, Conn., and the mysterious fate of her captain and his brother, continued to increase. The vessel, which had been hauled into shoal water inside the Battery wall, was visited by crowds of persons, who were curious to learn everything which would tend to throw light upon the affair. A force of Harbor Policemen preserved order, and prevented the people from crowding on to the sloop's deck while the investigations were going on. Several personal acquaintances of Capt. LEETE, and of his brothers, from among the crews of the market vessels, came to look at the wreck. While the tide was falling the police examined the cabin of the sloop, which was still under water. With a boat-hook they fished out from the berths various articles, such as clothing, bedding, coils of rigging, &c. Among them was a white cotton shirt, which was much stained with something red, but there was a difference of opinion as to whether it was blood or iron-rust. A gray woolen under-shirt was found with thick red stains near the neck, which, when it was pressed, came off on to the hand, and might have been blood. Soon a bed-tick came up. It had been filled with feathers, but they had been washed out. On this tick, near one end, were conspicuous stains as of blood a foot or more in circumference. Shortly afterwards a white cotton under bed-tick was recovered, which had large bloody spots in various places. The discovery of these articles removed all doubts that a murder had been committed, and it seemed apparent that the bloody deed had been stealthily perpetrated while the victims were in their berths. A laborious search was made in every part of the vessel which could be reached for the dead bodies, which it was supposed might be below, but no traces of them were found. The bloody bed-clothing was taken to the office of the Harbor Police to be dried. The public curiosity having thus been satisfied, and the seeming evidences of crime brought to light, the eager crowd gradually dispersed, and left the Harbor Police in possession of the vessel. She is an old-fashioned sloop of about 40 tons burden, with a flush deck, and a cabin which is entered from abaft. The bowsprit, mast and boom are gone, and fragments of the mainsail, jib, and rigging, are scattered over the deck, with two or three barrels, and coils of rope, one of which is of new Manilla.

BURR at sea. The idea is very common, that there can be no conviction for murder unless the body of the killed be found. It is true there is a rule that no person should be convicted in the absence of the body; and a very great English Judge once said: ""I would never convict any person of murder or manslaughter, unless the fact was proved to be done, or the body be found dead."" But this must be taken with qualification; and the circumstances may be sufficiently strong to show the fact of the murder, though the body has never been found. Thus, where a prisoner, a mariner named CLARK, was indicted in England for the murder of his captain at sea, and a witness stated that the prisoner had proposed to kill the captain; that the witness, being afterwards alarmed in the night by a violent noise, went upon deck, and there observed the prisoner take the captain up and throw him overboard into the sea, and that he was not seen or heard of afterwards; that near the place on the deck where the captain was seen, a billet of wood was found; and that the deck and part of the prisoner's dress were stained with blood, -- the Court, though admitting the general rule of law, left it to the jury to say, upon the evidence, whether the deceased was not killed before his body was cast into the sea; and the jury being of that opinion, the prisoner was convicted, and -- the conviction being approved of by all the judges -- was afterwards executed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mysterious Murders.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mysterious Murders.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca891743-fc7c-592f-936e-6fdb4f866e65,706,nyt://article/ca891743-fc7c-592f-936e-6fdb4f866e65,

CRUMMINS seems to realize keenly his unfortunate situation, and does not look composedly upon his impending doom. He tells his visitors, who are very numerous, the same story with reference to the murder, that the related in Court, when his sentence was pronounced. The circumstances, as developed by the testimony, showed that MCHENRY, who bore a very bad reputation, came to CRUMMINS' house and insulted his wife. An altercation ensuing, CRUMMINS pursued his opponent into the street with a musket, and then returned to his house. MCHENRY soon came back and resumed his insulting language, which so exasperated CRUMMINS that he threw a weight at his head, the deceased resenting the attack by throwing stones at him, CRUMMINS finally rushed upon MCHENRY, and stabbed him three times with a sword, while he lay prostrate on the ground, having fallen in his attempt to elude his pursuer, and these wounds resulted in his death. CRUMMINS asserts that he committed the act in the heat of passion, without being conscious at the time of its performance. He is represented as having always borne a good character, being of a peaceable disposition, but easily excited. Earnest efforts are in progress to secure a commutation of his sentence by the Governor, or at least a further reprieve, and a petition for this object, bearing many influential names, was carried to Albany last evening by a deputation of citizens.

BURR and of the brothers WATTS. The officers set out early in the morning in a small boat, but the water was so very rough that after skirting the shore as far as Bay Ridge, they abandoned that mode of conveyance, and performed the remainder of their journey on foot. Calling at every house on their route, they explained the object of their visit, and obtained from the fishermen a promise that they would be vigilant in watching for the bodies. At Gravesend Bay they secured a black cloth cap, trimmed with fur, that had been washed ashore a day or two ago. Mr. SNEDICOR, who resides at Gravesend Bay, told them that the E.A. Johnson had anchored there on the Saturday previous to the commission of the murders and that he believed the cap was the same that Capt. BURR wore on that occasion. At the Point Comfort House, on the South side of Coney Island, the officers also obtained from FRANCIS ANTONI and EDWARD ROACH a low-crowned tarpaulin hat and another cloth cap, which had been picked up on the beach, last Saturday morning. A canvas money-bag, marked on one side ""Mechanics and Farmers' Bank, Albany, $4,000, gold,"" and on the reverse ""Mercantile Bank, New-York, $4,000,"" was likewise found near the articles mentioned. This bag is stained with finger-prints, which strongly resemble blood stains. Sergeant BREVOORT, in whose charge these articles were placed, proposes to renew the search to-day. Towards night-fall, the body of a man was seen floating through Buttermilk Channel, and three boats of the Harbor Police were sent to secure it, but darkness coming on they were not successful. It is thought that it may have been the body of either the Captain of the sloop Spray or his brother, who, it is supposed, were murdered up the Sound, and which it is quite likely by this time may have floated down to the harbor.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE E.A.

Such a law has been introduced, as our readers know, at Albany. It was drawn up, not under the pressure of the tremendous facts revealed by the Legislative inquiry of 1856 into the moral and material condition of the tenement population of the metropolis; not for the purpose of diminishing the aggregate of human disease and human crime engendered by the inadequacies and the indecencies of the accommodation provided for thousands of American citizens in this richest of American cities; not with the determined intention on the part of our Republican law-makers to attack fever in its strongholds, and incest in its dens. True, the report of the Legislative Committee of 1856 had exposed the existence of these strongholds and the horrible influences of these dens. It had painted simply, clearly, without coloring too intense, or forms too exaggerated, a picture of life in New-York, from which we should have shrunk in horror and incredulity had it been offered to us as an image of the wynds of Glasgow or the slums of the He St. Louis. But the matter had slept, for no special catastrophe came to thrust it in all its hideous realities before the community at large.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Tenure by Fire.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Tenure by Fire.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0069cf24-f5b3-51ac-90ab-9535048fd899,831,nyt://article/0069cf24-f5b3-51ac-90ab-9535048fd899,

The fire is believed to have been the work of an incendiary, because when first discovered it was confined entirely to the stairway of the house, No. 90, in which six families resided. There were four buildings in all, Nos. 84, 86, 88, and 90, and they were of the very worst description of tenement-houses. They were constructed about nine years ago, during the excitement among property owners in the vicinity of the site of the Crystal Palace, and were mere wooden shells, four stories in height, and partitioned so as to permit of their being occupied by the very largest number of families possible The building in which the fire originated was occupied -- the first floor by MARTIN REDMAN, as a grocery and liquor store; and the upper floors by five large families, as follows: On the second floor there were TIMOTHY NOLAN, his wife and four children, and Mr. KEARNEY, a widower, and his two children. The third floor front was occupied by Mr. WM. IRVING, wife and four children. On the rear of the third floor was THOMAS BENNETT, wife and four children. The fourth floor was occupied by ANDREW WHEELER, wife and four children. The only means of ingress and egress was a stairway three feet in width, so of course as soon as that was on fire there remained no places of exit except the windows. The fire was discovered soon after 1 o'clock in the morning, when all who were in the house were in bed. Before any of them were awakened to their danger, many of them were nearly stifled by the dense smoke that filled the various rooms. The alarm was given, and all who were able ran to the stairs, but only to be met and driven back by the ascending flames. The scene at this time is described by those who were present as appalling. The inmates could be seen running hither and thither, seeking a way of escape, but finding none. While the increasing flames rose higher and higher, and they were forced from one floor to another by the intense beat, the shriekings of the women and children were terrible to hear. Those outside looked on with feelings of horror, for, until the firemen arrived with their apparatus, they could do nothing to save them. With remarkable alacrity, even for New-York firemen, Hook and Ladder Company No. 8 came to the scene. There was immediately a hope expressed that those in the building might yet be saved, for the firemen lost no time in rearing a ladder against the building, and springing to the rescue, and the fire had not yet reached the upper story; but through their very eagerness to save those in peril, the time and the means were lost. All being anxious to rescue some one, too many climbed the ladder, and it gave way, bringing them all to the ground. Those inside who saw the ladder break, and who were not yet suffocated, gave one heart-rending cry, and it was the last. All who were able rushed to the windows and sprang out, preferring to die by the fall rather than by fire. In this way quite a number escaped without serious injury. The engines were now at work, but the fire had reached the roof, which was composed of canvass, covered with a layer of pitch, and over that a sprinkling of gravel and small stones. As soon as the flames touched the pitched canvas, the fire spread rapidly over all four of the buildings, and in a few minutes the upper stories were in a blaze. The inmates of all excepting No. 90 had, however, had sufficient warning, and they escaped; and with the assistance of Steam Fire Engine No. 46, the fire was soon extinguished. In a short time, all who were supposed to be alive of the former residents, were brought together, and it was ascertained that Mrs. WHEELER and her four children, and Mrs. BENNETT and her four children, had been [???] to death.

"SCIENCE. -- The third lecture of the course on Sanitary Science was delivered by Dr. E.Y. ROBBINS at Clinton Hall, on Monday evening, before a select audience. The subject was the ""The Application of Sanitary Science, as a means of moral improvement, and for the prevention of pauperism and crime. The first point touched upon was the deaths of children, from 12,000 to 15,000 of whom, under five years of age, die yearly in this City, mostly from the impurity of the air they breathe. Marasmus, convulsions, cholera infantum, hydro-cephalus, pneumonia, are the monsters which feed on infants. The lecturer advocated the establishment of public nurseries, airy, commodious asylums, where the children of destitute parents might be nurtured. There was nothing Utopian in the suggestion. Paganism, in ancient Sparta, made all the children the care of the State, and should Christian charity do less? Even the children of rich parents might be benefited, for Fashion could not afford to let the child grow up healthily. Pneumonia destroyed as many children of the rich as it did of the poor. In view of the scant covering which Fashion allowed to their necks and arms, humanity might suggest that a ""Fashionable Children's Protective Society"" might be formed, to provide fitting clothing for the fashionably exposed children of the best circles. The moral effect of crowded and ill-ventilated rooms, where a whole family, and sometimes two families, live and sleep together, was next considered. The teachings of the Sabbath School were powerless against the daily teachings of an immoral home. For the ten thousand roving children, homeless, or worse than homeless, in this City, the doctor made an eloquent and powerful appeal. In reference to the various relations of his subject, he frequently quoted, and always with apt effect, from the writings of the Earl of SHAFTESBURY, and the Rev. CHARLES KINGSLEY and SYDNEY TURNER. The lecture was singularly effective, and it is to be regretted that it was listened to by so few persons.

After some other unimportant amendments the bill was read a third time and passed. An interesting debate occurred in the House on the bill recently reported from the Committee on the Judiciary to suppress polygamy in the Territories of the United States. Mr. BRANCH suggested that if polygamy was declared criminal, there would be no reason why the same action might not be taken regarding Slavery. He could not vote for this provision of the bill, which made penal laws applicable to all the Territories of the United States. Neither could Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. CLARK stated that the Committee on Territories had it in contemplation to report a bill parceling out Utah among the neighboring territories, so that the people themselves might remove the evil of polygamy. A disposition decidedly favorable to the measure under discussion was shown by the vote on a motion to lay the subject on the table, 19 members recording their names in the affirmative, and 148 in the negative. Five thousand extra copies of the report on our commercial relations, and of the last volume of the survey for a Pacific Railroad by Gov. STEVENS, were ordered to be printed.

GORDON on the 18th of October last. The circumstances of the case were briefly as follows: ACKER and GORDON, who had been friends and fellow- workmen, met at a tavern in Montville on the day of the murder, and after indulging freely in drink, had a slight quarrel. During the interview at the tavern GORDON displayed a sum of money amounting to about $30, and it is supposed that this, and not the quarrel, furnished the inducement to the commission of the crime. ACKER parted from GORDON at the hotel, and concealing himself by the roadside leading to the residence of GORDON, waited for his approach. After the latter had passed, ACKER came up behind him and struck him on the back of the head with a stone, knocking him senseless. He then dragged him into the field, cut his throut, and rifled his pockets. After going home to bed, being unable to sleep, the guilty man arose, returned to the scene of the murder, and buried the body in the sand, where it was found five days after. ACKER was arrested on suspicion, and his trial took place at Morristown last February, and resulted in a verdict of guilty. On being sentenced, he said, in answer to the usual question, that he was ""innocent of the crime."" Subsequently, however, he made a full confession of the murder, which, together with the report of the trial, has been published for the benefit of his family. In his confession, he attributes his ruin to indulgence in ardent spirits, and warns his associates against that fatal vice. Since his imprisonment he has manifested an apparent indifference and insensibility to his fate. Latterly he has charged visitors 25 cents a head for seeing him, devoting the proceeds to his wife, who has been constant in her attentions to him during his confinement.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.; Execution of Acker at Morristown.

After Tompkins had traced the man a short distance he met Officer Cottrell, of the same Precinct, who was in citizen's dress, and directing him to follow the suspected party, so that suspicion on his part would not be excited, Officer Tompkins dropped behind. Soon Newell entered another store in the vicinity, where he sought to dispose of the same worthless bill, when his arrest was immediately effected. The prisoner was taken to the Stationhouse, where, having been searched, $5 in worthless money was found upon him, and he was identified as a resident in a house in Fifty-second-street, near Eleventh-avenue, that the Police had supposed was the resort of a gang of counterfeiters. The officers determined to go there and arrest its inmates. In answer to their summons for admission John M. Parker alias Garrett, came to the door, but on learning the nature of the officers' business, he drew a large self-cocking rifled barrelled pistol and threatened to shoot the first man that dared to touch him. The officers were unarmed, and as a young man, named Frederick Miller, besides two females, were also arrayed against them, Thompson left to obtain assistance, while Cottrell remained to guard the place. Capt. Coulter and a force of men soon arrived and arrested Parker, Miller and the two females, but it subsequently appeared that the interval between the departure of the officer for aid and his return with it, had been occupied by the prisoners in destroying the evidences of their guilt. One of the women, who claimed to be Parker's wife, was found in a bedroom on the second floor engaged in burning thick bundles of bank notes in the grate; fragments of the bills were lying around the fender. An attempt was made to secure some of the charred paper, upon which the letters and figures were still visible, but the woman snatched it from the officer, and afterwards thrust the remainder down into the fire with her bare hands, thus effectually concealing all trace of the greater part of it. The prisoners were all conveyed to the Station-house and locked up to await examination. Some $ 13, mostly in altered bank bills, on various banks, in different stages or preparation, were found upon them. A portion of the money was recovered from the stockings of one of the females. A partial search of the house resulted in finding a large quantity of chemicals, rolls of bank-note paper, metal for the manufacture of bogus coin, and a variety of other articles and implements, supposed to be used by counterfeiters. The house, which is one of a row of neat four-story brick buildings, will be thoroughly overhauled by the police, when doubtless other evidences of the guilt of the accused will be furnished.

His third lecture was devoted to Mad. RECAMIER and her salon, of which he gave a spirited and very interesting description, with notices of the principal personages who made those gatherings to famous. Last evening he opened his lecture by some spirited and exceedingly discriminating remarks in answer to the question whether such assemblages as have made French society famous -- gatherings in which conversation and social intercourse were the chief and sufficient attractions, -- were possible in this country, -- whether in a word the salon could be introduced here. A. writer in the last British Review has discussed the same question in regard to England, and answered in the negative, mainly on the ground, natural for an Englishman, that the English people are above such trifling. Prof. CHARLIER took a very different view of the subject, and found the only obstacles to the salon here in the incessant occupation of Americans, in the lack of a class of cultivated, scholarly, rich people, who have plenty of leisure, and in the fact that those who are not rich already, are resolutely and laboriously seeking to become so. He found plenty of social gatherings here -- but the people at them are either stiff and pre-occupied with their own thoughts, or else they break up into knots, and talk about business, politics, or other topics uppermost in their thoughts. Conversation seldom becomes general -- turning upon themes in which all are interested, and enlisting the participation, as well as the attention, of the whole company. Still he had found circles in New-York society where this was not the case -- and he was inclined to think, therefore, that the salon, in the French sense of the word, might and would be successfully introduced into America.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Prof. Charlier's French Lectures."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Prof. Charlier's French Lectures."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f1df28ab-4048-582c-877c-d6cb86a3c98d,643,nyt://article/f1df28ab-4048-582c-877c-d6cb86a3c98d,

The Cardinal dwells at great length on this point. He also endeavors to throw blame on France for the campaign in Lombardy, but prudence gets the better of his resentment, and, suddenly coming to the real point in question, he declares that it ought to be well understood that if the Pope rejects the counsels of his protector, it is because he is compelled to do so by a higher principle, and that, moreover, that is not the exact point to be considered, but the promises of assistance given last year, in the month of March, by the Ambassadors of France and Austria.",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PAPAL QUESTION.; Reply of the Papal Government to the French Proposals.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PAPAL QUESTION.; Reply of the Papal Government to the French Proposals.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01a837da-2c46-5819-8da6-b3f259396e26,2046,nyt://article/01a837da-2c46-5819-8da6-b3f259396e26,

"As far as depends on the vote of the population the fate of Central Italy is now decided. The result of the elections in all four provinces of Tuscany, Parma, Modena, and the Romagna, is now sufficiently known: By enormous majorities, by a vote almost amounting to unanimity, the people have decided for annexation to the Sardinian Kingdom, and have utterly rejected both the claims of their legitimate Sovereigns and the scheme which has been lately put forward by the Emperor of the French. So important a political act has not been performed since the Autumn of 1852, when the French nation, by a vote almost as decisive, overthrew the Republic, which had been founded less than five years before, and established the Imperial Monarchy which now rules their country. The present appeal to universal suffrage will, however, have the sympathies of Englishmen more than any former display of the kind. It can not be doubted that the act of the population is sincere. A nation which has suffered more than any other in Europe, the whole of whose modern history has been a long record of oppression, -- a nation which has not only never known public liberty and national independence, but whose private life has been embittered and degraded by all that the petty tyranny of Courts and the bad activity of a police can perpetrate, has at length been able to pronounce in favor of union and constitutional government. No one -- not even Lord NORMANBY, not even the organs of the Viennese Government -- will venture to say that this extraordinary vote does not express the real feeling of the Italian people. There is no question of force or fraud, of terrorized peasants and cheating ballot-boxes. The Pope, the Austrian Press, the Ultra-montane Clergy, and their few sympathizers in this country, will be able to say that the Italian people are mad, possessed, led away by the teachings of atheists and revolutionaries; but they will be obliged to confess that, right or wrong, whole mass of them utterly reject the Government under which they have hitherto lived, and desire to link their fate to that of the monarch against which Austria would willingly let slip the dogs of war, and at whose head the Pope is ready to hurl an excommunication. Where all are so completely in favor of annexation, it is impossible to say that any one province exceeds the other in enthusiasm. But, undoubtedly, the vote in Tuscany and in the Romagna has a greater importance than in the two minor provinces. The French Government had already assented to the union of Parma and Modena with VICTOR EMANUEL's kingdom, and consequently the voting there may be taken as merely formal. The addition of these small States to Piedmont seems to excite no jealousy on the part of the Power which desires the Alps as a protection against a too powerful Italy. Austria has made up her mind not to interfere, the population is known to be friendly to Piedmont, they have no traditions of provincial rivalry to keep them apart, and their addition to King VICTOR EMANUEL's domains may be taken as a matter of course. But we own that we have been much relieved by the approach to unanimity in Tuscany and the Romagna, for the destiny of these provinces still hangs in the balance. The French Emperor cannot be considered to have given up his plan of an independent kingdom in Tuscany and of a Piedmontese regency in the Papal province. If any considerable number of voters had pronounced in favor of these views the destinies of the two provinces might be very doubtful. A party favorable to Papal suzerainty and to a new Duchy of Tuscany would, when disclosed by the ballot-box, have given encouragement to all the enemies of Italian unity. The apparatus for working on continental populations has been carried to such perfection in certain quarters that we may be sure that a fourth, or even a fifth, of the Tuscans or Romagnoli, if supported by France or Austria, would have the power to counteract the wishes of the great majority. But happily, and we should think somewhat to the surprise of the French Government, the propositions emanating from Paris have found hardly a partisan in the two provinces. By the telegrams which we publish it will be seen that in Tuscany not one elector in 25 voted for the separate kingdom. The list is made up, with the exception of 108 communes, and stands thus: For annexation to Piedmont, 259,000; for the separate kingdom, 10,729. Now, we do think that this is a most remarkable and important result. Nothing can show the fixed resolution of the Italian people more than the Tuscan vote. The Duchy and its celebrated metropolis have a long and glorious history. Every Florentine has been accustomed to consider his city as a capital, as rivaling Rome in the presidency of Italian cities, as the pure fount of Italian literature, and the classic home of art. Nor has the Florentine jealousy of other cities wholly died out. Many very practical politicians have been in favor of preserving the present Italian sovereignties, and being content with uniting them in something like a federation, and this solely on the ground that neither Milan, Florence, nor Turin would ever recognize the claims of any city but itself to be the capital of the monarchy. This sentiment has been appealed to and encouraged by the manifesto of the French Emperor. Florence has been told that the greatest potentate of the Continent thinks she should still remain a capital city, and that the banks of the Arno should still be honored with the residence of a Court and the throng of visitors from all parts of the world. To give up, or, at least, to stand the chance of giving up all this, and at the same time to offend the master of half a million of men, has been the choice of the Tuscans. They have voted unconditional annexation to Piedmont, and the small minority which has listened to the counsels of M. THOUVENEL only serves to show the preponderance of the opposite opinion.

The deed was found out about 6 1/2 o'clock -- some five hours and a half after its commission -- traces of blood being discovered by the members of the family, and traced up until the mutilated body of Mr. FOWLKES was found about half a mile from the house, on the side of the Southside Railroad, covered with sand. The traces were also found to lead from one of the kitchens occupied by a portion of the servants of the deceased, and blood was found upon some of their clothing. The negroes were also seen at an early hour covering up the blood, as it since proves, along the road, which, had fallen as they conveyed the body away; and the horse which he generally rides was found tied to a limb near to where he lay, and had, apparently, trampled on his face. The authorities of the County, as soon as aware of the crime, commenced prompt measures towards the investigation of the affair, and fixed 11 o'clock for the time of the holding of the inquest. Previous to the leaving of the mail train for this city, our informant learned that the negroes were in custody, and had confessed the crime. It appears, also, that at about 1 o'clock, near which hour the murder occurred, the deceased, hearing a noise in the kitchen, left the house, and went to the kitchen to ascertain the cause of it. He did not return again. It is supposed that they then and there seized and dispatched him before he could recover from among them.

"We are, in this Chinese difficulty, in the multitude of counsellors, destitute of counsel. Mr. BRIGHT makes his stereotyped declaration that the Chinese are angels and the English are miscreants, and, with a pompous and rather pharisaical protest, washes his hands of the whole business.

ELPHINSTONE in effect did last night, to trust it all to them, and let neither statesman or diplomatist meddle with it. We are warned by no means to go to Peking. All sorts of horrors are predicted from a march over a hundred miles of level, hedgeless country. The Chinese Court is depicted as so ancient and magnificent in its power and grandeur that we ought not to do anything to provoke it. Again, it is said to be so rickety, so insolvent, so powerless to protect its own subjects, or to gather its own taxes, that we ought to abstain from touching it, lest it crumble under our fingers. We are bid at the same time to tremble before a mighty monarchy, and to stand aside, lest we are covered by the dust of a falling ruin. If either of these were true, we might ask, ""Why should we spare this strong Government?"" or ""Why should we fear this tottering pageant?"" But, in fact, none of those who thus talk know anything about it. Whether Pekin is rich or poor, strong or weak, many will guess, but with our present opportunities none can know. In the Palace of Westminster, those who decide upon these questions most dogmatically know least, and if we would put their crotchets aside, and be guided by the rules of common sense -- if we would deal with the Chinese as with other mortals, believing that they are capable of being moved by hope and by fear, by kindness and by severity, as they may merit the one or deserve the other, we should probably save a large part of these threatened ten millions. There is a shortsightedness about our policy towards this empire which would cease if they of our statesmen who direct it would study it, or if the House of Commons would insist that they only who have studied the subject should direct the policy. It is a notorious fact that throughout our public offices the only men who have any ripe and useful knowledge of this matter are Lord PALMERSTON and one gentleman in the Foreign-office. The one knows it as a statesman, the other as a man of detail. The others only have their hands full of crotchets, which they shake together like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. It is not their fault that it is so, but it is their fault that they will, by meddling, do harm in so great a matter. Some day it will come to this, that the country, in its weariness and disgust, will flatly refuse to send any more forces into those seas, happen what may.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/31/archives/sanitary-science-a-crusade-against-corsets-and-crinoline-by-dr-ey.html,,"Dr. E.Y. ROBBINS delivered a lecture last week at Clinton Hall, before an appreciative audience, on the operations of air, light and costume upon the health of the female sex. He advocated the improvement of woman's health as a certain means of improving the race. He found a great deal of fault with the costume of the ladies. He especially condemned the use of corsets, commenced as it was in the present age with infantile years, and quoted a celebrated English author to show that even a man, who, when not dressed could inhale 180 cubic inches of air in a given time, could, when dressed, inhale only 130 inches. And of course a greater proportionate difference was observable in women, by reason of their mode of dress. He contrasted the ravages of cholera with those of consumption, brought on by inattention to the laws of nature which he now sought to inculcate, and strengthened his argument by the statement that during the cholera season of 1849 there died in this City from that disease 31,506, while in the same year there died from consumption no less than 33,516. To show how much more than men women were, from there habits and mode of dress, liable to this disease, he asserted that in the same year (1849) 5,640 men died of consumption, while no less than 10,195 females were its victims. Of all the women who have died in the northeastern section of our country, more than one-half died of consumption, and those between the ages of fifteen and twenty years. The lecturer was particularly severe upon the subject of tight-lacing so especially prevalent among American ladies. He deprecated the practice of depriving girls of the air and exercise so necessary to health, which boys are permitted to partake of; and he was at a loss to know why such a difference should be made in the condition and habits of the sexes. Speaking of the higher classes, with special reference to our own City, he asserted that three-quarters of the young ladies of the upper and wealthier classes had some personal deformity, caused by this inattention to the most rational laws of health, or by an over-anxiety to reduce the circumference of the waist. The truth of his assertions was proved by a reference to the ancient Greeks, who, even now, after the lapse of centuries, were the models of form received by painters and sculptors; and he instanced also the Circassians and Georgians, who had never yet learned the mystery of corsets. Light, the lecturer contended, which was so much denied to women on account of their constant in-door confinement, was of the utmost importance in the development of health and strength. A plant or shrub grown in the shade never displayed the same amount of color or strength as those which enjoy the light of the Sun, and he claimed that if the ladies of this country would preserve health and retain their beauty, they must use more of air and sunlight. In England a woman was in the prime of her attractions at the age of 35, and gradually but beautifully faded away, while in this country at 25 a woman had reached her prime, and at 35 had begun to fade. He dwelt upon the responsibility of a mother. She must either be the giver of health, vitality, and strength or else the dispenser of disease and degeneration, and a knowledge of this fact should inculcate in woman a sense of her responsibility.",11,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SANITARY SCIENCE.; A CRUSADE AGAINST CORSETS AND CRINOLINE, BY DR.

""L'Italia fara di se"" -- ""Italy will settle her own affairs"" sounded like an empty boast in the ears of the incredulous world, when Austria, after a twelvemonth of desperate revolutionary warfare, found herself once more mistress from the Alps to the Adriatic. The heroic defence of Venice and of Rome; the splendid revolt of Milan; the victorious battles of Goito and Somma Campagna; the Spartan courage of the volunteers at Curtatone, had all by turns challenged the admiration and moved the sympathy of mankind; -- but all seemed at last to have been but the pathetic pageants of a glorious play, when the curtain fell upon Novara, and Sardinia alone was left, shattered, panting, but unsubdued, to attest the existence of a truly Italian nationality. That hackneyed old injustice of history, the doctrine that they alone are capable of freedom who can win it for themselves, came easily to the lips of happier nations, and the defeat of the Italian arms was acquiesced in by the selfishness of stronger and freer States, as a melancholy but irrefragable proof of the incapacity of the Italian character. Englishmen forgot Dutch WILLIAM and the strong hand which struck away the falling throne of Stuart bigotry and Continental despotism, before the Grand Monarque had time to stay its ruin. Americans forgot the gold of Spain and Holland, the armaments of France, which our fathers hailed in their extremist need as the visible interposition of Providence.

"Dr. HIRAM COX, of Cincinnati, Inspector of liquors for Hamilton County, Ohio, lectured on Wednesday evening at Cooper Institute on the adulteration of liquors. Mr. WM. E. DODGE introduced the lecturer to his audience, which was discouragingly small. After giving a brief explanation of the modus operandi of analyzing liquors, Dr. Cox analyzed a few samples which had been handed in for that purpose. Pouring out some Otard brandy in a glass, he mixed with it a little chloride of barium, and in a few moments announced that it contained sulphuric acid and prussic acid. In Port wine, he found prussic acid and other substances not immediately distinguishable. He said however, that the specimen tested contained no alcohol whatever; whereas, if it were pure port, it should contain from 19 to 25 80 100 of alcohol. He next tried a bottle of pale Sherry, and found a large amount of sulphuric acid. All of the samples were labeled with the name of a prominent down-town liquor dealer, at whose store they were stated to have been purchased yesterday, without the seller knowing for what purpose they were to be used. A great many questions were put to the lecturer by individuals in the audience, some of which were impertinent, and evidently intended to annoy him. Of this class were the queries of one young gentleman who announced himself a liquor-dealer, and who was finally silenced by an aged gentleman, who arose in the audience and suggested to him that if he would allow the remainder of the audience to hear the Doctor through, he could then have an opportunity to take the stand and defend his trade at his leisure. Questions were asked about the Catawba wine, to which the lecturer replied that some of it was pure and some not -- generally not.

RUSSELL would be able to inform the House that strict instructions would be given for the conduct of the expedition. He forebore to move the resolutions of which he had given notice, and substituted a resolution founded upon the wish expressed in Her Majesty's speech on the opening of the present session: ""It will be gratifying to me if the prompt acquiescence of the Emperor of China in the moderate demands which will be made by the Plenipotentiaries shall obviate the necessity for the employment of force.""",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ENGLAND AND CHINA.; Debate in Parliament on Chinese Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ENGLAND AND CHINA.; Debate in Parliament on Chinese Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c6041158-89ce-5dda-8b50-3e7944889714,4111,nyt://article/c6041158-89ce-5dda-8b50-3e7944889714,

"At the theatres we have had but one novelty during the week -- Mr. DION BOURCICAULT's drama of ""Colleen Bawn; or, The Brides of Garryowen,"" which was produced on Thursday evening, at Miss LAURA KEENE's theatre. It obtained a success of the first class, and will, in all probability, keep the stage until the close of the season. The applause was vehement, and of that quick responsive kind which speaks so distinctly of sustained interest and animation. All the artists were called out and Mr. BOURCICAULT, at the end, made mate little speech, with just a touch of the blarney in it to prove that the performance was as satisfactory with the author as with the public. He said -- very truly, too -- that the field of Irish history and romance, whilst singularly rich in dramatic material, is almost un-trodden by the modern dramatist. A certain class of piece, remarkable for its stupidity, passes muster, to be sure, as the Irish drama, and exhibits rather too liberally the virtues of an agrarian peasantry, the depravity of cultivated classes, and the supreme reformations that are effected on the latter by the free use of the shillelah. But, like negro minstrelsy, this fashion of fun has gone out of date. Mr. BOURCICAULT, in exploring the romances of GERALD GRIFFIN, has opened new ground, and so successfully that a rich harvest may fairly be anticipated from his initial effort.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/03/31/archives/amusements.html,,"At the theatres we have had but one novelty during the week -- Mr. DION BOURCICAULT's drama of ""Colleen Bawn; or, The Brides of Garryowen,"" which was produced on Thursday evening, at Miss LAURA KEENE's theatre.
