",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/02/archives/interesting-discussion-in-the-royal-geographical-society.html,,"A numerously-attended meeting of the Royal Geographical Society was held in London on the 10th inst., Sir RODERICK MUROUISON presiding. Several papers relative to San Juan and its neighborhood were read; among them, ""Journeys in the District, bordering on the Fraser, Thompson, and Harrison Rivers,"" by Lieuts. MAYNE, R.N., and PALMER, R.E., and Chief Justice M. BEGBIE; communicated by the Duke of NEWCASTLE, Colonial Office. Lieut. MAYNE's report contained much interesting topographical information. It described the character of the soil, the vegetation and productions of the districts traversed, and pointed out the course of the rivers and the general geographical features of the country. Lieut. PALMER noticed the existence of gold in the Upper Fraser River, but observed that the great drawback was the scarcity and enormous price of provisions. Chief-Justice BEGBIE observed that two Indian chiefs paid him a visit while at Cayoosh, and complained of the conduct of citizens of the United States; while, on the other hand, there were many cases of cattle-stealing alleged by the whites against the Indians; this was said to be caused by the want of food; the Indians, many hundreds of whom had died of absolute starvation during the Winter, staling that the salmon had failed them now for three years altogether. They were said to be very lazy and improvident, but the Chief Justice had found them almost everywhere willing to labor hard for hire, and bargaining acutely for wages. The amount of wages for carrying burdens was eight shillings per day. His impression of the Indian population was that they had far more natural intelligence and honesty than the lowest classes of any European country. The chief point which struck him were, first, the ready submission of a foreign population to the declaration of the will of the Executive; secondly, the great preponderance of the Californian element of the population and the paucity of British subjects; thirdly, the great riches, both auriferous and agricultural, of the country; fourthly, the want of some fixity of tenure for agricultural purposes; and, fifthly, the absence of all means of communication except by foaming torrents in canoes, or over goat-tracks on foot, which render all productions of the country except such as, like gold, could be carried with great care in small weight and compass, practically valueless. The chairman, in proposing the thanks of the Society to his Grace the Duke of NEWCASTLE for sending the papers, as well as to the authors, said that he was much struck with the fact that vessels of large tonnage could navigate the rivers, thus affording access to the auriferous regions. The plan of the Island of St. Juan, about which the Governments of the two countries were in dispute, was before them. It was obvious that it would be of the highest importance to have the distinct line of the Fraser River for the transit of their auriferous products. He had specimens of the nuggets found in the Fraser River; they were of small size, but it might turn out that some would yet be found as large as in any of the Australian gold regions. Dr. HODGKIN had been struck by the observations made respecting the Indians. It has been noticed that they were improvident, but he believed that if proper care was taken of them they would prove of great service to the European population, Sir E. BELOHER said that what gave him most concern was the boundary line. In 1838 he had sailed up the Columbia River below the 46th parallel, and had not found one American located there, but on arriving at Fort Vancouver there were some American missionaries, who had been provided by, the Hudson Bay Company with seed, sheep, and every facility for settling; and when a certain number had arrived, they called on the United States Government to establish American rights there, and that was the way England had been ousted from the Columbia river. An insurrection soon after broke out in California, and the ""American Governor told him that if the British Government gave up to the United States the southern boundary of the Columbia, she would allow England to fake California for the Mexican debt. He had seen the Mexican Charge d' Affaires, and told him that he had sent a dispatch to England containing that proposition; but, as he was a sailor, and had traveled out of his strict province in writing direct to the Foreign Office, no notice was taken of the communication, and the result was that England lost California, the Columbia, and was ""fleeted"" up to the forty-ninth degree. Had the British Government adopted the proposal made in 1838, there would be no occasion for the ""San Juan difficulty"" of the present day.

"The $25,000 added to the appropriations of 1859, by the Common Council, for street cleaning, let it be borne in mind, was made to cover the arrearages of that year. There is no money appropriated at the present time for street cleaning. The Comptroller has addressed a communication to the City Inspector, calling his attention to the 28th, 31st and 22d sections of the amended Charter of 1857, which severally provide that no expense shall be incurred by any of the departments, whether the object of expenditure shall have been ordered by the Common Council or not, unless an appropriation shall have been previously made covering such expense; that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury with such an appropriation; and that no money shall be paid by the City Chamberlain for any object after the amount authorized to be raised by tax therefor is expended.

Then came up again the Houmas Land Fraud, a memorial in reference to which Mr. TOOMBS desired to have referred to the Committee on Public Lands. This reference having been objected to, it was finally consigned to a Select Committee of five. Mr. WIGFALL, the newly-chosen Senator from Texas, was introduced by his colleague, and took the oath. The word ""servile,"" applied to the Free States by Mr. MASON, on a previous occasion, elicited an explanation from that gentleman, the purport of which was that as whites filled menial positions at the North, the epithet was not inapplicable to Northern society. At length Mr. HARLAN, of Iowa, who was entitled to the floor, obtained it. He entered into an extended discussion of that portion of the President's Message which alludes to the question of Slavery in the Territories, insisting that the ordinance of 1787 was a binding compact, which no judicial decision could abrogate. A warm debate ensued, in which Messrs. PUGH, TRUMBULL and HARLAN participated. Mr. FOSTER, of Connecticut, subsequently obtained a hearing for an attack on the President's recommendations touching Mexico. He desired to know with what propriety we could make war on a foreign power for the protection of American citizens, when American citizens are more severely treated on our own soil than anywhere abroad. He proceeded to read extracts from newspapers to show how universally and indiscriminately Northern people are proscribed in the Slave States. He also objected to the Executive programme upon Constitutional grounds.

"The chief interest in the State Comptroller's Annual Report, which we published at length in the TIMES of yesterday, relates to the Canal Finances. These, from the constitutional diversion in 1846 of a large share of the annual surplus revenues of the Canal to the General Fund, and from the important cause of the rapid fall, of late years, in the gross receipts from tolls, have become a charge in a certain measure upon the tax list of the people. The figures of the Report, however, show that after all the financial results of our Canal system, from 1817 to the present day, are taken into account, we have little reason to complain of the difference last year between the 8960,000 surplus revenue from this source and the $1,460,000 interest charge upon the Canal Debt, as it then stood. That the Canals have failed to meet the whole interest charge and all other requirements of the Constitution of 1846, may be the fault in part of extravagant or unwise management, but the main difficulty is unquestionably in the progress, amounting almost to revolution, in the business of internal transportation from the lakes to the seaboard, which no reasonable legislation could check, even if it were desirable, and no discriminating tax upon the rival routes of trade within the State, can remedy. The latter might, possibly, in some measure, be practicable, if the Western trade were within the control, in any sense, of the State of New-York alone. But as Pennsylvania and Maryland are formidable rivals on the South, and the Canada roads are rapidly rising into importance by their direct connection with Detroit and Portland as rivals on the North, for our own domestic carrying and passenger trade, we apprehend that all attempts at discrimination against our New-York roads in favor of the Canals, would result in driving business from both and lessening the commerce of our great seaboard metropolis.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/05/archives/finances-of-the-state-canals.html,,"The chief interest in the State Comptroller's Annual Report, which we published at length in the TIMES of yesterday, relates to the Canal Finances.

This result was foreshadowed a year ago, when an effort was made to obtain from the Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company a more liberal share of the earnings of the route for the boats. At the expiration of the contract, on the first of January, the Railroad Company was informed that unless better terms were conceded, the other parties to the contract would be compelled to supply the service with inferior boats. Failing to accomplish such an agreement as was desired, the sate mentioned above was effected. The line, however, is to be kept up, as the Company still have the Connecticut and Worcester, besides their [???]pellers, by which passengers and freight will go forward as usual. It is probable that the two lines will now change piers, the business of the Stonington [???]te being transferred to Tier No. 18, foot of Cort[???]dt-street, North River; the Norwich propellers and steamers taking possession of Pier No. 2, North River, the present depot of the Stonington [???]ne. As the Norwich river is frozen over, the steamers now and passengers and freight at New-London, the connection being made by the New-London, Palmer and Norwich Railroad. The Commonwealth left Allyn's Point, for the last time, on Monday evening, the 2d instant, since which time she has made no trip. The Connecticut is still running, and left New-London yesterday morning, having been detained to receive the freight which it is now necessary to send around by the way of Norwich. The Commonwealth was built in 1855, at Greenpoint, by LAWRENCE & FOULKS, and the engine by the Morgan Ironworks.

"The special correspondent in Italy of the London Daily News went to Scandiano to see a battalion of 400 children, quartered in the old castle. He says: ""The first idea of recruiting this legion of children belongs to Gen. GARIBALDI. When engaged in the South American wars, and in the defence of Rome in 1849, this gallant leader had noticed that boys between the ages of 13 and 15 years had proved useful in the daring military operations he was called to accomplish. At the beginning of the late campaign, having found that the Lombard cities through which he marched his triumphant legions had given their contingent of young soldiers, he at once made up his mind to have a battalion of adolescenti organized. An intelligent young officer, whom he had known during the Roman campaign of 1849, being near at hand, he intrusted him with the formation of the legion, which at the beginning aid not number more than 150. Austrian persecutions and patriotism soon increased the number of the adolescenti, so that the battalion has now completed its numerical strength. These little soldiers are dressed in a dark green tunic, with red cuffs with a white edge, and dark green trousers. On my arrival here this morning from Reggio I happened to see them while maneuvering on the parade ground opposite to the castle. I was really at the same time astonished and amused to see how perfect and orderly their movements were. They went through all sorts of military evolutions with such steadiness and precision as could scarcely have been surpassed by grownup soldiers after many months of training and drilling. Their commanding officer, Count JOHN ARRIVABENE, is a young nobleman of three-and-twenty. He belongs to an illustrious Mantuan family, which, since 1821, has contributed a great many soldiers to the cause of national independence. Although I really believe that this battalion of boys will do good service should it be called to fight against the enemies of Italian independence, its chief importance is of a moral kind, and is such as will be easily under stood by all sensible men in Europe. This gathering of the representatives of the rising generation around the flag of their country should be taken as a warning to Europe that there cannot be any compromise, any temporary solution, of a question which has taken such hold not only of all classes but all ages.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/05/archives/garibaldis-battalion-of-children.html,,"The special correspondent in Italy of the London Daily News went to Scandiano to see a battalion of 400 children, quartered in the old castle.

He then requested Dr. FRANCIS, as the oldest member present, to state his views on the subject. Dr. F. proceeded to give a brief resume of the past literature on the subject -- contrasted the opposing views of Drs. BARD and BAILEY, of this City -- said that Dr. BAILEY's pathology was that it was an inflammatory disease, and his practice, founded upon, this belief -- which was of emetics, hot baths, and even the lancet -- had never been improved. BARD, on the contrary, gave stimulants, but not with the success of BAILEY. JOHN HUNTER agreed with BAILEY. English writers however, seem to have an astonishing ignorance of croup for HAMILTON speaks of the disease as if it lasted a week or more, when hours would be more like it.

"Mr. MASON'S explanation of what he meant by the epithet ""servile"" which he applies to Northern States, to distinguish them from what are called the ""Slave States"" of the South, is a very good specimen of that laborious hunting for parallels which in heated controversies often supplies the place of argument.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/06/archives/slavery-and-servitude.html,,"Mr. MASON'S explanation of what he meant by the epithet ""servile"" which he applies to Northern States, to distinguish them from what are called the ""Slave States"" of the South, is a very good specimen of that laborious hunting for parallels which in heated controversies often supplies the place of argument. The Senator from Virginia is apparently, and we must say, when we consider his theory and practice of social economy, rather oddly restive under the designation of ""Slave States "" commonly applied to his own part of the country, and while he is unable to dispute the accuracy of the term, seeks to lessen its force by the invention of a new phrase to define the exact condition of domestic servants at the North, or rather of those among the servants of the North who wear livery. He seems to attach a serious importance to ""livery,"" as an instrument in assimilating the real condition of a hired servant at the North to that of a negro slave at the South; and if there be any solid comfort concealed in the comparison we certainly would not grudge it him. But wherein that comfort consists we confess we do not see. It is due to all parties in the controversy which is now rending the country, to admit that there is a real, radical and essential difference in the condition of the laboring classes in the two sections of the Union, and all attempts to make it appear that there is no such difference at all, or that the difference is but superficial and trifling, instead of allaying must increase the existing irritation. If all the servants at the North wore livery instead of a very small number, as is actually the case, this sartorial fact would prove nothing for Mr. MASON's side of the case. Livery is simply a coat of a particular color, with buttons of a particular kind, and, of itself, the wearing of livery is in no way degrading or humiliating. Whether it shall disgrace the wearer or not depends altogether upon his reason for appearing in it. If he wears it in virtue of a contract voluntarily entered into by himself, and supported by a valuable consideration -- a contract which he can abrogate at any time upon reasonable notice -- it is ridiculous to assert that he is degraded or made servile by his coat and buttons any more than by fulfilling any other agreement which may entail discomfort or inconvenience. There is a certain loss of ""independence"" implied in doing anything for other people, but the constant and incessant doing of things which we would not do if we could help it, and which are more or less irksome and disagreeable, is unfortunately one of the first conditions of existence for the mass of mankind throughout the world, even at the present day. ""Wearing a livery is one mode of proclaiming to everybody that the wearer is a coachman or footman; but if he is remunerated at his own price for any loss and damage which this sort of advertisement may entail on him, it is very difficult to see in what essential particular he is worse off than a Senator of the United States, an officer of the American army, or anybody else who accepts pay for publicly exercising his vocation. If he were compelled to wear the livery whether he would or no, on pain of imprisonment or flogging, or some other physical indignity and violence, it would of course alter the whole aspect of the case. In short, it is not in their manner of passing their time or in the nature of their occupations, that Northern laborers differ from Southern slaves, but in their motive for following any occupation at all. Both of them dig and delve, and lead, as all men must lead who labor for a livelihood a tolerably uncomfortable life; but the free laborer does so in virtue of a voluntary and legal contract the slave simply to avoid punishment. In the comparisons which Southern gentlemen are constantly drawing between the condition of the two classes, this distinction is entirely overlooked; but we must say we do not see what is gained by the sophism fur sophism it is.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Slavery and Servitude.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Slavery and Servitude.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2bbabe18-867c-5026-9caa-b02cca892ee9,1231,nyt://article/2bbabe18-867c-5026-9caa-b02cca892ee9,

"The Senate was not in session yesterday. In the House, Mr. PORCHER MILES, of South Carolina, resumed the floor to complete his remarks, which the Anti-Lecompton squabble of Thursday had blown to the winds. The hope of organization, he declared, had ceased to be rational; and he could see but one way of solving the perplexity, and that is to refer the whole question directly to the people -- to leave the choice of a Speaker to a general election. He declared his willingness to sustain an Anti-Lecompton Democrat; but he could not be brought to support an American. Mr. MAYNARD, of Tennessee, however, was more acceptable than Mr. GILMRR, of North Carolina, as he claimed to be independent of that or of any other political organization. Mr. ADRAIN, of New-Jersey, defended himself against the allusions of Mr. HICKMAN, by stating the position of himself and his Anti-Lecomptonite friends. A sharp colloquy between him and the Pennsylvania member ensued, the latter charging Mr. ADRAIN with having been elected by Republican votes, and yet refusing to aid in the election of a Republican Speaker. Mr. CLARK, of New-York, declared that it would be impossible to define the relations of the Anti-Lecompton men with the Administration party, until the latter had announced what disposition it was prepared to make of the approaching application of Kansas for admission as a State. At the close of Mr. CLARK's remarks, Mr. HICKMAN moved the plurality rule, as an amendment to the motion for a ballot. Pending the motion, Mr. BRIGGS, of New-York, rose to define his position, as the only representative of the American party at the North. He admitted that he owed his election the Republican support; and in that connection expressed his willingness to sustain for the Speakership any Republican not committed to the Helper Circular; and even announced his confidence in the conservatism of Mr. SHERMAN. But it was for a distinctly conservative and national man he preferred to give his support, and he was prepared to give it at the earliest opportunity.

"The new Police Station-house which has just been completed at Jersey City, was opened last evening with appropriate ceremonies. The building, which is of brick, is situated at the junction of Gregory-street and Washington-place, is two stories in height, with a basement story of ten feet. The structure covers a space thirty feet wide by ninety feet in depth, and with an economical regard to the wants of the city, contains accommodations for the business of the various Departments more immediately connected with the City Police. Below, the space is divided into the heating-room, ten cells for the detention of prisoners, intended to hold two in each room, and has rooms fitted up for lodgers, with sleeping accommodations for twenty-four. In the rear is the cooking department. This story, which is all above ground, is well lighted, ventilated and warmed. The first, or main story, is entered by a flight of steps, the front room being appropriated to the office. The remainder of the floor is divided by a hall, on one side of which are comfortably-furnished rooms for the detention of witnesses, bath-room, and the family rooms of the City Marshal.

In the rear is the cooking department. This story, which is all above ground, is well lighted, ventilated and warmed. The first, or main story, is entered by a flight of steps, the front room being appropriated to the office.

"Although trade statistics, as a rule, may be a dry subject to the general newspaper reader, we suggest that some interesting points are presented this morning by the Custom-house returns of the foreign commerce of the port of New-York during the year just closed. New-York has no reason to complain of her position as the first importing and distributing market on the Continent; nor yet of the steady centralization of this branch of trade, as measured by the increased per centage of the total imports of the whole country, which the present annual summary illustrates. The entries of foreign merchandise for the year amount to two hundred and fory-two millions in value, before the impost duties are added. These, by the present tariff, average about sixteen per cent. Of the gross entries of the year, the value of two hundred and thirty-two millions, exclusive of the impost, or about two hundred and seventy millions value, has been actually marketed, or distributed to the country. This sum exceeds, by about one-sixth, the heavy distribution made in the year 1856 -- the season before the crisis. At the same time it is made to a population throughout the United States, increased in about the same proportion, taking into account the accession by immigration. This large distribution of foreign goods is by no means significant of an increased extravagance in their consumption, generally, by the whole country. The relative trade at New-York has gone up from 62 to 65 per cent. since 1856, and we look to see this proportion more than maintained in 1860. At the same time we must regret that we cannot claim that the proportion of these goods freighted from Europe in American bottoms is even equal to that of 1856. The admission is not creditable to the country, but it is not new to our own readers, as we have heretofore shown in these columns that our steam marine is sadly falling behind that of England, and that even Germany is in advance of us in the European trade. The humiliation may stop, but not the loss to our general commerce, with the fact that the Collins line has been driven from this trade, and that the Vanderbilt and Livingston lines, to Havre and Southampton, bear but small account to the Cunard, Hamburgh, North German, Liverpool (or Dale), and Quebec competition. The freight earnings of our merchant sailing fleet have been sadly interfered with by the same cause. The screw-steamers of British construction -- they are nearly all built on the Clyde and at Newcastle-on-Tyne -- and of European ownership, are now, and for a year or two past have been, the great carriers for the New-York Import trade. We count the difference against our own tonnage, including the old Liverpool sailing lines, by millions per annum on Dry Goods and other light merchandise alone. Of the one hundred and thirteen millions Dry Goods brought into New-York from abroad, last year, we doubt whether twenty per cent, was delivered by American vessels. And a very considerable portion of general merchandise, such as Sheffield and Birmingham abrics from England, and Wines and Brandies from the Continent, are diverted from our carrying business in the same way.",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/10/archives/what-newyork-buys-and-sells.html,,"Although trade statistics, as a rule, may be a dry subject to the general newspaper reader, we suggest that some interesting points are presented this morning by the Custom-house returns of the foreign commerce of the port of New-York during the year just closed.

"Rev. PETER CARTWRIGHT, the well-known Methodist pioneer clergyman of the West, lectured last evening to a large audience in the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Greene-street, upon life in the Western wilds. By way of introduction, he said he would give a short sketch of his history. He was born in Virginia, reared in Kentucky, and had been a citizen of the Mississippi valley for 68 years. He was now in his seventy-fifth year, and had spent 67 years of his life in the faithful preaching of the Gospel of the Methodist Church. Shortly after the Revolutionary War his father moved with his family into the Western country, which was then a wilderness of wild beasts and still wilder Indians. It was impossible for one who had never been a resident upon the frontier to realize the condition of life at that time. There were no schools, no preachers, no newspapers, no organized associations whatever. As late as 1811 there had been but one conference of the Methodist Church in the whole West, and the Church numbered at that time less than 2,000 souls, including the Northwest, West and Southwest. A preacher at that time was liable to be sent on a circuit of a thousand miles. The men of God at that period were wont to travel as best they could from court to court, and from place to place, wherever they could find a gathering of the people, to plant the standard of the Redeemer. On rare occasions he had the opportunity to listen to one and another of their pioneer preachers, but the best preacher to him in those early days was a pious mother, for whom he would bless God in Heaven forever and ever. Under the preaching of one of those traveling clergymen he embraced religion. His youthful companions thought him crazy, and an old Scotch doctor who lived neighbor to his father, and who, withal, was a confirmed infidel, on learning that PETER had got converted, straightway hastened to his father's cabin to see about it. Alter a faithful examination of his bumps, he pronounced him deranged, and advised his father to shave his head and put on a blistering plaster. His father, however, did not follow the Doctor's advice, and the following Sabbath the young convert essayed to preach his first sermon, and invited the old Doctor to come and hear him. The Doctor came -- there was a powerful manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and they had a solemn time. During the sermon, a lady member of the congregation fell in a trance. The old Scotch Doctor sprang to her assistance, and applied his hartshorn to her nose. Young CARTWRIGHT interfered and told the Doctor to stand aside -- that the lady was his patient and needed prayer more than hartshorn. The lady soon revived and sprang towards the Doctor, whereat the old infidel took to his heels as though the d -- l was after him. Shortly after this, one of the Elders offered to give him a license to exhort; but he told the Elder that he couldn't exhort unless he felt happy, and when he felt happy he should exhort anyhow. This was all the license he ever received to preach the Gospel until many years after he was ordained a presiding Elder. He, however, continued to preach in his own way, or to exhort, or whatever they pleased to call it, and with a library consisting of part of an old Bible, the Methodist Book of Discipline, and a hymn book, he traveled around the country, talking religion as he understood it, or rather as he felt it, and had the pleasure of seeing hundreds converted through his instrumentality. At the end of six months the presiding Elder came to him and handed him six dollars. While traveling near the head of the Cumberland River he made the acquaintance of a Justice of the Peace who had recently lost a child. He was asked to preach the funeral sermon, and did so; whereupon he was requested to tarry for several days. He complied, and preached nightly in the log meeting-house, the people coming from twenty miles round about to hear him. A revival was the consequence, and in a few days 23 converts were gathered into the fold, including the Justice of the Peace. After he had left, some Baptist preachers, who had been sent out as missionaries, chanced that way, and what with their everlasting hullabaloo about ""water,"" ""water,"" ""immersion,"" ""immersion,"" they got his young flock into a state of perfect confusion. They sent for him, and he returned to the place, underwent an examination at the hands of the Baptists, and was pronounced a genuine Christian. A day was appointed by the Baptist elders to baptize him and his converts. At the appointed time they all appeared on the banks of the river, when CARTWRIGHT declined the ceremony, on the ground that he had been once baptized by sprinkling, and he considered that sufficient. His converts all followed his example, and thus the ceremony was cut short. The same day, being communion, the young converts, with their leaders, took their seats in the congregation, and had the mortification of seeing the bread and wine carried past them, and administered only to those who were classed by the elders as belonging to ""our order."" CARTWRIGHT arose in the meeting and demanded that the sacrament should be administered to himself and his converts. The Deacon said to the Elder, ""Shall I do it?"" The Elder said ""No."" Thereupon CARTWRIGHT withdrew with his flock, and mounting a log in front of the church, proceeded to defend himself in the true Western style, ""roaring and thundering,"" to use his own words, ""like a unicorn."" He told them that since they were not permitted to enter that church, he would raise one for himself, ""And this,"" said the speaker, ""was the first church I ever established.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/10/archives/pioneer-life-in-the-west-lecture-of-the-backwoods-preacher-and.html,,"Rev.

"The pamphlet of M. DE LA GUERRONIERE, which is regarded as the manifesto of the Emperor NOPOLEON upon the Italian question, has elicited the general approval of all parties in England, as affording the only basis upon which a satisfactory and permanent peace can be established. The temporal power of the Pope is the knotty point of European diplomacy, and this is attempted to be untied by restricting this power to the City of Rome. The Papal sovereignty is thus made purely spiritual, and the freedom of his ecclesiastical functions is guaranteed by the municipal government of the city which is the seat of his spiritual empire.

At midnight dispatches were added to those previously received, which swell the calamity into one of the most terrible ever recorded.

"On the 22d September, as H.M.S. Spitfire was steaming to windward, a brigantine, suspected of being engaged in the slave-trade, was met off Aghway, Bight Benin, running to leeward, which shortly afterwards anchored at Whydah, a noted slave depot, at which place her Majesty's ship Spitfire likewise anchored. For three days the suspected vessel remained there, pretending to discharge plank and other cargo. On Sunday forenoon, Sept. 25, the weather being thick and squally, the brigantine left Whydah, and ran to leeward.

"EXTRAORDINARY ATTEMPT AT SELF-MURDER. -- The Cleveland Herald tells the following: ""An old woman, 80 years of age, residing near Auburn, the county seat of De Kalb County, Ind., beat her husband, who was as old as herself, with an axe and club, till he died. This was six weeks ago to-day.

WILKINSON, the Senator recently elected in Minnesota, for six years, commencing on the 4th of March 1859, appeared in the United States Senate, yesterday, and was sworn in. Mr. GREEN subsequently resumed his remarks on the Territorial Question, controverting the position of Mr. DOUGLAS, and was followed by Mr. PUGH, of Ohio, in response to the attacks of Mr. IVERSON. Mr. PUGH early gave way to an Executive Session. In the House, Mr. SCRANTON, of Pennsylvania, justified his votes for Mr. SHERMAN, on the ground that the latter had given him personal assurances of his soundness on the doubtful point of favoring servile insurrection, or other interference with Slavery where it is protected by law. Mr. SCRANTON claimed for himself a position independent of all parties; and as evidence of his willingness to facilitate organization, referred to the fact of his having twice voted for Mr. GILMER. He also presented resolutions adopted at a Union meeting held in Luzerne, Penn., in which BROWN's attempt was strongly reprobated, and his punishment as warmly approved. Such, he declared, were the sentiments of the entire population of Pennsylvania. Mr. CAMPBELL, of the same State, indorsed the latter assertion to the fullest extent. Pennsylvania had been uniformly loyal to the Union and the Constitution, and would be so to the end. He ridiculed the idea that any particular man could be prevented from filling the Presidential office if duly elected. He, too, had sustained Mr. GILMER, because he regarded that gentleman as faithful to the laws and the existing order of things. In reply to a remark of Mr. GARTRELL, in his speech of Tuesday, to the effect that the cotton crop of Georgia alone would buy up the State of Pennsylvania, arms, ammunition and all, Mr. CAMPBELL averred that the mineral and agricultural productions of Pennsylvania fall very little short, in value, of the cotton crop of the entire South. After some further debate, a vote for Speaker was had, 111 being necessary to a choice. Mr. SHERMAN received 108; Mr. HAMILTON, 81; Mr. GILMER, 19; scattering, 13. A second ballot was ordered. While the roll was called, several Southern American members announced their determination to vote no longer for a Democratic candidate, as it was evident none such could be elected, and as the Democrats refrained, when this fact was so apparent, from voting for an American. They accordingly gave their names to Mr. GILMER. Mr. CLARK, of New-York, without consultation with his fellow Anti-Lecompionites, expressed his disbelief in the possibility of electing either a Lecompton or Anti-Lecompton Democrat, and his willingness to support any of the Southern Opposition -- individualizing Mr. ETHERIDGE, of Tennessee. Mr. ADRAIN reproached Mr. CLARK for thus speaking without consultation; and repeated his previous declaration that when the selection of a Speaker became obviously dependent upon the votes of himself, or his friends, they would be prepared to assume the responsibility. The ballot resulted: Mr. SHERMAN, 106; Mr. HAMILTON, 75; Mr. GILMER, 25; Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana, 8; scattering, 7. Necessary to a choice, 111.

"There is one feature in the case between the City railroad companies and the public which the apologists of the latter entirely overlook, and that is, the rights not of those who stand in their cars, but of those who sit down in them. The obvious intention of the law in granting their charters, and fixing the rate of fare, was that every person who paid five cents for a seat in a ear thereby became entitled not simply to a seat, but to as much room in front for his legs as the width of the passage, minus the space occupied by the legs of his vis-a-vis, afforded; to as much light and ventilation as can be had when all the seats are full, and no less, and to perfect freedom of ingress and egress along the passage-way. Under the present system these undeniable rights of the stated passengers are entirely ignored. The passage-way is crammed full, their toes are trampled on, their legs cramped up, and the air, on a stormy or cold day, rendered so foul, that even half an hour's exposure to it is most injurious to health. Now, we maintain that when all the scats in a car are filled, the Company has contracted with every one of the passengers to secure him the accomodation, space, light, air and facility for egress which he then enjoys, and that, when a single person is admitted to stand up and hang on by the strap, their contract is violated. It is the duty of the Company to refuse to admit anybody else. The willingness of those outside to accept the standing-room has nothing to do with the question, any more than the willingness of a new corner at a crowded hotel to put up with half of a bed, the whole of which another guest has already engaged for himself, has to do with the landlord's bargain with the latter. The conductor of a car has but one answer for those who apply for admission after the seats are all taken, and that is that there is no room. If this rule were forced upon the companies, as it ought to be, they would soon be compelled to do their duty, and run, if need be, twice as many cars as at present. The crowds, who are now so anxious to get home that they are ready to be packed like sheep in the gangway, to the annoyance and discomfort and injury of those who have already engaged the car, would, if left on the sidewalk one or two evenings, speedily find means to bring the Presidents of these corporations to a sense of their obligations to the public.

Our Abolitionist cotemporary might have carried the comparison further, with equal success. Negro slaves are never allowed to enlist in the army or navy, and expose themselves to the Indian or Mexican rifles, or British broadsides. On the contrary, our soldiers and sailors are all poor white men, whom stern necessity drives into the ranks, and who, in time of war, are launched by cruel commanders into the most horrible dangers. The condition of the European whites is, in this respect, just as bad as our own, and contrasts sadly with the happier lot of our Southern Sambos. We believe it is no exaggeration to say that since the commencement of the present century a million and a half of poor Englishmen, Irishmen, Frenchmen, and Americans have fallen in battle, or been horribly mutilated by sabre, bullet and bayonet. Yet during the whole of that period, we do not believe twelve negroes have been slain in action, including those who were slain at Harper's Ferry.

In the House of Representatives, Mr. SHERMAN inquired of Mr. HOUSTON whether, in his remarks of the preceding day, he intended any personal allusion by stigmatizing the possible election of Mr. SHERMAN as a ""burning, withering curse and shame."" Mr. HOUSTON at once disclaimed any design to allude to Mr. SHERMAN personally. Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland, proposed that Mr. CLARK's Anti-Helper resolution be removed out of the way, and that the House adopt the substitute adopted by the Committee of Democrats, Americans and Anti-Lecomptonites at the meeting held Sunday, in which they declared that no man, who recommended, or still insists on and does not disclaim HELPER's doctrines, and who is not opposed to further agitation of the Slavery question, is fit to be Speaker. Various gentlemen explained the circumstances under which this substitute was adopted. Mr. HASKIN asked a question of Mr. MCRAE, which elicited from Mr. CLARK, of New-York, the words, ""It is none of my colleague's business."" Mr. HASKIN made some remarks, amid cries of order. Soon the members on all sides were on their feet, and many rushed to the area and main aisle. The Sergeant-at-arms was called on. He appeared with his mace, demanding peace. The Clerk kept on rapping to order. The utmost possible excitement prevailed. Subsequently, Mr. CLEMENS said that he saw Mr. HASKIN take a pistol out of his breast. Mr. DAVIDSON, jocularly, gave notice that when he again came to the House he would bring his shot-gun with him. Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland, said that was making game of the House. Mr. HASKIN subsequently explained how the pistol happened to fall from his breast. Every one who knew him, knew he would not use it except in an honorable way. Mr. CLARK, of New-York, apologized for the harsh remarks, and the House adjourned in good order and humor.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8e302c59-d449-5b73-85c2-f26fe0566e01,1736,nyt://article/8e302c59-d449-5b73-85c2-f26fe0566e01,

"PATRICK MAUDE was executed at the jail in Newark, shortly before 12 o'clock yesterday. The charge upon which he was convicted was the murder of his sister, Mrs. MARY TURBOTT, by shooting her with a pistol, on the evening of Saturday, May 28, 1859. The circumstances of the murder were briefly these: In April, 1858, MAUDE, who had been employed, off and on, at the Zinc Works in Newark, and who was generally esteemed a desperate, quarrel some and revengeful character, was arrested for a felonious assault upon his wife, and also upon WM. O'CONNELL, an alleged paramour of his wife, both of whom he attempted to shoot with a pistol. He was tried and convicted of the offence, but his strange conduct during the trial raised doubts of his sanity, which were afterwards confirmed by the decision of a board of medical men, who were appointed by the Court to examine him, and who without hesitation pronounced him insane. He was accordingly sent to the Insane Asylum at Trenton, where he remained until the night of the 26th May, 1859, .when he made his escape by removing a window in his room. Previous to, and during his confinement in the Asylum, he had frequently made threats against the Prosecuting Attorney and the Judge who tried him, as well as against his wife, his sister, and others. On escaping from the Institution, he left a note behind him, indicating his purpose of carrying out these threats. He walked on foot to New-Brunswick, and there took a boat to this City, where he purchased a pistol, powder and ball, with which he immediately started for Newark. He concealed himself in that city until after dark of the evening of the 28th of May, when he proceeded to the residence of his sister, Mrs. TURBOTT, in Madison street.

The charge upon which he was convicted was the murder of his sister, Mrs. MARY TURBOTT, by shooting her with a pistol, on the evening of Saturday, May 28, 1859. The circumstances of the murder were briefly these: In April, 1858, MAUDE, who had been employed, off and on, at the Zinc Works in Newark, and who was generally esteemed a desperate, quarrel some and revengeful character, was arrested for a felonious assault upon his wife, and also upon WM. O'CONNELL, an alleged paramour of his wife, both of whom he attempted to shoot with a pistol. He was tried and convicted of the offence, but his strange conduct during the trial raised doubts of his sanity, which were afterwards confirmed by the decision of a board of medical men, who were appointed by the Court to examine him, and who without hesitation pronounced him insane. He was accordingly sent to the Insane Asylum at Trenton, where he remained until the night of the 26th May, 1859, .when he made his escape by removing a window in his room. Previous to, and during his confinement in the Asylum, he had frequently made threats against the Prosecuting Attorney and the Judge who tried him, as well as against his wife, his sister, and others. On escaping from the Institution, he left a note behind him, indicating his purpose of carrying out these threats. He walked on foot to New-Brunswick, and there took a boat to this City, where he purchased a pistol, powder and ball, with which he immediately started for Newark. He concealed himself in that city until after dark of the evening of the 28th of May, when he proceeded to the residence of his sister, Mrs. TURBOTT, in Madison street. He arrived there about 9 o'clock in the evening, and found his sister behind the counter in her husband's store. While she was in the act of pouring out some beer for a customer, MAUDE suddenly entered the store, and fired two shots at her, both of which took effect in the breast, producing almost instant death. MAUDE was soon after arrested and placed in prison, where he remained until his trial, which took place in October last.

These meetings have now been held in very many of the cities and large towns north of Mason and Dixon's line, and though we certainly cannot approve of all the views which have been advanced under cover of such gatherings, nor of the spirit in which some of their orators have spoken; though in some cases they have, doubtless, been made subservient to party ends, and used for the advancement of personal interests, yet, upon the whole, it cannot be questioned that their influence has been salutary at the North, and deserves to be so at the South. They have roused Northern men into thinking seriously upon the dangers and duties of the present crisis; they have opened a way for the general instinctive disavowal of Northern sympathy with all plans of intrusive Anti-Slavery in the States in which Slavery exists; they have led the community to feel that open attempts to nullify the action of the law for the rendition of fugitives from service, which has been pronounced constitutional by the highest judicial tribunal of the land, are serious offences against the Federal rights of the South; they have proclaimed the fraternal regard of the masses of the North for their Southern fellow-citizens.

"The City Railroad Companies will forgive us for once more returning to the subject of their crowding their cars, when we mention that we have a suggestion to make for their benefit. They have laid down the doctrine that the passengers who have seats have no rights which a corporation is bound to respect, and that everybody who is willing to be packed into the inside, and left to stand up, ought to be packed in. In short, those who come up after the car is full, are entitled to more consideration than those who already occupy the seats. We controverted this theory yesterday, but as we do not expect the Companies to adopt our views until our logic is aided by the police -- which we confidently hope will shortly be the case, -- we beg to recommend that, in the meantime, in order to afford more standing room, the seats be removed in all the cars.

A European gentleman, high in rank and titles, and connected with the English service visited Dr. CHEEVER's church on Sunday morning last, accompanied by his wife, and attended by a female servant and a colored men in livery. His attendants followed him op the aisle of the church and seated themselves, according to European custom, in the pew behind him. The audacity of the negro servant, exhibited by so cool and unpardonable an act, amused the Christian sentiments and philanthropic feelings of the Abolition representatives of the congregation. Two young men, of high promise in the community, who have been heretofore actively identified with the Anti-Slavery designs of the Church requested the sexton, very politely, to suggest to the colored gentleman the practicability of his taking a seat in the gallery -- reserved seats for negroes, of course, in the dress circle, being a necessary concomitant of Abolition theatricals. This request the sexton (being a doughface, I expect, and ""sold to the South"") refused to acquiesce in. One of the Trustees of the Church then called upon the gentleman, whose servant had committed a ""breach of the Abolition peace,"" and informed him of the habits and customs upon Union-square. The gentleman very specifically and emphatically inquired if ""he was in Dr. Cheever's Church, -- the Church which was soliciting British aid?"" Also, ""whether colored men were not allowed there?"" He was told that they did not mingle promiscuously with the audience, -- the audience, I suppose, not being entitled to reserved seats. The gentleman then inquired ""which door the colored people could go out of"" and, on being satisfactorily informed, he ar[???]se and left the Church, accompanied by all the party. At the door he handed out his card, and requested that it should be sent to the pastor.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sham Philanthropy.; A PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE SINCERITY OF ABOLITIONISTS.

"At the meeting of the Police Commissioners yesterday, in accordance with a resolution of the Board, General-Superintendent Pillsbury reported the facts brought out during an investigation of the recent arrest of an alleged fugitive slave. From the evidence it appeared that on the night of the 30th of December, Officer Terhune, of the Fourteenth Precinct, while on the corner of Crosby and Spring streets, found a negro whom he took to the Station house, and preferred a charge of intoxication against him. In the morning the negro was arraigned before Justice Brennan, and committed temporarily.

"Barnard Levi, a lad about 15 years of age, was brought on from Boston on Thursday evening, by Detective Bennett, to answer a charge of having stolen $70 in cash, besides a gold watch and chain, valued at the same sum, from Mr. Pollitzer, a silver plater, doing business at the corner of Broadway and Cortlandt-street. Last Summer, Levi, according to his own statement, was employed as office boy by the complainant. Observing one night, when he closed the store, that Mr. Pollitzer had omitted to lock the safe, he determined to return and perpetrate a robbery. This was easy of accomplishment, as he always retained the key of the store-door. After he reached the store, it took him a long time to conquer his conscientious scruples, but the temptation proved irresistible. The watch which he took was immediately presented to a friend, and with the cash he departed for Philadelphia. After having spent his money, he left for Boston via this City, accomplishing the journey (about 350 miles) in seven days, doing without sleep for thirty-six consecutive hours, because he could, not discover a decent barn in which to repose. After reaching Boston, he sold some of his clothes to procure a meal of victuals, and then searched for employment. For some time he was unsuccessful, and each night he lodged in the cell of a Boston station-house, which, incidentally, he commended for its comfort and cleanliness. Finally he effected an engagement with a traveling theatrical company, and made the tour of the State of Massachusetts with them, acting, as occasion required, the role of call-boy, prompter and ""general utility"" man, in which latter character he achieved a decided success. After spending three weeks in this way, with ""plenty to eat and little to do,"" the company disbanded on account of internal difficulties, and young Levi was again thrown upon his own resources and the charity of the Boston Police. In his strait he wrote a letter to a brother in this City, requesting funds wherewith to defray his expenses to Texas, where he had previously lived. The Detective Police gained possession of this document, and telegraphed to Boston requesting the apprehension of the young man, for whom the New-York officers had been looking for several months. Accordingly, his arrest was effected, and Detective Bennett was sent to take charge of him. The prisoner takes the matter philosophically, and says he shall probably spend the ensuing six years in the House of Refuge, where he hopes to acquire a trade that will enable him to live honestly after his release, as he wishes to correct his wandering and erratic habtts.

Before it is too late, however, it may not be amiss to beg of the members to remember, that the curse of the country and of the age in which we live is over legislation. The habits and training of the American people are happily such that they can live with very little government, and everything which is left entirely to itself, and in which the law does not meddle, is pretty sure to be well done. Most of our troubles and griefs and annoyances are, in fact, caused by acts of Congress, or acts of the Legislature. If our statutes were diminished by one-third, we verily believe we should be much better off than we are. The mania for bringing fresh ones into existence, by which all members of the Legislature are actuated in these latter days, is one of the worst evils of the times. It burdens the Courts, confuses the bar, and unsettles business. It leads, moreover, to the introduction of hasty and ill-considered bills, which after annoying the whole State by their brief operation, bring all law into contempt by their sudden repeal. An act of the Legislature ought to be the fruit of much thought and much discussion, and ought to embody not the whim or crotchet of an individual, but the clearly and thoroughly expressed will of the public. If ambitious politicians will only devote a small portion of their energy to the work of securing a better execution of the laws already in force, we will cheerfully excuse them from the consideration of new ones. There are but few things in the social or political condition of the State of New-York at this moment which would not be the better for being let alone.

Such displays as took place in the Representatives' Hall, on Thursday night, are not more truly disgraceful, though they are more flagrant and startling, than the imbecility, want of public spirit, and intensity of partisan greed which can obstinately impede for weeks and months the organization of a great body of public servants, to the instant detriment of every public interest, and the prospective demoralization of the whole political life of the country. That Mr. CLARK should insolently snub Mr. HASKIN, and Mr. HASKIN raise revolvers upon the floor; that Mr. SMITH, of egg-nogg notoriety, should declare Mr. BINGHAM ""worthy of the scorn and detestation of every man who forms part of the American Union,"" assure him that if he were one of Mr. SMITH's slaves ""he would get what he deserved,"" notably a sound whipping, and ""direct"" him to take his seat;"" and that Mr. BINGHAM should thereupon do as he was bid, ""regretting that the gentleman was so ill-mannered"" -- all this is certainly a very pitiful and contemptible exhibition. Neither can it be thought very creditable to the wit of Mr. STEVENS, that he should quiz the Clerk by sending up a ""German paper,"" with a request to that hapless functionary to read out an extract from its, to him, hieroglyphical columns; nor highly indicative of the general good sense of the elect of the Union, that they should have been thrown into convulsions of anxiety, because Mr. CONKLIN sent Mr. BARKSDALE, a note ""containing a small bit of court plaster,"" no doubt in view of probable contingencies in which such a styptic might be of use to the member from Mississippi. But these are all things which, as Mr. ETHERIDGE, of Tennesssee, with complacent philosophy, remarked, ""must be sometimes expected to occur.""

It is said that Count WALEWSKI has made a very guarded denial of such authorship, having said to a German diplomat that were such the fact, he was unapprised of it, and that, if fully verified, he should resign his position in the Ministry. The pamphlet is generally accepted as evidence of an entire restoration of the entente cordiale between France and England, not only upon the Italian, but in regard to all other questions. To the same purpose, a dialogue purporting to have occurred between an Englishman and a Frenchman, upon the relations of the two countries, but in which the Emperor himself is understood to have been the chief interlocutor, is reported in the London Times, and gives occasion for general comment and much felicitation. Mr. RICHARD COBDEN is said to have represented England in the colloquy. There has been more skirmishing between the Spaniards and the Moors, but no general action. Italy is tranquilly awaiting the action of the Congress. The French pamphlet and the delegation of Count CAVOUR, as representative of Piedmont, are regarded as securities that the national claims are to be fully conceded.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/16/archives/private-property-in-war.html,,"Lord PALMERSTON has, it is said, given a direct negative to the proposal of the Hanse Towns, which we discussed a few days ago, to bring before the approaching Congress the propriety of placing private property at sea on the same footing as private property on shore. The London Times backs him up, by asking, sarcastically, why a proposition is not made to declare invasion of enemy's territory unlawful, and thus protect private individuals from the annoyance of having troops quartered in their houses. The question is a very silly one, and the answer very simple. War is a means of deciding quarrels between nations, and it is the only means that, in the existing state of human nature, will answer the purpose. It ought, however, to be deprived of every feature of harshness or severity which will not interfere with its efficiency as an arbitrator. It does not hasten the decision of the controversy to kill prisoners, or to rob houses, as the sorrowful experience of many ages and countries has proved. For a similar reason, it is unnecessary to rob vessels at sea. In fact, the great and only mode of putting an end to war, is seizing on the enemy's territory and holding it, or, in other words, assuming the government of it. This ends the dispute, and is consequently a complete justification of invasion, and the only one. If the Times is prepared with a substitute for war, it may ask to have the right of invasion abandoned; but until it is, its sneer is pointless; -- and unless those who refuse to place private property at sea at the same footing as property on land, can show that the right of plunder with regard to the former does more to hasten the decision of an armed controversy than the right of plundering the latter would do, they are fairly chargeable either with gross inconsistency, or with standing up in defence of one the worst relics of barbarism.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Private Property in War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Private Property in War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/552a5496-fb9c-512e-b448-70f665331811,332,nyt://article/552a5496-fb9c-512e-b448-70f665331811,

The Arizonians state that freight from Guaymas to Tucsen, in the centre of Arizona, is four cents per pound, and that the trip is made with ease, from end to end, in sixteen days, over as level and good a natural road as can be found in the United States; while freight from the mouth of the Gila to Tucson, though no further than from Guaymas, is twelve to fifteen cents per pound, and that owners of mules or cattle can scarcely be induced to go over the route at any price, because it is through an ""unsettled, dry and desert waste,"" and the best of fortune is required to get men and animals through alive within thirty days. ""C.T.C."" has got these routes transposed in his mind.

"FIRE AT POUGHKEEPSIE. -- On Friday afternoon last fire was discovered issuing from a large tenement house in Water-street. Poughkeepsie. The firemen experienced great difficulty in getting to the place, as the roads were obstructed by snow, and, when they did arrive, it was sometime before water was to be had.

[Cheers and laughter.] I am not sure but that honorable body consulted the proprieties of the occasion a little more closely than they were aware of at the time, for as things go nowadays, it is by no means certain but that the proper place for men who would save the Union is outside the halls of legislation. [Laughter, and cries of ""Good.""] But whether inside or outside, I, for one, am proud to be here to-night for such a purpose and with such an audience. I am glad to find myself among men who, even in these days of wild excitement, can lift themselves out of the smoke and stir of partisanship into the purer atmosphere of constitutional obligation -- who can apply themselves, without regard to party interests, in a spirit of elevated American patriotism, to the consideration of their duties to their common country. [Applause, mingled with talking and confusion from the attempt to approach the speaker by those at the further end of the Hall.] I must respectfully request, said Mr. R., that while I am talking others at the opposite end of the Hall shall keep silence. I cannot talk here against a dozen there. [Cries of ""Silence,"" ""Shut the door,"" &c.] I am here not to retract any political opinions I have ever held, nor to repent of any political action I have ever taken. I have held no sentiment at any time which would prevent me from joining, heartily and sincerely, in the objects of this meeting, and if there is any party in the country which dare not, or which will not respond to the demands of the call under which this meeting is held, I am thankful that I have never shared its hesitation or had any part or lot in its fastidious scruples. [Applause.] It is true that under ordinary circumstances it ought to be superfluous for Americans to meet together and declare their attachment to the Union and their loyalty to the Constitution under which they live and move and have their being. Love of the Union and loyalty to the Constitution ought to be taken for granted on the part of every citizen -- just as love of father and mother, of sister or of wife, is assumed in domestic life; and there can be no occasion for assembling together to proclaim our loyalty unless on the one hand it be suspected, or unless on the other the object of our regard may be menaced by some unusual peril.

The health of the historian had been failing for some months past, but there was no reason to anticipate a result so early and fatal. His disease was of the heart. As Lord MACAULAY was unmarried, the title has lapsed. Serious rumors in regard to the Congress were in circulation, and were not without depressing influences upon the money markets. Russia, it was reported, had protested against the pamphlet on ""the Pope and the Congress,"" and had announced its unwillingness to enter the Congress until its doctrines, which it regards as subversive of legitimate authority, should be disavowed. A similar protest had already been received from the Pope. Possibly, to these and other like difficulties is due the delay in the opening of the deliberations, the meeting having been postponed from Jan. 19 to a day not yet indicated. No fresh encounters had signalized the Hispano-Moorish war. The Spanish, fleet, which had been lying at Algesiras, had sailed with sealed orders. An enlargement of the story touching American mediation in China, states that Mr. WARD, our Minister, had gone to Foo-Chow to meet Ho, the Governor of that Province, and confer with him on the course to be pursued in order to avert the attack of the Europeans.

J.T. MOORS Co., is the largest structure for wholesale mercantile purposes in New-York. it covers over half an acre of ground, and has three fronts, on Broadway, Worth and Pearl streets, the width on Broadway being 75 feet, and on Pearl and Worth streets 75 and 25 feet, respectively. The lot is in the form of the letter T, the depth from Broadway to the rear being 175 feet, and the width from Pearl to Worth streets 200 feet. The style of architecture is Norman. The main and attractive features of the front are the columns, which extend up two stories, and are finished, with boldly-carved capitals and semicircular arches. For its vast extent, elegant finish and uniform distribution of light, the first story -- which is the leading salesroom -- is unsurpassed. Standing in the rear, one has an unobstructed view of the entire room. In the rear is an iron sky-light, as also one over the main centre; the latter, with the front windows, affording abundant light for the upper stories. The basement affords as large a salesroom as the stories above. The sub-cellar and the upper story are used as storage and packing rooms. Both basement and sub-cellar extend under the street on Broadway, the former being lighted by an illuminated iron platform extending the width of the entire front, and the latter by foot-lights in the basement floor underneath the illuminated platform. To facilitate the changing of goods from different stories, numerous ""dummies"" have been constructed. The goods are received into the basement and sub-cellar from Worth and Pearl streets by an elevator and inclined iron planes or slides, and are taken to and from the lofts by steam elevators, each being driven by a six horse power steam engine. The building is heated by steam throughout, and is fire proof. The lot is estimated at $365,000, and the building cost $225,000. The firm of C.W. & J.T. MOORE & Co., it is an interesting fact to mention, is the oldest importing and jobbing dry goods house in New-York, it having been established over forty years -- an unprecedented length of time in this City of mercantile vicissitude for a firm to remain unchanged.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c6afaae-4338-5bea-b764-72e572f8bb5c,1394,nyt://article/9c6afaae-4338-5bea-b764-72e572f8bb5c,

They involved charges of gross partiality, corruption and total incapacity, urged with unsparing rigor by the Mississippi Senator. Vainly, however, as Mr. BOWMAN was subsequently chosen. The House of Representatives addicted itself to the discussion of the plurality rule. Mr. HUTCHINS, who represents the District of Ohio, which for so many years returned the veteran GIDDINGS, advocated that plan, demonstrating the urgent need of organization, the impossibility of obtaining it without such resort, and pointing out the relative rights and duties of majorities and minorities in such contingencies. By the practice of both leading parties in previous instances, he showed that the plurality rule had always been regarded as constitutional; and into the question of its constitutionality he entered at some length. Mr. HUTCHINS was repeatedly interrupted by Southern members controverting his points; but eventually concluded by moving that the House proceed to vote for Speaker viva voce, and that he who should receive the highest number of voices should be declared elected. Points of order were raised at once, and an animated discussion resulted, in which Mr. HICKMAN vehemently denounced Northern Democrats who did the bidding of the South. Mr. MCCLERAND, of Illinois, and Mr. PRYOR, of Virginia, retorted upon Mr. HICKMAN, showering bitter personalities upon his head, and the latter charging him with falsehood.

The apologists of American Slavery in this country, who represent the New Englanders as desiring those consequences which they see, but which BROWN did not see, must have followed his success, have the means of knowing that the assertion is entirely unfounded. The intelligence of that rising was received by the true friends of the negro throughout the North with profound regret. It was seen at once that the best thing that could happen for the cause of liberation was the prompt suppression of that movement. It is a senseless calumny which the advocates of Slavery, whether in Virginia or Middlesex, utter when they pretend that the North wishes to see fire and slaughter carried into the homes of the white people in the South. We are at a loss to conceive what cause is to be served by these assertions.

PHILLIPS said that he knew of the decease of another old member, who had at one time left the City, and forfeited his membership -- Mr. JOHN ELY. Mr. ZOPHAR MILLS remembered that Mr. ELY was Foreman of Engine No. 37 in 1835. The Chairman appointed the following Executive Committee for the year: J.Y. Watkins, J.R. Titus, N. Finch, H. Feeks, David Logan, Alfred Ashfield, Mark Fowler, Jacob L. Smith. Messrs. A.W. TURNBULL and J. COGER, Jr., were appointed Representatives, and the crusty Sergeant at-Arms was continued in office. The Chairman presented a beautifully engrossed list of the Exempt Firemen in San Francisco, which was referred to the Executive Committee, and ordered to be framed and hung in the Exempt Firemen's room until further orders.

There are two royal resicences in Denmark which bear nearly the same name. The one, close to Copenhagen, is Fredericksberg, built in the 18th century by FREDERICK IV., in the Italian style, and afterwards enlarged by CHRISTIAN VI., and from the balcony of which there is a [???] view over the city, the Sound, and the coasts of Sweden. The other palace, that of Fredericksburg, which has been just destroyed, was five miles from Copenhagen, and was the Pantheon of the glories of Denmark. It was divided into three parts, separated from each other by fortified fosses. The principal edifice had four stories, with handsome towers and pinnacles. It had vast cellars extending under water, for the chateau stood on an island in a lake, but they were built so substantially that no dampness could penetrate. What more particularly attracted the attention of strangers visiting this place was the chapel situated in the left wing and embe[???]shed with sculptures, pictures, and the most exquisite carvings in wood. King CHRISTIAN the Fourth himself turned several of the arabesques and flowers in ivory found there. The altar was a masterpiece of workmanship, and had no less than 150 kilogrammes of silver employed on it. Over the gallery stool an escutcheon with the arms of Denmark, surrounded by those of the knights still living of the orders of the Elephant and of DanfDanish, an I German languages. It was a real nebrog. In an adjoining hall were the escutcheons of the deceased knights, and among them that of NAPOLEON I. The hall of the knights, one of the largest in Europe, being not less than 150 feet long, was all of marble; its handsome mantel-piece had been unfortunately injured by the Swedes during the wars. The ceiling was ornamented with innumerable figures, groups, and symbolical and emblematical representations of all kinds, intermingled with sentences in the Latin. Danish an I German languages. It was a real theatrum mundi, and twenty-six artists were employed on it for seven years. The portrait gallery was unique of its kind, and of great value for the history of Denmark. Each sovereign had a space reserved for him, and round him were grouped the members of his family, ministers, and all who had made themselves conspicuous under his reign. In the collection were portraits of the astronomer. TYCHO BRAHE, the poet HOLDERG, the historian SUHM, and numerous others. The portraits of STRUENSEE and the unfortunate Queen MATHILDA, were not suspended in the gallery, but visitors were shown the words ""O, God, keep me innocent!"" which the Queen had cut on one of the windows with a diamond ring. Fredericksburg was, as has been above mentioned, situated in the middle of a lake, a site expressly chosen by CHRISTIAN IV., who was an experienced sailor, and one of the most popular kings every known in that country. It was his favorite place of residence. The courtiers laughed at the idea of building a palace in such a spot, out the King paid no attention to their remarks, and by the aid of English architects and workmen, whom he procured for the purpose, succeeded in carrying out all his plans successfully, and completing a magnificent pile of building.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Destruction by Fire of the Royal Castle of Denmark.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Destruction by Fire of the Royal Castle of Denmark.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FIRES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4cec1d71-525d-514d-8b69-0d017c8fe2f4,557,nyt://article/4cec1d71-525d-514d-8b69-0d017c8fe2f4,

The most striking points against the young man were, his confession of guilt, as testified to by a single witness, and his flight into Canada. These, probably, would have been sufficient to convict him, without demur on the part of the jury, but for the astute manner in which his defence was managed by his counsel, Messrs. Oakey Hall and Edmon Blankman. As it was, they fairly won Judge RUSSELL to charge directly in the prisoner's favor. The Judge told the Jury that the offence committed by Karples -- supposing him to have committed one -- could not be one of embezzlement, inasmuch as the flour had been in the possession of Hecker Bros., and they could only, therefore, pass upon the indictment for larceny. After commenting upon the testimony, the Judge asked what evidence there was against him, except his confession? Confessions, he proceeded, were to be received with much caution. There was no evidence that the order was forged, except the alleged confession, and confessions were the worst species of evidence ever presented to a Court and jury, because there was in most cases, as in this, no person present but the witness and the party making the confession, and the latter's mouth being closed on his trial, he could offer no explanation, while the witness might have an object in perverting the substance of the so-called confession, or might do so inadvertently, through infirmity of memory. The Judge quoted Greenleaf on Evidence, relating to Confessions. It rested, he said, with the jury to receive the confession of the defendant or to reject it. Was the evidence conclusive as to the guilt of the prisoner? Might it not be consistent with the hypothesis of his innocence? His good character was to be steadily kept in view. The circumstance of his flight into Canada was not to be taken as evidence of his guilt, for fear operates differently on the minds of men, and an innocent person, suspected of crime, might fly because he was suspected.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; General Sessions.

"In a letter to the London Times, Mr. W. SAVAGE LANDOR Says: ""The French can never long be free; the Italians of the north can never long be slaves. Ardent in their aspirations, they are calm and steady in their march towards the recovery of their rights. The air of Venetia and of Etruria is of the same temperature; the pulses of the heart are the same in both. Italy is the only country that can present to Europe a balance of power. The fi[???]ger of France has lowered the scale on her side. It is only by the Union of all Italian States and their dependencies that the fairest portion of the globe can long exist in peace or recover its lost prosperity. England will no longer be apprehensive of injury by the canal (if canal be practicable) across the Isthmus of Suez. She will enjoy the full benefit of trade with Italian Companies now impoverished, but not ruined utterly. There are cities in Italy and Dalmatia destined to be as opulent and enterprising as Venice and Genoa were in former times. Russia is interested -- I will not say equally -- in the resurrection of Italy under one supreme ruler. She has obtained a privilege on the Mediterranean; she will obtain a similar or greater one on the Adriatic. Austria is crumbling to Pieces, and can neither help or hurt us. She refused the former in the Crimea, the latter she has exhibited in Italy with constancy and success. This is over with her now. Russia may, do us either service or injury, as she lists; but she well knows which is best for her.

SAVAGE LANDOR Says: ""The French can never long be free; the Italians of the north can never long be slaves. Ardent in their aspirations, they are calm and steady in their march towards the recovery of their rights. The air of Venetia and of Etruria is of the same temperature; the pulses of the heart are the same in both. Italy is the only country that can present to Europe a balance of power. The fi[???]ger of France has lowered the scale on her side. It is only by the Union of all Italian States and their dependencies that the fairest portion of the globe can long exist in peace or recover its lost prosperity. England will no longer be apprehensive of injury by the canal (if canal be practicable) across the Isthmus of Suez. She will enjoy the full benefit of trade with Italian Companies now impoverished, but not ruined utterly. There are cities in Italy and Dalmatia destined to be as opulent and enterprising as Venice and Genoa were in former times. Russia is interested -- I will not say equally -- in the resurrection of Italy under one supreme ruler. She has obtained a privilege on the Mediterranean; she will obtain a similar or greater one on the Adriatic. Austria is crumbling to Pieces, and can neither help or hurt us. She refused the former in the Crimea, the latter she has exhibited in Italy with constancy and success. This is over with her now. Russia may, do us either service or injury, as she lists; but she well knows which is best for her. She abates her desire to snatch the turban off the Sink Man's head; she sees him wasting away irremediably, and she will attend his funeral decently and demurely.

As there are several hundred of these gentlemen in this City, their appointment by universal suffrage would lend additional animation to our election days,--and anybody who is fond of uproar, confusion, corruption, irresponsibility and worthless officials, will, of course, be delighted to have the bill pass. Our main objection to it is, that it does not go far enough. The principle on which it is based -- that every one who performs any service for the public ought to be elected by the popular vote -- is capable of indefinite expansion. Why not deliver the Police, the Central Park laborers, and the City scavengers from their present degrading position, and let them derive their powers and privileges from the ballot-box alone? It is disgraceful that three or four thousand public functionaries should thus be left to owe their appointment to arbitrary commissioners and superintendents. Moreover, hotel keepers would do well not to maintain their present insolent attitude much longer. The proper way to select waiters is clearly to have them elected by the guests and boarders. Thus and thus only can they be protected from the abuses of power, and hotel-keeping be carried on with efficiency. The same thing may be said of bank clerks. The stockholders should choose them by ballot. The interference of the president and directors in their selection is utterly opposed to the spirit of the age as well as of our manners and government. In fact, the people at large are notoriously so diligent in ascertaining the fitness of candidates for the public service, in voting for the best that present themselves, and after their election in seeing that they do their duty, that it is clear the more officers we ballot for the happier and better governed we shall be.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEMOCRACY IN EXCESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DEMOCRACY IN EXCESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12626f07-f221-57f8-88b6-3de224406695,320,nyt://article/12626f07-f221-57f8-88b6-3de224406695,

The office is closed for the transaction of business regularly at 3 P.M., and two policemen stationed outside inform all who call after that hour that such is the fact. The Mayor is waited upon by visitors, whose name is legion, every day. Poor people, who are in difficulty, apply at the office for aid numerously. Whatever their complaint they seem to think Mayor WOOD can right them and redress their wrongs. Daily, women with young babes present themselves there, tell the story of their grievances, and ask that faithless husbands may be compelled to support them, or gay Lotharios forced to give them back their ""peace of mind."" The Mayor's Private Secretary, Mr. THOMPSON, or his chief clerk, Mr. AULD, converse with these, tell them that the Mayor is powerless to serve them, and inform them where and by what means they will be most likely to obtain assistance. The same gentlemen attend to all other applications for aid or information which are presented. The Mayor never receives any of them. The old complaints of ticket-swindling are frequently preferred. They present no novel features commonly. It is the old story in each case. A stranger in the City -- bound to California -- obliging friend -- regular ticket office -- a swindle -- applies at the Mayor's office -- no law against ticket swindling -- an officer sent to the bogus ticket-agent -- ticket-agent refunds part of the money, so as to ""keep on the right side of the authorities"" -- stranger departs disgusted. These bogus ticket-agents, now-a-days, are too cunning to sell bogus tickets to their dupes. They procure bona fide tickets, and sell them at exorbitant prices to the green ones. By so doing, in the eye of the law, they commit no crime. There should be some special legislation on this subject without delay.

After some preliminary business, in the course of which Mr. GWIN introduced his bill providing for a trans-continental telegraph, and Mr. BROWN his resolutions as to Congressional protection of Slavery in the Territories, a question as to the power of the Senate to legislate prior to the organization of the House was raised and discussed. Mr. HALE desired to put a naval appropriation bill upon its passage. Mr. HUNTER objected on the ground that after the action of the House last Summer it would be discourteous to originate appropriation bills in the Senate; while others took the ground that there can be no legislation until the House shall have organized. Mr. CRITTENDEN asserted that the House is as much a legislative body now as it will be after organization. This view was rebutted by Mr. TRUMBULL, of Illinois, who asked if the House, as now constituted, were to pass a bill to-morrow, and send it to the Senate, whether it could be accepted as valid legislation? Mr. BAYARD offered a resolution that no bills be put upon their passage prior to the choice of a Speaker in the House, and so the controversy ended. The attention of the House was claimed by Mr. CLOPTON, of Alabama, and after Mr. WASHBURNE, of Maine, had vainly attempted to stop further debate, Mr. CLOPTON had his hearing. His speech, while it differed from that of Mr. CURRY, of the same State, in its extreme violence of tone, offered no points distinguishing it from the mass of Southern oratory this Winter. Mr. CARTER, of New-York, then defined his position, declaring himself independent of the Republicans, and yet avowing opinions quite in advance of the Philadelphia platform. His interrogatories addressed to Southern Americans elicited from four of them declarations in favor of Congressional legislation protecting Slavery in the Territories, and. from ETHERIDGE, of Tennessee, an opinion adverse to such legislation. The sentiments of the Northwestern Democracy were expressed by Mr. COX, of Ohio, Mr. HOLMAN, of Indiana, and Mr. MCCLERNARD, of Illinois, as hostile to any intervention of Congress in Territorial questions.

The results already attained afford a curious commentary upon the indignation to which certain of the Baltimore partisan journals gave way on finding that the independent Press of the country had ventured to question the propriety, decorum and civilization displayed by the Plug-Uglies, Awl Clubs and other agreeable associations of Baltimorean sovereigns, upon that occasion. The editor of the Baltimore Exchange, as our readers will remember, was forced to defend himself from the assaults of some of these offended depositories of political power, by a recourse to the ""last argument of Kings,"" simply and solely because he had shown manliness in admitting, and good citizenship in denouncing, the outrages perpetrated at the polls upon unarmed voters. The NEW-YORK TIMES was in a like spirit set upon by some of its contemporaries for calling attention to the shame and peril of such occurrences in a great American city. It now appears that the system of intimidation by personal violence has become thoroughly organized in the Monumental City; and that the excesses of Baltimore elections are not to be treated as mere sporadic cases of popular ebullition. The Jacobin Clubs of France were not more thoroughly drilled in the art and mystery of harmonizing public opinion than are the so-called ""Americans,"" of Baltimore. Several days before the late election, these indefatigable men were in the field. They scoured the city, as eagerly bent upon finding ""foreigners"" as any Dublin oysterman upon dredging for ""natives."" Irishmen, Germans; all who fell in their way, were harpooned, carried off to subterranean cells, locked up, compelled from time to time to drink great quantities of whisky -- reduced, in short, to a state of complete submission. When the day of election came, these captives were paraded openly in the streets, in custody of a guard with cocked revolvers, marched from poll to poll, forced to vote five or six times over, returned to their dungeons, beaten again, and finally released when the great issue had been decided, and the ""unbought voice of freemen"" had selected the officers by whom the laws of an American community were to be administered and its rights defended.

Mr. COX of Ohio, Mr. MCCLERNAND of Illinois, and Mr. HOLMAN of Indiana, affirmed their adhesion to Popular Sovereignty, and deprecated the effect upon the Democratic Party of the North of any departure from the Cincinnati Platform. It is not easy to see any way of reconciling the existing differences of opinion upon this subject, and to ignore them would subject the Party to the well-founded charge of double-dealing and dishonesty. If Southern gentlemen expect to go into the next Presidential campaign upon a platform which recognizes the right and duty of Congress to interfere against the will of the people of a Territory -- for in only such a case would intervention be necessary -- without experiencing a Waterloo defeat, they will find themselves laboring under an egregious mistake. A ticket paraded on such a platform could not receive one electoral vote north of Mason and Dixon's line. We do not care, at the present time, to argue the matter, but it is our province to give a fair and truthful representation of the public sentiment of the country. It may be that some of the more extreme men of the South take this ground for the very purpose of hastening the crisis which they pronounce inevitable in the event of their political defeat. To suppose that they seriously urge the adoption of this doctrine as a party test, with any hope of its indorsement by the country, is to give them credit for a talent at blundering worthy the Roman soldier whom GALLIENUS decorated with a silver medal for missing the mark sixty consecutive times in his target-practice.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BREAKERS AHEAD FOR THE DEMOCRACY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BREAKERS AHEAD FOR THE DEMOCRACY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2edfb144-76a0-58fc-ab2e-d700296f49f4,370,nyt://article/2edfb144-76a0-58fc-ab2e-d700296f49f4,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/20/archives/chemistry-of-carbon-a-lecture-bt-prof-r-sillman-jr.html,,"The few persons who were able to hear Prof. SILLIMAN'S second lecture, at Cooper Institute, last evening, were no doubt highly interested, but the number of such persons was necessarity limited, in consequence of the presence of several hundred unruly, noisy, and disorderly boys from some of our Ward schools. Through some mistaken generosity, free tickets were given to the Grammar school pupils of schools Nos. 11, 45, 3, 16, 41, 48, and 35. The boys looked upon the entire proceedings as excessively amusing, and made so much disturbance that most of the adults left the Hall before the conclusion of the lecture. The busy hum of conversation, cat-calls, and whistles, finally rose to hooting and howling, and eventually terminated in prolonged shouting, to the great chagrin of the unfortunate M.P., who vainly strove to preserve decorum among the juveniles. As nearly as could be gathered, during the confusion, Prof. SILLIMAN commenced with an explanation of the character and extent of the Pennsylvania coal-fields, the nature of anthracite and bituminous coal, the geological formation of the coal-beds, and the evidence drawn from the subterranean strata that plants which now are the inhabitants solely of the tropics were once the products of Baffin's Bay and Vancouver's Island. The lecturer then proceeded with his interesting experiments, receiving little attention, and plentiful ""hi, hi's"" from young New-York. He demonstrated the properties of oxygen in sustaining combustion -- relighting a candle just blown out, by plunging it into the gas; and by the burning of phosphorus in a jar of oxygen, showing a brilliant light, which was immediately extinguished on being placed in a jar of nitrogen, and burned with ordinary flame in common air. He filled an inverted jar with hydrogen and held a lighted candle in it. The candle was extinguished and the gas took fire -- the reverse effect taking place when the candle was withdrawn. The extreme lightness of gas was shown by weighing it against common air, which proved the heaviest. The fact that carbonic acid results from respiration was proved by breathing into a jar, the acid being subsequently tested in various ways -- with a lighted candle and lime water, the former going out, and the latter being turned to chalk. Various effects were shown by the combustion of hydrogen, including the deposit of moisture, and the singing noise produced by burning the gas in a confined space. In this connection the lecturer demonstrated the explosive nature of hydrogen, by making bubbles filled with the gas, which exploded with loud reports on being touched with a lighted candle. The fact that there is no combustion in the centre of a flame, and that the greatest heat is at the top, was illustrated by passing a card through the flame at different points. The principle of Sir. HUMPHREY DAVY's safety lamp was shown by the holding of a piece of common sieve over a volume of flame, which was turned down, although some of the combustible gas escaped through the pores, and could be lighted by the application of flame to the upper side of the gauze. The philosophy of this lamp, he thought, could be properly applied to the prevention of camphene and burning-fluid accidents, by the application of a small piece of fine gauze sieve to the mouth and neck of the can containing the fluid.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Chemistry of Carbon.; A LECTURE BT PROF.

After obliging his subscribers with a twelvemonth of entertainment and instruction of a specifically literary kind, he has invariably astonished them on New-Year's Day with a refined and delightful engraving. The readers of the Albion know that this agreeable weekly has always maintained a high rank in the strictly critical world, and they have therefore been proportionably exacting in their expectations of its own artistic achievements. But it is due to justice and simple truth to say that the prints which have succeeded each other from its press during the last few years might be safely referred to to-day as illustrations of the gradual but decided progress which the art of engraving has been making on this side of the Atlantic. They have been chronicles of the burin as faithful, exact and impartial as could be asked for. With the present year, our contemporary reverts from the field of purely journalistic interest to the unchangeable domain of natural beauty. We have no Florence Nightingales now, nor Havelocks, but a most loyal and careful reproduction of one of LANDSEER's noblest works -- ""The Deer-Pass."" This picture is in every respect a fine companion-painting for the well-known ""Monarch of the Glen."" It represents, like that admirable composition, a wild, precipitous, solemn gorge of the Highland hills. The mosses are deep on the mountain sides -- the riding and rolling vapors cloud and cloak the deep rifts of the eternal rocks. The sense of space and of silence broods throughout the canvas. On the narrow pathway which winds through the formidable defile, the deer are clustered -- their many-antlered king in the van. Flights of hill-birds lead the eye gently away from the foreground over the vastness of the glooming distance. The engraver has followed the nervous, expressive pencil of his author with singular fidelity, and the picture is a success, which the subscribers of the Albion -- let us say it without compliment -- abundantly deserve. It is their just reward for believing with our contemporary, that an interesting record of the world's events, from week to week, may be made up without appealing to any sectional or political passions, on the broad Catholic ground of a general sympathy with literary aspiration, artistic culture and humane common sense all the world over. Our only quarrel with our neighbor is, that he is apt to fall into the Anti-Napoleonic craze of his countrymen, and to shoulder his old Queen ANNE's musket whenever he hears so much as a salute from the guns of a French man-of-war. But to ask the Albion newspaper to be wiser than Albion herself, would be absurd; and so taking our contemporary as right is, with all due recognition of his nationality and his notions, we can heartily rejoice in his prosperity, and wish him many long years of the same.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Albion Print for 1860.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Albion Print for 1860.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8159610c-112c-5117-a95c-36f8c9df476f,505,nyt://article/8159610c-112c-5117-a95c-36f8c9df476f,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/20/archives/scientific-notes-improved-agricultural-machinery.html,,"One of the most ingenious, novel, and, we believe, useful inventions of its kind, is a plan recently brought out, of applying power to agricultural and other hand or horse-propelled machinery, without the serious disadvantages attending the great weight, and consequent propulsive power ordinarily required. The cutters, and working parts of mowers, reapers, and tilling machines, are ordinarily driven from a wheel which carries the principal weight of the implement, and is itself rotated by its adhesion upon the ground, as the implement is drawn forward. Now, if the weight upon this wheel were very light, and the power required from it considerable, the wheel would slip over the ground like a sleigh runner, and the attached machinery would not be propelled. To avoid such a result, not only is the implement itself made very heavy, but the driver adds his weight to it, and the tread of the wheel itself is in most cases roughened with spikes or projections like a steamer's paddles, so that it shall more firmly adhere to the ground. That is to say: a light frame-work is amply sufficient to carry the working machinery, but for the simple purpose of adhesion, we add a tremendous and otherwise unnecessary load, provide several times the otherwise requisite power to draw it, and still further obstruct its easy action by driving the spiked wheels into the ground, and in thereby giving them a jarring and unsteady motion.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/20/archives/life-and-labors-of-whitfield-a-lecture-by-rev-jp-newman.html,,"Rev. J.P. NEWMAN delivered a lecture last evening, before the Yonng Men's Christian Association, of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church, on Whitfield, in their church in Thirty-fourth street. After describing somewhat at length the religious condition of the world at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the lecturer said that on the 16th of December, 1714, GEORGE WHITFIELD, the sixth son of THOMAS and ELIZABETH WHITFIELD, was born in Gloucester, England. His father was an inn-keeper, and at the age of 14, GEORGE assisted his mother in a public-house. Thus humble was his origin. He was put to school at 17, where he remained nearly two years, and at the age of 18 he entered Pembroke College. Although he was a child of prayer, it was not till he entered Oxford, where he met with the two WESLEYS, that he received pardon for his sins. On the 20th of June, 1734, he was ordained priest in the Cathedral of his native city, and his sermon on that occasion shadowed forth his future course. Mr. NEWMAN then sketched the characteristics of the contemporaries of WHITFIELD who were prominent in the ministry, not forgetting to mention his patroness, Lady JANE HUNTINGTON. In this country, JONATHAN EDWARDS was then at the height of his power. He, said the speaker, was the great theologian who planted his theology on Mount Sinai; WHITFIELD planted his on Calvary; EDWARDS appalled; WHITFIELD aroused. In contrasting WHITFIELD with JOHN WESLEY, he said that the former was the mountain torrent; the latter the sparkling fountain. WHITFIELD was the wagoner who brought the timbers for the house; WESLEY the architect that created is. Happily for the world, these two men were contemporaneous, and, as it were, the supplements of each other. But if WHITFIELD was so great a man, what must he have been as an orator? In early life he gave special attention to declamation, for to him it was a duty to learn how to speak as well as what to speak. It is a shame to the Christian ministry that the stage is the only place where true oratory is cultivated. WHITFIELD was a master of eloquence. His accents of love soothed the heart of the mourner, while they broke upon the ear of crime with the thunder tones of Job. He could conjure up another Gethsemane, or light up another Tabor and drown it in Heaven's own glory. He spoke because he felt; his heaters felt because they saw. He was also a master of sacred rhetoric, which was defined tone the presentation of trite and familiar truths with striking power. The difference between ministers, is not in thought, but expression. If MASSILLON was great in his appeals, HALL in his fullness of definition, CHALMERS in his splendor of diction, WHITFIELD was greater in the sublime naturalness of his impersonations and the impressiveness of his apostrophes. At his command the dead would pass in review before our startled gaze, and at his bidding ranks of shining saints would appear to our vision and one could almost hear the music of Heaven. If such was WHITFIELD the orator, what was he as a divine?",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Life and Labors of Whitfield.; A LECTURE BY REV. J.P.

They recommend for adoption ""Prospect Park,"" with the following boundaries: Douglass-street, Washington-avenue to the city line on Montgomery-street, thence southwesterly in a straight line to the intersection of the city line and Ninth-street; Ninth-street, Tenth avenue, Third-street to the centre of the block between Eighth and Ninth avenues; thence northerly in a line parallel with Ninth-avenue to Douglass-street; thence easterly along Douglass-street to Washington-avenue, the place of beginning -- containing 200 acres, exclusive of Flatbush-avenue and the Reservoir, which together contain 17 acres, making the whole area of the Park about 267 acres. The estimated present value of the same is $l,000,000. The Committee also recommend the adoption of the ""Ridgewood Park,"" with the boundaries as designated on the map prepared by THOMAS W. FIELD, Esq. This will contain 520 acres, 115 acres of which are permanently devoted to the Cemetery of the Evergreens, 48 acres to the Ridgewood Reservoir -- making the land to be purchased for Park purposes about 360 acres. The estimated cost of the land is $200,000. It also reported in favor of the land bounded by Third-street, Fifth-avenue, Sixth-street and Fourth-avenue as a local park, and of twenty-five acres of land at East New-York, in the town of New Lotts, to be taken from the southerly portion of land belonging to the heirs of -- HOWARD, deceased, for a parade ground. This land is located at the terminus of three City railroads, communicating with five different ferries across the East River, and is in full view of Ridgewood Park. The cost of this land wilt be about $25,000. This report was adopted.

We alluded, a few days ago, to W. P. GILMAN Co.'s grand plan of making a decent livelihood by establishing a registry in which Northern merchants may have themselves certified as ""sound on the goose,"" upon the payment of fifty dollars down, and the purchase of a book to be published annually by the said GILMAN & Co., at the small price of $3. A little journal in this City, which lives by praising Slavery and abusing negroes, and which is evidently very much too ""cute"" to make it necessary for us to advertise it by naming it, has come to the conclusion that GILMAN & Co. have ""struck a vein,"" and is most anxious to share in the profitable working thereof. A lengthy editorial, accordingly, favors the enterprising GILMAN with a reasonable measure of approval. It thinks he can render the South good service, and confound the Abolitionists, if he will but take the right means of ascertaining which merchants are sound and which are not. But how is this to be done? How is W.P. GILMAN to ascertain whether the persons who pay him fifty dollars, and order his invaluable almanac, are really Pro-Slavery men, or only mercenary Abolitionists in disguise. ""Fifty dollars,"" says our astute contemporary, ""would be amazingly cheap for some persons to pay for being put down sound."" So it would, and if Mr. GILMAN were wise in his generation he would arrange a sliding scale -- charging the rank Pro-Slavery men only fifty dollars; those who disapprove of Slavery in the abstract, but have no objection to its extension, seventy-five; those who object to its extension, but are willing to let it alone where it exists, one hundred; rank Abolitionists, for not showing them up and getting their collectors tarred and feathered, one hundred and fifty. This seems to us a very fail and feasible arrangement, provided the New-York merchants are as great fools as W.P. GILMAN & Co. evidently believe them to be. But even this plan does not provide for the great difficulty, that of classifying the applicants for W.P.G.'s indorsement.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trading is Terrorism.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Trading is Terrorism.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6a3327c-2e9c-590e-abe1-d5ef5cb507b4,818,nyt://article/a6a3327c-2e9c-590e-abe1-d5ef5cb507b4,

Mr. COLFAX, at the same time, proclaimed the willingness of the Republicans ""to vote on any and every proposition, now pending, or which may be pending."" In support of the constitutionality of the plurality rule, he referred to the two previous instances in which a Speaker had been elected under that rule without a question of the validity of the Congressional enactments of the period, and also to the fact that all the members hold their seats under the operation of the same rule, -- Rhode Island alone requiring a majority vote to elect her delegates. It might have been added that the President of the United States is elected in the same way; for though the Constitution requires that he shall receive a majority of the electoral votes, yet the electors themselves, in the different States, may be elected by a plurality. In fact the plurality rule is a practical necessity in the organization of any political body, or in the election of public officers, and all representative government might at any moment come to an end without it. But the question of the constitutionality of any action of Congress must originally be settled by that body itself; and the decision of the majority of its members in favor of such constitutionality is conclusive until it is reversed by the only competent tribunal -- the Supreme Court. There is no clearer principle than that, under our System, the majority should govern; and if a majority of the members of the House desire the adoption of the plurality rule, then the attempt on the part of the minority to prevent, by dilatory motions, and parliamentary tactics, the House from coming to a vote, is really factions, and will be eventually so understood by the country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Organization of Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Organization of Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed89a094-5a79-5079-806f-6f345cccf343,562,nyt://article/ed89a094-5a79-5079-806f-6f345cccf343,

The introductory essay to the Flora of Tasmania, a work now in course of preparation by the eminent botanist, Dr. JOSEPH D. HOOKER, is the opening article. In the course of this essay, which treats particularly of the origination and distribution of species, Dr. HOOKER states that he has brought together evidence of nearly 8,000 flowering plants having been collected or observed in Australia, of which number he has seen a catalogue of upwards of 7,000. By permission of the Treasury Department, Prof. BACHE communicates a general account of the results of the discussion of the declinometer observations made at Girard College between the years 1840 and 1845. He treats particularly of these observations as they relate to the eleven-year period, or, as it is commonly called, the decennial period in the amplitude of the solar diurnal variation, and the disturbances of the magnetic declination. Prof. W.H.C. BARTLETT, of the West Point Military Academy, presents a brief paper on the comas and tails of comets, and Prof. W.A. NORTON an article in which he sums up the result of his calculations to determine the theoretical dimensions of the comet of 1858. Chemists will be interested in the paper on osmious acid and on the numerical relations existing between the equivalent number of elementary bodies; while geologists will find their wants attended to in the articles which discuss the new genus of patelliform shells recently discovered in the cretaceous rocks of Nebraska, and the new species of crinoidea from the subcar-boniferous rocks of Indiana and Kentucky.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/24/archives/harpers-ferry-in-the-senate.html,,"The new Senate Chamber at Washington yesterday witneased, for the first time, a scene which recalls the great debates of the nation in that old Hall made illustrious by the eloquence and the patriotism of WEBSTER and CLAY of CALHOUN and BENTON. It was crowed in every part, from floor to gallery. The Representatives left their own Hall; the citizens of Washington, the foreign diplomatists, the whole floating population of the Capital, thronged the huge gilded saloon in which the Senators hold their high council, to hear the gravest questions affecting the relations of State with State in the Union discussed by the champion of Popular Sovereignty. Thus much at least it is due to Mr. DOUGLAS to say, that, he dealt with the themes suggested by the crisis in which the nation is now struggling, in a temper and in a tone worthy of their importance. The proposition which he laid before the Senate is one which has already been demanded with less of form and detail by conservative men out of Congress, in speeches made before popular assemblies in various parts of the country, and through the columns of the Press. The Senator from Illinois very briefly, clearly and forcibly stated the case arising out of JOHN BROWN's arrest, between the Governor of a single Commonwealth and the President of the Union. Virginia found herself threatened with invasion, not by a foreign foe, but by an organized band of American citizens from a sister State. On application for protection to the Federal Executive, she was informed that no provision had ever been made for meeting such a contingency. It can hardly be thought discreditable to the sagacity of our fathers that this should be so, since even after the angry sectional collisions of the last few years, the tidings of JOHN BROWN's raid took the whole nation by surprise. But it will be very discreditable to ourselves, as Mr. DOUGLAS boldly and distinctly put it, should we now refuse to meet an issue which has actually arisen, and the recurrence of which cannot be safely regarded as improbable unless measures shall be taken to render it impossible. For while nothing can be more certain than that the attempt to render the Republican Party or its leaders, now dominant at the North, directly responsible for the deliberate conspiracy of JOHN BROWN, was a most senseless and indecent abuse even of the large license of partisan warfare, nothing at the same time can be more clear than that JOHN BROWN's conspiracy would never have been dreamed of, had not a widespread practical hostility to Slavery wherever it exists been developed throughout the Northern States during the fierce sectional conflict which followed the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Harper's Ferry in the Senate."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Harper's Ferry in the Senate."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a7674dbe-2c7c-512b-9289-4d90cb10a702,855,nyt://article/a7674dbe-2c7c-512b-9289-4d90cb10a702,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/24/archives/colored-persons-and-passports.html,,"A curious instance of that cheap Pharisaism which is so common all the world over, and which leads the British Abolitionist to look down with a sort of contemptuous compassion upon his benighted American brother as a covenanter with hell, just as it leads the American demagogue to pity his British kinsman as a serf of the ""spangled aristocracy,"" has just occurred in London. Miss SARAH LENOX REMOND, a colored young lady of Massachusetts, who devotes a good deal of her time to the pleasing task of teaching the English idea of freedom to shoot envenomed arrows of scorn at the American fact of Slavery, found herself the other day in the British Capital on her way to Paris, and sent or took her passport to the American Legation for a visa in form. The passport appears to have been regularly issued from the office of the Secretary of State at Washington, and describes Miss REMOND as ""a citizen of the United States."" On the face of the passport there could be no question as to the right of Miss REMOND to demand a visa from the American representative. But the Secretary at the Legation seems to have been instructed to take his cue from the face of the bearer rather than from that of the document, and he accordingly refused to affix the official certificate to the paper in question. In this refusal he was sustained by his chief, who informed Miss REMOND that it was impossible for him to comply with her demand, without violating injunctions received from the American Government, July 8, 1856. It is sufficiently plain that the American Legation at London really did nothing more than its duty in this case, although it may well be a question whether the Secretary of State has a right to throw the responsibility of criticising and correcting passports signed by himself, upon his representatives abroad. A certificate of citizenship issued in this solemn form by the American Premier, ought not to expose persons who have left their homes, relying upon its validity, to such annoyances as overtook Miss REMOND in London.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Colored Persons and Passports.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Colored Persons and Passports.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bba60d48-ef13-5d8b-8b12-1ede20cdfaeb,455,nyt://article/bba60d48-ef13-5d8b-8b12-1ede20cdfaeb,

That he is a humbug in judgment, and a flunkey in patronage, I scarcely think that MORRIS MOORE, that most renowned and ill-treated art-critic, would deny. There are men born to be wrong, even when most intending to do right. There are insects which perform the functions of life when their brains are removed and replaced by cotton-wool. Among human insects there is often to be seen a melancholy amount of activity coexistent with the normal absence of the cerebral matter.

This attempt originated, so far as appears, with that model of all municipal virtues, Mayor WOOD, who began his term of office by requesting as a ""personal favor"" that he might be allowed to substitute one Police Captain for another in the command of the City Hall force, and followed up the success of this impertinent interference with a demand to be permitted to select the whole number of the officers detailed to the City Hall service. This demand Mr. PILSBURY very properly refused to comply with, on grounds perfectly respectful to the Mayor and connected with the exigencies of the Police Department. Thereupon Mr. WOOD, taking counsel with Commissioners STRANAHAN and BOWEN, procured the passage of resolutions, the tendency of which is simply to strip the Police Superintendent of all real authority over the force confided to his care. Now, as we cordially agree with Mayor WOOD in his loudly professed respect for a ""one man power,"" and believe a force like the Police to be peculiarly adapted for its exercise, and as we furthermore consider Mr. PILSBURY to be the most efficient head the Police has ever had, we need hardly say that we deprecate in the strongest manner any interference with him until his own distinctly proved misconduct shall make interference necessary. It seems to be the inevitable fate of all Boards and Commissions in this unhappy country, and at this juncture of time, to be split up into at least two political parties, each of which is guided in all its acts by the sole consideration of their bearing on the next Presidential election, and on the question of Slavery. When any body of men, in such a perfectly frantic condition of mind, undertakes to interfere with the internal discipline of a military corps, the result is certain to be the destruction of all discipline, and the growth in its place of corruption and insubordination in all possible forms. The duty of a Police Commission is to indicate generally the policy to be pursued by their commanding officer; to supervise expenses, and to try delinquents. They may point out the duties of the Police -- but how those duties are to be performed, what men shall perform them, and what rules are necessary to secure efficiency, ought to be absolutely none of their business. The Superintendent ought, on all these points, to have an entire discretion, and to be held strictly responsible. It may perhaps be in the nature of news to the present Police Commission, to tell them that when an order is sent by a General of Division to have a certain service performed by a certain number of men, it would be a rank insult for him to ignore the existence of the General of Brigade and the Colonel of the regiment, and select the companies for the work himself, and that no army could be held together for a month under such a system.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spoiling the Police.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spoiling the Police.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'POLICE DEPARTMENT', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2093e2ee-15a9-5bd8-a0ce-69abe132ef7a,704,nyt://article/2093e2ee-15a9-5bd8-a0ce-69abe132ef7a,

The Congressional elections were over. Important discoveries of silver mines, and of a shorter route to the navigable waters of the Amazon had been made. CASTILLA, URETA and ECHINIQUE, in the South, are actively plotting against the present Government, and expect to be joined by General SAN ROMAN, in which case ECHINIQUE, it is said, will declare openly against CASTILLA. The French claim against Peru was paid by CASTILLA, who sent the money ($8,000) from Guayaquil as soon as he learned that the Vice-President had refused to pay it. Affairs in Chili, with the exception of some disturbances on the Araucanian frontier, were tranquil. The revolution in New-Grenada had been brought to a close.

Moreover, as if they were determined to provide for every contingency, and harass the wretched passengers to the bitter end, the conductors frequently stop -- according to Mr. DELAVAN -- and take in persons afflicted with infectious diseases, on their way to the Hospital, and crowd them in upon the dense steaming mass of mortality which they have already caged up inside. We have no doubt that many a man who goes to his grave with a fever, bilious disorder, or lung or throat disease, owes his death to his occasional rides in bad weather in the disgusting little dens which the avenue railroads run for our accommodation; and many another has to thank the close contact with diseased persons, in the total absence of fresh air, which he incurred in the same place for a variety of complaints, if less fatal, not less disagreeable.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Street Inspector on City Cars.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Street Inspector on City Cars.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f80ecb59-4c69-5a9c-a833-273627f84422,729,nyt://article/f80ecb59-4c69-5a9c-a833-273627f84422,

In fact, we feel no doubt whatever that, even for some time after the Lemmon slave-case shall have been decided, Lord MANSFIELD's name will continue to flourish with the reputation which has so long crowned his tomb, of having been the ablest lawyer, the most upright judge, the most graceful legal writer, and the most accomplished judicial scholar who has adorned the Bench of any civilized country, since the days of the immortal D'AURESSEAU.

Mr. Wheeler was the first witness called. He testified that he had known defendant for about two years, and had business transactions with him, Williams being engaged in the milk business, and acting as his (Wheeler's) agent. About the 14th of December he drew a note for $3,000, which, he desired to get discounted at the Norwalk Bank, and inclosed it to the Cashier, requesting the favor of a discount ""if it was convenient."" The note was dated Dec. 19, payable three months from date, at the Pacific Bank, New-York, and indorsed, by Charles Johnson, to whose order it was made payable. A note was shown to witness, and identified as the one he had drawn, with the exception of the first word, ""three,"" which had been altered to ""two"" months. Getting no reply from the Bank, he called at the Pacific Bank and made inquiry concerning the note, but could get no satisfactory clue to it. He wrote several letters to the Cashier, requesting him to return the note, if it could not be discounted. Two days afterwards he met the Cashier of the Norwalk Bank, who told him his note had been discounted, and the money sent to him by Express.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/26/archives/the-pope-and-his-friends.html,,"Nine clergymen of the Roman Church in America, styling themselves in a rather sumptuous fashion, the ""Bishops of the Ecclesiastical Province of New-York, in Provincial Council assembled,"" have just issued a long and very elaborate pronounciamiento in favor of tho maintenance of the temporal rights of the Bishop of Rome, as a sovereign prince on the soil of Italy. In taking this step, these personages have but followed the example set them by their colleagues of the French and Irish Churches, and their action is avowedly intended to exert some measure of influence, more or less important, upon the minds of the rulers of Europe in the Congress which is expected shortly to assemble at Paris. It may possibly occur, not only to Protestant, but to Catholic laymen, here, as it has very distinctly occurred to Catholic laymen both in France and Ireland, that an explanation is required of this extraordinary zeal, on the part of men whose allegiance can in no just sense of that word be due to any sovereign but the States to which they are civilly subject, in behalf of the worldly position of a prince whoso claims to reverence are founded upon his pretensions to represent a Master whose ""kingdom was not of this world."" No such explanation is to be found in any part of the singularly loose, diffuse, clumsy and inaccurate paper which the nine American indorsers of the Papal throne have issued. The zeal is asserted, not explained. We are gravely informed that ""an attack on the States of the Church shall be considered as an attack upon the nine Bishops and their rights,"" but we are not informed, either gravely or quizzically, in what way the rights of nine residents of the United States, subject to our laws and entitled to our protection, are to be imperiled by any imaginable invasion of the territories acquired by the Papal Government, through precisely such a series of usurpations, conflicts, intrigues and submissions as the territories held now by any other European Crown. It is upon this point, exactly, that we need the light which these nine candlesticks of the Church decline to vouchsafe to us. For we will not do Archbishop HUGHES and his suffragans the injustice of supposing that they have been at the pains of composing this long and solemn document merely as a literary pastime. They have, no doubt, borne in mind the actual position of affairs in Rome; and they have wished to be of some practical weight in the present crisis of the Papal history. This object they can hardly expect to attain by the force of their argumentation or the terror of their titles. If they had any purpose in view beyond that of airing their style, they must have hoped to bring the popular feeling of Americans, or at least of American Catholics, to sustain them in their fulminating declaration, that when ""an attempt is made to destroy the sovereignty of the Holy Father, or diminish its extent, it is their right, as free American citizens, as well as prelates of the Church of God, to protest and resist.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pope and his Friends.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pope and his Friends.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a25284d-ae07-5c1b-9d09-0115d5e07a13,2028,nyt://article/6a25284d-ae07-5c1b-9d09-0115d5e07a13,

He then turned upon the Democratic side, and charged it with employing the threat of disunion as it did in 1856, for purely partisan purposes. Messrs. CLINGMAN and IVERSON participated in the discussion as Senator WILSON proceeded, and the conversation became extremely animated. The Senate adjourned without an Executive Session. In the House, Mr. BRISTOW, of Tennessee, uttered some patriotic remarks in behalf of the Union, and after him, Mr. KEITT controverted some of the positions assumed by Mr. CORWIN in his speeches of Monday and Tuesday. Mr. ASHMORE, of South Carolina, moved a resolution in favor of excluding the Reporters of the New-York Herald from the Gallery, on the ground that their reports were a libel and shame inflicted upon the proceedings and upon the body. The resolution was not, however, pressed. A resolution was offered by Mr. ETHEREDGE, of Tennessee, that for a fortnight the House should cease talking, and confine itself to voting. The resolution was adopted, with the important modification that three ballots at least should be had daily, leaving the remaining hours for talk.

If he means that any conspiracy in one State to run off slaves from another should be made a penal offence indictable in the Federal Courts, we entirely agree with him. If, however, he means, as his language has in some quarters been construed to imply, that the Federal forces should be placed under the control of the Executive for the suppression of any movement in anticipation of such conspiracy, then we do as entirely dissent from his doctrine. That we may do the Senator no injustice, we refer to his own language, as reported to have been used in his speech of Monday in the Senate. Mr. DOUGLAS ""then presumed there would be but little difference of opinion that it will be necessary to place the whole military power of the Government at the disposal of the President, with proper restrictions, to repress such invasion."" This would appear to be meant to confer a discretion upon the President which would be unrestrained by any judicial interpretation, and would therefore be clothing him with a power not contemplated by the Constitution, and hostile to the genius of our institutions. The Executive province is limited, as its name implies, to the execution of the laws, but should the Executive be armed with the whole power of the Government to suppress, at his own discretion, any assemblage or political organization which he might interpret to be a conspiracy against the rights or institutions of any of the States of the Confederacy, he would be made in effect a military dictator, and under the cloak of powers so conferred upon him the reserved rights of the States and the liberties of the Republic itself might easily be sacrificed. This whole doctrine of the prevention of contemplated or anticipated crime is always a dangerous thing to meddle with. We have no objection that the overt act of conspiracy should be punished to the extent of any Federal law which may be passed on the subject, but when the President is allowed to snuff conspiracy on the tainted air, and to judge of the tendency and design of any movement in one State, which he may consider to be hostile to the peace and security of another State, we shall not be far from saying farewell to all constitutional guarantees, and to all individual liberty.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Protection of the states.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Protection of the states.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32049711-fab3-5fd8-8972-bbee9f1e150a,802,nyt://article/32049711-fab3-5fd8-8972-bbee9f1e150a,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/27/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"A motion of Mr. HUNTER, in regard to the resumption of the debate on the resolution of Mr. DOUGALS, was encountered by Mr. Davis with the objection that a Committee of the Senate had been appointed to investigate the Harper's Ferry tragedy, with a view to ascertaining what legislation the occurrence appeared to exact and that the resolution of the Illinois Senator was an unfair and needless anticipation of the Committee's action. Mr. DAVIS could see no motive for the course of Mr. DOUGLAS, save hostility to the Administration; and distinctly objected to investing the Federal Executive with power to invade sovereign States, under pretence of suppressing insurrection. Mr. DOUGLAS replied by charging the Senator from Mississippi with misrepresenting his position. What he wanted was such legislation as should oblige Federal Grand Juries to find bills against the invaders; and as should authorize the President, in the event of a State calling for aid to repel invasion, to furnish it without awaiting Congressional sanction. Mr. WILSON subsequently resumed his remarks from the session of Wednesday, entering minutely into the history of Slavery aggression, and incidentally alluding to the imprisonment of colored sailors in South Carolina, and the treatment, of Mr. HOAR, the Massachusetts Commissioner. Messrs. HAMMOND and CHESNUT, the Senators from that State, explained that the imprisonment of negro seamen was purely a Police regulation, and that it had recently been modified. The expulsion of Mr. HOAR, while it was necessary, was accomplished with all possible respect and gentleness. Mr. WILSON's further remarks elicited from Mr. DAVIS an admission that the election of a Republican President of the conservative class of which Mr. FOOT, of Vermont, is a type, would not constitute a basis for Southern secession; and from Mr. FITCH, of Indiana, a declaration, that in the event of dissolution, the Northwest would go with the South, and not with the North. The Senate adjourned to Monday. The House of Representatives, agreeably to the project propounded by Mr. ETHERIDGE, of Tennessee, on Wednesday, was to have proceeded at once to balloting for Speaker, and in that practical and pleasant way to have occupied the ensuing fortnight, without further debate. Mr. HICKMAN, however, on the Republican side, protested that he was not bound by the suggestion of the Tennessee member; and from all quarters on the Democratic side, came similar protests, and refusals to abstain from talk. A ballot, thanks to Republican urgency, was at length obtained -- 226 voting, thus rendering 114 necessary to a choice. Of these Mr. SHERMAN had 109, Mr. BOCOCK 58, Mr. SMITH, of North Carolina, 37, Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana, 5, Mr. MCCLERNAND 3. The rest were scattered. While the ballot was proceeding Mr. HAMILTON, of Texas, withdrew his name from the list of candidates, using the occasion to thank the partiality of his friends, and to protest the devotion of his constituents to the Union. A point of order was raised by Mr. HICKMAN, when the result of the ballot was announced. He argued that a motion to proceed to vote was as much out of order as a motion to adopt the plurality rule, and he objected to any more useless balloting. The objection was eventually withdrawn, and two more ballots were had, the number voting being as before. The last ballot resulted as follows: Mr. SHERMAN 109, Mr. BOCOCK 51, Mr. SMITH, of North Carolina, 33, Mr. GILMER 4, Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana, 7, Mr. FLORENCE 4; the rest scattering.

BENEDICT, HALL Co.'s boot and shoe establishment, No. 21 Park-place. Deceased had been employed for nine months past, as errand-boy and to assist in stringing shoes. About 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon he was seen to go down stairs, and as he did not close the shutters in the upper part of the building, which duty also devolved on him, the porter attended to it, thinking the lad had for once been negligent and gone home. His parents, who reside at No. 100 Hudson-street, quieted the apprehensions which his absence at first excited by the supposition that he had spent the night with some friend, but when Mr. CARTER went to the store to inquire with reference to his son, he learned that he had not been seen since about 4 o'clock on the previous afternoon. A search which was immediately cemmenced resulted in finding the body of the missing lad in the upper loft of the building, suspended by a long roller-towel between two high piles of packing boxes. He had apparently ranged these packing-boxes, layer upon layer, with the ends against the wall, having removed the centre pile, thus forming a niche, in which the body was found suspended. A piece of timber resting upon the top of the other piles of cases forming the cross-piece, around which the towel was placed. The knot was skillfully tied, and the position of his legs showed that he had stood upon an empty box and dropped from it. What induced the commission of the act is a mystery, as the deceased was of an uncommonly cheerful disposition, and by his amiability and attention to business had won the favor of his employers, who had increased his salary at the beginning of the year. He remarked, in conversation with a girl who worked beside, him, a few hours before he disappeared, that he was tired of this world, and had had enough of it: still it was not suspected that his mind was deranged.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; STRANGE SUICIDE OF A BOY.

Mr. ALLEN commenced by saying: Odd Fellowship imposes upon all who seek its honors or material advantages the first great duties of a Christian life--benevolence and work. The illiberal man finds no congeniality in the lessons of the lodge-room; the drone finds there, for him, no refuge nor a home. According to the Odd Fellow's Lexicon, ""mutual dependance,"" the basis of the Order, meant something more than ministration to mere physical wants; it meant, as well, mutual encouragement, and mutual instruction in fostering among its members those attributes of character which ennoble life and make the real man. The lecturer, therefore, invited attention to the importance of ""heroism in character."" Very few in life appreciate the importance of giving thought to the regulation and improvement of their own characters. Many passed from the cradle to the grave, as if the Omnipotent at their birth had granted them a patent for perfection, and all that was required of them by human or divine laws was an unrestricted progress wherever unchastened desire should point the way. Such -- and their name is legion -- are the mere counterfeits of manhood; by irresistable demonstration they are false and unimportant in the economy of life. At all times they have the ring of a base metal, and finishing their mortal pilgrimage they drop into the grave without leaving any void behind them or diminishing in the least the life capital of the world.

Soon, however, the winds were tempered and softened to the growling passengers, and shedding their overcoats and thick clothing, Spring, then Summer, styles came in vogue with the warm air, and a seat on the deck under an awning was pleasant to those who had been shuddering with cold for four days before. When we landed here we found men, apparently in their senses, walking about the clean, white streets of this quiet town, wearing Panama hats and white linen suits, and young negroes with nothing but their wool and a moderately long shirt; -- that, too, in the middle of December. Such has been the weather, here, for the greater part of the past mouth -- the weather of a Northern July -- while you have the shivering mercury crouching below zero.

"A curious debate took place on Thursday in the Senate between Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, and Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, each interlocutor being sustained by friends, who played for each the parts of Aaron and Hur holding up the hands of Moses; on the relations which exist, and which ought to exist, between the slaveholdieg and the non-slaveholding States of the Union.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/28/archives/the-states-and-their-relations.html,,"A curious debate took place on Thursday in the Senate between Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts, and Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, each interlocutor being sustained by friends, who played for each the parts of Aaron and Hur holding up the hands of Moses; on the relations which exist, and which ought to exist, between the slaveholdieg and the non-slaveholding States of the Union. The debate was marked by a good deal of rather exasperating recrimination on both sides, and can hardly be regarded as likely to conduce of itself to a better mutual understanding between the people of the North and their brethren of the South. Mr. WILSON charged Mr. CALHOUN with insulting the moral sense of the country by declaring that we had annexed Texas for the purpose of extending Slavery, and Mr. HAMMOND, of South Carolina, abused Massachusetts for sending Mr. HOAR to Charleston to create an excitement. Discussions of this kind in the actual crisis of American history can have but one effect, and every good citizen who honestly desires the maintenance of the existing Union, with its solid guarantees of State independence and of individual liberty, must earnestly deprecate their recurrence. But the debate of Thursday was not altogether absorbed by these acrid antagonisms of sectional passion. It afforded to Mr. DAVIS an opportunity for asking, and to Mr. DOUGLAS an opportunity for answering, grave questions of the broadest national import, in relation to the resolutions introduced on Monday by the Senator from Illinois, in reference to the maintenance of order between the several States of the Union. The results of this brief conversation afford the best possible commentary upon the remarks which we yesterday felt constrained to make upon the proposition of the Northwestern leader of the Democracy. Proceeding in these remarks upon the report which lay before us of Mr. DOUGLAS' speech of Monday, we could not feel ourselves exempted from the necessity of questioning the drift of the legislation apparently suggested in that speech. For it is clear that nothing could be more dangerous to the principles of Republican Liberty than a doctrine of inter-sectional law, which should so much as imply the right of the Federal President to anticipate the movements even of seditious conspiracy in any State of the American Union. Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, evidently sharing this conviction, urged the Senator from Illinois, on Thursday, to explain whether he meant to be understood as intending to confer upon the President authority either to suppress by anticipation, conspiracies formed in one State against another, or to enter the several States with the power of the Union, and suppress conspiracies actually developed into a practical shape. Mr. DOUGLAS met these queries with a frank and decisive reply. He explained the object of his resolution to be simply the clothing of the Grand Juries of the United States Courts, with power to indict conspirators in one State against the peace of another, and of the courts of the United States with power to punish conspirators so indicted.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The States and their Relations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The States and their Relations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f8ba5bb-19a8-52aa-858e-4f80299e4fc2,1521,nyt://article/9f8ba5bb-19a8-52aa-858e-4f80299e4fc2,

"Judge BROWN, of Lewis Country, and ""half a dozen other judges,"" have, according to our correspondent at Albany, testified to their desire for an increase of salary by addressing a petition to the Legislature in favor of an amendment to the Constitution for that very purpose.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/28/archives/judges-and-justice.html,,"Judge BROWN, of Lewis Country, and ""half a dozen other judges,"" have, according to our correspondent at Albany, testified to their desire for an increase of salary by addressing a petition to the Legislature in favor of an amendment to the Constitution for that very purpose. We commend this fact, with all its incidents and consequences, to the attention of our critic, Judge HILTON, of the Common Pleas, who disapproves so strongly of our making any comment upon the doings of the Bench. We still think that any amendment relating to the Judiciary, which does not effect a radical change in the manner of its appointment, will prove worse than useless. Instead of more, we want fewer judges; and we want the salaries made so high that they shall furnish a reasonable temptation to leading lawyers to accept the office. When the Democracy took it into their head to bring justice to every man's door by filling the State with Judges, they took no precaution to make it worth having when it came. The result has been that every one is convinced that there is no justice so dear as cheap justice. We have swarms of judges, and the result is, that the honors which once clustered round the office, the general public respect and veneration for it which were the means of illustrating the forensic annals of America with such names as KENT, and STORY, and WALWORTH -- which, in short, made the Bench the prize of talent and of worth, are all gone, we can only hope not never to return. Finally, as if we wished to degrade the ermine still further, we placed the selection of the candidates in the hands of that numerous, energetic, and universally esteemed body of men, the professional politicians in caucus assembled. The only consequence of these changes which bears even the appearance of being advantageous, is the cheapness of lawsuits, and the multiplicity of the courts. But the general estimate of cheap law and numerous courts is best illustrated by the number of cases that are carried to the Court of Appeals. The truth of the matter is, that this Court has now become, to all intents and purposes, a court of original jurisdiction, and the Special and General Terms of the Supreme Courts have resolved themselves into tedious and useless forms, through which the suitor has to pass in order to reach the one respectable tribunal of last resort at Albany. Everybody has his case tried first before a single judge, and then argued on exceptions before the General Term, because the law compels him to do so; but he does not pay the least attention either to what the one judge or the four judges may say. They do not, in the least, shake his confidence in his own view of his case. Everybody, in short has the law at his elbow, but as is usual in most such cases, familiarity breeds contempt, and nobody is ever satisfied till he gets the decision of the one court which is hardest to reach and farthest away.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Judges and Justice.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Judges and Justice.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aec94220-3650-5da1-84e3-313939c35ed2,765,nyt://article/aec94220-3650-5da1-84e3-313939c35ed2,

The ""Ancient City,"" as it is termed, is literally packed with parties from almost every precinct in each county, all of whom have some favorite project on hand. Many of these are professional lobby members, who are supposed, either in their own estimation, or by others, to possess more or lees influence. Lobbying, in fact, has settled into a profession or business with this description of outsiders, of whom a large proportion are lawyers, Ex-Delegates, Ex-Senators, Ex-Governors and Ex-Members of Congress. They usually take rooms at the State Capital, to be in readiness at all times if their services should be required. Like Beau HICKMAN, in Washington, they talk up or talk down measures that parties directly interested therein have paid them for. The specific qualifications requisite to fill such an office, are unquestionable impudence, moderate intelligence, any amount of self-conceit, elasticity of conscience, want of fixed principle and a love of money rising paramount to all other considerations. These, together with liberality, when some desired point is to be gained by being liberal, a barrel or so of good whisky, a fair supply of wines, cigars, brandies, &c., furnish the ingredients and qualifications which, as a general thing, make up the lobby member's stock in trade. He is then considered a graduate and may hang out his shingle, not only at our State Capital, but within the locality of all other legislative bodies, not excepting the Federal Metropolis.

It appears that since the Lawrence calamity a certain individual in East Boston sent a letter to Mayor Lincoln, stating that the building was unsafe, and requesting the attention of the city authorities to it. Yesterday afternoon the joint committee of the City Government went to the school-house during school hours, and made a critical and thorough examination on of the entire building, from cellar to garret; and they came to the conclusion that the rumors were entirely unfounded. The children, however, seeing the examination and overhearing the remarks, got the idea that the walls were going to tumble down at once, and went home with frightful stones to their parents.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1860-01-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3d28d83-c237-58f3-b514-726dc3e47eff,1290,nyt://article/c3d28d83-c237-58f3-b514-726dc3e47eff,

The fact -- and it is a fact, which ought never to have been doubted -- is, that the number of those at the South, and particularly in the border States, who see in the Union the best, if not the only, remedy for all existing evils and grievances, is far larger than that of the noisy crowd whose patriotism expends itself in rhodomontade and tar and feathers. But it happens, as it always happens in such cases as these, that it is the brawlers and disturbers of the peace who are active and energetic in politics, and the conservatives who lie still and say nothing. No man who renders himself really very valuable as a citizen by attending to his own business, and entertains a salutary distaste for spouting, is willing to serve in the front ranks of a brawling agitation. But when an opportunity offers itself of declaring, in a sober and respectable way, their loyalty to order and law, it needs but a very small amount of demonstration on the part of those who abhor violent courses, to outweigh the tumultuous threatenings of adventurers and conspirators. The border States clearly entertain no intention of electing Gov.

We refer to the bills for the reimposition of the Canal tolls upon our Railroads; and to compel them to transport local at very nearly the same rate as through freights, and under conditions most onerous to our Railroad Companies. The first named bill is proposed as a measure of Finance, a resort of Taxation. The reasons upon which it is urged may be stated as follows: Many years since, and under conditions entirely different from those which now exist, and which could not then be foreseen, very large expenditures were made, chargeable annually upon the Canals of the State. At that time the Erie Canal was the sole carrier between the East and the West. The capacity which Railroads have since shown themselves to possess was not then understood or anticipated. The Canal had so long enjoyed an undisputed monopoly of its business that successful competition was not dreamed of. Upon no other routes was a waterline between our rival States of the Atlantic frontier and the interior practicable. It was taken for granted, consequently, that the supremacy of the Canal would remain as it then was, undisputed and undisturbed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Taxing the Great Routes of Trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Taxing the Great Routes of Trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a2870aae-27be-5da3-a84f-84e8588a43d3,1939,nyt://article/a2870aae-27be-5da3-a84f-84e8588a43d3,

There is much of interest in the news. The idea of a Congress seems to have been definitively abandoned, the policy dictated in the famous pamphlet forming the present programme of the Western Governments, viz.: that Italy be left to arrange her internal affairs absolutely without external intervention; that even the French troops now stationed at Rome be instantly recalled, and that the Papal Government be prevented from drafting recruits in foreign countries. One result of this project, according to a French journal speaking, it is understood, the views of the Emperor, will be, that the Romagna and the Duchies will at once consolidate themselves under the Crown of Sardinia; and that from the pressure of liberal institutions in such close and menacing proximity, the rigor of Austrian rule in Venetia must be permanently relaxed. The Pope is said to be profoundly alarmed and offended by the attitude assumed by the French Government, and a cessation of diplomatic relations is hinted at as not an entirely improbable event. In the meantime, the undertalk at Paris Speaks of Marshal CANROBERT as on the eve of departure to Rome, to superintend the embarkation of the French army. The funeral of the regretted MACAULAY took place on the 9th inst. The line of the procession from Holly Lodge, the residence of the late historian, to Westminster Abbey, was thronged with spectators, while the procession itself was composed of a long line of carriages, belonging to the nobility and gentry. At the Abbey, there were assembled all the more noted representatives of current English literature. The most notable fact was the marked absence of the leading Conservatives, who seemed thus to express their unconquerable aversion to their veteran assailant. The assistant pall-bearers included the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord JOHN RUSSELL, the Earl of Carlisle, the Bishop of Oxford, and other distinguished characters. The services were extremely solemn and impressive. The President's Message was received with general approval by the London press. The Times considers it minutely, and not unfavorably, so far as points of European interest are concerned. The later news we receive from India, China, and Australia, is without importance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5bf34af-da02-5d85-8023-e94902f089ca,1480,nyt://article/c5bf34af-da02-5d85-8023-e94902f089ca,

WYNKOOP HALLENBECK THOMAS, steam job-printers. A number of circumstances conspired to enable the flames to gain full headway before effective efforts could be made to check them. The floor on which the fire was first discovered, as well as the entire building, was stored with printing paper, and there were, unfortunately, no large engines in the immediate vicinity. Some time elapsed before the Manhattan steam engine and the more powerful of the hand engines, Nos 6 and 21 could reach the spot. Company No. 5, whose house is almost opposite the building destroyed, had its engine ruined at the Beekman-street fire, two or three weeks ago, and the engine of Company No. 38, which is located in Ann-street, is out of repair. Both these Companies, in consequence were, using inferior apparatus, and were virtually crippled. Assistant Engineer CREGIER stationed Company No. 8 opposite the burning building as soon as it arrived. The great heat soon compelled the firemen to retire from this position, but they immediately took another, and threw two powerful streams on the burning structure over the building No. 111 Fulton-street. By this time the steam engine was well at work, and though the flames were soon subdued, it was about two hours before they were entirely extinguished. After the majority of the firemen had left the spot, the alarm bells again rang as fire had been discovered in the building No. 46 Ann-street. It was extinguished, however, with but little difficulty. The following is a correct list of the occupants of the building destroyed, and of the losses sustained, so far as they could be ascertained. The names of the insurance companies which hold policies on the property could not be learned, as the safes of some of the parties burned out are still in the ruins, and others refused to give the information asked for.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DESTRUCTIVE FIRES.; NEWSPAPERS IN A BLAZE.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/31/archives/a-desperate-plot-frustrated-attempt-of-sanchez-and-stephens-to.html,,"Yesterday afternoon it was discovered that JAMES STEPHENS AND FELIX SANCHEZ, the one convicted of having murdered his wife and the other of having killed his father in-law, were about to attempt to escape from the City Prison by murdering the two night watchmen. The cells in which, the two felons are confined are connected by the waste-pipe, and STEPHENS, it is said, having discovered this fact, made this pipe the medium, of communication with his fellow convict. He proposed to provide SANCHEZ and himself with revolvers, and then to shoot the night watchmen, as they went their rounds to lock the cells, take from them the keys to the outer doors, and thug make their escape into the street. By some means at present unknown, but which it is not difficult to surmise, STRPHENS succeeded in procuring two heavily-loaded revolvers. One of these ha reserved for his own use, and the other was put in the possession of SANCHEZ, probably by the friend who procured the weapons for STEPHENS. Just as they had achieved what they considered the most difficult part of the plot the scheme was divulged to Mr. CHARLRS SUITOR, Warden of the Prison. Having acquainted Sheriff KELLY with the facts, the two went to STEPHENS' cell and declared their intention of searching him. The prisoner demurred, and on being told that he must submit, declared positively that he would not. Mr. SUTTON and Sheriff KELLY then seized him, are, after a desperate struggle, succeeded in overpowering him. They found in his pocket a six-barreled revolver, heavily loaded. After relieving him of the weapon, and ironing him heavily, the two went to the cell of SANCHEZ, and demanded an immediate surrender of the revolver which they had learned was in his possession. Perceiving that resistance was useless, SANCHEZ complied. He was also heavily ironed, and removed to a cell up stairs. By the opportune discovery and frustration of this plot the lives of the two night watchmen, Messrs. FINLEY and CUNNINGHAM, were undoubtedly saved, as those who are acquainted with the character of SANCHEZ and STEPHENS have no doubt but that they would have made a most desperate attempt to carry ant their design. It is stated that duly a few days ago a hole intended to communicate with the cell of SANCHEZ was discovered under the bed in STEPHENS' cell.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Desperate Plot Frustrated.; ATTEMPT OF SANCHEZ AND STEPHENS TO ESCAPE FROM THE TOMBS.

We trust that in its anxiety to convict the TIMES of being the ""organ of Senator DOUGLAS,"" our contemporary has not so far neglected the interests of its own friends as to have forfeited their confidence, but the case as it stands looks rather dark. In commenting upon the contest for the Speakership, a fortnight since, the Tribune, speaking as with authority, used the following emphatic language: ""It is all nonsense for anybody to pretend that an election would be any nearer with another candidate than Mr. SHERMAN. We trust, therefore, that our opponents and everybody else will shut up on this point. We say SHERMAN or nobody."" This declaration no doubt struck a good many worthy people, unfamiliar with the exigencies of party warfare, as slightly inconsistent with what have been commonly recognized as the feelings of a good citizen. To lay down a permanent Congressional disorganization as the alternative of the election of one particular candidate for whom no special inspiration setting him apart among his felows as the Heaven-intended Chairman of the American Representatives, had been claimed by his friends, or would have been allowed to be claimed by himself, must have seemed rather an exaggeration of party ambition, to those who look upon Congress in an old-fashioned way as a body of men sent to Washington to attend to the business of their constituents.

ALEXANDER CLEMESTS, in the Presbyterial Church in Twentyeighth street, near the Ninth avenue. The audience, whose Hiberno-Scottish nationality was betrayed as much by their enthusiasm as by their faces, completely filled the edifice. In treating of the character of ELIZADETH as a woman he described her as vain and a flirt; in reviewing her course as a monarch he awarded her the credit of having been the first to effect a thorough severance of Great Britain from any connection with or subjection to the Romish See. The act of Uniformity, passed in her reign, he regarded as not only unjust but as in direct hostility to the great principle which inspired the Reformation -- the right of freedom of thought. Protestantism, he admitted, was fragmentary, but every fragment had vitality and action. Some trees grow by slips; take a branch from such a tree and plant it, and its growth and vigor will be greater than that of the parent stem. So Protestantism, grew by slips. The great struggles of the early Protestants arose, first, he said, out of the unhappy tendency in some to make compromise, not thoroughness, their motive of action; and next, to sacrifice independence to uniformity. From these all their troubles began, but they did not retard the spread of the truth. It was, however, reason for humiliation that true Protestantism had not made more progress throughout the world, In Italy, in Hungary, in Eng-land, and in this City even the struggle was still going on. He called upon all his hearers, especially the young men, to gird on the armor of God, wielding the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God, and boldly to mingle in this conflict between truth and error.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CITY INTELLIGENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/75755a68-7eb5-56e8-9f8b-45dd1cc47f13,1188,nyt://article/75755a68-7eb5-56e8-9f8b-45dd1cc47f13,

Mr. David Roberts has a view of the front of San Marco, with a part of the shaft of the Campanile, and a glimpse of the Doge's Palace. Mr. Maclise has a figure picture ""The Loving Cup,"" a horseman starting on a journey, taking from a fair hand the parting ""God speed"" in a beaker of wine, first kissed and tasted by her rosy lips. Mr. E.M. Ward has in hand a scene in the ante-room of the palace, adjoining the State apartment in which Claude the Second is dying, with a harlot at his side and a jest in his mouth. An episode in the life of Charles Du Val, the famous highwaymen, gives Mr. Frith a capital opening for his broad, pictorial comedy. The scene is Bagshot Heath; a great family vehicle lumbers up -- the gang cut the traces, lug the old gentleman out, and bind his arms, and the dashing highwayman dances a caper with the fair spouse or daughter, while his desperadoes rifle the coach inside and out. Mr. Phillip will be represented by his diploma picture, and his royal commission of the ""Marriage of the Princess Royal."" Mr. Elmore, once more well at work, and on a subject suited to his genius -- the story of Marie Antoinette. Mr. Egg will give us a new pictorial version of the inexhaustible quarrels of Katherine and Petruchio. Mr. Faed is elaborating a great picture not yet named. Mr. Millais is working on a love scene, in the character of his ""Huguenots."" We hear a good deal of Mr. Holman Hunt's ""Christ in the Temple,"" but this picture is unlikely to be sent to the Royal Academy. Mr. O'Neal has in hand a Wreck, near a rugged coast, with the intensely-dramatic incident of a seaman volunteering to take a line on shore -- such a scene as occurred on the Royal Charter the other day. Mr. F. Good all is putting his Egyptian studies on canvas, in a picture illustrating the various Oriental life of an Arab encampment. Mr. Poole has a scene from the Last Days of Pompe[???].

"Mr. NICHOLSON, of Tennessee, held the attention of the Senate yesterday, speaking upon Mr.  BROWN'S resolution. There was little of novelty in his remarks.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/31/archives/news-of-the-day.html,,"Mr. NICHOLSON, of Tennessee, held the attention of the Senate yesterday, speaking upon Mr. BROWN'S resolution. There was little of novelty in his remarks. He regarded Mr. SEWARD as the source of Brownism and Helperism; pronounced the Republican movement an attempt of Northern capital to divert Northern labor from the vindication of its own rights : and saw no escape from the mischievous tendencies of the Republican Party. The alternative of disunion he was unwilling to contemplate, but it was the only one left, if the North persist in its aggressive designs. He was hopeful that the calamity might yet be averted. After an executive session, the Senate adjourned. The House resumed its conflict over the Speakership. Long before the hour of meeting, the Hall, the Capitol and all the avenues to them, were thronged with multitudes eager to witness the scene. It was only after an hour's struggle that room could be obtained on the floor for the transaction of busidess. Order and space were finally obtained, when Mr. SHERMAN rose, and in a short and sensible speech withdrew from the contest. Mr. PENNINGTON was then promptly put in nomination and the ballot commenced. The whole number of votes was 234 necessary to a choice 118. Of these Mr. PENNINGTON obtained 115, Mr. SMITH 112, scattering 6. A second ballot, in which, Messrs. PENNINGTON and SMITH refrained from voting, thus reducing the number necessary to a choice to 117, gave Mr. PENNINGTON 115, Mr. SMITH 113, scattering 4. With this result the House ad-adjourned. The calculations of the Republicans for to-day are founded on the supposition that Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland, and RIGGS, of New-Jersey, will come to the aid of Mr. PENNINGTON, and so elect him. The Democrats, we are told, will abandon Mr. SMITH, and by putting in nomination a Northwestern Democrat, secure Messrs. ADRAIN and RIGGS, and so prevent the choice of PENNINGTON. At the Democratic Caucus last evening, a Committee of three was appointed to present a name to the party this morning. It was thought that Mr. LARRABEE, of Wisconsin, would be the selection.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1860-01-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4b88b88-491e-59a5-aefb-550d8b2453d3,1631,nyt://article/d4b88b88-491e-59a5-aefb-550d8b2453d3,
