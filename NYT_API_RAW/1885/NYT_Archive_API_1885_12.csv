"NASHVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 30.--Information was received to-day of the death at Beasley's Bend of a young son of Ephriam Beasley from injuries accidentally inflicted by his father. The elder Beasley, who is very near sighted, was cutting wood, when his son came in front of him and was struck by the axe, which split his skull. Mr. Beasley is nearly crazed with grief.
