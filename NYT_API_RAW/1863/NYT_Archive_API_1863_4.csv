"THE WILLIAMSBURGH ABORTION CASE. -- In the Court of Sessions, yesterday, Dr. PETER W. RAY, a colored physician, was arraigned for trial on an indictment charging him with manslaughter in the second degree, in procuring an abortion on the person of MARY BURNS, a white unmarried woman, employed as a servant in a family in Williamsburgh. The deceased died in August last under circumstances which led to the suspicion that she had been improperly dealt with. Several physicians were examined as witnesses, who swore to the effect that death resulted in consequence of loss of blood, caused by premature birth, but no direct evidence was brought to show that Dr. RAY had used improper means to accomplish the object. The ante-mortem examination of the deceased having been made by Coroner MURPHY, who held the inquest, her statement was admitted in evidence, and which was to the effect that Dr. RAY had attended her during her illness, &c. The defence was a general denial. After summing up of counsel, Judge GARRISON (presiding) stated that in his opinion there was not enough evidence to convict the defendant; but being overruled by his associates, permitted the case to go to the jury. After a comparatively brief deliberation, the jury convicted the defendant of misdemeanor, in having used instruments with intent to procure miscarriage.

"-- An Irishman, named HENRY TESTOR, was taken into custody yesterday, by Capt. BROWER, of the Seventeenth Precinct Police, upon a warrant issued by Coroner NAUMANN. The accused is charged with having assaulted his wife with a deadly weapon, thereby inflicting injuries upon her head and other parts of her person, from the effects of which, it is believed, she  cannot recover. But the most aggravated part of the charge against TESTOR is, that after having inflicted these severe injuries upon his wife, and while she was lying in bed unable to move on account of these cruelties, he took a step-child of his, aged about three years, and the only other member of the family, placed it upon a red hot stove, and held it there until a large portion of its body was burned to a crisp. The cries of the little sufferer brought some of the neighbors into the apartment, and the brutal father was thereupon compelled to desist from his barbarous work. Soon afterwards, however, he sought to complete his inhuman work by applying the burnt portion of the child's body to his mouth, and, with his teeth, tearing off large quantities of the crisped and blackened flesh. He then seized the child by the legs, swung it several times around his head, all the time making loud threats that he would dash its brains out against the wall. Some persons in an adjoining apartment interfered at this stage of his proceedings, and rescued the child. The offender is a currier by occupation, aged about 23, and with his wife and child, resided at No. 111 Third-street. He is held by the Coroner, to await the result of the injuries inflicted upon the two members of his family.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/01/archives/cruelty-of-a-husband-and-father.html,,"-- An Irishman, named HENRY TESTOR, was taken into custody yesterday, by Capt.

The British Minister, with his diplomatic appreciation of motives, had no difficulty in apprehending the real spirit and intent of the party managers closeted with him. Their errand was not at all to discourage foreign intervention; they simply wanted the thing prudently managed -- or in other words, they wanted time first, to blind, cajole and circumvent the people. ""At the present moment, therefore"" says his lordship, ""the chiefs of the conservative party call loudly for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and reproach the Government with slackness, as well as with want of success in its military measures.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Duplicity of the Copperheads.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Duplicity of the Copperheads.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/055b5427-ec1a-5a9b-8d9e-669caf2f1196,1233,nyt://article/055b5427-ec1a-5a9b-8d9e-669caf2f1196

Every one had last week got hold of the notion that Vicksburgh was about to fall, and that the Yazoo expedition was certain to be successful. The Yazoo expedition has not yet proved successful, and Vicksburgh will probably remain in rebel hands for weeks to come, if not longer. But it is well to bear in mind that we have accomplished the greater part of what we seek to accomplish by taking both Vicksburgh and Port Hudson. It ought not to be forgotten, as it is too often, that the capture of these places would, after all, be but a means to an end. What we seek by assailing them is to obtain control of the 800 miles of river which stretches between them -- because with this in our possession, and with vigorous operations going on in Virginia and Tennessee, it is all but certain that the garrisons of both of them will be compelled to retire into the interior, partly through fear of being cut off, partly through want of the supplies for which they have drawn so largely upon Texas. We have got control of the river, and there is no likelihood of our again losing it; so that, in point of fact, the most important part of the operation is actually achieved. The remainder does not, in our opinion, depend on anything which can be immediately done either on the Yazoo or at Port Hudson, but on the amount of pressure which can be brought to bear on other points of the circle.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ups and Downs of Public Confidence.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ups and Downs of Public Confidence.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17e4a669-76da-5e66-96a1-8016b7c6344f,1053,nyt://article/17e4a669-76da-5e66-96a1-8016b7c6344f

The rebels chose a position at Somerset, on the north side of the Cumberland River, a few miles from Mill Spring, where they were so completely whipped in January of last year, in what may be called the first real and proper battle of this war. The-rebels under PEGRAM, on this occasion were smaller in number than they were under ZOLLICOFFER last year, but the scourging they received seems to have been about equally thorough in both cases. GILMORE attacked the rebels, who had a force double his, in their chosen position, fought them five hours, drove them from one place to another, and finally to the river, which they hastened in the night time to put between themselves and their pursuers.

He was driven from one position to another -- the last one being carried by storm, when the rebels were driven in confusion toward the Cumberland River, the fighting having lasted five hours. The rebel loss is put down at fifty killed and nearly four hundred prisoners, including twenty commissioned officers. They also lost nearly 450 cattle which they had captured, and two stands of colors. Our loss in killed, wounded and missing will not exceed thirty. The remainder of the rebel force succeeded in escaping across the Cumberland, but at last accounts were closely pursued by Gen. GILMORE and his victorious troops.

"We have advices from Europe three days later, by the arrival at Halifax of the steamship Canada. She left Liverpool on the 21st and Queenstown in the 22d ult. Intelligence of still further depredations by the Alabama reaches us by this arrival. The ship Washington, from Callao for Antwerp, had arrived at Southampton, and reported having been captured by the pirate on the 20th of February, but released on giving bonds in $50,000. She had on board the crews of three vessels which had been captured and burnt -- the Golden Eagle, the Olive Jane and the Palmetto. The rebel Cotton loan had caused considerable excitement in the English and French money markets. The bidding was expected to close on the afternoon of the 21st, much more having been offered than needed, particularly in London and Paris. In Liverpool the offers were not very heavy. The London Times says that very little political feeling was manifested in the matter, it being regarded simply as a cotton speculation. The Star and Daily News denounce the loan in most decided terms, as aiding and abetting the Slave Power. Mr. SEYMOUR FITZGERALD had given notice in the House of Commons of his intention to ask whether the British Government had accepted, or intended to accept, a proposition made by President LINCOLN as to measures to inquire into any just complaints of the violation of neutral rights. There was not much change in the aspect of Polish affairs. The debate in the French Senate was concluded on the 19th. It was decided to send all petitions to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, -- leaving the whole matter virtually in the hands of the Emperor. A popular demonstration in favor of Poland had taken place in Paris. The latest news from Poland is regarded as showing that the revolution is becoming general. With regard to the success of LANGIEWICZ, dispatches are contradictory. He is said in one to have defeated the Russians, and in another to have been himself defeated. The commander of the French forces in Cochin China is said to have made an urgent call for reinforcements, -- and Gen.

The treasure list of the Northern Light is a very light one. News had reached Aspinwall from Greytown, by the British steamer Tamar, that the Government of Nicaragua had seized all the steamers, warehouses, provisions and other property belonging to the Nicaragua Transit Company, on the ground that the Company had violated their contract, and thus forfeited it. It was understood in Aspinwall that the default in the Company was in the non-payment of five or six thousand dollars due the Government. An agent of the Company had arrived at Aspinwall to ask assistance in the matter from United States ships of war. A full statement of the circumstances attending the seizure will be found in the deposition of the agent, given in our correspondent's letter. It was considered doubtful whether the passengers coming down from San Francisco would be allowed to cross Nicaragua, in which case they would be compelled to proceed to Panama.

"-- Judge-Advocate Gen. HOLT, by a simple recital of the facts connected with a Union expedition into Northern Georgia, and the capture and subsequent sufferings of those engaged in it, has made out a tragic tale of thrilling interest. It appears that just one year ago, the late Gen. MITCHEL set on foot an expedition to destroy the communications on the Georgia State Railroad, between Atlanta and Chattanooga. It was one of those bold designs in which the mind of Gen. MITCHEL was fertile. Judge HOLT says, that ""the expedition, in the daring of its conception, had the wildness of a romance; while in the gigantic and overwhelming results which it sought, and was likely to accomplish, it was absolutely sublime."" By a circumstance that could not be known or foreseen, and the details of which are given in the report in another column, the expedition was baulked, and the two dozen men engaged in it were dispersed to the woods, where they were hunted down by bloodhounds, and all taken prisoners. Now commenced the worst barbarism of the rebels, and now, and to the end, was shown the perfect heroism of our men. One Spartan lad of eighteen, from Ohio, was tortured in a manner that would have done discredit to Spain three hundred years ago; but his fortitude under suffering was greater even than their atrocity; and after great vicissitudes, he has lived to receive honors at the hands of the President in behalf of the country. The men were thrust into a negro jail and subjected to sufferings compared with which those of the ""Black Hole"" of Calcutta were light, and a few days reduced them to the verge of death. Their leader, Mr. ANDREWS, of Kentucky, was hung at Atlanta; and seven others of them were carried to Knoxville and hung in the most revolting manner. ""They died,"" says Judge HOLT, ""as all true soldiers of the Republic should die in the presence of its foes."" The remaining prisoners, now reduced to fourteen, learning that they also were to be hung, formed a plan to escape from the jail, which they carried into execution. Six of these, after long and painful wanderings, succeeded in reaching our lines; of the fate of two of them nothing is known; and the remaining six were recaptured and taken to Richmond, where they were confined in a wretched dungeon until a few days since, when they were exchanged; and they have lived to make depositions and testify to these facts before the Judge-Advocate General in Washington. ""Thus,"" says Judge HOLT, ""at the end of eleven months, terminated their pitiless persecutions; persecutions begun and continued amid indignities and sufferings on their part, and atrocities on the part of their traitorous foes, which illustrate far more faithfully than any human language could express it, the demoniac spirit of a revolt, every throb of whose life is a crime against the very race to which we belong.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/05/archives/a-tragical-romance-of-the-war.html,,"-- Judge-Advocate Gen.

"HOOKER, ROSECRANS, GRANT, BANKS, and HUNTER -- these are the five commanders to whom the whole country has been looking with the highest hope and the greatest eagerness ever since the beginning of the year. Each of the three officers first named commands a first-class army, both as regards magnitude and efficiency. The army and navy under BANKS, and the army and navy under HUNTER, both come under the category of great, though not first-class forces. Each of the three chief armies -- that of the Potomac, that of Tennessee, and that of Mississippi -- fought a great battle in December last: Fredericksburgh, on the 13th; Vicksburgh, on the 27th, and Murfreesboro on the 31st and two following days -- the two former being repulses, and the latter one of the most valuable victories of the war. Gen. BANKS has accomplished nothing since he and his troops arrived in New-Orleans in December last; nor has Gen. HUNTER attempted or accomplished anything since he took command in South Carolina. HOOKER has spent his time and strength since Fredericksburgh, in reorganizing and disciplining his army, which was much damaged by the severe campaigns of 1862. ROSECRANS has chosen to remain on the defensive for three months, probably not feeling strong enough, under circumstances that have existed, to achieve such a decided victory as his next battle should be. GRANT has labored harder than any other General in the service since the year began. He had probably the most difficult job to do, and one that could less afford to wait than any of the others. He has kept his army actively at work, and has shown himself a man of remarkable expedients, even though fortune has decided that those expedients should not be crowned with success.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/05/archives/latest-aspects-of-the-war.html,,"HOOKER, ROSECRANS, GRANT, BANKS, and HUNTER -- these are the five commanders to whom the whole country has been looking with the highest hope and the greatest eagerness ever since the beginning of the year.

"-- Every one in England is now anxious to learn something about Miss BRADDON, the authoress of the two most successful books of the season, Lady Audley's Secret and Aurora Floyd. The reception these have met with from the public has placed her at once on the topmost pinnacle of literary popularity -- that elevated position, indeed, where a writer can make his own terms with his publisher. It is shared at present in England by Miss EVANS, Mrs. HENRY WOOD, ANTHONY TROLLOPE and WILKIE COLLINS. The new market for Fiction opened by the immense circulation of the cheap Magazines, where good serial stories are the main attraction, has vastly increased the rate of remuneration awarded to authorship. In the palmy days of MARRYAT, JAMES, BULWER, HORACE SMITH and Mrs. GORE, twenty or thirty years back, when the modern novel took nearly its existing shape, from &#65533;500 to &#65533;1,000 was thought an extreme price. Now, we are credibly informed, at least one of the abovenamed writers has received more than five times the latter sum for a single work. Such success is enough to make the recipient a legitimate object of curiosity. It is now said that Miss BRADDON was once an actress, and has written one or two dramatic pieces. She first appeared as a writer of fiction in the cheap London serial, of indifferent repute, Reynolds' Miscellany. Her first great hit, Lady Audley's Secret, was commenced in a short-lived paper, edited by Dr. CHAS. MACKAY, now correspondent of the London Times in New-York, called Robin Goodfellow, and afterward continued in the Sixpenny Magazine, a paper of equal obscurity, but attracted no notice till it was published entire in three volumes, when it at once took rank among the most brilliant and original books of the day.

The Coroner, in company with Dr. ROBINSON, accordingly visited the premises, and made an examination of the victim. Wounds and bruises were found upon her head, and various other parts of her person, and from the appearance of the [???], and such information as could be gl[???]ned from the occupants of the adjoining pre[???]ses, there was no doubt that she had been dead since the early part of the previous night. The deceased it appears was a widow, and resided alone in the rear portion of the house. She was about moving away, and had already moved the lighter portion of her furniture during Friday, in the evening, as the neighbors say, she had a quarrel with a man named YOUNG, and his wife, who resided in the same house with the deceased. The [???]a[???]er was attacked first by YOUNG's wife, who s[???]zed her by the hair, as she was passing through an alley, with some furniture in her arms, knocked her down, and afterward kicked her several times, as she lay upon the ground. The screams of Mrs. SCHAEFFER brought YOUNG, the husband of the assailant, to the spot, and he at once began to kick and beat the victim. Several of the neighbors, it is alleged, heard the screams of the injured woman, and also the noise produced by the kicks and blows; and yet, strange to saw no one went to her assistance. The only evidence there is thus far of any notice having been taken of the matter, is the fact that a man named WOLF, residing in an ad joining building, called out to YOUNG during the progress of the affray, and asked the latter what he was doing. YOUNG answered, ""If you dare come this way, I'll serve you in the same manner."" WOLF therefore thought it prudent not to venture from his room. After her assailants left her, it is supposed that Mrs. SCRAEFFER managed in some way to crawl back to her apartments in the building. Yesterday morning, when the cartman, whom the deceased had engaged to remove her heavy pieces of furniture, entered her room, he found her body lying as though she had fallen over a chair in her efforts to reach a seat. The appearance of the body indicated that death had taken place several hours previously. The police were immediately notified, and yesterday afternoon they succeeded in taking CATHARINE YOUNG, the wife, into custody.

"News which we have from the Southwest this morning points to the possibility of the abandonment of the Mississippi by the rebels. Telegrams are said to have been received from Gen. HURLBUT at Memphis, Gen. ASBOTH at COLUMBUS, and Gen. DODGE at Corinth, reporting that there is a heavy force of rebel cavalry on the Tennessee River in the vicinity of Florence, and that the rebels are constructing bridges and floats for crossing the Tennessee in that neighborhood -indicating either a movement of BRAGG in that direction, or a movement of the Vicksburgh Army to join BRAGG. Meantime, Gen. GRANT appears to have given up the idea of capturing Vicksburgh by engineering strategy, and to have commenced preparations for its reaction in the regular way.

"A correspondent of a Lemberg journal, who has visited LANGIEWICZ in his camp, writes as follows: ""At the entrance of the General's residence stand two powerful sithemen, with their weapons crossed. These form the body-guard of the insurgent General. On the left is a chamber of moderate dimensions, in the centre of which is a table of a long and oval shape, and around this sit and stand many men, who carry on so lively a discussion that one scarcely understands its purport. Some of these are strong and wiry, others are in the bloom of youth; but among those present there are weather beaten men, with gray beards and locks. At the end of the table, somewhat sidewards, sits Gen. LANGIEWICZ, engaged in writing. The noise does not disturb him.

He writes, and at the same time answers many questions, and also distributes various orders to his officers, who continually come and go. His answers were short and decided, as were his orders. At last he raised his head a little, and I could observe him more narrowly. Persons entirely disinterested would declare his appearance to be quite an ordinary one, but be pleased me on the instant.

"The Secretary of War has done an excellent thing in subjecting the lately released survivors of the expedition, dispatched last year by Gen.

The Northern mind, we say, has long since learned to expect such things, from what it knows to be the utter depravity of the rebel character. But the European people do not know it.

"The matinee on Saturday brought Mr. MARETZEK's fourth week to a brilliant termination, and, we are surprised to hear, without any loss to the management. Mr. MARETZEK has suffered from a multitude of evils that are hardly likely to occur again. His singers have been sick, the weather has been bad, and on one occasion he was compelled from these combined causes to close the house. The religious austerities of the season have also probably had some influence on the attendance, although it must be confessed that the irreligious, who have no austerities, turned out in great force whenever the opera was attractive. The present week will probably be marked by moderation in the weather, and ""perfect looseness"" in the morals of the community. Unfortunately it is the last of Mr. MARETZEK's present campaign -- that otherwise sensible impresario being possessed with the amiable mania of visiting Boston. Why do people visit Boston, when Boston so frequently visits New-York, and stays on the slightest provocation? GRAU has been to Boston, and has acquired a deep bass voice in consequence.

The treasure list of the Northern Light is a very light one. News had reached Aspinwall from Greytown, by the British steamer Tamar, that the Government of Nicaragua had seized all the steamers, warehouses, provisions and other property belonging to the Nicaragua Transit Company, on the ground that the Company had violated their contract, and thus forfeited it. It was understood in Aspinwall that the default in the Company was in the non-payment of five or six thousand dollars due the Government. An agent of the Company had arrived at Aspinwall to ask assistance in the matter from United States ships of war. A full statement of the circumstances attending the seizure will be found in the deposition of the agent, given in our correspondent's letter. It was considered doubtful whether the passengers coming down from San Francisco would be allowed to cross Nicaragua, in which case they would be compelled to proceed to Panama. There was no later news from Bogota. All intercourse had ceased between New-Granada and Ecuador, in consequence of the unfriendly action of the latter against MOSQUERA. There were some apprehensions of a war. News from Guatemala and Salvador is to the 12th ult. President CARRERA, of Guatemala, had reached his capital after his defeat and retreat, with some 3,000 men, leaving 1,500 men as a corps of observation near the frontier. He lost in the battle of the 24th of February at least 600 men. It was thought that a settlement would be made between the two Governments. Nicaragua had suspended friendly relations with Salvador.

It was the first election in which the animal gave fight in its own veritable shape. Here in New-York, and all through the West, the peace policy, as a distinct issue, was carefully avoided. The whole canvass was conducted under other semblances, -- such as questions of sustaining the suspension of habeas corpus, of upholding the President's Proclamation, of approving the management of the war -- all of which were calculated to deceive and distract the people. Successes thus treacherously gained were really of no account as a test of the real spirit of the people touching the vital point of abandoning the war. But the peace-plotters insisted that it was the peace policy itself which the people had sustained, and grew so bold as to resolve to make that the plain out-and-out issue in the Spring elections. But in New-Hampshire and Rhode Island the leaders, after casting about a little, found it would hardly answer. So far as they well could, throughout the canvass, they kept the peace question in the background. They were beaten, but, not having fully shown themselves, pretended the blow was not really aimed at them. In Connecticut, on the other hand, they came squarely into public view at the very start, and fought unflinchingly to the end. There have been few, if any, political canvasses of late years in which the issues between the contending parties were more veraciously set forth. There can be no caviling about the result.

"An important discovery was made, yesterday, by the Police of the Eighteenth Precinct. About $3,000 of counterfeit money, consisting of bills and coin, was found secreted in a bale of hay in the feed-store of WM. HAUGHEY, NO. 125 East Twenty-first-street, near Third-avenue. Officer SUTTON, with three others, made a thorough search of the premise, and in addition to spurious money, they found a very finely engraved plate, intended for the alteration of bank notes; also, a crucible containing some spelter, a quantity of acids, such as are used in obliterating figures and letters, and several bottles of bank-note printing ink. The officers found no one in charge of the feed-store except THOMASS HAUGHEY, a son of the proprtetor. He protessed entire ignorance upon the subject of the counterfeits, but it was thought best to secure him, and then await the arrival of the rather, whom the son said would be in shortly. The elder HAUGHEY soon made his appearance upon a load of hay, which he had been out to procure. Upon seeing the officers on the sidewalk, he suddenly stopped his wagon and jumped off the opposite side. As soon as he struck the ground he was seen to draw a well-filled wallet from his pocket, and attempt to thrust it into a bale of hay. The officers were too quick for him, however, and they at once took both him and the wallet into their custody. An examination of the latter was made, and about $60 in bi[???]ls were found; one-half of which, at least, were counterfeit. He was taken to the Station-house and confined to await an examination. He denied all knowledge of the spurious money found on his premises. He is, however, well-known to the Police, who allege that he has recently come from Sing Sing, whither he was sent for two years for counterfeiting.

"Charleston is situated on a low, level point of land, at the junction of Cooper and Ashley Rivers. No portion of the city is more than twenty feet above the tide, so that upon approaching it from the harbor its buildings and the beautiful spires of its churches seem to rise directly from the water. The Cooper River joins the Ashley at a right angle from the North, and the continuation of the latter river, running nearly due east, forms the lower hadbor and bay of Charleston, which widens gradually from 2 to 5 miles to its mouth, distant about 10 miles from the city. On the opposite side of the Cooper River, where it debouches into the harbor, a short mile from the City, is Castle Pinkney, a small work, but mounting some heavy guns. Nearly opposite, on the southern side of the harbor, on James' Island, about two miles distant, is Fort Johnson. About four miles from the city, midway between Sullivan's and James' Islands, is Fort Sumter, and directly northward of it, on Sullivan's Island, at a distance of two thousand Yards, is Fort Moultrie. Between these two forts is the only channel for vessels to approach the city. Fort Sumter has three tiers of guns, and under the old Government, ranked as a fortification of the second class, in the extent of the works and the strength of its armament, but it was constructed in a very superior manner, and was supposed to be invulnerable at the time to the effects of any naval ordnance then in use.

"Henry B. Herts, Jr., vs. Henry Wood. -- This was an application for an injunction and receiver made by the plaintiff in an action for a dissolution of the firm of Henry Wood & Co., auctioneers, at No. 450 Broadway. It was shown by the articles of copartnership, and by the papers used upon the motion, that soon alter the election of James Lynch, the present Sheriff of this City, he selected the defendant, a brother of Fernando Wood, as his auctioneer; and that, in the month of December, 1861, the parties to the action formed a copartnership by an agreement in uniting for the period of three years, from the 1st day of January, 1862, that being the official term of the Sheriff elect. The plaintiff, as appeared, was a practical and professional auctioneer, and the defendant was not. The plaintiff, as alleged, for a half interest in the business to accrue from Sheriffs sales, paid the defendant the sum of $8,000, and covenanted that the defendant's share of the profits should not be less than $5,000 per year during he three years. The firm of Henry Wood & Co. continued business, as auctioneers to the Sheriff, until about the 1st day or March, 1863, when the Sheriff withheld his patronage and selected other auctioneers. The plaintiff, finding that the business for which he had bargained had been taken from him, desired a return of his money which the defendant had received, alleging that the defendant had been selected to act as auctioneer for one year only. The defendant denied this and claimed that he had been selected by the Sheriff for the full term, and that so far he had acted in good faith toward his partner, and offered to refer it to arbitrators to adjust their differences. The plaintiff declined to enter into an arrangement to arbitrate, but brought this action. It was shown that the practice of the Sheriff had been to take goods seized upon execution to the auction-room, and that they are sold by the auctioneer, who deducted his commissions and other charges from the proceeds, turning the residue over to the Sheriff, who then deducted his fees, as fixed by law, applying the balance upon the execution.

"DREADFUL ACCIDENT IN A CISTERN -- TWO MEN SUFFOCATED AND TWO OTHERS NEARLY KILLED. -- A terrible accident occurred at the rear of No. 96 Oarll-street, Brooklyn, about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, involving the almost instant death of two men and the serious and perhaps fatal injury of two others. It appears that a laborer named JOHN MCGINNESS was employed to clean out a cesspool on the above premises, and in descending, in order to examine the condition of affairs, was struck senseless by the foul air, and fell to the bottom. The fact was soon made known to the neighbors, and several came to aid the man. JOHN DONNELL, who was the first on the spot, went down for the perpose of rescuing MCGINNESS, but he had descended only a few feet when he, too, was rendered senseless by the foul vapor, and sunk into the filthy mass beneath. Mr. JOHN HEAREY, engaged in cleaning the street at the time, next came to the aid of the unfortunate men, and he too, met with a similar fate. Mr. SAMUEL SLOCUM, anxious to aid his fellow-men, likewise descended, and, like the rest, sunk to the bottom. A neighbor, named KENNY, having the sad fate of the others for his guidance, procured a rope, and with the aid of a number who by this time crowded the yard, succeeded in bringing up Messrs. HEAREY and SLOCUM. The latter soon revived, and was taken to his home near by; but HEAREY, who appeared to be in a dying condition, was conveyed to the City Hospital. The dead bodies of MCGINNESS and DONNELL were subsequently hauled out. The family of the latter, consisting of wife and four children, reside at No. 94 Carroll-street, and that of the former at No. 192 Hudson-avenue. The cistern, it appears, was not only in a very filthy condition, but to add to the nastiness, the wall of an adjoining privy had broken through, making matters much worse. An inquest was held upon the bodies of deceased by Coroner HEGEMAN, and a verdict was rendered that they came to their death by suffocation.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/11/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"DREADFUL ACCIDENT IN A CISTERN -- TWO MEN SUFFOCATED AND TWO OTHERS NEARLY KILLED. -- A terrible accident occurred at the rear of No. 96 Oarll-street, Brooklyn, about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, involving the almost instant death of two men and the serious and perhaps fatal injury of two others.

"-- We stated yesterday morning that we now controlled the whole length of the Mississippi River, so far as its navigation by the rebels was concerned. An evening journal objects to this, so far as relates to the space of 200 miles between Vicksburgh and Port Hudson. It says that we have only three vessels there, and that these can do very little to prevent the rebels from crossing with bodies of soldiers, supplies of cattle, mails, etc. We do not think, as we expressly stated, that our fleet will be able to cut off entirely the mail communication between the east and west banks of the river; but still we control it pretty effectually so far as all other intercourse is concerned. The rebels would need steamers and transports to bring across bodies of troops and supplies of cattle, and they have none at liberty in that part of the Mississippi referred to. Beside, the only navigable stream entering the Mississippi between Port Hudson and Vicksburgh, by which supplies could be brought down from Texas, is Red River, and we have news this morning that FARRAGUT's fleet of two vessels and ELLET's ram have again swept down to that region, and have doubtless cleared the river of any craft that may have tried to creep out from any hiding-place, as the fleet cleared it a few weeks ago, on going up.

The lady, so far, has been seen under circumstances that were, from their suddenness -- if from no other came -- unfavorable to the ease of the artist. Placed suddenly in a character that had been impersonated by Miss KEENE, and which even that remarkable artist could not make powerful, it is certainly high praise to say that Miss EYTINGE infused into it a quiet, graceful and earnest interest that gave abundant evidence of her delicate and unusual powers. The lady's freedom from affectation of speech and exaggeration of action, without detracting from the force that is required, are so marked that we are sure in a higher range of play, where jigs and brogues are alike unknown, she will win and merit a career before a metropolitan audience. It is a fortunate thing that her debut, although hurried, was made under the auspices of Miss LAURA KEENE, who will, as an artist of the undemonstrative school herself, appreciate Miss EYTINGE's ability, and give to her, we hope, the proper opportunities for displaying it.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/11/archives/laura-keenes-theatre.html,,"-- The performances at this establishment to-night are for the benefit of Mr. THOMAS BAKER, the popular and able conductor of the orchestra, and a musician who succeeds more than any other in providing the precise kind of orchestral extracts that the public requires and relishes.

Moreover, on this occasion Miss ROSE EYTINGE, whose success on Wednesday last in Miss KEENE's role of Nellie O'Donohus was so marked, will make her last appearance in that character. The lady, so far, has been seen under circumstances that were, from their suddenness -- if from no other came -- unfavorable to the ease of the artist. Placed suddenly in a character that had been impersonated by Miss KEENE, and which even that remarkable artist could not make powerful, it is certainly high praise to say that Miss EYTINGE infused into it a quiet, graceful and earnest interest that gave abundant evidence of her delicate and unusual powers. The lady's freedom from affectation of speech and exaggeration of action, without detracting from the force that is required, are so marked that we are sure in a higher range of play, where jigs and brogues are alike unknown, she will win and merit a career before a metropolitan audience. It is a fortunate thing that her debut, although hurried, was made under the auspices of Miss LAURA KEENE, who will, as an artist of the undemonstrative school herself, appreciate Miss EYTINGE's ability, and give to her, we hope, the proper opportunities for displaying it.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LAURA KEENE'S THEATRE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""LAURA KEENE'S THEATRE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb359f35-081c-59e7-a7d9-a31d4dcf95b2,282,nyt://article/eb359f35-081c-59e7-a7d9-a31d4dcf95b2

"In the House of Commons, on March 27, Mr. W.E. FORSTER rose to ask the noble Vicount whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government had been called to the danger to our friendly relations with the United States, resulting from the fitting out in our ports of ships of war for the service of the self-styled Confederate States, in contravention of the Foreign Enlistment act and of the policy of neutrality adopted by this country. Some persons, he said, most of whom were British subjects, were, in defiance of the Queen's proclamation and the statutes of the realm, breaking the law, and were engaged in acts which placed the country in danger of being involved in war. That was so notorious a fact that papers had been presented with regard to one of the most flagrant cases -- the fitting out of the Alabama. The first question for consideration was, whether the Government had done all that they could to prevent these breaches of the law; and the second was, whether they were impressed with the necessity of doing their utmost to prevent them for the future. So great was the danger, that he thought the House ought not to separate for the holidays without obtaining from the Government an answer upon on this point, more especially as to the future.

FORSTER rose to ask the noble Vicount whether the attention of Her Majesty's Government had been called to the danger to our friendly relations with the United States, resulting from the fitting out in our ports of ships of war for the service of the self-styled Confederate States, in contravention of the Foreign Enlistment act and of the policy of neutrality adopted by this country. Some persons, he said, most of whom were British subjects, were, in defiance of the Queen's proclamation and the statutes of the realm, breaking the law, and were engaged in acts which placed the country in danger of being involved in war. That was so notorious a fact that papers had been presented with regard to one of the most flagrant cases -- the fitting out of the Alabama. The first question for consideration was, whether the Government had done all that they could to prevent these breaches of the law; and the second was, whether they were impressed with the necessity of doing their utmost to prevent them for the future. So great was the danger, that he thought the House ought not to separate for the holidays without obtaining from the Government an answer upon on this point, more especially as to the future. With regard to the past, it would be more convenient if the discussion could be postponed, as additional light would be thrown upon it by the papers which had been asked for.

"Several weeks ago we called attention to the fact that the rebel blockade runners might be enabled to make their exchanges in our Northern cities by means of North Carolina bonds. But we did not at that time expect to have either so prompt or so perfect a demonstration of the correctness of our views as that presented by the arrest of CRAWFORD, in this city, on Wednesday last.

"An Englishman, named JOHN WILSON, was brought before Justice OSBORNE yesterday, at the Essex Market Police Court, charged with having broken into and robbed the house of MAX S. MEYER, No. 3 Ridge-st., of money and goods amounting to about $2,000. Among the stolen property there was gold coin in $10 and $5 pieces to the amount of $1,100, and Treasury Notes to the extent of $300. The balance of the plunder consisted of silver coin, silk dresses, coats, pants and other articles of wearing apparel. Officer GASTLIN, of the Thirteenth Precinct, discovered the prisoner as he was leaving the premises with a large bundle under his arm, and believing him to be a suspicious character, he followed him a short distance, and finally took him into custody. All the stolen property was recovered from the possession of the accused, with the exception of the money. It is presumed that WILSON had ingeniously passed the latter to an accomplice immediately after the robbery was consummated. In WILSON's possession were found a set of skeleton keys, a jimmy, and other instruments usually carried by burglars. The accused, when taken before the magistrate, stated that he was an English sailor, just arrived on a packet ship from London.

Such was the fight before Charleston -- a mere contest of strength between ordnance afloat and on shore -- and furnishing results valuable to science, but wholly inconclusive of the issue between loyalty and rebellion.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REAL ASPECTS OF THE CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/66280255-4fb0-5800-aa79-21c7e4fca79d,293,nyt://article/66280255-4fb0-5800-aa79-21c7e4fca79d

In the annals of naval warfare, no instance can be found of a serious attack upon a place a hundredth part so formidable. Considering the tremendous calibre and scientific construction of the guns, and the fact that three hundred of them simultaneously belched their concentric fire upon the little fleet at the distance of only a few hundred yards, and considering, too, the infernal agents of destruction that lay beneath the water, as well as the curbs and the snares and the traps, all former attempts of the kind now seem but mere child's play.

If ever impresario deserved well at the hands of the music-loving public it is be. Setting aside his indefatigable, indomitable efforts in by-gone seasons, he has within the past few weeks done enough to entitle him to the most generous measure of commendation and support. He has given us a series of lyric entertainments which, in point of genuine merit, have been far superior to anything of the kind offered to long-suffering New-York audiences for years. Without preliminary puff or subsequent ostentation, he has produced two new operas, and given a variety of old ones, with a perfection of ensemble to which we have long been unaccustomed, and his company, while not comprising any artists of overwhelming European celebrity who have outsung the freshness of their voices, has been one of the best for all practical purposes that has ever appeared at the Academy. For all this the public should prove, if not grateful, at least appreciative. What pleasure the fickle monster has received is owing to the enterprise and energy of MAX himself. The obligation is one that should be recognized and repaid, and the most effectual way of doing this will be by leaving no foot of space unoccupied in the Academy to-night. As additional inducements for every opera-goer to be there it should be stated that an opera, almost as good as new here, will be brought out in splendid style and that Madame MEDORI will make her last appearance in it. MEDORI is a great artist, whose wonderful voice and method are a revelation to all who have not enjoyed them. The opera is Verdi's ""I Due Foscari,"" which has not been given in New-York since its production at Castle Garden in 1850.

"The Cincinnati Price Current, of the 15th inst., publishes its annual statement of the Pork-packing trade of the West. The editor says: ""The result is wonderful. The number of hogs packed the present season is over four million head, being an increase over the packing of the season of 1861-2 of over a million and a quarter, namely: 1,357,787, being an increase of 40 1-10th cent. The decrease in weight is 7 1/2 percent., leaving a net increase of over 32 3-5th cent. as compared with last year. The yield of leaf lard is five pounds per hog less than it was in 1861-2, but owing to the great increase in the number of hops slaughtered, there is an absolute increase in quantity of 27 1/2 cent. over last season. In these comparisons we do not include the Tennessee packing last season. It will be seen that the great increase was in that section of the West tributary to Chicago, but of all that section, in no place was that increase so marked as in Iowa, and our correspondents in that State, say that fully one-half the hogs packed in Chicago, were shipped from thence, and explain the enormous increase in this way. The corn crop in that State, the past two years, was an unusually good one; but owing to the blockade of the Mississippi, the usual channel of outlet to a market, and the low price, the article did not admit of transportation to the East, it was therefore as a matter of necessity fed to hogs, to an extent unusual, and which would not have been the case had a market been accesible. This applies not only to Iowa, but to that portion of Illinois bordering, upon the Upper Mississippi. Owing to the great speculation in and high rate of gold, remunerative prices were obtained, and which proved of as much advantage to the feeders, as if the currency was down to a specie basis. The rise in gold affected none but those who use foreign goods, and of these the agricultural classes use but little. It will be seen that there is a large increase in all the States but Kentucky, and in that State there is a decrease, but this is not wonderful, and the surprise is that the packing along the Ohio was as large as it has been, owing to the disturbed state of affairs and the repeated menaces of the rebels along the border.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/17/archives/the-porkpacking-trade-of-the-west.html,,"The Cincinnati Price Current, of the 15th inst., publishes its annual statement of the Pork-packing trade of the West.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/17/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- MAX MARETZEK's benefit on Wednesday evening, was an immense triumph fof the man and the manager. The Academy was crowded in every available part with an audience brilliant as beauty and Spring fashions could make it and the musical and other performances incident to the occasion went off with an eclat that has rarely been surpassed in the history of Italian opera in New-York. ""I duo Foscari"" is not one of VERDI's most felicitous efforts. It abounds in the instrumental noise and vocal difficulties for which most of his works are celebrated, without, like his later compositions, including a sufficiently redeeming quantity of passionate melody to make it popular. Still there are in it two or three very fine episodes, such for instance as the duet between the soprano and tenor in the second act -- sung with splendid dramatic effect by MEDORI and MAZZOLENI -- and the Doge's solo, exceedingly well rendered by BELLINI. But, whatever the opera, the house would have been full and the audience enthusiastic, to MAX had deserved well of the public and the public felt constrained to acknowledge the obligation. The singers coincided with the public, and had made preparations to testify their friendly appreciation of the professional capacity any personal good qualities of their director. These preparations they developed into action at the close of the second act, when the ""indomitable,"" being thrust forward by kindly hands. Signor COLLETTI made him the neatest of little speeches simultaneously presenting him, on behalf of the company, with a silver tea service. MAX responded in eloquent dumb show, and received several avalanche, of overwhelming plaudits. Take it altogether, the affair was a highly flattering tribute of admiration and good will. It was a bright spot in MAX's lifetime that he can always look back upon with unalloyed pride and gratification. This evening Madame MEDOR makes her final appearance in Norma. MAZZOLENI will be the Pollio, and BIACCHI the Oroveso.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/babbd031-4007-5aa4-a6a7-b2b12de57d2d,504,nyt://article/babbd031-4007-5aa4-a6a7-b2b12de57d2d

The rebels will now doubtless suppose that they can release the greater part of these troops for work elsewhere. If they imagine that HOOKER is going to attack them in Virginia, they will run the troops along the two railroad lines that connect Charleston with Richmond, and thus, in less than a week, they can add thirty or forty thousand to the strength of LEE's army. Or, if they think by massing an additional twenty or thirty thousand in front of ROSECRANS, beside those that have lately been gathering there, that they can greatly outnumber and overwhelm the army of that gallant soldier, they can send them along the Charleston and Augusta, or Charleston, Savannah and Atlanta roads, and in ten days they might all be at Tullahoma. If they think they can overwhelm our forces at Newbern, simultaneous with the attempt to overwhelm them at Little Washington, they could dispatch their spare men there from Charleston in double-quick time. It is not likely they will make any attempt upon our lines at Port Royal, as that post, since Wednesday last, has been protected by a Monitor, and has probably now two or three, beside other vessels and its fortifications.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Palpable Strategy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Palpable Strategy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be12de72-54e1-5921-a127-e9bfcc5dcf07,417,nyt://article/be12de72-54e1-5921-a127-e9bfcc5dcf07

Only three or four of the whole batch of conspirators who stampeded from Washington during the two or three months which preceded the inauguration of Mr. LINCOLN, have ever been heard of since. DAVIS, who was elected President before the events of the war had brought other names into prominence, still keeps his head above water, while BENJAMIN, who became Secretary of State, and who is a dextrous man of affairs, is also still occasionally heard from through his intercepted correspondence. But, with these exceptions, we hardly recall a man of the old Southern political regime who is now prominent.

"-- In the Prize Court, yesterday, an interesting question of international law was raised. It grow out of the capture of the brig Josephine, near the mouth of the Mississippi, soon after the taking of New-Orleans. It is alleged that that cargo, consisting of cotton, belonged to a native of France, not at the time a resident of the United State, and that he was not in any respect aiding or assisting those in rebellion against the United States; further, that after the rebellion broke out, and the port of New-Orleans was blockaded, the vessel could not leave; and that, when the United States gunboats were making their way up to the city, the vessel was ordered up some distance above New-Orleans by the authorities there. Supposing that the port would be open when the United States forces took possession of New-Orleans, the Josephine watched an opportunity, and passed through one of the bayous to the mouth of the Mississippi, to await an opportunity to sail. There she was captured, and was sent to this port in charge of a prizemaster. It is now claimed that the vessel and cargo were not liable to seizure and confiscation. The matter was argued by F.C.

"Mr. CARL ANSCHUTZ, with an energy only surpassed by the gravity of the undertaking, has attempted a second season of German opera in the City of Churches. The works given were BEETHOVEN's grand ""Fidelio,"" FLOTOW's charming ""Martha,"" and ""Der Freischutz."" The casts included the well-known names of Mme. JOHANNSEN and Mme. VON BERKEL, and Messrs. QUINT, WEINLICH, GRAEFF and HART, with an efficient and well-trained orchestra, and a chorus composed of excellent singers, members of the Liederkranz and other musical organizations, the whole being under the able conduction of Mr. AHSCHUTZ, and the low price of fifty cents charged for admission. The ""Fidelio"" had a good-sized corporal's guard, the ""Martha"" not so many, and ""Der Freischutz,"" probably on account of the red devils, the blue goblins and the fireworks, a somewhat better house than either of its predecessors.

A year ago last February, the Florida was launched, pierced for six guns and provided with magazines, was manned with a crew of Englishmen with hardly an exception, took on board a cargo of one hundred and seventy-three tons of arms, and notwithstanding the perfect notoriety that she was to engage in privateering business, she was allowed to sail without the slightest hindrance; and all the answer the remonstrances of Mr. ADAMS could elicit from Earl RUSSELL was ""a polite expression of regret."" Four months afterward the Alabama was in like manner launched; her whole manner of construction and peculiar adaptation to war purposes, as well as the notorious fact that the whole direction of her building and outfit, and shipping of the crew, were in the hands of the agents of the rebel Government, showed conclusively that she was intended to prey upon the commerce of the United States; the remonstrances of Mr. ADAMS in this case only led in about a month to a shain attempt to stop her, when it was too late. Now, after an interval of eight months, the little propeller Alexandra, with no gunports at all, or any of the visible appurtenances of a man-of-war, presenting simply the appearance of a schooner-rigged steam-yacht, is no sooner launched than she is seized by order from the Foreign Office. No men had been shipped for her, no arms had been taken on board, and not even her engines had been set. So far as we can judge, the evidence against her was not a fiftieth part so palpable as that in either of the other two cases, and yet Earl RUSSELL hurries his officials, post haste, to put the ""broad arrow"" on her mast.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Change for the Better in English Policy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Change for the Better in English Policy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-04-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0778cd8a-5cb2-58c1-8849-99602a4ec5d0,960,nyt://article/0778cd8a-5cb2-58c1-8849-99602a4ec5d0

"William Birdsall vs. Salem T. Russell. -- This action was brought to recover two bonds, of $1,000 each, alleged to have been stolen. On Friday, the 2d day of November, 1860, the plaintiff, as alleged, sent a tin box to the Fulton Bank, and left it in care of the parties at the bank counter. On Monday, the 5th of November, the box could not be found at the bank, and was never heard of afterward. The box contained five bonds of the Cleveland, Norwalk and Toledo Railroad, payable to bearer, two of which are the subject of this suit. The plaintiff immediately, as alleged, advertised the loss in various newspapers in this City and other places, and distributed handbills among the brokers of the City, notifying them of such loss. He also notified the agent who paid the coupons, directing him not to pay those belonging to the missing bonds. After the payment of the next coupons in February, 1861, it was discovered that although none had been received of the numbers stolen, yet there had been paid five duplicate coupons of other numbers. The supposed stolen bonds, were then found in possession of the defendant, with an alleged change of the numbers, which were written in red ink. A newspaper containing the notice of the lose was found to have been taken by the broker who bought them. This cause had once been submitted to a jury, which disagreed.

"The theatrical world and the play-going public generally were startled by the announcement in yesterday's papers of the death of Mr. BLAKE, the comedian. Last week, on Thursday, he took his farewell benefit at Laura Keene's Theatre, announcing that it was not to be final farewell, but only a temporary good-bye, till his return from a series of representations with a traveling company. The company to which he referred opened in Boston on Monday, and Mr. BLAKE on Tuesday played the part of Sir Peter Teazle, in ""The School for Scandal."" On Wednesday he was seized with an attack "" of bilious colic, which shortly resulted in his denth. Mr. BLAKE was not far from 58 years of age. He was born in Halifax. N.S. His first appearance in New-York was made at the old Chatham Theatre in 1824; he was afterward stage-manager of the Tremont Theatre in Boston, of the Walnut-street Theatre in Philadelphia, and of the Broadway Theatre in this City. For a long time he was connected with Mr. WALLACK's Theatre, but at the time of leaving New-York he was a member of the Laura Keene Company. In early life Mr. BLAKE was what is techically called a ""light"" comedian. In person, he was then finely formed and his face was singularly handsome. He is said to have excelled in such parts as Hurry Dornton in ""The Road to Ruin,"" and Captain Absolute in ""The Rivals."" He became extremely corpulent, however, as he increased in years, and wisely changing his line of business while yet in the full enjoying of his best powers, he gained a reputation as an exponent of ""serious and comic old men,"" which has never been surpassed upon any stage where the English language is spoken. He was the most spontaneous and natural that the present generation has ever seen, and his pathos was singularly dignified and tree from effort. It may truly be said, without derogating from the undoubted abilities of several living actors, that it will be impossible to fill the void his death has caused. There is no performer of matured powers, or in process of development, who, in a wide range of characters, can be expected to approach him in originality and finished excellence.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/24/archives/death-of-willam-r-blake-the-comedian.html,,"The theatrical world and the play-going public generally were startled by the announcement in yesterday's papers of the death of Mr. BLAKE, the comedian.

Some hours afterward HOWARD was missed, also the key of the safe. An examination of the latter was made, when it was found to be carefully locked. The proprietors were notified of these circumstances, but they having full confidence in HOWARD's honesty, attributed his disappearance to some legitimate but unexplained cause. Late in the afternoon two boys called at the hotel and delivered the key of the safe, and also a note signed by HOWARD, and dated in Brooklyn. The note stated that the writer had been suddenly called away on account of the illness of a relative, but he would return that evening.

The first large army which was raised after the fall of Fort Sumter went to the seat of war en masse, in the belief then prevalent that the rebellion could be crushed by one great blow. The possibility that another army still might be required before the struggle was over, or even that the one then going to the field would ever need reinforcements, did not occur to anybody. So we went through the first campaign expending men with a sort of oriental extravagance. There was nothing of which we were not more careful than of soldiers. State rights, Governors' prerogatives, the election of officers, every popular crotchet, or delusion, or doctrine, or tradition, had hecatombs of privates offered up at its shrine. Every battle saw thousands disappear from the ranks, every march its hundreds, by bullet, by desertion, and by disease.

"Speaking with the diffidence becoming a non-professional critic on military affairs, we are disposed to regard this work as one of the most important on the science of war, considered with reference to our situation, and present and future condition, that the existing rebellion has called forth.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/04/25/archives/literature-of-april-african-hunting-from-natal-to-the-zambesi.html,,"Speaking with the diffidence becoming a non-professional critic on military affairs, we are disposed to regard this work as one of the most important on the science of war, considered with reference to our situation, and present and future condition, that the existing rebellion has called forth. The object of the writer is to examine the operations of the last two years by the great principles of war, ""which cannot be violated with impunity,"" and to test, by a military examination of those campaigns, how far and in what manner they confirm those maxims which, like similar truths or morals, too often receive rather a general mental assent, than implicit submission to their dictates. The author possesses many qualifications for his task. His acquaintance with military history is very extensive; he claims no exclusive source of information, and laments the want of more accurate maps and official documents necessary for a strictly scientific judgment. There is no traee of personal feeling or hero-worship in the book. In the first division the principles of strategy concurred in by all the great masters of the art are expounded and illustrated to the comprehension of any non-technical reader. The second portion is a detailed examination of the geography of the Southern Confederacy; the scene of action for reducing to practice the principles already discussed. Their special application to the theatre of war then follows. The work continues with showing that the results of last year's campaign agrees with the conclusions to be drawn from the admitted data, and winds up with suggestions for the operations of 1863. Good maps illustrate the author's positions, and enable the reader to comprehend them thoroughly. A view of the great physical features of the country show that three great zones, or theatres of war, are distinctly marked out by natural lines of separation on the ""debateable land"" of the North and South. The first, or left zone, extends from the seaboard to the Alleghanies and the Blue Ridge; the right zone, comprising the country west of the Mississippi; and the central, interposes between the two others, extending north and south from the Ohio to the Gulf of Mexico. From natural causes these zones require each distinct military organizations --armies, bases of operation, supplies, &c. In importance, they diminish toward the West -- the first, or Eastern division, being incomparably the most serious point either of attack or defence, and the main field for decisive measures. While the West and the Central have no one essential strategic position, the reverse is the case in the East. Here we find a chain of mountains like a wedge driven from the North right into the very heart of the theatre of war -- it is the only elevated front of it -- and dominates it in all directions, like the bulwark or citadel of a fortress, which, in this case, may represent the whole South. Occupy the fortress, but leave the citadel untouched, and it will be the same as if nothing had been taken. In these mountains the Southern armies can rally, and maintaining here a central position, with the facility of debouching at any place, they can throw themselves with their whole force on all the surrounding fragments of our armies and beat them in detail. The possession of the mountain region is, therefore, a necessity for the holding not only of the left zone, but also of the whole theatre of the war. This once secured, we hold the key of the whole Southern Confederacy. Our armies are then in the central position and able to throw themselves on the fragments of the Southern armies with their united forces."" Instead of the prosecution of a grand central plan like this, the author fin[???]s in the discussion of last year's campaigns a failure to understand the great principles of wars of invasion. A glance at the map is sufficient to show the number of places, isolated from each other, occupied by Union troops, where they are practically locked up in large bodies and debarred from exercising any influence in the general result. The invading armies should not care for towns or for occupation it should have but one object -- the finding and a[???]i[???]ilating of the enemy's armies. In a word, instead of one grand war and plan of operations, half-a-dozen small wits or petty plans were substituted. It must be remarked that the defence admirably profited by the rude lesson it received at Fort Don[???]lson, and from that moment its action became more and more correct, and in accordance with the rules to concentrate the main force always on the decisive point, and to act on interior lines. The following passage will show the originality of M. SCHALK's views: ""The facilities offered by the navy by sea and river gunboats, had the most deteriorating effect on the operations. It was almost taken for granted that without them operations were impossible, and with them irresistible. The consequence of this gunboat mania was and is still, that the best lines of communications, but the least decisive line of operation, were invariably chosen. The large rivers on the seacoast attracted the Union Generals like magnets. If ever a circumstance conducts them into the interior of the country, immediately these rivers and the thought of safety and gunboats draw them back. As far as gunboats are concerned, they ought to play a very secondary part, merely to serve as a kind of diversion, but never to intrust large operations to, or confide to their guns the safety of a large army."" Writing in January of the present year, the author reviews the probable occurrences of the coming campaign, and it is creditable to his foresight that a rebel attack on Gen. FOSTER and the army at Newbern, is pointed out as the very first step likely to be taken. He thinks that the rebels cannot afford to make any mistakes, but if they adhere to a correct defence and are less exhausted than is reported, the plan of invasion indicated by the position of the Unionarmies (in January) is not favorable to decisive results.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERATURE OF APRIL.; AFRICAN HUNTING FROM NATAL TO THE ZAMBESI, INCLUDING LAKE NGAMI, THE KALAHIRRI DESERT, &c., from 1852 to 1862.

But a short distance of the track was laid, however, in consequence of the injunction issued by the Supreme Court. A gang of men employed by the opposition or George Law Company also commenced laying a track, for the purpose of obtaining the right of way. The points selected were the junction of Fourteenth-street and Broadway, just above the point where the Harlem track had been laid; and also a place below the Harlem track, and near the Battery new tracks were laid, so that, if the Harlem track that had been commenced was extended, it would compel the removal of the bars that were laid in its line. The bars or rails are about ten feet in length, and are temporarily fastened in the pavement -- the work having been performed at each end in not more than twenty minutes time. The rails laid by the Harlem Company are permanent, and the line it proposes to occupy is obstructed by the temporary railway of the opposition Company. An injunction prevents any further operations. Considerable excitement was occasioned yesterday around the City Hall, from information received that copies of the injunction would be served on the members of the Common Council.

It is evident at a glance that the object of this tremendous revelation is to neutralize the effects of the Union and emancipation agitation now going on in all parts of Great Britain, as well as the demonstrations of sympathy with the North which the middle and lower classes have everywhere made, by representing the whole movement to be the work of paid Federal agents, or the direct result of Northern bribery. Allegations to this effect were made by the London Times some weeks ago, but they were promptly and flatly contradicted by Mr. ADAMS, in his reply to one of the Anti-Slavery deputations.

The Comptroller reported that the balance in the City Treasury on last Saturday was $2,601,776 55. A proposition to pave the Third avenue with Belgian pavement, between Fifty-sixth and Eighty-sixth streets, elicited some debate. Some settled ratio of assessment upon property-owners and the City for this kind of pavement, Mr. FROMENT urged, should be decided upon. The Legislature, he said, reduced our appropriations for the work every year, and so kept the Croton Board from fulfilling the orders of the Common Council for laying the Belgian pavement. Meanwhile the expense of repairing the cobble-stone pavement amounted to about as much each year as was allowed for putting down new pavement. Mr. BOOLE wished to stop ordering any more Belgian pavement till it shall be definitely determined how much the City and the property-owners benefited by the improvement in each case shall respectively bear, for work had long been ordered far exceeding the amount of the appropriation for new pavement. Mr. HARDY showed that the work proposed to be done on Third-avenue was ordered by an ordinance passed in 1856, assessing half the cost upon the property-owners directly interested, and the remainder upon the City.

The return of the Seventh and Eighth regiments called out not only their immediate friends, relatives and acquaintances, but, thousands upon thousands of their countrymen, together with a mass of all nationalities seldom gathered at such short notice. The uncertainty as to the hour of the arrival of the regiments, of course made the reception much of an impromptu affair, but, in heartiness, in cordiality, in the whole-souled congratulations which it elicited, it could hardly have been surpassed. The friends of the two regiments collected respectively at the Steuben House, Bowery, and at Dramatic Hall. Houston-street, early in the day, and left about three o'clock, with the expectation of meeting the returning regiments immediately upon their landing. But, they were a little late, as the veterans had already arrived at Jersey City, where, exactly at 3 o'clock the whistle of the locomotive was heard, and in a few moments the train dashed into the depot, amid the cheers and shouts of the people, heartily responded to by the soldiers. As the latter left the cars they endeavored to fall into line; their ranks,however, were soon broken by the mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts, rushing in eagerly, clasping their hands and, as might naturally be expected, embracing and kissing them. At last, with the greatest difficulty the men got on board the ferry-boat D[???]y, which soon started for the New-York shore, amid the blowing of steam-whistles from the boats in the river, the lowering of colors, and cheers from the crews of the various vessels in the river, and the firing of salutes. As the boat touched the stores, the crowd outside the gates broke through all restraint, and rushing through the gandway, welcomed the soldiers with ""three times three"" rousing cheers. The ""Seventh"" at once formed in line in Cortlandt-street, and were received by a detachment of the Third New-York cavalry, and by them escorted through Broadway. They were soon followed by the Eighth, escorted by a delegation of German citizens. On the left hand of Col. (Prince) SALM SALM, of the Eighth, was Gen. BLENKER, attired in citizens' dress. The meeting with the reception delegations in the angle formed by the junction of Park-row and Broadway, in front of the Astor House and Museum, was extremely interesting; for, soon after the arrival of the veterans at the front of the Museum, the head of the reception delegations made its appearance with a band of music, with bouquets, banners, ladies, war-worn veterans who had previously returned, citizen soldiers and citizens generally, to the number of thousands. Such a hurrahing and cheering as ensued baffle description. It was ordered that the reception procession should countermarch so as to take the lead in the triumphal march through the City, and a faint effort was made to carry out that programme. But the long pent-up feelings of separated friends could not be thus baffled. Crowds rushed from the ranks, and ran eagerly along the line of sun-burnt braves to catch the familiar features of loved ones -- familiar, though disguised with the hardships of two years' camp service, and bronzed by Summer suns and Winter storms. The reunions of the few moments thus occupied were enough to touch the heart of the most stoical bystander. It was the acme of human happiness -- the rejoining of husband and wife, of brother and sister, of parents and children. All was happiness.

Nothing can be more just and needful than that on the eve of commencing new and, as we trust, decisive movements, we should pause to invoke the Divine favor, without which all efforts are vain.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Fast.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Fast.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee3e76ea-c19e-58f5-a91d-b41e623b4f45,778,nyt://article/ee3e76ea-c19e-58f5-a91d-b41e623b4f45

"If this war were remarkable for nothing else, it would be made ever memorable by the severity with which it is testing the price and value of a vast number of doctrines and beliefs which were held at its breaking out by a large and influential portion of the Christian world.

With some of the delusions which it has exploded, our readers are very familiar. We were all of us more or less satisfied, when it began, that Cotton occupied such a place in the world that there was no baseness or violence of which France and England, at least, would not be guilty in order to procure it. We thought the South so demoralized by the habit of bullying and of idling, as to be incapable of organized and persevering effort. We thought self-interest so powerful in determining men's course of action, as to make a combined attempt on the part of any large body of its citizens to overthrow the Union an idle dream. We were so impressed by the skil and wisdom displayed in the construction of the Constitution, that we had ceased to attach much importance to the character of the men who were to administer it. We were perfectly certain that the mere fact that every able-bodied man nominally belonged to the militia of the United States, placed the Republic in possession of an army 2,000,000 strong, and ready for immediate action.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lessons of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Lessons of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-04-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f425edad-72ad-5c93-9cdd-4cccec74c711,1173,nyt://article/f425edad-72ad-5c93-9cdd-4cccec74c711
