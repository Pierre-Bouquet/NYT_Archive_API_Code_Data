The address prepared by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, in response to the contributions for the relief of the distress, received by the ship George Griswo[???]d, from New-York, was to be publicly presented to the Commander of that vessel, in the Concert Room of St. George's Hall, on the 16th of February. Some of the leading men of Liverpool were expected to take part in the proceedings, and a gratifying demonstration was looked for. The Liverpool mass meeting for the adoption of an address in support of President's LINCOLN's emancipation policy was to be held at the Amphitheatre in that town on the 19th of February. The Polish insurrection appears to be assuming more and more formidable proportions. A band of 2,000 insurgents had occupied Dibienka, upon the frontier of Dublin. The statement that the insurgents under LANGEWEIZ had suffered considerable losses proved exaggerated. His chief force, consisting of 5,000 men, was posted in the mountains of Krzyz. The Austrian Government had prohibited the exportation and carriage of arms and warlike stores across the frontier to Prussia. The Russian and Prussian Government showed great irritation against the Austrian Press on account of the sympathy it was manifesting for the Poles. It is stated that the Poles have intercepted letters to the Russian Ambassador at Berlin and Paris, accusing Austria of encouraging the Poles in their insurrection. It is also stated that the Poles have intercepted letters from the Grand Duke CONSTANTINE, stating his intention to pursue the same course of action he has hitherto pursued in the government of Poland. A Convention between Prussia and Russia, in reference to the Polish insurrection, was signed on the 8th inst. In the Liverpool Cotton market prices were without change. There was very little business doing in Breadstuffs, and Provisions were dull. Consols were quoted at 92 1/8@93.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27761e4c-c69b-5336-80e6-6e2b6fa606fb,554,nyt://article/27761e4c-c69b-5336-80e6-6e2b6fa606fb

A large numbe of resignations have been sent in to headquarters on account of the presence of the Third Louisiana Native Guard, colored regiment, at Baton Rouge, and a spirit of insubordination prevails among nearly all the troops. This feeling of prejudice and bitter hatred extends to all the regiments, and is shared by the majority of the commissioned officers, who assert they will not participate in any engagement where negroes are placed in command as commissioned officers. Some of these officers have threatened to kill the first colored officer that offers to assume, in any way, military authority in their presence. I understand that Maj.-Gen. AUGUR and Brig.-Gen. GROVER, the latter now in command at Baton Rouge, do not approve of commissioning colored officers. Col. STAFFORD, of the First Louisia a colored regiment, and Col. J.A. NELSON, of the Third Louisiana Native Guard Regiment, are here in town to-day for the purpose of having an interview with Gen. BANKS on this important matter. The non-commissioned officers refuse to acknowledge the authority of their colored superiors, and our privates are extremely bitter in their avowals of hatred, and are determined to mutiny if these colored officers are not dismissed. I cannot understand why Government will persist in intruding upon our soldiers a measure so repulsive to their feelings, and one which is causing a great amount of demoralization and disaffection among our troops. It is understood that the Commander-in-Chief has already declined to appoint colored officers to the fourth negro regiment, now being raised in this city.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS WAR ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS WAR ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f2822e0-564e-5a01-b2e8-4739e4e076d3,2590,nyt://article/2f2822e0-564e-5a01-b2e8-4739e4e076d3

"By the arrival at this port of the steamship Africa, we have received advices from Europe to the 15th inst., two days later. The news is not specially important. Nothing new relating to the American question had been developed. The address prepared by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, in response to the contributions for the relief of the distress, received by the ship George Griswold, from New-York, was to be publicly presented to the Commander of that vessel, in the Concert Room of St. George's Hall, on the 16th of February. Some of the leading men of Liverpool were expected to take part in the proceedings, and a gratifying demonstration was looked for. The Liverpool mass meeting for the adoption of an address in support of President's LINCOLN's emancipation policy was to be held at the Amphitheatre in that town on the 19th of February. The Polish insurrection appears to be assuming more and more formidable proportions. A band of 2,000 insurgents had occupied Dibienka, upon the frontier of Dublin. The statement that the insurgents under LANGEWEIZ had suffered considerable losses proved exaggerated. His chief force, consisting of 5,000 men, was posted in the mountains of Krzyz. The Austrian Government had prohibited the exportation and carriage of arms and warlike stores across the frontier to Prussia. The Russian and Prussian Government showed great irritation against the Austrian Press on account of the sympathy it was manifesting for the Poles. It is stated that the Poles have intercepted letters to the Russian Ambassador at Berlin and Paris, accusing Austria of encouraging the Poles in their insurrection. It is also stated that the Poles have intercepted letters from the Grand Duke CONSTANTINE, stating his intention to pursue the same course of action he has hitherto pursued in the government of Poland. A Convention between Prussia and Russia, in reference to the Polish insurrection, was signed on the 8th inst. In the Liverpool Cotton market prices were without change.

"The topic of conversation in circles that are usually stirred by the announcements of managers is, of course, the approaching operatic season, at the Academy of Music, under Mr. MAX MARETZEK. The impression is general that it will be one of unusual brilliancy, and so far as the public is concerned there can hardly be a doubt that it will more than fulfill the expectations that have been formed of it. The artists are entirely new -- some of them preeminent la their profession -- all of them vouched for by Mr. MARETZEK, who is never mistaken when the question is one of voice merely. With a repertoire that includes three new operas, and the whole range of old ones, and a well-informed musician to attend to their production, it will be strange, indeed, if success does not await an effort so bold and praise worthy. The Academy will, undoubtedly, be well attended on every fine night of the season, but will the slight surplus obtained on these occasions be sufficient to protect the manager from loss when the weather is bad? We fear not. The ordinary prices are much too low for a complete company like Mr. MARETZEK's, especially at the present time, when artists expect to be paid in specie, and even then demand increased salaries. Mr. MARETZEK, who is always hopeful, and at the commencement of a season fond of indulging in balmy visions of crowded houses, has resolved not to make any addition to the usual prices of admission, and there, of course, the matter ends. Nothing but the weather will, we are sure, interfere with his prosperity, but in the Spring there is always much to be apprehended on tha: score.

Mr. Sumner's Resolution; Secretary Seward's Dispatches,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/03/archives/foreign-intervention.html,Mr. Sumner's Resolution; Secretary Seward's Dispatches,"The resolutions reported in the Senate by Mr. SUMNER, on the subject of Foreign Intervention in our affairs, are admirable. They leave nothing to be desired. They put the whole case clearly and strongly, and yet without the slightest passion, before the world, and give conclusive reasons why we cannot permit the interference, in any form, of any foreign nation, in the adjustment of our controversy with this rebellion. They admit the propriety of intervention where one nation is at war with another, and do full justice to the motives which lead foreign Powers to seek the termination of a war which inflicts such serious evils upon all mankind as that now raging between our Government and the rebel States: -- but they also declare the supreme necessity of crushing the rebellion, and that ""any proposition from a foreign Power, whatever form it may take, having for its object the arrest of these efforts, is, just in proportion to its influence, an encouragement to the rebellion and to its declared principles, and on this account is calculated to prolong and embitter the conflict, to cause increased expenditures of blood and treasure, and to postpone the much desired day of peace;"" and they sum up the whole matter by announcing that ""Congress will be obliged to look upon any further attempt in the same direction as an unfriendly act, which it earnestly deprecates, to the end that nothing may occur abroad to strengthen the rebellion, or to weaken those relations of good will with foreign Powers which the United States are happy to cultivate.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Foreign Intervention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Foreign Intervention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad706c78-ba2b-56cb-98c0-428f4c820129,890,nyt://article/ad706c78-ba2b-56cb-98c0-428f4c820129

Why, we ask in turn, does the Post confine its reasoning to that particular route? Why not hand over all our commerce to foreign nations? Why have American vessels on the ocean at all, when British ships stand ready to take their place and relieve them from all risk of capture by rebel privateers? If the argument is good for the San Francisco route, it is just as good for the trade to Liverpool, to Havre, to Hamburg, to Canton, and to every other port on the surface of the globe.

It may not be generally known that there is a great scarcity of instrumental players and of chorus singers; and that this scarcity, in the case of Mr. MARETZEK, has been aggravated by the machinations of a previous empressario. Mr. MARETZEK has fortunately surmounted both difficulties, and is now prepared to give opera to the public in a way that it has not been given since he left the conductor's rostrum.

The bill to modify the existing laws for the collection of duties on imports was passed without amendment.

MCDOWELL voluntarily submitted his military career since the war began.

WHITEBERRY, of the bark Golden Rule, which was captured and burnt by the rebel pirate Alabama off Hayti, arrived here yesterday in the brig Ocean Belle, Capt. PETTINGILL, from St. Domingo. The Golden Rule belonged to the Panama Railroad Company, and left here for Panama with an assorted cargo, on the 17th of January. On the 26th, when about 40 miles south-southwest from Cape Taburone, Capt. WHITEBERRY discovered, at about 12 M., a steamer, which afterward proved to be the Alabama. She had the American ensign floating from her mizzengaff, and immediately steered toward the bark. When within half a mile she fired a blank shot, hauled down the American ensign and raised the rebel colors. She then sent a boat to the Golden Rule, with an order for Capt. WHITEBERRY to go on board the Alabama. The Captain complied with the order, and on reaching the pirate was invited into the cabin by Capt. SEMMES, where he was questioned about his vessel -- her destination, cargo, &c. SEMMES informed the Captain that he would be obliged to burn the bark, and gave permission to the crew to take each a bag of clothing with him on leaving the bark. The crew were all brought on board the Alabama and put in irons. Capt. WHITEBERRY, however, was allowed the liberty of the vessel. Before burning the Golden Rule, which was done at 9 P.M. the same day, the pirate took from her twelve or fifteen boat-loads of provisions, such as the Alabama stood in need of at the time. Capt. WHITEBERRY and his crew were landed in the city of San Domingo on the evening of the 28th of January. He gives the same account of his good treatment by the pirates, while on board their craft, as has often been given by other captives. With regard to the Alabama, Capt. WHITEBERRY does not think she is capable of that extraordinary speed for which she has got credit. The Captain desires to return his thanks to Capt. PETTINGILL, of the Ocean Belle, for kindness extended to him in his misfortunes.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Capture of the Golden Rule by the Pirate; Alabama. STATEMENT OF CAPT.

No part of the President's policy for conducting the present war to an issue consistent with the interests of freedom and humanity has had a more prominent place, or, in all his messages, a more extended and earnest advocacy, than this scheme for ridding the Border States of Slavery. And it is not to be denied that the Government has received more applause from abroad on account of these persistent efforts of the President for a peaceful and humane solution of the Slavery question than on any other account whatever. In the Border States also, but more especially in Missouri, the Government was immensely strengthened by the liberal overtures of the President and Congress on this subject; for it must not be forgotten that Congress, by an almost unanimous vote, at a former session, indorsed and promised to carry out the President's plans.

Neutrality--Privateers and Arms Supplied the Rebels,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/06/archives/the-angloconfederate-privateers.html,Neutrality--Privateers and Arms Supplied the Rebels,"There was some very strong talk at the Chamber of Commerce meeting, yesterday, concerning the British pirates who are now using the rebel flag to destroy American commerce on the waters of our own coast, as well as on every sea of the globe. The recent accounts we have published from London journals make it appear that the matter is likely soon to assume a far more formidable and flagitious character than it has at present. It would be impossible for the commercial marine of any nation to exist for three months in the face of the warlike naval force that is now being fitted up in English ports for the ""Emperor of China,"" alias JEFF. DAVIS. The cotton bonds, and mortgages upon the Southern cotton crop, are the means used to pay for these ships, while the prospect of plunder and the love of lawless adventure will always be a sufficient inducement for British sailors to man them. We must primarily look for redress in this business, and for its prevention, to our own skill and resources; but our Government must not fail to persistently press upon the British authorities some regard for that neutrality of which they perfidiously boast. The British Government can no longer pretend that it does not officially know the facts; for our Minister to their Court has taken care that this prefence shall be no longer tenable. Mr. TAYLOR, member of Parliament from Leicester, truly said that if the Mexicans were to go to England to purchase vessels to prey upon French commerce, nobody doubted that the British Government would detect the fact, and very quickly put a stop to the negotiations or to the career of any such vessel that might attempt to get to sea. And they would be as careful in their dealings with us if they had the same wholesome respect of our power.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ANGLO-CONFEDERATE PRIVATEERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ANGLO-CONFEDERATE PRIVATEERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/787c9c5b-f5a6-5fcf-b2e4-e566c79fb3bd,398,nyt://article/787c9c5b-f5a6-5fcf-b2e4-e566c79fb3bd

The Act took effect on the first of last September and the six months of its operation which have since passed have served to suggest the modifications embodied in the amendatory act. A glance at the table will show the reader that the changes in the rates of taxation are quite numerous and important. In addition to the alterations there noted, some have been made in sections relating to the duties of the Government officers and of the persons taxed.

Since the first issue of the currency, it has been customary to receive it for all sums of duty under five dollars, in accordance with that provision of the law authorizing its issue, which made them ""receivable in payment of all dues to the United States less than five dollars."" For some time past the premium on gold and Demand Notes has been so great, that merchants doing a large importing business have found it considerably to their advantage to avail of the privilege heretofore accorded them of using the postage currency in the payment of small sums. On every entry which passes the Custom-house, fees are to be paid which are in all cases under $5. In payment of these the notes have been very convenient. The Cashier does not refuse, however, to receive the notes in payment of these fees. His orders from the Collector were to ""receive no more postage currency for duty."" It often happens that the importer will be required to pay such a sum that it is necessary to use small coin or fractional notes to make the exact amount. Persons familiar with the law under which the postage currency was issued at first believed that the order against receiving it for duties only applied to large sums, when importers desired to pay a portion of that sum in currency. For instance: an importer wishes to pay duty amounting to $344 25. Until Tuesday he would pay $340 in gold or demand notes, and $4 25 in postage currency. It was believed that the order was issued merely to enforce the payment of the whole sum in gold or demand notes. The law makes the currency receivable in payment of all dues to the United States less than $5, and it was said in support of the supposed decision of the Collector, not to receive it in such a case as the above, that the total sum of duty could not be divided: that $344 25 was the amount to be paid, and certainly that was not less than $5. The decision of the Collector, however, was not confined to such a case as the above. If an imposter wishes to pay $4 25 as the entire duty on any single entry, he must now pay it in gold or silver, the Collector's decision be sustained.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Affairs at the Custom-House.; THE POSTAGE CURRENCY NO LONGER RECEIVABLE FOR DUTIES--COMMENTS ON THE COLLECTOR'S DECISION BY THOSE AROUND THE CUSTOMHOUSE--GOLD RECEIPTS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Affairs at the Custom-House.; THE POSTAGE CURRENCY NO LONGER RECEIVABLE FOR DUTIES--COMMENTS ON THE COLLECTOR'S DECISION BY THOSE AROUND THE CUSTOMHOUSE--GOLD RECEIPTS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf906537-abe7-5fcd-ad85-d45c75880723,631,nyt://article/cf906537-abe7-5fcd-ad85-d45c75880723

The interests of the Academy, so far as Italian Opera is concerned, have not been well conserved in the absence of such a head. Various experiments of singular audacity and barren result have been made; such, for instance, as trying to give grand opera without grand artists, and mainly on the strength of a few pieces of ""armour by GRANGER of Paris,"" -- a chivalric device that failed utterly; then came the epoch of diminished forces, when an orchestra of twenty-eight was considered sufficient, and a chorus of equal magnitude had to sentinel the stage, and make an imposing effect before the public. There are many small towns in Europe where economical contrivances of this sort are practiced, but the Academy sank even lower than these, for the operas played were not given entire as they are almost sure to be there. The absence of any musical head to the concern resulted naturally in a degree of license that was almost incredible.

Constitutionalism in; Policy of the Deputies,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/08/archives/constitutionalism-in-prussiathe-policy-of-the-deputies.html,Constitutionalism in; Policy of the Deputies,"Constitutionalism in England, under Queen VICTORIA, and constitutionalism in Prussia, under King WILLIAM, are two very different things. In England, the Constitution, and Parliament as its exponent, are supreme; the Queen is but its highest subject. She never makes herself a party to the acts of her Ministers, nor opposes her opinion to the expressed will of Parliament, and she can always change her Government without detriment to her authority. She secures her prerogatives, maintains her sway, and gives stability to her throne, by rigid observance of the law, and rigid respect for the rights of the people's representatives. In Prussia just now the case is quite otherwise. There the sovereign tramples on the Constitution at his whim; contemns the Legislature, and regards his Ministers as but a species of upper servants, who are bound to carry out his caprices, and by whom, as long as they do so, be is obliged in honor to stand, no matter how offensive to the nation or antagonistic to law may be their doings. That this is WILLIAM's theory of constitutionalism is evident from his reply to the address of the Lower Chamber. In this document, his Serene Majesty reproves the Deputies for having presumed to censure the conduct of the Government, because, forsooth, he had sanctioned its acts. The three estates of the realm, not having been able to come to an agreement, it was, of course, the duty of the Landesvater to take care that the nation's interests should not suffer. The King warns the Deputies that he is determined to uphold the prerogatives of the Crown and the privileges of the Kerrenhaus, despite the attempts of the popular branch of the Diet to encroach on them; and he winds up with the expression of a hope that this manifestation of his conciliatory disposition will be met in a like spirit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Constitutionalism in Prussia--The Policy of the Deputies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Constitutionalism in Prussia--The Policy of the Deputies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0da05c5b-657f-56a4-8a9f-ddfa7d5fd47f,1113,nyt://article/0da05c5b-657f-56a4-8a9f-ddfa7d5fd47f

Ambulance Corps for the Army,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/08/archives/an-ambulance-corps-for-the-army.html,Ambulance Corps for the Army,"The ""Ambulance Corps"" bill which was before Congress, failed of passage because the General-in-Chief thought the thing impracticable. The system which was last tried consisted in taking certain men from the regiments on the eve of battle to attend to the work of carrying off their comrades who might be wounded in the engagement. This plan was adopted by Gen. BURNSIDE at the battle of Fredericksburgh, and worked very well; but at all previous battles of the war, the wounded have been greatly neglected until the close of the engagement, and a vast amount of unnecessary suffering has been the consequence. When a soldier fell, the two nearest to him, if not too busily engaged, would carry him to the rear for the attention of the surgeons. But there being no regular plan of organization, and no special body of men set apart for the duty, a large part of the wounded had no attention at all. In no engagement that has yet occurred, have systematio and sufficient arrangements been made for taking care of those who should chance to fall. Thousands whom prompt assistance would have saved, have thus been allowed to linger through days of agony into untimely graves. There have been instances of men left in terrible anguish in the field for seven days, until exhaustion rendered mortal injuries which were in themselves but trifling. The ambulance trains have been left far in the rear; the drivers have frequently deserted or fled; the horses and mules have been run off by skulks and stragglers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Ambulance Corps for the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Ambulance Corps for the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/41e48021-c1bf-5305-8c92-ef4ac7f08407,640,nyt://article/41e48021-c1bf-5305-8c92-ef4ac7f08407

"-- By  order of the United States District Court, Marshal MILWARD sold on Saturday, the prize steamer Princess Royal, recently captured off Charleston by the United States gunboat Unadilla. There was a large attendance, but very few bidders. The vessel was put up at $90,000, and knocked down to an agent of the Government at $113,000, the appraised value. It is understood that the Princess Royal will be hauled to the Navy-yard as soon as the sale is confirmed by the Court and the money paid over, and that she will be fitted up for a gunboat. Some persons have supposed that, being a fast steamer, she might be sent out in search of the Alabama, but they forget that she is not more than half the tonnage of the rebel steamer, and  besides, has an iron hull, which a solid shot would pass through almost as readily as it did through the hull of the Hatteras. Part of the cargo of the Princess Royal was also sold, by an order of the Court, on Saturday. The principal item in the catalogue, 400 bags of coffee, was disposed of first. One Purchaser took the entire lot, at 32 1/2 cents per pound, which was above the appraised value, and thought by dealers generally to be a high figure. Some choice packages of a lot of tea brought as high as $1 20, but the generality of it sold from 85 to 95 cents the package. The pepper, tin and sheet-iron all sold at high prices.

Mr. FIELD refused to be convinced without a struggle, and the result was a long correspondence, which Mr. LORING has since been induced to publish. It now lies before us in a large pamphlet, and contains the main points of the controversy, as fully stated as is possible within the limits of letters which when written were private, and intended to remain so. We wish we could add that Mr. LORING was rewarded by witnessing Mr. FIELD's repentance and conversion as the result of his labors.

"-- Our readers are not, perhaps, aware that there is now being built here an iron-clad battery of the Monitor pattern, intended for ocean service, and which, in point of strength, speed and effectiveness, promises to excel any vessel of the class afloat. The new battery has been named the Manayunk, and is being built on the south side of the Monongahela close by the end of the Monongahela Bridge. The contractors are Messrs. SNOWDON, MASON & CO., and if we are informed aright, the price to be paid is something over $[???]00,000. The vessel was commenced some three or four months ago, and has given employment ever since to some 150 hands. The model of the vessel is exceedingly sharp and graceful, and with engines of sufficient power, she will doubtless make fast time. Her length is 235 feet, and breadth of beam 40 feet. Like all the other Monitors, she will consist of two hulls, an upper and lower, but, unlike the original Monitor, they will be joined together in such a way as to entirely avoid the defects which resulted in the loss of the latter, the upper hull will be plated with six inches of iron, and the turret with ten inches. The pilot-house will be protected by eight inches of iron, and the chimney will be constructed of iron plates, each an inch thick. She will carry two guns, one 15 inch, capable of throwing a ball weighing 430 pounds, and the other 11 inches, and will, it is believed, be the most substantial and reliable vessel of the character ever built. The greater portion of the side of the lower hull are now in place, and a portion of the plating has been put on. The turret is also under way, and the engines are in an advanced state.

Each combatant is often forced to draw comfort on the happening of an untoward event by the reflection that it was not so bad as it might have been. We are compelled to accept this minor consolation in considering the loss of the iron-clad monitor Indianola, below Vicksburgh. At first it was not clear in what condition the enemy obtained this prize. It appeared that the struggle had been very brief -- that the Indianola had yielded to the assaults of two rams -- but beyond this nothing was certain. Some of the crew stated that she had been abandoned in a sinking condition, but other reports were current that the rebels had taken her below and anchored her under the guns of Port Hudson. The public mind, annoyed by the unwelcome news, was willing to accept this story, and fears were even entertained that with the Indianola and the Queen of the West the rebels would dash at once into the lower Mississippi, destroy Commodore FARRAGUT's wooden fleet, and recapture not only Baton Rouge, but even New-Orleans. And undoubtedly a raid of the Indianola down the river might have put in peril a very large Union fleet, and rendered doubtful our tenure of the Lower Mississippi. But happily we are relieved of apprehension on this score. We have the best authority -- that of the rebels themselves -- for stating that the Indianola will, if we perform our duty, never do service under the Confederate flag. Though lost to us, the vessel is equally lost to the enemy. ""She is sunk on the Mississippi side, and her upper works removed.""

Boston Commercial Bulletin on his Butter Speculation,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/09/archives/the-house-of-stewart-in-a-new-line-of-speculation.html,Boston Commercial Bulletin on his Butter Speculation,"-- Provision dealers were not a little astonished, the other day, to find an operator in the Butter market who made a clean sweep of every choice grade lot of that commodity offering, at the highest current rates. But they were still more surprised when they learned that this bold and persistent speculator was an agent of the dry goods house of STEWART, in New-York City, and that the butter thus bought up was to be shipped to Europe to pay for importations, in lieu of exchange. Our market has since been left nearly bare of good stocks of Vermont and New-York butter, and prices have materially advanced. This ""cute"" and characteristic operation rather beats the cotton goods monopoly. There is but one more chance for a ""spec"" left for STEWART in this quarter, and that is to go into the fish market. The cod and haddock have already taken the alarm, and struck out for deep water. -- Boston Commercial Bulletin, March 7.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HOUSE OF STEWART IN A NEW LINE OF SPECULATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE HOUSE OF STEWART IN A NEW LINE OF SPECULATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/767c4d07-c469-5415-b0bd-591f795252c9,164,nyt://article/767c4d07-c469-5415-b0bd-591f795252c9

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/09/archives/local-intelligence-our-police-our-harbor-defences-court.html,,"The Police Commissioners, with their more immediate subordinates, are comfortably and conveniently settled in their new building, of which mention was made in the TIMES several months since. The amount of routine business necessitated by the growing importance of the Police Department, has increased vastly during the past three years, and as the population of the city rolls on toward the million, the exigencies of office duty alone demanded accommodations largely advanced in space and modern conveniences beyond the narrow and greatly prescribed limits of the old headquarters. The working statue of the Metropolitan force was never more elevated than now, nor at any time within police recollections has a system of such absolute efficiency been in operation as the present. The Commissioners, by a habit of judicial impartiality, have impressed upon the corps, from the Superintendent to the patrolman, the absolute policy of good behavior, and unflagging interest in the performance of duty. Regular sessions are held by the Commissioners, at which all members of the force charged with dereliction of duty are arraigned and afforded a fair opportunity of explaining their action, and as yet we have to learn of dissatisfaction on the part of citizen or officer with the decision of the Court. Since the retirement of Gen. BOWEN, the Presidency of the Board has devolved upon Commissioner ACTON, who, with Commissioner BERGEN, constitute the Board. Superintendent KENNEDY has his office in the same building, and remains, despite the charges against him, all of which have been exploded in regular trial, at the head of the force. Ex-Chief JOHN S. FOLK, is in charge in Brooklyn, subordinate, of course, to the Metropolitan Headquarters. The force in Brooklyn is ridiculously small, and wholly inadequate to the proper performance of the required work. It is not right to leave a city of over 300,000 inhabitants to the custody of between 200 and 300 men. With the exception of occasional officiousness on the part of bilious or newly appointed officers, and a tendency to strain at gnats, while metaphorical camels are permitted unimpeded progress, the people of this City and of Brooklyn have slight cause of complaint against the force as now organized, while the Commissioners and their immediate subordinates may with propriety and justice claim for themselves the thanks of a well protected people.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Our Police.

The work is a favorite with our public, and has been so ever since its production, invariably attracting the best audiences of the season. Considering that we have not always heard it under the most favorable of circumstances, this popularity augers well for Mr. MARETZEK, whose company gave it last night in a way that, in many respects, has never been equaled. The distribution included nearly all the leading artists of the troupe, with the exception of Signor BELLINI, who is still too much under the weather to sustain his role. An able and zealous substitute was found in Signor YPOLITO, who sang the aria in the first act with much energy, and in the fourth with artistic feeling, but lacked dramatic force for the situation of the third act. It would be difficult to say to whom the honors of the evening were due. Both Mad. MEDORI and Signor MAZZOLINI were in such superb voice that the house had barely recovered from one outburst of enthusiasm before it was plunged into a fresh one by one or other of these artists. The fine school of Mad. MEDORI, her large voice, and ample command of dramatic intensity and expression, are all superbly displayed in the effective role of Amelia, more particularly in the latter half of the opera where the tribulation of the heroine commence and end. It was apparent that this lady has yet another career before her. Her artistic resources are of the amplest kind, and although her voice is afflicted with a tremolo which indicates excessive use, it is yet commanding in power and admirable in quantity. As an actress, too, she is thoroughly good. We have no hesitation in saying, and without qualification, that the third and fourth acts have never been so well rendered in this City.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2afa9af5-358e-5592-b1cb-97d7e4e29515,635,nyt://article/2afa9af5-358e-5592-b1cb-97d7e4e29515

Against whom is this proposed law aimed? Are not the people of Virginia, as of the whole South, a unit for secession? Have we not been told a thousand times, that both sexes, all ages, all sizes and every color, were opposed to the Union with all the faculties of their minds, all the passions of their hearts, all the members of their bodies, opposed to it totally and to the bitter end, even to the ""last ditch?"" It seems, however, that this is slightly if not considerably exaggerated; for why should a law be made to punish a crime that has no existence?

RALPH RICHARDS -- My Dear Sir: Seeing your name in one of the public prints to-day, put it in my mind to write you, the more especially as you are in some measure both the representative and manufacturer of public sentiment at home. I have been more and more impressed of late with a notion that the people at home do not stand up to that high mark of patriotism and of public virtue which the exigencies of this gigantic war demand, and which the sublime history and vast hopes of an heroic nation and a great and virtuous people entitle us to expect. The public Press and all the various modes for the expression of public sentiment indicate that a large portion of the Northern people, and, it is greatly to be feared, a majority of them, look with doubt upon the issue of this struggle, and are ready to abandon it upon any, even dishonorable terms. The prevalence of this idea in the army has weakened its courage and heroic fortitude, prepared it for weak and unmanly concessions, robbed it of the high and holy aims which sanctified its efforts, and has in a great measure reduced it from an army of patriots fighting for a great cause and conscious of the sublimity of their mission and the estimation which posterity will place upon their efforts, to an army of mercenaries, entering the service for the huge bounties offered, serving in it grudgingly and of necessity, and working with aching hearts for any mode by which they may possibly leave it.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ARMY AND THE WAR.; Letter from a New-York Volunteer on the Duty of the People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ARMY AND THE WAR.; Letter from a New-York Volunteer on the Duty of the People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d1d5196-b017-5058-a9af-f709ffb8ddee,1125,nyt://article/3d1d5196-b017-5058-a9af-f709ffb8ddee

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- The performance of ""Ernani,"" last night, was so thoroughly excellent that a paragraph recording its success is almost all that need be said, without repeating general expressions of praise concerning each member of the company. It is seldom that such an admirable representation is enjoyed in New-York; and, to our recollection, the finale to the first act has never been so forcibly and dramatically rendered here. An ensemble involving such a grand combination of power and precision is not often heard in the grand opera houses of London and Paris, and certainly was worthy of the best establishment in any other city. Mme. MEDORI, as Elvira, gave a fine dramatic reading to the part, and her large voice, except in certain forced passages, where it scarcely reached the limits of just intonation -- was heard to immense advantage. Signor MAZZOLINI sang as heretofore, with ease, finish and great power. Signor BELLINI, the baritone, made his rentree as Carl, and although barely recovered from the indisposition that veiled his voice on the opening night, sang with spirit, and demonstrated amply that he has a voice of the first class, and is an artist who understands thoroughly the dramatic scope of his role. This latter characteristic, we may mention, is the peculiar feature of Mr. MARETZEK's company -- all the singers seem to be actors, and enter thoroughly into the spirit of the scene.

The people of that State are not willing to be misunderstood on this subject. They have elected a Republican member of Congress in every district, and a strong Republican majority in the Legislature, which insures the election of a Republican Governor. The result is one of great importance. It indicates on the part of the people of the State a firm and settled purpose to stand by the Administration in its prosecution of the war. It is for Connecticut to speak next. The Democrats are making strong efforts to carry the State, but unless we are greatly mistaken they will meet a disastrous defeat. If they succeed they will certainly be entitled to put down that State as against the war.

It is full of expressions of fortitude and hope; but the writer has been led to the conclusion, from various indications, that a large portion, if not a majority, of the Northern people look with doubt upon the issue of, this struggle, and are ready to abandon it upon any, even dishonorable terms. He thinks that the prevalence of this idea in the army has weakened its courage and fortitude, robbed it of the holy aims which sanctified its early struggles, and prepared it for weak concessions. He says he is filled with rage and indignation that the grand efforts and sacrifices of the army should come to naught, and shipwreck come to the cause, through the cowardice, the weakness, the falsehood and the low ambition of our own people. He calls upon patriotic men to labor early and late to bring back the country once more to the high standard of virtue and confidence which has so often before swelled up like the ocean tides, and adds that a single manifestation of such an imperial and fast-fixed resolve to win would do more to secure the final triumph of our arms than a victory on the Rappahannock.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Army and the People.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Army and the People.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4296010-10f6-5938-aefe-b0682c80ba3f,693,nyt://article/e4296010-10f6-5938-aefe-b0682c80ba3f

It began at the very opening of the conflict, in the memorable applications to Chief Justice TANEY for the discharge of MERRIMAN and the other bridge-burners of Baltimore, summarily seized in the work of preventing the advance of the national troops to Washington. Gov. HICKS has recently averred in the Senate that the summary arrests of that period alone saved Maryland from going over to the Confederacy. The revolutionists of the State felt the pinch on the instant, and, like the precious champions of law that they were, flew to the Judges. They took nothing by the motion; but they and their allies all over the North have ever since continued their efforts to make something out of this judicial resort. Had they succeeded at first, they must have infallibly destroyed the Government.

Republicans, Democrats and Abolitionists, waiving all differences and giving up all party feeling on other points, must, on this point, ""become one party."" He admits that the Abolitionists, by their talking and writing, did much to annoy the South, but that neither this nor anything else justified the rebellion.

"A DANGEROUS ALTERATION OF GREENBACKS. -Yesterday afternoon a book-keeper at Earle's Hotel, in Canal-street, appeared at the Detective Office, Police Headquarters, and made complaint that a well dressed young man, apparently about 23 years of age, had, a few hours previously, passed upon him a bill purporting to be a $50 Government greenback. An examination of the note was made, when it appeared very evident that it had been quite ingeniously altered from a $2 greenback. When compared with a genuine $50 note, the cheat is quite apparent. In the centre of each of the genuine bills -- i.e. the twos and fifties -- there is a fine steel engraving, alike in all respects. This fact has doubtless suggested the idea of altering the twos. In the genuine fifties, however, the head is immediately between the word ""United"" and the word ""States,"" whereas in the ""twos"" the words are above the engraving. In addition to this, the $50 notes are covered over on the back with the number ""50,"" which is not the case in the altered notes. Four or five cases of this nature have recently come to the notice of the Police officers. With one exception, however, the rogues have escaped detection.

"By the steamship Anglo-Saxon, which arrived at Portland yesterday afternoon, we have advices from Europe one day later than by the City of Baltimore. She left Londonderry on the 27th. The most important news by this arrival relates to the Polish revolution. An engagement is reported to have taken place between the Poles and the Russians near Kutnow, seventy miles west of Warsaw, lasting nearly eight hours, in which the Russians were defeated, routed, and forced to take refuge on Prussian territory. Another report is, that Cossacks pursuing Polish fugitives on Austrian soil, had been pelted with stones by the people, and compelled to pass back over the frontier. Austria was expected to demand satisfaction of Russia for this violation of her territory. The Paris Constitutionnel thinks there need be no fears of a European war, as the understanding between France, England and Austria, regarding the Prussian intervention, is a sure guarantee of the maintenance of peace.

"The speculators in nickel have raised a storm among the noble army of crossing-sweepers, which promises to spread consternation throughout Wall-street, and its right-angular adjacents, and bring upon the daylight denizens of down-town an alarming increase in the cost of patent-leather and pantaloons. The number of juvenile crossing sweepers of both sexes and tender age, who adorn the public streets and clean the crossings during that large proportion of the year in which the presence of HACKLEY's contract renders their shovels and brooms necessary, is about equal to that of a full regiment. With these unclean cleaners times were moderately good while the nickel remained at par; when it became a drug in the market, peanuts and the Old Bowery were buoyant, and the barefooted knights of the broom were wallowing in metaphorcal clover. But darker days were in store for even these embryo contractors, they are upon them even now; for the plaintive cry for a penny is but seldom indulged in with success, and as for taking the pieces of presumptive printed pasteboard which presume to represent the payable penny of the past -- with which the pockets of their former patrons are plethorically packed -- they have not fallen so low yet, and they have determined to act, and act effectively. Seeing it in the papers that those engaged in other branches of honorable and productive employments are uniting for mutual protection, they have resolved to do likewise, and, in fact, have already made sufficient progress to afford ground for the gravest apprehensions on the part of those whom they incline to hold responsible for their calamities. Their meetings have not been open to the Press or the public generally, but enough is known to enable us to warn the holders of nickel to beware of the crossing-sweepers on muddy corners.

On Advent of Mob Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/13/archives/the-tables-turnedthe-albany-atlas.html,On Advent of Mob Law,"and Argus affects great alarm at the prospective advent of mob-law. It denounces the ""Republican-Abolition party,"" as it styles the supporters of the Admistration, as a ""party of mob rule; of reckless disregard of law; of intemperance, bigotry and violence,"" and among its specifications designed to sustain this absurd and sweeping censure, it says that ""the TIMES, a leading Republican organ, cites the story of the massacre of Royalists in the French Revolution, and impliedly urges the mob to break loose and murder all Democrats in the loyal States, before fighting the Southern rebels."" One knows not which most to pity, the intellectual imbecility which is compelled to resort to such balderdash in place of argument, or the reckless disregard of truth which permits it. There has never been a syllable in the TIMES which could give any candid man a shadow of warrant for imputing to it such a sentiment. Nor is there the slightest ground for the affected apprehensions of the Argus lest free speech should be suppressed by mob-law. Since the days when Democratic mobs, under party leaders, used to suppress, by force, the utterance of Anti-Slavery sentiments, public sentiment on this subject has decidedly improved. And now that the Democrats have become themselves the champions of free speech, it may be considered out of danger.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TABLES TURNED.--The Albany Atlas', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TABLES TURNED.--The Albany Atlas', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'ALBANY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b2c5f6a7-cb70-5e2f-9807-a922781df7a8,219,nyt://article/b2c5f6a7-cb70-5e2f-9807-a922781df7a8

a War with the Saints,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/13/archives/war-with-the-saints.html,a War with the Saints,"A telegram from Salt Lake City the other day made the announcement, unexpected by most people, that a collision between the military and the Mormon citizens or Utah was imminent -- that the Governor of the Territory had ordered the arrest of the Prophet, and that the Saints were in arms to prevent it. Our correspondence from Utah for some time past, has indicated that there was trouble brewing in that quarter. Gov. HARDING, during his brief term of office, has become very offensive, officially and personally, to the Mormons. His inaugural speech was directly in antagonism with their religions prejudices, social customs and political proclivities, and was especially severe upon polygamy. The Mormons were aroused. BRIGHAM YOUNG was wroth. The people convened at the Tabernacle, denounced the Gentile Governor, and demanded his removal, as well as that of the two Territorial Associate Justices. It is probable that latterly they have interfered with his exercise of his official functions, and he, being backed up by some regular troops, and by the regiment of California volunteers which recently defeated and exterminated the Hickup Indians in the battle on Bear River, thought proper to assert and maintain by force his legitimate authority. We suppose that thus far, nothing has come of the matter but a general row, for, though we have the telegraph to Salt Lake City, we have not had a dispatch since the beginning of the week. It is fortunate, indeed, that in such a crisis we have the Pacific telegraph -- for we can thus promptly render justice and make concession from Washington on the one hand, or, on the other, reinforce our Utah army from California, Nevada and Colorado, and prepare for war before the Mormons get the advantage of us.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'War With the Saints.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'War With the Saints.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Utah', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb296b66-30de-5467-872d-6911628fcb45,716,nyt://article/bb296b66-30de-5467-872d-6911628fcb45

It seems to us, and we think nine-tenths of the public will agree with us, that he ought for divers reasons to decline it. What office of State it is which he would fill with most credit to himself and most advantage to the country, we confess we are unable to say. But we know one office which he certainly cannot fill, either with credit or advantage, and that is, the office of Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of a first-class Power. Nature has indicated in the clearest manner, that she did not mean him to be a diplomatist, and his education has not been of a kind to lessen the force of her prohibition. To serve the Republic well in a diplomatic capacity at this crisis in her history, a man needs tact, discretion, judgment, a spirit of subordination, some knowledge of foreign languages, or at least of French, much knowledge of foreign life, and its manners and usages. He needs, above all things, to remember also that diplomacy, like war, is but a means to an end; that it is the art of keeping up the influence and protecting the rights and interests of one's Government by fair words, and skillful arguments, and dextrous play upon the passions and prejudices of those with whom one is dealing. He needs to remember that the resort on the part of an Ambassador to bullying, abuse or invective, is as absurd and as futile as knocking a man down with a cudgel in order to make him love you. Whenever the relations between two Powers assume such a character as to call for violent and threatening language, diplomacy, properly so-called, retires and makes way for the army and the fleet. The Minister shuts up his portfolio and goes home, and the General takes his place.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cassius M.

The point made by Mr. BLAIR is this: That it is not really a dismemberment of the Union that we have to fear as the permanent result of the pending war, but the overthrow of its vital principle -- the sovereignty of the people. The Union, in his opinion, is safe enough. The physical conformation of the country will defy all attempts to permanently dissever it. Its lakes and gulfs, its rivers and bays, its canals and other highways, ""bringing the seas to the homes of all the cultivators of the continent,"" renders the dissolution of the Union which grows out of the necessities of commerce ""as impossible as the destruction of the system provided by nature for that intercourse.""

It treats at large on the revolutionary spirit abroad. It says ""the times are fraught with events of startling magnitude."" It declares that, ""in the frenzy of the hour, new and startling dogmas are daily broached, and seem to enlist the support of a party in the country, just in proportion to their strangeness and novelty."" Having prepared the recipient of his epistolary favor for any absurdity, by these quite truthful preliminary statements, Col. WOOLFOLK proceeds to make his contribution to the ""startling dogmas"" of the frenzied hour.

They join with these, as we notice, something of the Chinese mode of warfare, to which they have shown themselves addicted heretofore. They do not, indeed, beat Chinese gongs, or put on hideous masks, or perform horrible contortions in front of our lines of battle; but the American gong, the newspaper, they bring into most vigorous use.

Mr. BRADY was followed by Gov. WRIGHT, of Indiana, and Gov. ANDY JOHNSON, of Tennessee, who were received with unbounded applause, and made out-and-out thorough-going war speeches.

We give this morning an account of it written by Admiral PORTER himself, another from a Vicksburgh paper, and a third from our own correspondent. ""ERICSSON,"" says PORTER, ""saved the country with an iron Monitor -- why could not I save it with a wooden one?"" The Richmond Examiner, however, in its description of the ""turreted monster,"" was wrong in characterizing it as a vessel with a ""small house taken from the back garden of a plantation"" on top of it. As described by its inventor, the monster was simply a broken down coal barge which was picked up in the river, with a few old boards run around it, some empty pork barrels piled on top of each other for smoke-stacks, and with furnaces built of mud, for the purpose of vomiting forth black smoke.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TURRETED MONSTER AGAIN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TURRETED MONSTER AGAIN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ca0de9b-6f91-5ba4-9087-0cb3b53c1eb9,598,nyt://article/9ca0de9b-6f91-5ba4-9087-0cb3b53c1eb9

His speech at Hartford, the other night must, we imagine, have sent a thrill of joy through every abode of sin and wretchedness throughout the length and breadth of the land. There is a popular notion that there is a large class of offences for which condemnation or pardon on this side of the grave is hopeless; and we none of us ever listen to five minutes' conversation upon the vanity of worldly things, without hearing men's hardness, uncharitableness and bitterness toward the victims of misfortune descanted upon as one of the most lamentable and notorious facts of this sorrowful life. There is, we are told, on all sides a disposition to accelerate the movement of persons who show any tendency downwards; a strong desire to keep down those who have once fallen, to treasure the memory of their fault, to doubt the sincerity of their repentance, and to predict their relapse. If the sinner's own conscience makes his way hard when he is sinning, his fellows make it harder when he is trying to amend; and vast numbers of those who are groping in darkness are said to prefer the horrors of their situation to facing the jeers and scoffings and scorn that would hail their reappearance in the light.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Case of Wonderful Assurance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Case of Wonderful Assurance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e1a48d7-6adf-53b8-8765-a3d4dcf819ba,1031,nyt://article/9e1a48d7-6adf-53b8-8765-a3d4dcf819ba

"Ayres, Brig.-Gen., deserved promotion of",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/16/archives/a-deserved-promotion.html,"Ayres, Brig.-Gen., deserved promotion of","-- Among the recent promotions to the post of Brigadier-General, none will give more universal satisfaction to all who appreciate sterling merit, than that of Capt. AYRES, who has commanded one or more batteries of artillery from the very commencement of the war, and who has rendered most distinguished service in nearly every battle that has been fought since the first gun was fired. He is an officer of rare merit and of still rarer modesty -- never obtruding his services or his claims on public attention, or on the notice of the official authorities; and one result of this has been, that while hundreds of officers who have rendered far less service were pushed rapidly forward to the very highest positions, he remained plain Captain AYRES, though for much of the time doing the duty of a Brigadier, but on a captain's pay. At the battle of Antietam he had six batteries under his command, and at the crisis of the engagement was sent for by Gen, MCCLELLAN, who asked him if he could take his artillery across a stream in front, and through some marshy ground which bordered it. ""Sir,"" was his reply, ""I can take my artillery wherever it is wanted."" He did take it where it was wanted, and where it carried fearful carnage into the rebel ranks. The Government cannot afford to leave such men in the rear ranks, merely because they will not push themselves forward for promotion.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A DESERVED PROMOTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A DESERVED PROMOTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ba2c1bc8-2e95-567e-8524-a3b6b42baf78,244,nyt://article/ba2c1bc8-2e95-567e-8524-a3b6b42baf78

Three evening performances and a matinee were given, the last a brilliant affair on Saturday, that attracted an overflowing representation of our New-York fair ones, and was in all respects eminently successful. The opera performed was ""Ernani"" -- one of the most pronounced of VERDI's works, and well calculated to show off the strength of the company. We have already referred to its production, and need only say, that its repetition was free from the usual nesligencies and omissions that characterize matinee performances. The artists were in superb voice, and combining suitable, and frequently powerful, action with their vocal vehemencies, brought down the house with legitimate bursts of applause. It is conceded now on all sides, that Mr. MARETZEK's troupe is the best we have had here for many years. The plan of the campaign, both as regards these leading artists and the important auxiliaries of orchestra and chorus, is on the largest scale. When it is remembered that, notwithstanding the increased expenses of the establishment, the prices remain at the lowest standard, it will be seen that the most genial support of the public is needed to make the experiment only moderately successful. The enthusiasm that prevails seems to promise the happiest results to the energetic impresairo. It will not be lessened by an entire change in the programme of the present week.

ROBERT BAIRD, D.D., died at Yonkers, on Sunday, March 15, in the 65th year of his age. Dr. BAIRD was of Scottish descent, and was born in Fayette County, Penn., on Oct. 6, 1798. He pursued his studies at Washington and Jefferson Colleges, and graduated at the latter in 1818. During the year following he was engaged in teaching at Bellefont, contributing frequently to the local newspaper published in that village. In 1819, be entered the Princeton Theological Seminary, and completed a full course there, discharging the duties of tutor in the college during the last year of his connection with the Seminary. After completing his theological studies, he took charge of an academy in Princeton, and held the situation for more than five years, preaching as opportunity offered in the churches of that city and vicinity, and upon resigning that position, in which he had acquitted himself with great credit, he commenced his labors in behalf of our prominent religious and benevolent societies, and in these he spent his life. First he proposed and carried into execution a plan for supplying each destitute family in New-Jersey with a copy of the Holy Scriptures; next, as agent of the Missionary Society of the state, he did much toward organizing its present educational system, and in 1829 he devoted his energies to the American Sunday School Union, in the course of five years increasing its revenues from $5,000 to $25,000 per annum. In 1835 Dr. BAIRD visited Europe, where he remained for nearly eight years, laboring zealously to promote different religious and benevolent enterprises, and upon the organization of the American and Foreign Christian Union he became its agent and Corresponding Secretary. Both by the pen and voice Dr. BAIRD has given the public the benefit of his experiences and observations in his extended European tour. The courses of lectures which he delivered all over the country, upon topics connected with his journeyings, were very popular and instructive. His work upon the ""State and Prospects of Religion in America"" had a foreign as well as domestic reputation, and his ""Visit to No. them Europe"" had a wide circulation in this country.

The experience of Surgeons on the field, and, after an engagement, in hospitals -- the facts that have come to their knowledge of the wounded remaining a night and day, and even for a longer period, upon the ground, without covering and without relief -- and their return to their homes in this and other States, and making known these facts -- naturally awaken inquiry and suggest remedies.

A report of the rebel Secretary of War, made a few weeks since, first brought to light the fact of a serious failure of the corn and wheat crops in the seceded States last year. The Commissary authorities at Richmond, right under the eye of the Confederate Government, lately seized a large quantity of flour at one of the City Mills. The flour was private property, manufactured for the use of families by a miller who had previously proposed to grind for the Government, but had been refused any share of its patronage. The seizure of this flour by Government officers created a stir in Richmond. It was a blow at private rights, and put every man's ability to subsist his own family at the mercy of the rebel Government. The owner of the mills at once reported his case to Gov. LETCHER, and invoked that official, who still claims to represent the proud and free Commonwealth of Old Virginia, to interpose in defence of the rights of her citizens. But Gov. LETCHER did not venture to do so. The doctrine of States' Rights has no more virtue or power in the South. It is a panoply that shields no longer. Gov. LETCHER contented himself with a spirited verbal protest (to the owner of the mills) against the injury he had suffered, and advised him to seek redress (by law, it is imagined,) against the individual officers who had despoiled him.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Food Question in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Food Question in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Food', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1232497f-e71e-5932-97c2-05b166873401,924,nyt://article/1232497f-e71e-5932-97c2-05b166873401

She left her home after dinner, leaving her daughter FANNY -- 5 years of age -- asleep, and had not returned when the fire was discovered. Before leaving, she had locked the doors. The flames soon enveloped the building, which was reduced to cinders. The little girl was burned to death. Her charred remains were discovered after the fire had been suppressed. His not known how the fire originated....About noon yesterday there was an alarm of fire in the Eighth Precinct, caused by an explosion in the house of Mr. PETER FLANNERY, situated in Twenty-first-street, near Third-avenue, Gowanus. It appears that FLANNERY had a can of wet powder, which he, injudiciously, placed by the side of a hot stove, to day. A neighbor, and his wife, and daughter three years of age, were in the room at the time. The fire communicating with the powder caused an explosion, the force of which blew out the front part of the house. The neighbor, named MCGUIRE, was considerably injured, and the little girl was so badly burned that her recovery is considered doubtful. Mr. FLANNERY and wife were but slightly injured. The house, which is a three-story frame, was very much shattered, and the firemen, in order to prevent further accident, pulled out the entire front and propped up the root so as to keep it from falling. The damage amounts to about $1,000....About 1 o'clock yesterday morning the iron foundry of Mr. MOORE, in Walton-street, near Flushing-avenue, was destroyed by fire. There was a large amount of prepared stock on hand, which, together with the machinery, was greatly damaged. The building is damaged to the extent of $2,800, and the loss on contents amounts to $5,000, mostly insured.... Two serious accidents occurred to firemen, in proceeding to some of the above fires. JAMES J. LAWRENCE, an exempt member of Hook and Ladder Company No. 2, was run over in Court-street last evening, and from all appearances, was dangerously jured. He was conveyed to the City Hospital. A member of Truck No. 1 was run over in Court-street, near Fourth-place, while running to the fire in Gowanus, and sustained a fracture of one leg.

The first time was immediately after the bombardment of Fort. Sumter by the rebels. The second is -- now. And if the unanimity at the present time is characterized by less of patriotic frenzy than possessed all hearts two years ago, it is not the less real, and is even more significant of triumph for the Union cause. Two years ago the millions of the North were moved by passion. A holy zeal for an insulted flag animated them, and they threw themselves forward upon a prepared and malignant foe with more ardor than discretion. Little account was made at the start of the possibility of repulse. Far too little care was observed in the preliminary organization and discipline of the ardent soldiers, who, in vaster numbers than the Government called for, went out under the flag of the Union. Never, since the days of Peter the Hermit, who aroused all Europe to a frenzied rush to Palestine, to rescue the Holy Sepulchre from Infidel sway, was such an outpouring of voluntary soldiers witnessed as that evoked by the rebel insults in Charleston harbor. But as the bones of the zealous but unprepared crusaders whitened the wayside of their toilsome and dangerous march, so did the graves of our enthusiastic volunteers mark their early invasions of the rebel States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'War for the Union--Past and Present.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'War for the Union--Past and Present.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4ff7ab61-3681-565a-9688-9fe7d38a4217,895,nyt://article/4ff7ab61-3681-565a-9688-9fe7d38a4217

"Election, The",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/19/archives/the-connecticut-election.html,"Election, The","This election excites greater interest in view of the fact that it is the first one in a Free State in which the peace issue has been clearly put forth and accepted. In NewYork, and in every other Northern State, the Anti-Administration party made their fight on the ground that the Administration was mismanaging and unnecessarily protracting the war; that it had assumed undue powers in the matter of arrests; and that its Anti-Slavery measures were unwise and unwarrantable. But they made no demonstration against the war itself. They expressly declared themselves not only in favor of it, but for its more vigorous prosecution. The resolutions of the Anti-Administration Convention in this State, which nominated Gov. SEYMOUR, declared that ""the present deplorable civil strife has been forced upon the country by the Disunionists of the Southern States now in arms against the constitutional Government;"" and that ""they will continue to render the Government their sincere and united support in the use of all legitimate means to suppress the rebellion. And Gov. SEYMOUR, in his speech in Brooklyn, during the canvass, said: ""They (the rebels) have not contented themselves with the ballot, but have chosen the bayonet and the bullet to settle the question; then with the bayonet and the bullet we must meet them. The men of the South made the bayonet and the sword the arbiters of their doctrine, and, so far as the present is concerned, the sword must be the arbiter, and by it, with our strong arms, we will strike vigorous blows for the life of the Constitution and the flag."" The resolutions of the Connecticut Convention, which nominated the other Gov. SEYMOUR, on the other hand, declared that ""the time has now arrived when all true lovers of the Constitution are ready to abandon the monstrous fallacy that the Union can be restored by the armed hand,"" and that ""the Democracy of Connecticut pledge themselves to unite in all honorable measures having in view the cessation of hostilities between the North and the South."" And Mr. SEYMOUR, the selected candidate for Governor, in his speech at Hartford, during the canvass, said: ""We have gone far enough in an unprofitable and cruel struggle. It is time to sheath the sword and spare mankind. It is not by force of arms that we are to have another Union, but by force of reason.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Connecticut Election.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Connecticut Election.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Connecticut', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64d20557-199e-5764-9d60-c692c9948741,1322,nyt://article/64d20557-199e-5764-9d60-c692c9948741

FIELD addressed the Board of Brokers in Beaver-street, yesterday afternoon, upon the subject of the Atlantic Telegraph -- the present condition aad prospects of the enterprise. His remarks were substantially the same as those made the day before at the Produce Exchange. He spoke of the manifold advantages, political, social, and financial, that would result from the successful laying of a telegraphic cable between this country and England, and expressed the opinion that the enterprise was now certain to be carried out. He read a letter from ELLIOTT, GLASS & CO., the English cable manufacturers, in which they expressed the utmost confidence that a cable could be laid down between Ireland and Newfoundland, and as an evidence of the faith that is in them, offered to take $150,000 worth of the stock. With reference to the profitable nature of the investment -- supposing the cable to be laid -- nothing could be surer. The telegraph to San Francisco had returned to the stockholders the entire amount of their subscriptions in less than a year, and the demand for this line was not a tithe of that for a line across the Atlantic. Supposing twelve words per minute to be transmitted by the Atlantic telegraph during the twenty-four hours, the receipts would be (reckoning 62 cents per word) nearly $4,000,000 per annum, or over $1,000,000 more than the required estimate for laying down the cable. In answer to a question, Mr. FIELD said that subscriptions for the enterprise in England amounted, at the last advices, to £205,000; those of this counrty to £27,500, and the estimated cost of the work was £600,000, although it was doubtful if more than one-half of this sum would be required.

The testimony given upon the inquest all tends to show that a freight train on the New-York and New Haven Railroad was running toward this City on Sunday morning last, and that when the train was between Melrose and Mott Haven, the engineer observed a man just ahead of the locomotive, in the act of rolling down an embankment toward the track. The engineer did all he could to stop the train, but the man was passed over before the cars became stationary. The engineer and other employes on the road were all under the impression that the victim had been struck by the locomotive; they, therefore, stopped the train and went back to gather up the remains. To their astonishment, they found the man in a sitting posture upon the track. When addressed by one of his countrymen, he stated that he had not been run over, but that he had been shot by the locomotive can, (meaning the engineer,) and no suggestions which were made could in any degree after his opinions in regard to his having been shot. He was found to be seriously injured, and was therefore conveyed to Bellevue Hospital, where he died on Tuesday night. Dr. BOUTON made a post-mortem examination of the body yesterday afternoon. No external injuries, except some slight abrasions on the nose and hands were to be found. The only theory that can be given as to his death is that the victim was walking beside the railroad track, when the train came along. He tried to climb up the embankment out of danger and in doing so fell backwards. The current of air created by the passing train gave him a shock from which he never recovered. This sudden shock doubtless gave him the idea that he had been shot by the engineer, which idea he entertained up to the time of his death.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Singular and Fatal Accident on the New-York and New-Haven Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Singular and Fatal Accident on the New-York and New-Haven Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/92d7d1f6-019d-590b-91ee-3899d3173c16,346,nyt://article/92d7d1f6-019d-590b-91ee-3899d3173c16

The second report is, that the rebels attacked Newbern, N.C., last Friday, and were defeated. This is also likely. The rebels, supposing that the withdrawal of troops from Gen.

The third report -- and this comes from the Richmond papers of the 17th -- is that, on the 14th, Admiral FARRAGUT attacked Port Hudson, and was repulsed, with the loss of the steam-frigate Mississippi burnt and his flag-ship disabled. It is also stated that the land force did not join in the attack. This story, as told, is very unlikely, though it probably has some little foundation. Our latest advices direct from New-Orleans are to the 8th inst., at which time the movement against Port Hudson had not commenced, though it was expected soon The rebel report of the repulse of Admiral FARRAGUT undoubtedly grows out of a naval reconnoissance of the rebel position, preliminary to the grand combined attack by our land as well as naval forces.

In addition to her former gifts, she bequeathed the sum of $80,000 for the maintenance in the Dudley Observatory, which she established, of a scientific chair to be known as the ""Blandina Professorship."" This puts the institution in an excellent position, monetarily considered, giving it a permanent endowment of $80,000, which is safely invested, and yields an annual income of $5,600. The Observatory is now well supplied with astronomical instruments of unsurpassed excellence, some of which our Albany correspondent describes this morning. In short, the buildings, grounds and instruments, the management, the professors' chairs and the endowment, are all now highly honorable to America, to science, and to the noble, lady whose munificence founded the institution, which, we trust, will be sustained for ages. Mrs. DUDLEY gives expression in her testament to the belief that the Observatory ""is destined yet to realize the hopes of its early friends and founders in the sure but modest elevation of American science;"" and every one who appreciates the worth of science, and the incalculable value of such institutions as this in advancing it, will join in the hope that her faith and charity may, in time, find their full fruition.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.-', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DUDLEY OBSERVATORY.-', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d711fc2f-610e-5465-b9f0-6c2764ea8ff1,224,nyt://article/d711fc2f-610e-5465-b9f0-6c2764ea8ff1

"ALLEGED MURDER.--On Sunday last an Irishman, named JAMES KELLET, was found lying on the Hunterfly Road, beyond the city line, suffering from injuries sustained, as then supposed, by falling with his head upon some sharp stones, while in a state of intoxication.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/19/archives/brooklyn-news-the-bark-sarah-nichols-chased-by-the-florida.html,,"ALLEGED MURDER. -- On Sunday last an Irishman, named JAMES KELLET, was found lying on the Hunterfly Road, beyond the city line, suffering from injuries sustained, as then supposed, by falling with his head upon some sharp stones, while in a state of intoxication. Mr. GARRETT STOOTHOFF, who discovered him, put him on his wagon, with the aid of a lady and gentleman passing at the time, and conveyed him to the farm-yard of Mr. VANDERBERG, where he left him. The face of the injured man was bleeding badly, and there was blood on and about the stones. Mr. STOOTHOFF asked him where he lived, and he answered that he did not know. He did not complain of any person striking him. Just before Mr. STOOTHOFF arrived at the spot where KELLET was lying, he met four colored men, named JOHN JACKSON, HENRY JACKSON, SAMUEL JACKSON and FREDERICK JOHNSON. The first-named had a pair of skates. They were laughing, and seemed very merry. KELLET died of his injuries during the night, and an inquest was held on Monday, resulting in a verdict that deceased died of injuries sustained by a fall while in a state of intoxication. Some circumstances having come to light showing that the man, so far from falling and injuring himself, had been knocked down and beaten, the body was sent to the County Hospital for further investigation. The inquest was renewed and the evidence elicited was to the effect that KELLET came to the store of JOHN F. KOCH, on the Hunterfly road, town of New-Lotts, on Sunday morning. The three JACKSONS and JOHNSON, with some white men, were present. Mr. KOCH exhibited a pair of skates for sale, and soon after a conversation took place about gloves. The deceased, after purchasing a paper of tobacco, left. A pair of gloves belonging to JOHN JACKSON, and the skates were missing, and KELLET was at once suspected of having taken them. The negroes pursued him, and JOHN JACKSON, over-taking him, struck him two or three times, knocking him down, and kicked him while down. The skates and gloves were recovered, and the negroes returned to the store where they related their exploits, and JACKSON, who is a powerful fellow, threatened to whip any man who told of the transaction. He was not aware however, at the time that he had injured KELLET so severely that his life was in danger. When he ascertained that KELLET was dead he and his companions left the neighborhood, but were subsequently arrested by the Forty-ninth Precinct Police, and committed to await the result of the second inquest. The post-mortem examination of the body proved that there was a lacerated wound on the left eye of deceased, extending deeply in, with a fracture of the lower border of the maxillary bone; a vertical cut in the upper lip, three-fourths of an inch in length; a punctured wound in the right lower jaw, extending over an inch, and several abrasions on the left side of the face. There was effusion of blood upon the brain, and the fracture of the maxillary bone extended down through the bone of the face to the antram. All the other organs were in good health. The cause of death was compression of the brain, which might have been produced by kicks and blows. Two men, named KOCH and HARTMAN, who served upon the first jury, gave as the reason for not stating the facts as they knew them, that they were afraid of the negroes. The Coroner's jury brought in the following verdict : ""That the said JAMES KELLET came to his death by compression of the brain, superinduced by injuries inflicted by JOHN JACKSON, on the morning of the 15th of March, 1863, and that HENRY JACKSON and SAMUEL JACKSON aided and abetted in the attack. We also find that JOHN F. KOCH and WM. HARTMAN knew all the circumstances of and concealed the cause of death of said JAMES KELLET, and placed themselves on the jury, thereby assisting in covering up the facts connected with said KELLET's death."" The parties implicated were committed to answer. The two jurymen were released on ball.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; The Bark Sarah Nichols Chased by the Florida.

To wear a hat during two consecutive seasons would be so great a trial to any one of them, that we feel it our bounded duty to chronicle the fact that all the milliners of the City are bountifully supplied with any quantity of new bonnets of new styles -- if anything, a touch and a half beyond that which has reigned supreme in ugliness during the Winter. Whether it will be a possibility for gentlemen at church or opera to see anything that may be in pulpit or on stage, we regard as entirely a matter of doubt; in fact, so high have the fronts gone up, that, with the exception of some of the fancy stocks on Wall-street, we know of no parallel in altitude.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SPRING FASHIONS.; Opening Day in New-York.

There was a simplicity and originality and fresh flavor of the groves about it, which led us to imagine that it was one of those droppings of wisdom which Mr. BROOKS heard when sitting round the stumps of the South, in one of those delightful communities, where the workings of the human mind are not trammeled by the arts of reading and writing. But whatever its origin, we all received it with the deference and humility which Northern barbarians like ourselves owe to the academicians of North Carolina and Mississippi. The great cure for our miserable condition, the bottle that was to purge the North of all its peccant humors, and make it fit company for our clear-skinned healthy ""brethren of the South,"" was ""self-restraint."" We were deliberately and carefully to avoid touching either in the pulpit or on the platform, or in the Press, upon the subject of Slavery; we were, as Mr. SAMUEL J. TILDEN warned us, to treat and consider Slavery in the Southern States absolutely as if it were Slavery in Brazil or Cuba, and preserve a profound silence about it in all its bearings. The South, however, was not, under this arrangement, to act toward us as if it were Brazil or Cuba. It was still to be at liberty to bring bills about Slavery into our Congress, to make speeches in its glorification, to seize slaves in our streets, and employ our soldiers in protecting slave property in our Territories, and our Ambassadors in preaching the Slavery gospel in foreign parts.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Doctrine of Self-Restraint.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Doctrine of Self-Restraint.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4dc79630-a80c-5d22-9bae-b3054be67b5b,964,nyt://article/4dc79630-a80c-5d22-9bae-b3054be67b5b

The Improved Efficiency of Our,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/20/archives/our-cavalry.html,The Improved Efficiency of Our,"-- The improved efficiency and spirit of our cavalry was admirably illustrated by the gallant fight they made on Monday on the Rappahannock. From the descriptions given by our correspondents yesterday and today; it would appear that the affair was one of the most daring, dashing and successful we have had in the war. As in the case of the cavalry fight reported by ROSECRANS in his army the other day, AVERILL's men used their sabres freely upon the rebels, and taught them a lesson which they have long needed. They have always vaunted of the prowess of their horsemen; and their various successful raids during the war have given them at least a show of ground on which to base their claims. We think, however, that such exploits as those of ZAGONYI, CARTER, PLEASANTON, MINTY and AVERILL quite equal, and some of them far surpass anything that the rebels have ever done. We are glad to see such dashes as these. They hold the enemy in check and keep him on the defensive, beside their effect in inspiriting our own army. Our cavalry will continue to be of more and more use as the main armies of the rebels are beaten and driven back, and it should be kept in the highest state of efficiency by continual work.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR CAVALRY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR CAVALRY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/624b6b56-33f1-59b9-8c0f-697c6ee2041e,219,nyt://article/624b6b56-33f1-59b9-8c0f-697c6ee2041e

Dr. CHRISTOPHER WELTJE was immediately called to attend the injured man, but medical aid was of no avail, as death ensued soon afterward. LAUNDRESS was promptly arrested by Officer COYLE, of the Twenty-seventh Precinct, and locked up to await the result of the Coroner's inquisition. The knife with which the fatal wound was inflicted, was subsequently found in the rear yard of prisoner's premises, and identified as belonging to LAUNDRESS. Coroner WILDEY was notified, and will hold an inquest upon the body at 10 o'clock this morning, at the Twenty-seventh Precinct Station-house in Cedar-street. Dis. BOUTON and WELTJE made a post-mortem examination yesterday afternoon. They found one stab of a serious nature in the left arm, and another in the right side. This is the one which, doubtless, produced his death. The knife had entered between the eighth and ninth ribs, and then passed through into the right lobe of the liver, causing a frightful wound. It has been ascertained that the deceased had been in this country but a short time, he having arrived a few weeks ago from Ireland. He immediately put up at the boarding-house kept by LAUNDRESS. A few days ago the latter turned him away from his premises, on account of some quarrel between them. On Thursday evening deceased returned, and LAUNDRESS was obliged to call in a policeman to eject him from the house. Later in the evening he again returned when the quarrel ensued which resulted in KANE's death.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2e76460e-dac2-5498-bbd9-9dbc7c826c08,728,nyt://article/2e76460e-dac2-5498-bbd9-9dbc7c826c08

Yesterday morning it became evident that the fraud had been practiced to a greater extent than was at first supposed. Five persons -- the most of them Wall-street brokers or their clerks -- appeared before Justice DOWLING, at the Tombs, and made oath that a man named GEORGE PARK had been guilty of passing upon each of them one of the spurious notes. One of them was passed upon the firm of WHITE. MORRISON & Co., No. 29 Wall-street; one upon GWYNNE & DAY, No. 21 Wall-street, and one upon EDWARD LIVERMORE, No. 40 Wall-street. PARK attempted to pass one at No. 33 Wall, and also one at the banking office of ISHI CRAVEN, NO. 17 Wall-street. At the latter place it appears that the note was suspected, and the broker in charge of the office sent it out for examination. It was soon returned with the information that it was a counterfeit. PARK was therefore detained a few minutes until an officer came and took him into custody. Upon his preliminary examination yesterday afternoon. PARK stated that he had received these bills in the ordinary course of business, and had no idea that they were bad; he further stated that he was a merchant of 20 years' standing, and would not for any amount of money, knowingly, endanger his reputation. He was then committed for a further examination. The Police authorities have in the meantime received dispatches from Boston, Philadelphia, Washington and other places, to the effect that bold attempts have just been made to put into circulation these $500 counterfeit notes.

"Accounts from Berlin state that the note of M. DE LHUYS, which was communicated by the French Ambassador to Count BISMARK, insists that Prussia shall keep within the limits of neutrality, and proposes a diplomatic intervention at St. Petersburgh. M. BISMARK told the French Ambassador that the arrangement with Russia was purely a military one; that it was not contemplated to send troops into Russian Poland; that the Russians could only pass the frontier after consulting the Prussian authorities; and that the progress of events in Poland justified the hope that the Convention would cease to be applied. In any case, it was said, Prussia was not pledged to depart from the principles of non-intervention, although neutrality could not be spoken of in a question of insurrection. The military measures taken on such a large scale by the Prussian authorities, are perfectly justified by the character of the insurrection, as well as by the great interest which Prussia has in restraining the Polish movement. Prussia only wishes to defend her frontier. At the same time she will do all she can to prevent the insurgents from drawing succors of men, arms, and ammunition from the Prussian provinces. As to the diplomatic intervention with the Russian cabinet, Prussia does not believe she can participate in it, as such an act, would be equivalent to lending a moral support to the insurrection. The English Ambassador, Mr. BUCHANAN, is said to have made similar remarks to those of the French Minister. A letter from Berlin says, however, that Mr. BUCHANAN, after having condemned the Convention, ""expressed the strong desire of the English Cabinet that Prussia should stop in this path, otherwise it was possible that France would decide to intervene energetically, and in case of war, England could not depart from her neutrality toward France, as public opinion, and that of the English Parliament, had pronounced very strongly against the policy of Prussia, which is endangering the peace of Europe.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/22/archives/the-polish-question.html,,"Accounts from Berlin state that the note of M.

And the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/22/archives/kentucky-and-the-war.html,And the War,"Several indications of late observed in Kentucky inspire more hope in the permanent Unionism of that State than we have ever previously had. We have never denied to the loyal people of Kentucky full praise for their fidelity and genuine heroism, under very great difficulties. At the beginning of the rebellion BERIAH MAGOFFIN was Governor of the State, a political adherent of JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE, and undoubtedly possessed of the rebel proclivities of the apostate Vice-President. The Legislature was nearly balanced, and the tendencies of the public mind were all apparently toward the rebellion. SIMON BOLIVAR BUCKNER, arch traitor that he was, was placed in command (by MAGOFFIN and the Legislature,) of the State Guard of Kentucky, and the first idea of duty taught to this Guard was, that they were to defend the sacred soil of Kentucky against the tread of any armed Federal force, though called out to defend the Constitution, the Union and the laws! Add to these facts the presence of a quarter of a million of slaves in Kentucky, and the prevalence of a despotic Pro-Slavery sentiment that had long before trampled out every humanizing thought of gradual emancipation taught in other days by HENRY CLAY, and let any candid Northern man answer whether the chances did not seem a hundred to one, or a thousand to one, against holding Kentucky to the Union.

A Guardian Angel of Connecticut,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/22/archives/connecticuts-guardian-angels.html,A Guardian Angel of Connecticut,"Connecticut enjoys one advantage over the rest of the Union, which may tend to bad feeling between her and the other States, if she continues to retain it. In nearly every important canvass she is blessed with the ministrations of FERNANDO WOOD, of this City, and she is, we believe, the only State -- New-York, of course, excepted -- upon whom this eminent political philosopher makes his light to shine. What it is about Connecticut which incites his interest we have been unable to discover, after an attentive consideration both of her laws and manners. But whatever it be, it is certain that whenever an important election is at hand, he flies over the border, and distributes warning, reproof and encouragement with a prodigality which is well calculated to make the Connecticut people desire that elections occurred oftener. We could wish that Mr. WOOD were not so exclusive in the distribution of his wisdom, for the sake of the rest of the Union, but we have the consolation of knowing that though his partiality may exasperate other States, it can only draw closer the bonds of Union between us and ""the land of steady habits.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Connecticut's Guardian Angels"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Connecticut's Guardian Angels"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b0ce9cd7-41ff-5bba-a442-e272ae964248,973,nyt://article/b0ce9cd7-41ff-5bba-a442-e272ae964248

SUMNER, will be mourned by the whole land. A soldier from his youth, and continuously in the military service of his country, throughout his whole career he stood forth as the very noblest embodiment of what an American officer and patriot should be. Brave as a lion, chivalrous and pure, frank, honest earnest, of fine intelligence and perfect fidelity, of manly mould, courteous and kindly manner, clear-headed, clear-eyed and generous-hearted, devoted unto death to his flag and his country, he has furnished in his military life, of nearly half a century, an admirable illustration of all these qualities. He had been in service all over the Continent -- on the Great Plains of the West, fighting the hostile savages, yet avoiding by his skill and generosity more battles than he ever fought -- in Mexico, where under SCOTT, he commanded at the most famous cavalry actions of that war -- in Kansas, where by his firmness, justice and humanity, he brought to an end a fierce local contest, which, seven years ago, threatened to overspread the country -- on the coast of the Pacific -- and, latterly, in Virginia, in the Army of the Potomac, whose fortunes he followed just one year, but in all of whose battles, from Yorktown to Fredericksburgh, he was a prominent and heroic participator. At the last-mentioned battle, it will be remembered, Gen. BURNSIDE, fearing that his impetuous valor would impel him to rush with his men into the very jaws of the enemy's batteries, and that thus his invaluable advice to him and his invaluable services to the country would be lost, compelled him to stay on this side of the river; but as the smoke and thunder of the battle rolled up, and he could see his old division battling with fearful odds, the lion soul rose within him, so that it was only the most peremptory orders of his chief that could restrain him.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Gen.

P., D. D.; Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church; Green, Prof. William Henry; The Pentateuch Vindicated from the Aspersions of Bishop Colenso","Up to this time the Spring season has been one rather of promise than of performance among publishers. Many causes have retarded the issue of books now in various stages of preparation. Principal among these is the enhanced cost, not merely of paper, but of all the other materials (binders' board, muslin, &c.) that enter into the mechanical construction of a book. Some relief was hoped for from the action of Congress on the paper duties, but the reduction which was carried of 15 per cent. from the former rates is of no practical effect in the existing state of the exchange market, and as a benefit to the book and newspaper publishers, is merely illusory. It results from these increased prices that a volume formerly manufactured for 30 cents, cannot now be produced for less than from 45 to 48 cents, thereby demonstrating the necessity of a corresponding addition to the former scale of retail prices, to which it was feared the public were hardly ready to respond. The general ease of circumstances, arising from an abundant supply of money, has, however, shown that this apprehension was unfounded, and publishers are now eager to mee the buoyant demand for really good sterling literature, as a glance at their numerous announcements will prove. Messrs. HARPERS, beside a host of minor works, have just ready KINGLAKE's History of the Crimean War -- a book that has excited a more vivid sensation abroad than any publication since Lord MACAULAY's England -- and the able and exhaustive work on Japan, The Capital of the Tycoon, a Narrative of Three Years' Residence, by Sir RUTHERFORD ALCOCK, the first English Minister to that country. The important scientific subjects connected with man, his fate on this earth, his position in the series of animated beings, his typical forms and varieties of species, receive ample discussion in Sir CHARLES LYELL's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, Prof. HUXLEY's Man's Place in Nature, and Mr. CHARLES BRACE's Races of the Old World, a Manual of Ethnology, to be published respectively by Messrs. G.W. CHILDS, (of Philadelphia,) APPLETON & CO., and C. SCRIBNER. The latter publisher will also soon issue an edition of the New Testament, with explanatory notes or scholia, by Prof. HOWARD CROSBY, late of New-Brunswick, who has just accepted the pastorate of the Fourth-avenue Church, New-York. Among the great historical works promised, which we hope in due time to introduce to our readers, is D'AUBIGNE's History of Calvin and his work of Reformation in the Church, printed from advance sheets furnished by the author to Messrs. ROBERT CARTER & BROTHERS. MERIVALE's able and scholarly History of the Romans under the Empire, to be brought out in superior style by Messrs. APPLETON, and a translation of Gen.

There are glimpses of the inside condition of affairs at all the points of interest -- Richmond, Charleston, Vicksburgh, the Yazoo, the Mississippi and Middle Tennessee. The Richmond papers continue to be greatly exercised at the position of the loyal conservatives of the North. The Dispatch says: ""Of the two classes of our mortal foemen at the North, there is little to choose;"" but it adds that ""EDWARD EVERETT and CALEB CUSHING are to be despised and execrated more than PHILLIPS or GARRISON;"" and, in a high chivalric tone, decides that ""no man of honor could take EVERETT or CUSHING by the hand, the latter especially."" At the same time we learn that the garroters who infested the city in which this pink of chivalry and mirror of honor dwells, have flitted, but that their place has been taken by a ""jolly set of well-dressed Baltimore burglars,"" who are often arrested with ""jimmies"" in their pockets, -- that drunken men, in the uniform of Confederate officers, are daily seen in the streets, and the theatres are infested with drunken chivalry, -- that a regular fist-fight occurred in Capitol-square in the presence of hundreds of ladies, no effort being made to separate the pugilists, who fought it out, -- that the number of dens where the vilest of ""apple brandy"" is sold is astonishing -- that at every bar hangs a card upon which is printed ""Blockade, 75 cents,"" and that a small wine glassful is measured out for one ""blockade."" The question might arise, if one wine glassful or ""blockade"" of the ""vilest apple brandy"" costs 75 cents, what is the number and cost of the ""blockades"" required to make a rebel officer or ""man of honor"" drunk, and how many drunks would it require to degrade either of them to the level of ""taking by the hand EDWARD EVERETT or CALEB CUSHING, the latter especially?"" But such questions are quite out of place under the circumstances. Another extract says that hot coffee in Richmond is sold at the restaurants for one dollar per cup -- or ""blockade,"" we suppose. It is evident that the people of Richmond must either be blessed with tremendous piles of money, or must be rather scant in their ""blockades,"" whether of the inebriating cup or the cup that cheers without inebriating. We judge the former must be the case, as the streets and theatres are described as daily infested with reeling drunkards. Probably the standard for judging a ""man of honor"" in the South is the amount of money one has on hand; and if so, we do not wonder at their refusing to shake hands with our Northern Conservatives, for few of them could afford to get happy were liquor sold at Richmond rates.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Peep Over the Lines.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Peep Over the Lines.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c0573a8-2f8d-50f2-819c-cb706f149d01,817,nyt://article/1c0573a8-2f8d-50f2-819c-cb706f149d01

Thus, for instance, a so-called Democrat introduces into the Legislature of Indiana a resolution demanding an armistice, while another introduces into the Legislature of Ohio a resolution that ""we will have no armistice.""

These dispatches contain the first reliable intelligence received regarding Admiral FARRAGUT'S operations at Port Hudson. Though very brief, they are sufficient to show that the rebel reports of the affair of the 14th were much exaggerated, though in some respects true. A dispatch from CHARLES S. BULKLEY, Assistant Superintendent of the Military Telegraph in the Gulf Department, states that the Admiral, leading in the Hartford, attacked the Port Hudson batteries at 11 o'clock at night; that the firing on both sides was rapid and severe, and that the Mississippi ran aground, was abandoned and burned. Another dispatch, received at the New-England rooms in this City, states that the Admiral passed the Port Hudson batteries with his fleet -- all but the Mississippi, which suffered the fate above indicated.

The splendid chapter in Les Miserables which describes the battle of Waterloo, is marred in several places by the author's absurd speculations upon what might have happened, if certain things had not happened; if the peasant that guided the Prussian column had lost his way, if NAPOLEON had not had a pain in his stomach, or if it had not rained. There must be a good deal that is fascinating about this sort of intellectual diversion, or a man of HUGO's resources would certainly not be tempted to indulge in it; and we know as a matter of fact, that for the mass of twaddling moralists, and cheap philosophers and metaphysicians, it has irresistible attractions. Its greatest charm lies in the circumstance that anybody, no matter how slender his stock of knowledge, or how limited his capacity, can indulge in it to his heart's content without the slightest fear of refutation or contradiction. He has only to provide himself with an emperor or a general or statesman and a piece of orange-peel or a badly-baked pie, and he has, forthwith, the fate of mankind in his hands, and can mold it at his leisure without let or hindrance. The emperor has only to step on the orange-peel and fracture his thigh and die of gangrene, or the general has only to eat the pie before breakfast on the morning of battle and be led off the field suffering from severe griping, and two or three kingdoms, or all Christendom, fall into the philosopher's hands for rearrangement and redistribution. Or he may, if he is ambitious, eschew orange-peel or pie -- though effects produced by these trifles are by far the most striking -- and by supposing great and decisive victories to have been crushing defeats, by supposing whole nations to have said Aye when they actually said No, by supposing statesmen to have known things which at the time it was impossible for them to know, or supposing them to have done things which at the time would have seemed very foolish, though they now look wise -- he at once gets the",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What If Your Uncle Had Been Your Aunt?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What If Your Uncle Had Been Your Aunt?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36e2b6b7-9282-5d95-b9b8-f8637a5fd334,994,nyt://article/36e2b6b7-9282-5d95-b9b8-f8637a5fd334

"And Port Hudson, the Siege of",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/26/archives/the-mississippi-vicksburgh-and-port-hudson.html,"And Port Hudson, the Siege of","The siege of Port Hudson by the army and navy of Gen. BANKS may be said to have begun. Vicksburgh and Port Hudson, both on the east bank of the Mississippi River, 230 miles apart, and forming the two great final points of rebel defence on the Father of Waters, are both virtually invested by armies and navies of great magnitude and power. The military situation at each of these points is in some respects alike, in others it differs. At Port Hudson the Union army, under Gen. BANKS, is on this side of the river; at Vicksburgh the Union army under Gen. GRANT, is on the opposite side of the river to the objective point. At Port Hudson, the fleet is below the city; at Vicksburgh, it has been above the city. The strategy of Gen. BANKS aims to getting in the rear of Port Hudson with his land force, while FARRAGUT's vessels cooperate in front. The strategy of Gen. GRANT aims to flank Vicksburgh from the north with both his army and navy, or at least part of them, while another part may operate in front. It would seem from the rebel dispatch we gave the other day, to the effect that our forces had attacked Helena, which is a village twenty-five miles east of Port Hudson, that Gen. BANKS succeeded admirably in his first manoeuvre, and the subsequent dispatch, by way of New-Orleans, that he had got within five miles of Port Hudson, would indicate that the movement was progressing satisfactorily. The news from Gen. GRANT's flanking force, military and naval, for the last few days, has also been, on the whole, eminently cheering; and the official dispatch we publish this morning from Commander PENNOCK, opens up brighter prospects of success than we have ever yet had. It would seem from this and the unofficial dispatches, that one, or perhaps two new routes have been discovered by which our fleet can get into the Yazoo River, and consequently to the rear of Haines' Bluff and Vicksburgh.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mississippi Vicksburgh and Port Hudson.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Mississippi Vicksburgh and Port Hudson.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/35ab8c79-b637-505e-a249-37a83ca18c23,968,nyt://article/35ab8c79-b637-505e-a249-37a83ca18c23

"The news from Vicksburgh and vicinity this morning is of a very important character. Dispatches to the Navy Department announce that Admiral FARRAGUT's flag-ship, the Hartford, was below Warrenton on the 20th. This confirms the report received by way of New-Orleans, that she had succeeded in passing the rebel batteries at Port Hudson. It is announced further, however, that she is the only one of the fleet which did succeed in passing them. Admiral FARRAGUT's Secretary was on his way to communicate with Admiral PORTER. We have also an official statement of the discovery of the new passage into the Yazoo River, described in yesterday's TIMES. An interesting account of the movement through this passage will be found in our letter from Vicksburgh. The Carondclet, commanded by Capt. MCLEOD MURPHY, took the lead, and finding the way practicable -- or, rather making it so by cutting away the branches of the trees -- was immediately followed by a number of other gunboats and troop-transports. Admiral PORTER himself accompanied the fleet, on board the captured gunboat Gen. Price. The water was found of ample depth through the whole course of eighty miles. A rebel engineer was captured at Sunflower Lake, who gave information that there were at Yazoo City thirty steamers of large size, and 6,000 troops, with a battery of six guns. Gen. GRANT had put in motion a large body of National troops, and it was his intention, in conjunction with Admiral PORTER, to surprise and capture the entire rebel force there. Our latest intelligence from the Yazoo Pass Expedition is to the effect that it had come to a stand-still before the rebel batteries at Greenwood, waiting for reinforcements.

"The rapidity and steadiness with which Mr. MARETZEK steps from one success to another, is a good proof that his artists are of the class that can be depended on for all kinds of work. On Monday last, Mme. MEDORI achieved the greatest triumph of the season, winning for the opera of ""Norma"" a new vitality. The performance was so excellent throughout, that it has been universally pronounced to be the best ever given in America -- a statement which probably exceeds the requirements of truth, but indicates clearly the supreme excellence of the occasion that brought it forth. After a success in a part so vehement as the Druidess, it was a bold, and even hazardous venture for Mme. MEDORI to essay a role so completely different in all its requirements as Linda, in the opera of ""Linda di Chamounix,"" produced here last night, yet it was completely successful. In the first act, to be sure, it is necessary to extend some of ""the great charities of the imagination"" to the lady. Her appearance, always charming and lady-like, is scarcely petite or picturesque enough for the village maiden, who, on the stage at all events, is a very dainty creature, and in this City has been charmingly impersonated. In the second act all disadvantages of this kind had disappeared,and in every portion of the work, except the trivial scenes with the Marquis, there was no musical inability on the part of the lady. In the second act, indeed, the dramatic points were so grandly incorporated with the vocal ones that we doubt if its touching duo finale has ever been heard to greater advantage. Mme. MEDORI sang, indeed, with superb feeling and nicety. Dramatically the third act was, of course, the best and carried off the honors. Mlle. SULZER was an excellent Pierrotto, and in the organ air of the first act won a merited round of applause. Signor BELLINI as Antonio, and Signor BIACHI as the Prefetto, were alike good; the first-named artist especially so in the great scene of the second act. Mr. MARETZEK's new tenore di grazia, Signor MINATTI, made his debut as Carlo, and was very favorably received.

In the second act, indeed, the dramatic points were so grandly incorporated with the vocal ones that we doubt if its touching duo finale has ever been heard to greater advantage. Mme. MEDORI sang, indeed, with superb feeling and nicety. Dramatically the third act was, of course, the best and carried off the honors. Mlle. SULZER was an excellent Pierrotto, and in the organ air of the first act won a merited round of applause. Signor BELLINI as Antonio, and Signor BIACHI as the Prefetto, were alike good; the first-named artist especially so in the great scene of the second act. Mr. MARETZEK's new tenore di grazia, Signor MINATTI, made his debut as Carlo, and was very favorably received. He has a head voice of exceeding sweetness -- rather cloying, indeed, from this cause -- and phrases better than any singer we have had. He is evidently a fine artist. He succeeeded in winning an encore for his romanza.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6988decd-cb76-52c5-99e4-c1646637613b,423,nyt://article/6988decd-cb76-52c5-99e4-c1646637613b

The more he calls, the more they won't do it. We want just now no better guarantee for the substantial loyalty of the masses of the Democratic party in this State, than is given by the attempt of WOOD and his associates to array them in hostility against the Government. We find, moreover, in the very fervor and zeal with which he is prosecuting this endeavor, evidence of its desperate nature. WOOD sees clearly that although the Democratic party may, on the eve of an election, yield an apparent assent to his doctrines, they have no thought of making him the leader of their councils. His present movement, therefore, is an attempt to force them into acquiescence. He will fail, and the result of his attempt will be to throw himself out of position with his own party.

Their passage of a bill to borrow a million of dollars for State defence has led to the suspicion in some quarters, and to the hope in others, that they meant to resist the execution of the Conscription law and the collection of the National taxes. But Mr. RANDOLPH, their leader in the Senate, took occasion to disabuse the public of this impression. He warned them against supposing for a moment that this money was to be used in any other way than in sustaining the General Government, and in putting down all appeal to other than legal means for the redress of real or imaginary grievances.

"London newspapers tell us that six lives were lost in the crush of the procession on the occasion of the marriage of the Prince of Wales. These were the lives of women and children who were literally squeezed to death by the confusion and pressure of the unmanageable crowd. It is also stated that the passage way for the carriages of the procession could not possibly be kept open, and it was only by tact, coaxing and management on the part of the persons in attendance, that the crowd was induced to give way and allow a passage for the vehicles.

In Texas they have seized corn, sugar, cotton, leather, and everything they could lay their hands on. A Texas paper says that the impressment agents are shunned by the people as they would shun lepers; and that their threats have compelled even the wives of soldiers to give up the necessaries left for their support. So far as that State is concerned, it will now happily be relieved from these authorized and merciless robberies by the fleet of Admiral FARRAGUT. His vessels not only control the Mississippi between Vicksburgh and Port Hudson, but a number of them have ascended the Red River, the only route by which these supplies can be carried from Texas, and doubtless some of the steamboats bearing them have fallen into his hands.

"Rebel Cotton Loan, The",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/29/archives/from-europe.html,"Rebel Cotton Loan, The","We have advices from Europe two days later, by the arrival at this port yesterday of the steamship Asia. The dates are to the 15th inst. The news is important. The diplomatic correspondence, called for by Parliament, in reference to the war in America, had been issued. Mr. MASON's latest letters urge the English Government to declare the blockade of the Southern ports a nullity, or not to respect it, because it can be shown that the North has not been able to render it complete and total. The refusal of this application is cause of dissatisfaction to the South. The latest cause of dissatisfaction on the part of the North is that England has done too little to satisfy the National Government in the case of the Alabama. The London Times, in an editorial on this correspondence, says the irritation that may be traced [???] nearly an equal degree in both divisions -- North and South -- is of itself a proof that England has not unduly inclined to either side. The latest dates of correspondence leave both with no grounds for more than remonstrances, and both have much less to say against anything England has done than in favor of something they assert she ought to do. The Times reiterates its arguments in defence of the position of England in the matter of the Alabama. The Union and Emancipation Society of Manchester having sent a protest to Earl RUSSELL against fitting [???]t vessels for the Confederates in England, Earl RUSSELL replies by policing out that the act of Parliament requires evidence on oath to enable proceedings to be taken against parties suspected of contravening the law. It is asserted that irritation among the operatives in Lancashire was becoming very strong. They complain of the behavior of the Relief Committees, the administration of the Poor law, the enormous reduction in wages, and that the workman is sinking more and more deeply into the power of his employer by running into debt for rent. The rebel loan of £3,000,000 was expected to be introduced in London and Paris soon after the sailing of the Asia. The accounts from Poland, although vague, show conclusively that the revolution is assuming the most formidable proportions. The Revolutionary forces are said to have reached already some 50,000 men. The latest telegrams via Queenstown state that the Russians have suffered another defeat near Myserzowo, losing 100 killed. The attitude of the French Government continued to be decidedly in favor of the Poles. An advance of 1/2d. per pound had taken place in Cotton in the Liverpool market. Breadstuffs and Provisions were quiet.

"The Manchester Guardian gives the following particulars of the meeting of Lancashire unemployed operatives, in Stevenson-square, to return thanks to the American people for their contributions of food to the relief fund. We may observe that an impression prevailed that the real object of the promoters of the meeting was to get up an agitation in favor of the Federal Government, and steps were taken by the friends of the Confederate Government to defeat that object. The Guardian says: ""After some delay, Rev. C.W. DENISON commenced the proceedings with a prayer, not one word of which, owing to the hooting and applause, could be heard beyond the spot where it was uttered. The prayer being concluded, several attempts were made to go on with the programme; but, beyond the success which attended a call for three cheers for the Queen, and three more for the royal bride and bridegroom, those efforts were wholly ineffectual. At length the expedient was hit upon of inviting the opposite speakers to come and say what they had to say upon the platform. This done, the leader of the opposition began to address the mixed crowd amid the most [???]uous confusion. He asked what business had those ships and those carts full of bread to be drawn up in that square? What was it the promoters of that meeting intended the people to do? He said he did not wish to appear ungrateful to the American people for their gift of the bread, but he wanted to know why it was brought into that square, instead of being sent to the proper quarter -- the quarter that the people have had to avail themselves of for the last nine months. At the conclusion of this speech, THOMAS EVANS endeavored to obtain a hearing, but the crowd refused to listen to him. Several other persons having failed in a similar manner, Mr. EDWARDS stood forward and was rather more successful. He denied that the object of the meeting was to offer a bait to the people, but the promoters had thought that, upon such a day of rejoicing, something better might be done than to give an empty pageant to the starving poor. They had accordingly spent $200 to carry out their intentions, and they were prepared to distribute to those who were in want 15,000 loaves of bread. Rev. C.W. DENISON rose, and, after order had been restored, he proposed that the people should offer up their praises to God in a hymn in which all could join. [Confusion and laughter, and cries of 'No religion,' 'Plenty of humbug without that.'] The reverend chaplain managed to obtain a hearing, and addressed the meeting upon emancipation. At the conclusion of his address the meeting became quite ungovernable. The crowd surged to and fro and kept up an incessant uproar that drowned the voice of several successive speakers. The scene of confusion rose to its height when a loaf of bread was hurled with great force across the bows of a model of the Alabama, in the direction of the platform. From this moment it was obvious that any attempt to restore order would be fruitless. The several bread-carts were carried by assault, and their contents were thrown in all directions. In vain some persons on the platform protected against the disgraceful scene, while others pointed to what was going on as a worthy finish to such a meeting. In many cases severe injuries were caused by the force with which the loaves struck the people in the crowd. During this riotous scene, a loaf, thrown from the crowd, struck Rev. Mr. DENISON. He thereupon quitted his place on the platform, and left the meeting. By this time the bread-carts had been taken possession of by some authorized persons, who proceeded to distribute the loaves in a less dangerous manner; and when their stores were exhausted, the windows in the upper story of a bakery near at hand were thrown open, and more loaves were thrown out upon the crowd below.

BROOKS and FERNANDO WOOD. This reason is neither more nor less than the doctrines which he alleges to be held by the entire Republican party, on the subject of negro equality.

"A LADY ARRESTED ON A CHARGE OF LARCENY. -- For the past few days considerable talk has been occasioned in that part of the city called Frankfort, owing to the fact that a respectable and wealthy widow had been arrested and taken to Lackport for examination, charge with the larceny of a note of the amount of $2,400. It is contended by the lady, the defendant in the case, that she gave a man residing in Lockport, who had been transaction some business for her, a note for the amount above stated in payment for his services. When the note became due it was presented to the defendant by a man, a stranger, to whom it had been transferred by the original owner. The lady stated that she could not pay the note then, but would in a few days. About ten days thereafter the holder of the paper again made his appearance, and presented it, and the lady paid $1,900 in cash, and gave another note for the balance, the interest on the original note being thrown off through generosity, as she supposed. This is the defendant's case, or as much of it as is proper to publish at the present time. The prosecutor alleges, as we he hear, that the defendant while visiting at his house in Lockport wrongfully obtained possession of the note. The further examination of the case was postponed until to-morrow, meanwhile the lady is at large on bail or on her own recognizance. There are other matters connected with the case which will probably be developed in behalf of the defence which promise to give it some magnitude.

On this eventful day, according to the Scripture record, our Lord, after entering the temple, healed many of the sick, blind and lame. St. Philip announced to our Lord that certain Greek proselytes, who could not enter the interior of the temple, were anxious to see Him, and He, therefore, went to them in the Court of the Gentiles. There He predicted the conversion of the Gentiles, and the glorious harvest of His own death and resurrection; and as He uttered a prayer to the Father, He was answered by a miraculous voice, which the people mistook for thunder. Our Lord further fulfilled prophecy in clearing the Temple of the profane traffickers by whom it was polluted. At evening, He returned to Bethany with the Twelve, and was the guest of Lazarus, and Mary and Martha. In commemoration of this day by the Catholics, sprigs of the palm, or some other evergreen, previously blessed by the priest, are carried to church -- silent though expressive memorials of Him who disdained not to accept the same tribute from His Apostles.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Religious Intelligence.

He was a man about 39 years of age, a native of this City, where he has always resided, and so far as is known, he has always borne a good reputation. He owned a stall in Washington Market, where for several years past he had been doing a thriving business. He was a single man, and, with a younger brother, resided at the house of his parents at the place above indicated. Yesterday morning he intimated to his family that he was too unwell to attend to his business, and that he should therefore remain at home. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon, his mother visited his room with some medicine, when, upon opening the door, she was startled by the spectacle presented. Her son was lying lifeless upon the floor, and in his right hand was a pistol. An examination of the body was made, when it was found that all upper portion of his head had been shot away, and that death must necessarily have ensued immediately after the shot was fired. All the circumstances of the case went to show that he died by his own hands. Coroner RANNEY was notified to hold an inquest upon the body.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-03-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/93f192e0-7d14-5d8a-9c3d-f907d0aad7d5,528,nyt://article/93f192e0-7d14-5d8a-9c3d-f907d0aad7d5

"-- Among the foreign news which we published yesterday was an extract of a letter from Frankfort, (Germany,) which mentioned that public opinion in Germany against Slavery was too strong to allow any one to interfere, by speech, writing or action in its favor; and that the course of the Confederates was so universally detested there, that persons who ventured to advocate that cause in the Clubs, had been remonstrated with, and then expelled.

Men of all parties seem to agree that, whatever else may happen, the Union must be preserved. We hear nothing now, from any quarter, of letting the South go in peace. Six months or a year ago there were thousands among us who were half inclined to regard the attempt to quell the rebellion as hopeless, and who were more than half inclined to end the war by conceding independence to the Southern States. We hear no such talk now. Even those who are most impressed by the magnitude of the struggle, and by the sacrifices which it costs to carry it on, seem to have become satisfied that if there is no way out of it except by disunion, it must be continued indefinitely. Thousands who would willingly grant the rebels large and liberal terms of peace, who would concede whatever they might demand in the nature of added guarantees and enlarged powers under the Constitution, who would even put the Government of the country into the hands of JEFF. DAVIS, and substitute the Montgomery Constitution for that of the United States, -- even these men would not consent to a division of the Union.

The dates are to the 15th inst. The news is important. The diplomatic correspondence, called for by Parliament, in reference to the war in America, had been issued. Mr. MASON's latest letters urge the English Government to declare the blockade of the Southern ports a nullity, or not to respect it, because it can be shown that the North has not been able to render a complete and total. The refusal of this application is cause of dissatisfaction to the South. The latest cause of dissatisfaction on the part of the North is that England has done too little to satisfy the National Government in the case of the Alabama. The London Times, in an editorial on this correspondence, says the irritation that may be traced in nearly an equal degree in both divisions -- North and South -- is of itself a proof that England has not unduly inclined to either side. The latest dates of correspondence leave both with no grounds for more than remonstrances, and both have much less to say against anything England has done than in favor of something they assert she ought to do. The Times reiterates its arguments in defence of the position of England in the matter of the Alabama. The Union and Emancipation Society of Manchester having sent a protest to Earl RUSSELL against fitting out vessels for the Confederates in England, Earl RUSSELL replies by pointing out that the act of Parliament requires evidence on oath to enable proceedings to be taken against parties suspected of contravening the law. It is asserted that irritation among the operatives in Lancashire was becoming very strong. They complain of the behavior of the Relief Committees, the administration of the Poor law, the enormous reduction in wages, and that the workman is sinking more and more deeply into the power of his employer by running into debt for rent. The rebel loan of £3,000,000 was expected to be introduced in London and Paris soon after the sailing of the Asia. The accounts from Poland, although vague, show conclusively that the revolution is assuming the most formidable proportions. The Revolutionary forces are said to have reached, already some 50,000 men. The latest telegrams via Queenstown state that the Russians have suffered another defeat near Myserzowo, losing 100 killed. The attitude of the French Government continued to be decidedly in favor of the Poles. An advance of 1/2d. per pound had taken place in Cotton in the Liverpool market.

So far as they dared, they denounced its spirit and its tenor, and in terms that made it morally certain that they were really in favor of foreign intervention as a means of terminating the war. Difficult as it was to believe that men who called themselves American citizens could be so lost to American spirit as to favor European interference, yet the tone of the complaints toward Secretary SEWARD, we felt at the time, could have no other animus; and we stigmatized it accordingly.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- The performance of ""Semiramide,"" last evening, was all that a lover of mere vocalism could desire. Signer BIACHI, as Assur, rollicked in the roulades of his part as blithely as an infant in its nurse's arms; Mlle. SULZER, in her tremendous scena of the first act, displayed an excellent executive ability; Mme. GUERRABELLA, as Semiramide, expressed her emotions in the most accurate of periods, and Signor MINETTI demonstrated that he is a good pupil of the school of ROSSINI. We think in vain of a part that was not well interpreted; and yet the performance lacked spirit. The opera has never been a successful one here, although one of the best the maestro ever wrote. To explain this we must look at the libretto, and here we find a lamentable lack of action. The first act (subdivided into two acts last evening) might be played in a concert-room, so little does the scene add to the illusion. This defect is a radical one, and becomes in the end a bore -- especially with a public not thoroughly familiar with the music. And so, although the artists we have named were excellent, the performance dragged, and failed to elicit that warm response which we excellence of the singing really deserved. Of the Assur of Signer BIACHI, we have no hesitation in saying it is the best vocally we have ever heard. In mere facility of execution, nothing better could be desired; but apart from an insufficient profundity of voice, it seemed to us that he lacked ease and repose in the part, and hence the breadth which comes of those two qualities.

Object of the Movement on,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/31/archives/port-hudson.html,Object of the Movement on,"The contradictory rumors which we have been receiving for a fortnight past, through rebel and other sources, from Port Hudson and the Lower Mississippi, are cleared up this morning by the very interesting and lucid letters we publish from the scene of action. The movements of Gen. BANKS' army and FARRAGUT's navy, first in the direction of Port Hudson, and afterward back to Baton Rouge, are set forth as being the carrying out of a plan to push part of our navy beyond Port Hudson up the Mississippi, with the view of gaining control of that part of the river not previously in our hands, as well as of the Red River and the region from which the rebel armies in the Mississippi Valley obtain their supplies. Gen BANKS' flank movement by land was not, it seems, intended to prelude a direct assault upon the enemy's works, but to divide and divert their attention while FARRAGUT was effecting his part of the plan. As soon as news reached Gen. BANKS that the Hartford and Albatross had passed Port Hudson, he telegraphed to the officer in immediate command of the land force that the object of the expedition was accomplished, and ordered him to return leisurely to Baton Rouge. The idea seems to have been comprehended in the fleet itself, as will appear from the letter of a clergyman written on board the sloop-of-war Richmond. This is not exactly what the public had been led to anticipate. A combined assault in force on the rebel works had been generally advertised as about to come off, and a victorious reduction of the rebel stronghold was expected. For that, it seems, we must wait a little longer. But, as it is, we met with a gratifying success, and one whose results may be as great and wide-reaching as would have come from a storming of the rebel fortifications. With fleets above and below Vicksburgh and Port Hudson, the whole river, excepting those points, is now in our hands.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Port Hudson.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Port Hudson.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-03-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80db8af3-4d91-5f09-a744-3b5d62bb689d,378,nyt://article/80db8af3-4d91-5f09-a744-3b5d62bb689d

He daily attended to his business, however, and no serious consequences were anticipated. Yesterday afternoon he appeared unusually depressed in spirits, and about 1 o'clock he announced to his partner, Mr. TYSON, who is also his brother-in-law, that he was unable to attend to business, and would lie down in the office, adjoining the store, and take a little rest. He remained there undisturbed for over an hour, when Mr. TYSON, thinking he might need aid, entered the office. To his astonishment, he found Mr. PURDY was dead. A pool of blood upon the floor, a small wound in his throat, and a small pen-knife lying near, afforded strong evidence as to the cause of his death. Physicians were at once called in, but life was found to be entirely extinct. An examination of the body was made, when it became evident that he had terminated his life by severing the jugular vein with the knife which was found near him covered with blood. Coroner WILDEY was notified, and will hold an inquest upon the body this morning. The deceased was a well-known merchant of this City, aged about 66 years.

"The steamship New-Brunswick, from New-Orleans on the 22d inst., arrived at this port yesterday morning, and was followed last evening by the McClellan, which left New-Orleans on the same day. By these arrivals we have full details, from our Special Correspondent, of the movement against Port Hudson by the land and naval forces, and the passage of the rebel batteries by two of Admiral FARRAGUT's vessels -- the Hartford and the Albatross -- not the Monongahela, as before reported. The passage of the batteries, as already stated, took place on the night of Saturday, the 14th inst. Taking the lead with the Hartford and Alabatross, followed by the Richmond and Kineo, the Monongahela and Genesee, and lastly the Mississippi. Admiral FARRAGUT essayed the passage, while the Essex and Sachem in the rear, with six mortar-boats, kept up a constant fire. The Hartford and Albatross passed the upper batteries in safety. The Richmond, after reaching the upper battery, was temporarily disabled and had to fall back. So was the Monongahela. The Mississippi ran aground at the bend Opposite the central battery, receiving the concentrated fire of the entire fort for an hour, and fighting most desperately. Finding it impossible to save her, Capt. SMITH gave orders to fire her. She afterward floated down the river till she reached a point a few miles above Baton Rouge, where her magazine exploded. Some sixty of the crew are either killed or missing. The remainder of the fleet are safe and ready for action. The army, under Major-Gen. BANKS, proceeded by land, simply to make a diversion; but after the Hartford had passed, and the experiment of passing the forts was ended, returned to Baton Rouge. They approached to within five or six miles of Port Hudson, and met portions of the enemy, who retreated to the forts. There had been no other military or naval movements. The steamship Bio Bio, which arrived at New-Orleans on the morning of the 22d, was burnt at her wharf immediately after her arrival.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/03/31/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The steamship New-Brunswick, from New-Orleans on the 22d inst., arrived at this port yesterday morning, and was followed last evening by the McClellan, which left New-Orleans on the same day.
