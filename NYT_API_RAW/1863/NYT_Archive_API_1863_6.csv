BRECKIN RIDGE has been as unfortunate as a General as he formerly was fortunate as a politician. In political service he obtained every honor which he coveted, except the highest; and this, too, while yet a young man. In the rebel army, misfortunes have followed him, and dishonors have been heaped upon him, until now, stung to the quick by the accusations officially made against him by Gen. BRAGG, regarding his conduct at the last battle in which he was an actor, he has written a letter to Richmond, demanding justice and a Court of inquiry. He says that BRAGG's report thoroughly disparages both him and his command -- that BRAGG levels his strictures at his conduct as an officer during all the operations, and that BRAGG, by direct statement and unmistakable innuendo, reflects upon his capacity and conduct. BRECKINRIDGE retorts sharply upon his superior officer in replying to these accusations -- charges him with misrepresentation, injustice and baser crimes, and contends that the failure of his troops to hold their position at the battle of Stone River was due to no fault of theirs or his, but to the fact that BRAGG commanded them to do an impossible thing.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A BROKEN-DOWN REBEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A BROKEN-DOWN REBEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/32c027c0-d9da-5557-8f33-704165f311cb,382,nyt://article/32c027c0-d9da-5557-8f33-704165f311cb

Mr. JOHN BROUGHAM is the author of the novelty in question, which is called the �Duke's Motto.� It has met with the greatest success in London, and is still being played there. All the resources of Niblo's will be exhausted in bringing the work before our public, and Mr. COLLINS and Mr. WHEATLEY sustain the principal parts. At Mr. WALLACK's theatre the comedy of �A Bold Stroke for a Husband� will be played for the last time this season. Novelties are still announced as in preparation at this house, although the season must be drawing rapidly to a close.

Two incidents called the Committee together at the present time: the first was the Loyal State Convention at Utica, which ignored all party divisions, and rallied patriots of every name and of every party to the supreme work of saving the country, and the second was the approaching Peace Convention, to convene in this City day after to-morrow. The Democratic State Committee found its party in danger of an attack both in front and rear.

We have had no special information as to his success during these fifteen days in bringing up reinforcements -- though the dispatch said to have been sent by him to PEMBERTON assured the latter that in fifteen days he would aid him with a hundred thousand men. His facilities for bringing forward men are not very great, as the railroads are few, ricketty and much damaged by our raids, and the places from which reinforcements can be obtained are very distant. We have the evidence of eye-witnesses that troops have been brought from Charleston, which is distant from Jackson 767 miles; and if they have been brought from Charleston, they have doubtless also been brought from Savannah, Mobile, and all the garrisoned positions in the Gulf States, if not from North Carolina. We have also had numerous rumors that reinforcements were being got from BRAGG's army; and though the shortest line of communication between Tullahoma and Jackson may not be available, yet it would be easier to take troops from Chattanooga by the Western and Atlantic Railroad to Atlanta, and thence to Jackson, than to transport them from the Atlantic coast.

Mr. CONWAY recognizes the practical unanimity of men of all parties in declaring that the Union must be maintained -- whatever may become of Slavery or anything else. He acknowledges that ion this point Republicans, Democrats, and to a considerable extent Anti Slavery men, are substantially agreed. But for his own part he protests against it. Unless Slavery is destroyed he does not wish the Union preserved. If Slavery is destroyed, he does not object to the Union; but the abolition of Slavery is with him the main consideration; it is for that he would have the war carried on; -- the preservation of the Union is a secondary matter altogether.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AN ABOLITION VIEW OF THE WAR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AN ABOLITION VIEW OF THE WAR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/53a60f98-28d4-57cc-9886-8eb440842928,500,nyt://article/53a60f98-28d4-57cc-9886-8eb440842928

Very few would declare this sentiment openly, but they were for stepping the war at all hazards, and ""letting the Union slide.""

"A grand romantic drama, called the ""Duke's Motto,"" was produced here on Monday night. It is an adaptation of a French piece, made with the consent and cooperation of the author, and now playing in London with the greatest success. We shall not attempt to describe the plot The briefest summary of the incidents would alone fill a column, and even a list of the depths and casualties would occupy more space than we propose to devote to the entire work. The here of the piece, Capt. Lagardere, is an amiable swordsman, who, in the pursuit of virtue, finds it essential to assail the vitals of almost every one he meets. A single illustration of his character will be sufficient. At the close of the prologue he makes a vow to kill every living being then on the stage, and before the end of the play he keeps his word. Fortunately, a sturdy and attractive race of females has in the meantime grown up, so that the gaps made in the dramatic ranks from time to lime are not so much remarked as otherwise they would be; and the new characters being in their prime by the third act, there is, not-withstanding the heavy mortality, a good muster at the end. The merit of the dramatist is discovered in the fact that the audience fully indorses the acts of the Captain, regarding him as the champion of innocence, and rejoicing when he turns up, as he always does, just in time for the slaughter. The character-contrasts, situations and incidents by which this is effected, are frequently of the most startling kind, and in every Instance display rare ingenuity. As a consequence, the ""Duke's Motto"" is a highly elaborate and exciting drama of the sensation school; violating every rule of probability, but beeping the audience in a state of breathless anticipation from beginning to end. It must be added, too, that there is nothing unwholesome in the way this is done.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/03/archives/niblos-garden.html,,"A grand romantic drama, called the ""Duke's Motto,"" was produced here on Monday night.

The here of the piece, Capt. Lagardere, is an amiable swordsman, who, in the pursuit of virtue, finds it essential to assail the vitals of almost every one he meets. A single illustration of his character will be sufficient. At the close of the prologue he makes a vow to kill every living being then on the stage, and before the end of the play he keeps his word. Fortunately, a sturdy and attractive race of females has in the meantime grown up, so that the gaps made in the dramatic ranks from time to lime are not so much remarked as otherwise they would be; and the new characters being in their prime by the third act, there is, not-withstanding the heavy mortality, a good muster at the end. The merit of the dramatist is discovered in the fact that the audience fully indorses the acts of the Captain, regarding him as the champion of innocence, and rejoicing when he turns up, as he always does, just in time for the slaughter. The character-contrasts, situations and incidents by which this is effected, are frequently of the most startling kind, and in every Instance display rare ingenuity. As a consequence, the ""Duke's Motto"" is a highly elaborate and exciting drama of the sensation school; violating every rule of probability, but beeping the audience in a state of breathless anticipation from beginning to end. It must be added, too, that there is nothing unwholesome in the way this is done.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Niblo's Garden."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Niblo's Garden."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11765aa1-6cf4-50bf-aa0b-ec1df61185e6,964,nyt://article/11765aa1-6cf4-50bf-aa0b-ec1df61185e6

Removal from Department of the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/03/archives/removal-of-gen-hunter.html,Removal from Department of the South,"-- It is announced from Washington that Gen. HUNTER has been relieved from the command of the Department of the South, and that he is succeeded by Gen. GILMORE. We have as yet no statement of the reasons for this change. Whether Gen. HUNTER is relieved at his own request, or in consequence of some failure in duty, we are not aware. His letter to JEFF. DAVIS, which we published yesterday morning, was in some respects a singular production, and may have had something to do with his displacement. It is dated April 20. The first part of it threatens to execute the ""rebel of highest rank"" in his possession for every negro in the employ of the Government who may be executed or sold into slavery by the rebels. This may be justified, perhaps, on the ground of necessary retaliation. But Gen. HUNTER also informs Mr. DAVIS that, unless he immediately revokes an order which he issued in August last, directing the execution of all negroes who may be taken prisoners; he will ""at once cause the execution of every rebel officer and every rebel slaveholder"" in his possession. This certainly is a strange threat for a Commanding General to make. We do not know that Gen. HUNTER has ever attempted to put it in execution, but it is quite possible that it may have had something to do with his removal. The Government could not permit an officer to announce or initiate any such policy as this, nor is it at all likely that they would permit it to pass without notice.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REMOVAL OF GEN.

Intemperate Patriotism at the West,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/04/archives/gen-burnsides-doings-at-the-west.html,Intemperate Patriotism at the West,"Unless we are greatly mistaken, the Government will very soon find it necessary to check the intemperate patriotism of Gen. BURNSIDE in his mode of dealing with disaffected persons and Presses in the loyal States. Whether the powers which he claims to exercise over freedom of speech and of the Press do actually belong to his office or not, it is very clear that they should never he intrusted to any man whose zeal outruns his judgment. An over-zealous friend will often do ten times more harm by restless and injudicious meddling than an open enemy; and in the exercise of powers which, however necessary they may be, are always odious, an excessive prudence is always preferable to a headlong and reckless temper. We have no doubt that Gen. BURNSIDE thinks he is rendering the country an essential service, in suppressing the Chicago Times and in forbidding the circulation of the New-York World within his lines; and we have just as little doubt that he is utterly mistaken. He will very speedily find that he is multiplying ten-fold the very evil he seeks to extirpate. It is very rarely that a military man can be found who is capable of understanding what public opinion is, or who can be made to comprehend that the Press has any other rights than those which he may be pleased to confer upon it. We do not know that we should gain much on either point by appealing from the camp to the Government; but our interest in the welfare of the country impels us to risk the experiment of counseling President LINCOLN to put a check upon Gen.

SIR: I have been desired by my legal advisers to reserve any public reply I might have to the calumnies in circulation concerning me until Mr. JORDAN'S case appeared before the tribunals; but I cannot endure any further delay in publishing the following statement. I have no wish to conceal or disguise ...  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/04/archives/m-boucicaults-version-of-the-jordan-and-gibbon-case-mr-jordans.html,,"SIR: I have been desired by my legal advisers to reserve any public reply I might have to the calumnies in circulation concerning me until Mr. JORDAN'S case appeared before the tribunals; but I cannot endure any further delay in publishing the following statement. I have no wish to conceal or disguise any imprudence I may have committed, but I deny most indignantly the guilty imputations and disgraceful acts laid to my charge. In July, 1861, Mr. and Mrs. JORDAN arrived in London from New-Orleans, and from that time until the Summer of 1862 they were received on the most intimate footing in my family. It soon became apparent that they lived very unhappily in consequence, as Mrs. JORDAN told my wife, of a connexion which her husband had formed with another lady, a matter which subsequently became notorious. In May, 1862, Mrs. JORDAN left her home, and sought refuge in the house of a friend. I was the means of inducing her to return, and of effecting a reconciliation. In June I opened Drury-lane Theatre, and by Mr. JORDAN's desire I gave his wife an engagement; I did so at the suggestion also of Mrs. BOUGIOAULT, who entertained sympathy for her position, and requested me to pay her every attention in my power. This engagement Mr. JORDAN stated at the trial was without his consent and against his wish -- that he was opposed to it and to any intimacy with me at this time. This is wholly untrue. During the season he came almost nightly behind the scenes, and sat with me and my friends in my room, dined at my house, and exhibited every evidence of intimacy and confidence. After the performances I usually gave them seats in my carriage, and left them at their door in passing. When he did not come I invariably escorted her in my carriage to her door. This continued until the end of July, when I heard that he had expressed some suspicions respecting my relations with the lady. I immediately begged her to resign her engagement, and she consented to do so. On the following day she informed me that Mr. JORDAN refused to allow her to leave the theatre, alleging that he was at the time without any permanent engagement, and she must stay where she was. Subsequently to this Mr. JORDAN continued to visit the theatre as usual, sought my society, dined at my house, I took them borne in my carriage as before, Mr. JORDAN generally preferring to ride on the box; and in his absence I escorted her, as it had been my custom to do. I regret to say I did not tell Mrs. BOUCICAULT of these suspicions respecting me, as I did not wish to give her anxiety or trouble at the time, and I did not think them seriously entertained. A few weeks after this I was informed by the lady that after a dispute, unhappily not unfrequent, her husband had ordered her to leave his lodgings, as he felt convinced of her guilty relations with me. She begged him not to cast that opprobrium upon her, or to give her the means to go to America, where her parents resided. He refused it, and told her to seek what assistance she wanted from me. On learning of this, I wrote to Mr. JORDAN, remonstrating with him on his conduct, but assuring him that if he persisted in it, I neither could nor would allow his wife to be reduced to want; that he left me no alternative but to retain her la the theatre, but if she preferred to return to her parents, that I would give her the means to do so. I added that I did this after consulting with my wife, and had written to inform him of my intentions lest my motives might be misrepresented or misconstrued. To this letter I received no answer. By my advice Mrs. JORDAN, on leaving her husband, went to apartments in Pall-mall, where he and she ha') previously lodged. She wrote to her husband to inform him where she was to be found. I continued, as before, to escort her to her door nightly after the performances. I did so without secrecy, in my own carriage, and as publicly as I could. This was my first imprudence. Mr. JORDAN had, it seems, been watching night after night in the hope of seeing me enter the house, but had been disappointed. On the night in question she had begged me to lend her some books; so, after leaving her door, I drove round to my chambers in King-street, St. James', and returned immediately with the works. I had scarcely entered the hall when I heard a Knock at the door. Presuming it was one of the lodgers in the house, and fearing my presence even in the hall might cause some remark, I withdrew to let them pass. Mr. JORDAN entered. He showed neither anger nor excitement, and exhibited no violence whatever; had he done so I should have followed him into his wife's room, toward which he went. His remark was: ""I only desire to see Mr. BOUCICAULT, that he may be identified,"" or words to that effect. I was unaware of the circumstances that followed, and that Col. GIBBON or any one else had been mixed up in the affair until after Mr. JORDAN had been removed. I am quite aware how injudicious and imprudent my conduct was under the circumstances, and, in my desire to shield the lady's reputation, and avoid, if possible, a public scandal on my own account, I contrived to make matters much worse than they need have appeared. Mrs. BOUCICAULT had been ill for some weeks previously, but, on her recovery, I told her candidly what had occurred, and by her conduct toward Mrs. JORDAN subsequently she desired to exhibit her disbelief in the scandal which then became only too notorious. Shortly after this Mrs. JORDAN returned to America, and I afforded her the means to do so. These are the facts for which I have been so severely reprehended. Mr. JORDAN brought an action against Col. GIBBON in order that a scandalous story might go forth to the public, as it has done, without investigation or defence. This trial was not, nor was it intended to be, against the nominal defendant; it was against me, and so contrived that I might suffer all the odium without even the opportunity of reply. If Mr. JORDAN were injured at all it was by me, and I alone was the proper defendant against whom an action might have been brought. I deny the charges brought against me, and I defy Mr. JORDAN to prove them.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""M.

It was opened by the Marquis of Clanricarde speaking in favor of his motion for copies of the proceedings, of our Prize Courts, in a speech most remarkable for the untruth of its statements and the recklessness of its charges. The ground of his bringing up the subject was, as he said, that ""the whole trade of England with the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies was at preterit arrested."" This statement was, of course, a mere rhetorical flourish; for no seizure of vessels by our cruisers could have had any serious effect upon the lawful trade to that part of the world, and we have yet to see any signs that the illegitimate trade has been checked by such seizure, or by anything else. Now and then, it is true, we notice that some blockade runner has been forced to make his appearance before the Insolvent Courts; but where the profits are so large, the failure of one or two will not intimidate the rest.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American Affairs in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American Affairs in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8bfdb851-8d97-5131-bb1b-d80c97bd351c,763,nyt://article/8bfdb851-8d97-5131-bb1b-d80c97bd351c

According to the originally designed scale of the work the present would have formed the last volume, and it is matter for congratulation that the richness and abundance of the material in the Editor's hands induces him to enlarge the Life to four volumes. The portion now before us includes the incidents of fourteen years, from Mr. IRVING's return to the United States after the long residence abroad, which had allowed a generation to grow up, to whom he was personally strange, in 1832, until his final restoration to his native land in 1846, on his retiring from the Spanish Embassy. Thirteen years of happy home life yet remains for the subject of the concluding volume. The period now illustrated was one of considerable literary activity, including the publication of Astoria, Adventures of Capt. Bonneville, Tour on the P???aries and other volumes of The Crayon Miscellany, and the preparations for the Life of Washington, delayed for a time by diplomatic functions, but always kept in view by the writer as the destined goal of his authorial career. A thousand interesting facts and anecdotes connected with the above works and the literary men of Europe and America, will be found now given for the first time in the correspondence of IRVING with his family and friends, all in the highest degree creditable to him. Amongst others may be mentioned the particulars of the noted sacrifice of time and money that he made when nobly giving up to PRESCOTT the subject of The Conquest of Mexico, on which he had long intended to write a work as the pendant to his Columbus. It is needless to enlarge on a book that will be so generally read. A more perfect picture of a literary life, told with the good taste which allows the subject of it to be mainly his own biographer, has never appeared.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF WASHINGTON IRVING, by his Nephew, PIERRE M.

There has been a peace party in the country ever since the war began, but it has never ventured to declare openly its real aims. Either through a consciousness of its weakness, or through faith in the policy of temporization and subterfuge, it has steadily devoted itself rather to the support of things that were likely to hinder or delay the war, than to the advocacy of the immediate cessation of hostilities. It became aware at a very early stage in the conflict that if the Southern property in slaves were scrupulously respected, it would leave in the hands of the rebels the means of protracting their resistance almost indefinitely; and the first efforts of the opposition, therefore, were directed to securing to this species of property a formal exemption from the risks in which every other species of property was necessarily involved. They did all that pen and tongue could do to place negroes, for this once, in a different category from mules and cattle, and to make out their seizure or liberation as something more than usually outrageous and unjust. The natural effect of the operation of this theory, had they been successful in securing its adoption, would, of course, have been to neutralize at one stroke a large ???crtion of the Northern superiority in point of population, on which the National Government relied largely for its final success. It would have converted, in short, the weakest point in the Confederacy into its strongest.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Peace Party.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Peace Party.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3018b92c-5fc1-5078-9500-7831604364be,960,nyt://article/3018b92c-5fc1-5078-9500-7831604364be

Anaconda Plan of Hostilities,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/06/archives/the-anaconda-plan.html,Anaconda Plan of Hostilities,"-- The necessity of pushing active operations into the rebel territory, and attacking him energetically, is revealed more and more, as we continue to do so; and the errors of the anaconda plan, as a permanent mode of operation, are made more patent daily. We had news, yesterday, that a naval expedition had ascended the Red River as far as Shreveport, 330 miles from its mouth, and had there found on the stocks and destroyed two immense iron-clad rebel vessels, of sufficient power to have demolished our Mississippi fleet. A few days ago Admiral PORTER forwarded a dispatch announcing that he had sent an expedition up the Yazoo; and that at Yazoo City three powerful steamers had been destroyed, and also a monster ram, 310 feet long, 70 feet beam, to be covered with 4-inch iron-plate. At both Shreveport and Yazoo City were found extensive navy-yards, which were demolished. These are but a fraction of the rebel iron-clads that have been destroyed on the Western rivers during the year, or since FARRAGUT and PORTER began active operations in searching for them. All the Western streams have been pretty thoroughly scoured now, however, and we imagine that these late exploits must about have finished up all the rebel iron-clads in that section, unless they happen to have some up the Arkansas River, which as yet has not been penetrated for any distance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ANACONDA PLAN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ANACONDA PLAN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f8bbcc6-66f3-50c6-a779-a58847ae69e8,287,nyt://article/4f8bbcc6-66f3-50c6-a779-a58847ae69e8

"And Reunion, According to Rynders and Wood",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/07/archives/peace-and-reunion.html,"And Reunion, According to Rynders and Wood","""Peace and Reunion!"" These were the dulcet words which lined the blank walls and guttersides of New-York and Brooklyn, heading the call for the Grand Mass Convention or ""those opposed to the war and its continuance."" Peace and Reunion! What a delightful combination. Read it again. ""It hath a dying fall."" Do not all manner of visions at once come over the mind, of millennial glories -- visions of lions and lambs, of Southern chivalry and Northern hyenas, of Copperheads and Butternuts, and Abolitionists, and all manner of opposing elements, all joined together in one grand Happy Family? Did not every one instinctively picture to himself the mild and gentle faces sure to be found at this meeting of the Peace and Reunion seekers? -- the intellectual and honest phiz of FERNANDO, the calm and philanthropic countenance of ISAIAH, the ambrosial curls of EDMON, and the general halo of meekness and serenity which would glorify the walls of Cooper Institute? And then the speeches sure to be heard, full of all gentleness and sweetness and piety, such as beseems those who come forth at the heavenly call of Peace and Reunion. They would all of course be earnestly in favor of free speech, so much so that it would not be very safe for any one to undertake to discuss the other side of the question in the hearing of the audience. They would be strong for the Union, so strong that not a word should be said against those who have armed themselves to overthrow it. They would be strenuous for the rights of the citizen and for a constitutional Government, so much so as to show plainly their sympathy with those who have based their rebellion upon a denial of those rights, and have striven to set up a despotism instead of a Constitution. And through all their outcry about the liberty of the citizen, about Free Speech and a Free Press, it would appear plainly enough that it is only because they have not the power that those who differ from them are not crushed under their feet by a tyranny which would, if it could, trample out even the thoughts of those who love freedom and would elevate the oppressed. Peace and Reunion! Well! we all would like to accomplish that. There is something of a difference, however, in the ways by which we would pursue it. We wish these gentry would be explicit as to the means by which they propose to attain both of these objects. We can understand how one who is ""opposed to the war and its continuance"" might go to work to obtain peace. He might say let the Army of the Potomac lie down, while LEE rushes over it, and burns Washington. Let GRANT retire from before Vicksburgh, and send back the hundred cannon which he has captured. Let ROSECRANS send a flag of truce to BRAGG, asking permission for his army to lay down their arms at the feet of the rebels whom they whipped at Stone's River. Let BANKS evacuate New-Orleans -- SCHOFIELD St. Lou is -- BURNSIDE Louisville, and MITCHELL Nashville. A vigorous prosecution of such measures might bring peace, but how about Reunion ? -- ay, how about Reunion ?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Peace and Reunion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Peace and Reunion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b1bf53f-ff6f-5a9d-b72e-e6e1c92e9886,663,nyt://article/3b1bf53f-ff6f-5a9d-b72e-e6e1c92e9886

The Crisis in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/07/archives/the-crisis-in-prussia-the-crisis-in-prussia-continues-the-king-has.html,The Crisis in,"This message was delivered and read to the House by Herr VON BISMARK himself, but it did not shake the resolution of the members, or produce the anticipated effect. On the contrary, it was declared to be based on misinformation, and a Committee was appointed to take it into consideration and prepare a suitable reply, in which doubtless ministerial calumnies will be refuted, and royal errors corrected. A heavy responsibility rests on the Deputies. For not only are their own privileges at stake, but even the fate of constitutionalism in Prussia. The Premier and his master are at present merely striving to get in the edge of the wedge. Let them succeed in this, and they will not cease till they have driven it home. Their assumptions are wholly unwarrantable. The right which President GRABOW claims is not a violation of the Prussian Constitution, is not derogatory to the Prussian monarchy. What are the rights of Ministers, and what is derogatory to the dignity of royalty, are questions as well understood in England as in Prussia, yet PALMERSTON, LAYARD and GLADSTONE are as liable to be called to order by the Speaker of the House of Commons, as the most insignificant of its members. But the Prussian Ministers are not, it seems, members of the Lower Chamber, and therefore they claim to be exempt from the jurisdiction of its President. What clause or article of the Constitution justifies this claim? The Constitution, indeed, requires them to attend the House, and authorizes them to take part in its discussions, but it nowhere stipulates that they shall be privileged to indulge in vituperation, insult the Deputies, and violate the rules of the Chamber with impunity. Had the Constitution given the Von Bismark Cabinet any such license, they would doubtless have demonstrated it; and yet, so late as the Autumn of the past year, we find the very Minister who has caused the trouble now pending, submitting as a matter of course to be called to order by President GRABOW, for the use of unparliamentary language, and humbly apologizing to the House for the indecorum. It was not till the debate on the cartel-conventions that a disposition was manifested by any member of the Cabinet to question the authority of the President, and the Premier himself was the first to set that example of insubordination which VON ROON has only too faithfully followed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Crisis in Prussia.; The crisis in Prussia continues.

His Peace and Free Speech Farce,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/07/archives/fernandos-farce.html,His Peace and Free Speech Farce,"It is generally supposed that the Americans, as a people, are keenly alive to the ludicrous, and that a party which, in this country, lays itself open to the shafts of ridicule, is already as good as dead, if not buried. If this be true, the Fernando Wood faction must be in a parlous state; for the recent peace meeting was certainly the most notable farce ever played in this City. The presence of that fighting apostle of peace, Capt. RYNDERS, was in itself a capital joke; and not less happy was the hoarse applause which repeatedly greeted the mild proposition to revolutionize the Government by force of arms! To judge from the appearance of the audience, an uninitiated person might have been led to congratulate the City upon the recent conversion of a very large proportion of her rowdies and red-mugs to the Quaker faith; and this, it must be confessed, was another capital stroke on the part of the peace-mongers. It would have moved the ghost of George Fox himself to inextinguishable laughter, to see such an audience vociferously applauding the pacific sentiments of FERNANDO WOOD, and hi-hi-ing when the angelic prophecy of ""Peace on earth and good will to men"" was alluded to. We have always known WOOD to be a man of daring genius. We are not accustomed to be startled at what he says or does; but we never expected that even he would have the temerity to present a crowd of New-York roughs as the harbingers of the Millenium!

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/07/archives/the-returning-regiments-facts-connected-with-the-thirtyseventh-and.html,,"The Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth NewYork regiments did not arrive in this city till 1 o'clock yesterday morning, although it was confidently expected they would reach here by 10 or 11 A.M. on Friday. It was known here early on Friday morning that the regiments had got as far as Philadelphia, and information to that effect was telegraphed to the military committees at the Astor House, and to the Committee on National Affairs of the Common Council. The time occupied in transferring a few hundred soldiers from Philadelphia to New-York, is usually about six hours, and, in this instance, it was understood by all parties concerned in the reception, that ample preparations had been made for placing the troops on board the cars at the former city and sending them to this point. In accordance with the programme of arrangements the military escort, consisting of several regiments, the whole under the command of Brig.-Gen. HALL, was marched to the Battery, there to await the arrival of the returning regiments. Broadway, from the Battery to Union-square, was thronged, as were also the steps and esplanade in front of the City Hall, with citizens who had assembled to witness the grand ovation to be extended to the gallant volunteers. Hour after hour this large military and civic concourse was kept in anxious waiting for the expected troops, and it was not definitely known by the public till 6 P.M., that the regiments would not arrive in season to participate in the reception which it was proposed to give them on that day. Possibly some few persons in the crowd might have inferred that the delay was the result of political intrigue, but the people generally evidently believed that accident alone prevented the regiment from arriving here at the appointed time. That the troops were purposely detained at Philadelphia is now well-known and freely admitted. Why they were not allowed to reach here at a seasonable hour on Friday will be explained hereafter, and the names of the individuals who identified themselves with the movement will be announced in connection with a full explanation of the affair to be made by a City official. Taking into consideration the great expense attending a reception like the one proposed, it was no light matter that the arrangements should be seriously interrupted, and the thousands of people who were disappointed in not seeing the regiments, did not probably take it all as a good joke. It seems that the Military Committees and the Committee on National Affairs of the Common Council, different as to the arrangements to be observed, consequently, instead of all the Committees working harmoniously together for the benefit of the returning regiments, the Military and the Common Council Committees worked to get the lead of each other; and although the Military Committee temporarily succeeded in accomplishing their object, it remains, to be seen what will finally be done by the Committee on National Affairs. It has been decided to publicly receive the regiments to-morrow, and if the weather should prove favorable, the display will be the grandest that has yet taken place on a similar occasion. The proceedings will be managed entirely by the Committee on National Affairs. Ald. BOOLE. Chairman of the Sub-Committee, consulted with Gen. HAIL yesterday, and received from him the assurance that nothing should be waning on his part to make the event equal the expectation. In the evening the Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth will be entertained with a dinner at the City Assembly Rooms. Yesterday, the Thirty-eighth matched from the Park Barracks to the Arsenal on White-street, which place they will make their temporary quarters.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RETURNING REGIMENTS.; Facts Connected with the ThirtySeventh and Thirty-Eighth NewYork Volunteers.The Reasons why the Regiments did not Arriveat the Appointed Time.

In one respect the Convention was a great success. There was really a national representation of interests there. The City of St. Louis and the City of St. Paul on the far-off Mississippi, had numerous and able delegations present, and so had the City of Portland, the City of Boston, of New-York, and the City of Oswego, on the remote Atlantic and Lake coasts. And all the large cities between -- Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, &c. -- sent representatives to take part in the important deliberations. In most cases, the Boards of Trade of the several cities undertook to act in appointing members to the Convention, but in many other cases municipal authorities sent delegates; and a great many prominent politicians were present voluntarily, because of their general interest in the subject to be considered by the Convention. Upon the whole, while it was a ""mixed Commission"" as well as a voluntary one, it was a very full and fair representation of the opinions and wishes of the country in regard to the great works of internal improvement that are contemplated. Avery great concourse of persons was drawn about the Convention, betokening a deep interest in it, and a quite emphatic popular approval.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Results of the Canal Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Results of the Canal Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06907a08-4aca-5d81-8889-c75a7598f060,948,nyt://article/06907a08-4aca-5d81-8889-c75a7598f060

"The Savannah Republican contains an interesting letter from HERSCHEL V.

The amendment proposed to incorporate the doctrine of secession into the Constitution, so that there could be no mistake about it in the future. It provided that when any State being aggrieved by any act of Congress shall by convention declare the act to be unconstitutional. Congress shall call a convention of the States, and if the act is not approved by two-thirds of the States, it shall be void; but if it is affirmed and no adjustment can be made satisfactory to the complaining State, that State shall, if it choose, be allowed to secede in peace.

It was based simply and purely upon pretence, and therefore merits the fate that has been awarded to it. Without a single male artist, without a second or third rate prima donna, without in fact anything that constitutes a company, it would have been strange, indeed, if a different result had been attained. A limited knowledge of English seems to have been the only art capital of the concern, but this was hardly a sufficient of an attraction to justify double prices. It was a mistake to call the concern an English opera; every one knew that it was nothing of the kind; it was a mistake, also, after bestowing on it the name of Italian opera, to commence with ""Il Trovatore,"" a work which does not depend on the contralto voice, and which in every respect has been given so well and so often at the Academy, that a hasty performance elsewhere, without the attraction of grand artists, was not likely to excite the community. And this is just the point; the ???public does not want hasty performances of opera anywhere, and least of all, in a theatrical establishment. It would have been a disgrace to any but a provincial community if Mlle. VESTVALI's miserable attempt had succeeded. Better a thousand times no opera, than have it cause such needy experiments. Still, we are sorry that the lady has been the victim of a mistaken idea. She is an excellent and graceful actress, and a singer who generally succeeds in pleasing the public. After a long absence, she was justified in expecting a hearty and genial reception. On some future occasion she will, we are sure, attain it; but we warn her again against any new experiment in management. On Friday next Mlle. VESTVALI will take her benefit.

They were soon followed by several Vermont regiments, and a charge on the rifle-pits resulted in the capture of some sixty or seventy prisons. The pontoons were then laid by the engineers, and the remainder of the division was crossed over. Our force gradually felt its way out to a position where it remained for the night, and on Saturday morning the reconnoissance was continued. Our skirmishers brought in some thirty others prisoners, during Friday night, making the number captured about two hundred. The results of the reconnoissauce are most important.

We are glad that Gen. HOOKER made this reconnoissance, if it were but to quiet the public mind. The reconnoissance itself was admirably executed in all its details. It is to be hoped that Gen. HOOKER may by such means as this keep himself thoroughly posted in regard to rebel manoeuvres. In this way, they will neither be able to surprise us, as they did by the retreat from Manassas, nor assail us with overwhelming force at unexpected times and places, as they have so often done.

Banishment of Rebels and the Richmond Sentinel,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/09/archives/the-banishment-of-rebels.html,Banishment of Rebels and the Richmond Sentinel,"The question how to receive and how to treat the disloyal citizens of the United States who have recently been sent through to the rebel lines and warned not to return till the war is over, is under discussion in the Confederacy, and exciting no small degree of feeling. We published yesterday a very bitter philippic from the Richmond Sentinel on the subject, which is a type of the prevailing spirit of the rebel Press. The policy of sending these persons South is denounced in a spirit of extraordinary bitterness and ferocity. The Sentinel exclaims: ""What should our Government do in response to this demoniacal outrage of our enemies?"" And it answers: Some ""will cry out precipitately 'Raise the black flag.' Perhaps it will come to that."" But the Sentinel intimates that chiefly cowards and laggards who keep themselves out of harm's way will join in this cry for the ""black flag,"" and therefore it suggests other modes of meeting the issue. The allusion to the black flag by one who so obviously regards the frequent appeal to it by rebel noncombatants with a good degree of contempt, is only made by the Sentinel, we judge, to remind the people of the North that there is a ""black flag"" kept in Dixie, finished, folded and ready for us, and only withheld from the breezy winds of Southern battle by the forbearance of our foes.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Banishment of Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Banishment of Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/837616b6-d62c-54cf-8860-3c233775f8f3,957,nyt://article/837616b6-d62c-54cf-8860-3c233775f8f3

BANKS' army at Port Hudson via New-Orleans, up to the 1st inst., and from Gen. GRANT'S army at Vicksburgh up to the 3d. At each of the two scenes of action at these respective dates, things were in a very similar state. Gen. GRANT'S army was still investing Vicksburgh, with his right and left wings resting on the Mississippi River; Gen. BANKS' army was investing Port Hudson, 228 miles below Vicksburgh, with the right and left wings of his army resting on the river. GRANT had made no assault in force upon the Vicksburgh defences since the attack of the 22d, which was unsuccessful; and BANKS had made no assault upon the Port Hudson works since the attempt of the 27th, which also was unsuccessful. All that has been done at Vicksburgh for the last eighteen days has been to keep the rebel garrison awake by an active fire from the siege guns in the rear and the gunboats in front; and precisely the same course has been pursued at Port Hudson for a fortnight past. The latest advices from Vicksburgh indicate that it is GRANT's plan to pursue the siege steadily and mainly by engineering operations, with an expectation that the garrison must soon succumb from hunger; and our New-Orleans letters of this morning set forth that BANKS intends pursuing a similar plan, with like hopes. In one important point, however, there is a difference: -- while we hear much about the great rebel army that JOHNSTON is gathering in the rear of Gen. GRANT, we hear nothing whatever of any rebel force in Gen. BANKS' rear. This is fortunate for Gen. BANKS, for his army is very much smaller than that of Gen. GRANT, and is not so favorably posted to resist an attack in the rear. It is fortunate for both of these excellent commanders that they have first-class naval officers to cooperate with them. Admiral FARRAGUT has been as uniformly successful and brilliant in all his naval operations as BANKS has been in his land operations in Louisiana; and Admiral PORTER's operations have only been less glorious than those of Gen. GRANT because they have been so very much smaller in their sweep and aim. Gen. BANKS and Gen. GRANT communicate with each other by means of couriers along the Louisiana bank of the river.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mississippi River Operations of Gens.

The flames were first discovered in a rear room on the second floor occupied by MARY DANIELS, and so rapidly did the fire spread that it cut off all means of escape for those persons living on the third floor, unless they saw fit to leap from the windows to the pavement below. Rather than perish in the flames, several persons jumped out, and were more or less injured, while four others were overcome by the heat and smoke, and were burned to death. Capt. JOURDON, of the Sixth Precinct, Sergeant WALSH and Roundsmen RYAN and HOPKINS and a platoon of men were early on the ground, as also were several fire engines, and rendered efficient service, doubtless saving several lives and much property. While the fire was raging furiously MARGARET KEATING, an Irishwoman, 50 years of age, leaped from the third story window of the tenement and was dangerously injured. By direction of Capt. JOURDON, Officer MORIARTY conveyed her to the New-York Hospital, but she was refused admittance, the officer being told that Bellevue Hospital was the proper place to take her. The woman was accordingly forthwith conveyed to that institution. ELLEN MCCONNELL, also an Irishwoman, 40 years of age, jumped from the third story window, but before reaching the ground Roundsman HOPKINS caught her in his arms, thereby in all probability saving her life. She was but slightly injured. JOHN SANDS, an Irish laborer, 32 years of age, was fearfully burned on his arms and back, while endeavoring to make his escape through the flames. He was removed to the New-York Hospital, where it is thought he cannot long survive. The fire was extinguished with all possible haste, after which Capt. JOURDON and his officers searched the ruins, and on the third floor found the charred remains of ALICE MURPHY, a widow woman, 35 years of age, and folded in her arms was MARY ALICE MURPHY, her little daughter, four years old. BRIDGET GRAY was found Iving dead almost beside Mrs. MURPHY, and in a rear room, Iving on a bed, was the dead body of MARY JANE MCMASTERS. All the bodies were so blackened and burned as to be almost past recognition. The women were all natives of Ireland, and from 35 to 40 years of age. The remains were conveyed to the Sixth Ward Station-house, where Coroner WILDEY subsequently held an inquest over them.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/10/archives/presidential-smiles.html,,"-- There are certain persons in Washington who observe closely the President's countenance, and telegraph to the Press from time to time the result of their observations. If Mr. LINCOLN smiles and looks joyful, it is evident he has some good news, which the public will learn by and by. If he looks glum and dismal, it is because he has ominous tidings locked up in his bosom. We always look upon such signs dubiously -- knowing that the President's facial muscles are much more likely to be affected by the state of his stomach than by the condition of the country. It appears they also have people in Richmond who watch JEFF. DAVIS' face, and, in lack of other news, report to the rebels what they find there. It is evident that they, too, sometimes make a fearful miss; for they report that on the 18th ult., the great traitor was seen to smile and heard to make a very gleeful remark concerning affairs at Vicksburgh. Now, of all the days in the present year, the 18th of May was the day when JEFF. DAVIS should not have smiled, if his smiles were to be taken as true indexes of his successes. For, on the day before, Gen. GRANT had defeated the rebel army at Vicksburgh, after having previously inflicted upon them a quartette of defeats; and on that very day he moved up to Vicksburgh, captured Haines' Bluff, and effected the investment of the place. We wish the reporter had told us on which side of his face JEFF. smiled, then or subsequently; and if our Washington friends would also be a little more particular as to the precise character of Mr. LINCOLN's ""smiles,"" they would confer additional obligations on an anxious and distracted country.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PRESIDENTIAL SMILES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PRESIDENTIAL SMILES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ba6de46-b09c-5e63-bf91-d199c1b92e4e,297,nyt://article/5ba6de46-b09c-5e63-bf91-d199c1b92e4e

They confirm the French report of the fall of Puebla, but differ materially as to the details of that event. It appears that on the 15th and 16th of May, the French were repulsed before the Fortress Carmen. Meantime the garrison and inhab???tants were reduced to a state of starvation, and their ammunition was entirely exhausted, Gen. COMONFORT having failed to cut his way through with supplies. On the 17th Gen. FOREY offered to for the Mexican officers and soldiers march out ???ho officers with their side-arms, provided they would give a parole not to serve against the French again. This was refused. Gen. ORTEGA then spike??? his cannon, burnt his gun carriages, destroyed the arms of his infantry, and surrendered himself and garrison as prisoners of war. Several prominent Mexican officers committed suicide by shooting themselves, rather than become prisoners. The advance of the French army was at Cholula, only six miles beyond Puebla. The Mexicans were much embittered. All Frenchman within the capital had been ordered to leave within eight days, and the approaches to the city were to be defended to the last.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/938856ff-ee54-5870-adc2-fe303d7b52e1,1359,nyt://article/938856ff-ee54-5870-adc2-fe303d7b52e1

Veteran Observer on Development of the American Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/12/archives/men-and-women.html,Veteran Observer on Development of the American Race,"-- The ""Veteran Observ- er"" of the TIMES furnished an interesting disquisition on Tuesday upon the position of the American Man among the races of the world. Basing his remarks upon statistics of the State of Ohio, he showed that in height the American man surpassed the men of other nations; that in measurement round the chest he was surpassed by only one European people; that the solid contents of his body were nearly as great as that of the larger-chested man, and much greater than of most other peoples; and from these facts the corollary was drawn that, in strength and capacity for labor, the American man is superior to the European. This is a topic of very great interest, and we could wish that the collated statistics from which to form conclusions were much more extensive than they are. There never was such an opportunity as now to obtain data on the subject, from military sources; and we hope some of our statisticians or statistical societies will embrace it, and work up the material. Probably the conclusions our correspondent draws from the Ohio man are not applicable to the people of all the other sections of the country -- not, for instance, to some of the Eastern States. Travelers and observers have noticed the remarkable development in stature and bulk of the people grown in some of the Western and Southern States, especially the agricultural classes, in Ohio. Kentucky, East Tennessee and Northern Georgia; and, as all these regions were largely populated from Virginia, the same remark may apply to that State. Hoosiers and Vermonters are also noted for their vast length, and perhaps with good reason. On all these points information might be gathered from regimental records, and the offices of the Adjutants-General of States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MEN AND WOMEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MEN AND WOMEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a9c3c33-e460-514b-8795-b7b84bccc287,424,nyt://article/2a9c3c33-e460-514b-8795-b7b84bccc287

Not for a long time has a more interesting entertainment been presented in our sister city. The pupils, though generally quite young, performed their various parts with a promptitude, a precision, and a spirit that would have done credit to any age. The Primary (youngest) Department, especially excited admiration. Nothing could be more charming than some of their singing, their tableaux, and their calisthenic performances. The excellence of the older girls in elocution, who are under the charge of Miss TUTHILL, now and for the last seven years Principal of the Female Grammar Department, also evoked great applause. One performance in this department was particularly effective -- a representation of the States by thirty-five girls in white, arranged in groups -- the seven loyal and the four disloyal of the original thirteen, the fifteen loyal and seven disloyal of the later States. A most pathetic appeal was made by Western Virginia to Old Virginia to return to the old altars; then a classic, yet unsparing rebuke by Massachusetts to the four faithless ones of the old family; then a rougher admonition by ""Old Kentuck,"" directed to the other recreants; and, finally, a magnanimous address by New-York, as the Empire State, to all, in the spirit of prophecy. The elocution of each of the four misses who sustained these parts was remarkably fine, and could hardly be excelled in any institution of the country, however high its grade. The patriotic spirit that pervaded all the exercises was very marked, and attested that the teachers are fully alive to the duty they owe the country. Brooklyn has reason to be proud of this school, and all the more so because its pupils are mainly drawn from the poorer classes of the city. The constant improvement and elevation of our free public schools of this character is one of the most encouraging developments of the times; and every citizen should feel in it both an individual interest and a personal pride.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6f9871e8-fa8e-5859-a46d-f11f3852f812,392,nyt://article/6f9871e8-fa8e-5859-a46d-f11f3852f812

New-York Yacht Club Regatta,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/12/archives/local-intelligence-newyork-yacht-club-regatta-a-good-race-and-a.html,New-York Yacht Club Regatta,"Water is a desirable element for yacht racing, as well as for canals, aqueducts and navigation generally. It is not, however, so essential over, as it is under the yachts. Therefore, as far as the rain of yesterday concerned the yacht race, it may be considered out of place. But, after all, it was ""only a shower,"" and brought its compensation in a fair breeze that filled the sails of the white winged coursers in the lower bay until their speed vied with the steam tugs, so that upon the whole the yachtsmen have no complaints to make of Jupiter Pluvius. The day was fair enough for the veriest landlubber to keep his sea legs, and still the breeze was one which the Club would be glad to insure for the next year. To be sure, only fifteen of the half a hundred yachts of the Club entered for the race, and a contest with the Julia, Una, Rebecca, America, Henrietta and Widgeon left out, is much like ""Hamlet"" with the part of Hamlet left out, or the TIMES without its editorial page; still, the dozen boats that did sail afforded a fair day's amusement. It is likewise a fact that the Regatta Committee, Messrs. HASWELL, ROLLINS and WESTRAY, did not succeed in enabling the representatives of the Press to see either the start or the close of the race, but they performed wonders in the line of duty. They did all the ciphering beforehand, so that the dear public knew, what it never knew before, that the first three boats reaching the home stakeboat, would take the first three prizes. This was a great advance, because, heretofore, it appeared to be the fact that races were won by ciphering and not by sailing, ""the allowance of time"" often making an apparently late boat really the winner. The Committee did all their ciphering before the start, which simplified matters much. To be sure, no opportunity was furnished the press, to ascertain what was ""the allowance of time influenced by the wind at the time of starting."" But, as Mr. TOOTS philosophically remarked, it's of no consequence, we know who won, as the sequel will show. It was an excellent regulation of the Committee, that each yacht sailing in the race should carry her signal at her peak; but the Committee cannot be blamed because some yachts carried signals not down in the flagbook, another, a signal that belonged to different yachts, and others didn't carry any signals at all. In fact, there was every proof that the Club would have done the spectators a great service had it adopted the sensible suggestion of Mr. GODWIN, made about ten years since, that each yacht shall carry a plain distinguishing mark like the numbers on the sails of the pilot boats. With the exception, therefore, of an opportunity to see all the race, or to know much about what they did see, the members of the Press were well cared for by the Committee. Certainly they could ask no better attention to their creature comforts, and, if they had gone to the Regatta to eat, drink and be merry, instead of to report, they could have no cause for complaint. It is not intended hereby to suggest that the eating, drinking, or being merry should be curtailed, but, that the facilities for reporting should be increased.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; NEW-YORK YACHT CLUB REGATTA.

Any attempt to lay down a code of rules for the government of all journalists will fail, -- as indeed all attempts to secure unity of action among newspapers on any subject will fail, and ought to fail. The utility of the Press depends entirely on its independence -- by which we mean not its power as a combination to defy hostility, but the complete freedom of each individual editor to express, without dictation from Government, or from any class or profession, even his own, as such, the views on public affairs of those for whom to a certain extent he speaks.

Pre- cisely what all these signs are, it may be as well not to publish. In both of the armies on the Rappahannock things look unsettled and stormy. HOOKER's late infantry movement to the other side of the river, just below the rebel lines, and his cavalry movement to Culpepper Court-house, in the opposite direction, show that he is closely watching the enemy, either with designs upon him or to learn his designs. The movement of a heavy rebel force to Culpepper Court-house, consisting of detachments of two arms of their service and the whole of their cavalry arm, -- and the reconnoissances of the rebels toward the Potomac, indicate their projects if not their plans; while the fact that all the able-bodied citizens of Pennsylvania have been summoned to arms by Gen. COUCH, shows the deep and pervading apprehension of invasion. Gen. ROSECRANS, in the West, has received some newspaper censure for remaining so long inactive, while GRANT was waging his heroic battles around Vicksburgh. It is altogether unjust, as those who give it would admit, if they comprehended ROSECRANS' position and his assigned duty. His half-year's inactivity, however, is likely to be broken very soon, and that, too, by his own act.

If we play eternal smash with GRANT, good bye to poor ROSECRANS; but if GRANT gives PEMBERTON his quietus, then farewell, a long farewell, to the proposed reoccupation of Nashville and southern Kentucky."" The Rebel is right in its speculations on the vast bearings of the campaign against Vicksburgh, and the results likely to follow upon the success or failure of either side. It is not merely Vicksburgh -- not merely the Mississippi River -- it is the whole Southwest whose fate will be decided, for some time at least, by the fortunes of GRANT. The fall of Fort Donelson, far north on the Cumberland River, carried our arms to Nashville, to the southern line of Tennessee, to Florence in Alabama, and subsequently to Memphis and to Vicksburgh itself. Hardly less far-reaching could be the results of a success at Vicksburgh. We doubt whether the rebels would try to make a stand anywhere west of the Tombigbee River, and they might even find it necessary to retreat to Montgomery or Atlanta. It would probably also compel BRAGG to evacuate Shelbyville by making an attack on his rear feasible, and might give us possession of East Tennessee, and plant us on the line of Georgia, and close to the Southwestern line of Virginia. The fall of Donelson not only gave us half the rebel territory this side of the river, but, in its consequences, it may be said to have given us the whole country west of the Mississippi; for no great rebel armies have latterly existed in that region; and the occupation of its stragetic points is simply a matter of our convenience. If we obtain the States of Mississippi and Alabama by the fall of Vicksburgh, that section would probably be for some time in the same condition in which the trans-Mississippi region has been -- haunted by guerrillas and having small rebel bodies stationed here and there to give us trouble. But the war there, in its larger features, would be closed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILITARY BEARINGS IN THE SOUTHWEST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILITARY BEARINGS IN THE SOUTHWEST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/630f1151-3840-599a-aec5-237450721ca8,352,nyt://article/630f1151-3840-599a-aec5-237450721ca8

There is the Invalid Corps, for such disabled soldiers as are unfitted for hard field service, yet are anxious to spend their lives in the lighter military labors, such as garrison duty, etc. This furnishes a splendid opening for our wounded veterans who are now daily coming out of the hospitals convalescent. Only those men disabled in the service, whether still in the army or honorably discharged, will be received in this Corps of Honor. Those capable of performing guard duty and light marches will be assigned to duty in the First Battalion; those who have lost an arm, to the Second Battalion; those who have lost a leg, and are least effective, to the Third Battalion.

Closing of the Chambers by the King,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/14/archives/a-prussian-coup-detat.html,Closing of the Chambers by the King,"WILLIAM of Brandenburgh has just put an end to the controversy between his Government and the Lower Chamber, by closing the Diet. The reasons assigned in the royal speech for this arbitrary proceeding cannot justify it. The addresses of the national representatives to the King, denouncing the illegal acts of Ministers; their opposition to the cartel conventions; their refusal to suffer the privileges of their President to be curtailed, afford but a poor basis for such a course; and if the people should conclude that their deputies have been dismissed because they dared to discharge their public duties, the conviction will not tend to strengthen the Court party at the next election. The sudden closing of the Chamber could not indeed have occurred at a more favorable period for the interests of liberty. Had the session been prolonged, the popular branch of the Diet, by factious obstruction of some beneficial measure, might have given the Cabinet a plausible pretext for getting rid of them. But now the Representatives can return to their constituents, and say, ""We have been dismissed, ere the public business had well commenced, because we have stood up for your rights and ours, because we have attempted to shield Prussia from dishonor.""

The joy which this intelligence will diffuse through the Confederacy will be, we need hardly say, as intense as it is pure, for it will, of course, at once put a stop to hostilities, and relieve the South from the pressure of misery and privation under which it has so long labored. The only sad reflection which this happy event is calculated to inspire is the thought that it should not have happened sooner. Nobody who possesses a spark of humanity can avoid deploring the unnatural reticence which led the Democratic party to conceal their real sentiments so long, when the utterance of them was all that was needed to put an end to ""this dreadful war."" It is well known that the sole reason for which the Cotton States left the Union was their mistaken notion that nobody at the North wanted them in it, and the citizens in those parts being men of sensitive and retiring dispositions, of course got out of it as fast as possible, and now resolutely persist in staying out, and are fighting in the conviction that the aim of the radicals is simply to cut the throats of all the adult males, and lead the women and children into captivity. Now we cannot help saying that under these circumstances, the Democratic party has been guilty of culpable negligence in not coming forward at the outset, and in a frank and manly way telling JEFFERSON DAVIS and his friends that they would prefer that the South would not leave the Union; and that it was heartily welcome to remain in it as long as it pleased.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Card of Invitation to the South, with Compliments of the Democracy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Card of Invitation to the South, with Compliments of the Democracy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a6d9df4-1921-5046-b43b-c6aae163ccf8,1055,nyt://article/5a6d9df4-1921-5046-b43b-c6aae163ccf8

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/16/archives/journalists-in-the-army.html,,"-- We have news of serious wounds received by two former attaches of the TIMES, now holding responsible official positions in the army. At the recent attack on Port Hudson, it is stated that Major G.C. CARR, of the second battalion of Duryee's Zouaves, was very severely wounded while leading his regiment into action; and Capt. ADAM BADEAU, of Gen. SHERMAN's Staff; also received a severe wound in the foot. Both these gentlemen left the TIMKS establishment to enter the army and both have rendered most honorable and effective service. Major CARR took the field at the very outset of the war, as Lieutenant in the original regiment of Duryee's Zouaves, and took part in nearly all the engagements from Big Bethel down until the formation of the Second regiment, which was due largely to his personal efforts. Capt. BADEAU joined the army at Port Royal, and, after a brief transfer of service to the West, went with Gen. SHERMAN to the Lower Mississippi. Both are young men of ability, energy and promise, and will, we trust, recover from their wounds and add largely to the service they have already rendered. Capt. BADEAU is a brother-in-law of Gen.

Emancipation in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/16/archives/emancipation-in-missouri.html,Emancipation in,"To-morrow the State Convention of Missouri meets, under the call of Gov. GAMBLE, to consider the subject of Emancipation. The present Convention was elected more than two years ago, and it was composed at that time of uncompromising Unionists, but in large part of equally uncompromising ProSlavery men, STERLING PRICK, for instance, of rebel fame, was a member; and so was URIEL WRIGHT, of St. Louis; and several others of marked ability and influence, who have long since abandoned the Union cause because they could not love it more than they did Slavery, and have cast their fortunes with the seceded States. This purgation, together with the hard lessons and incalculable losses that two years of war have inflicted on Missouri, has effected a great change in the opinions of the members of the Convention, and in the public sentiment of the State. There is not a reasonable doubt that a majority of the people now demand the adoption of some system by which Slavery shall be abolished as speedily as is compatible with the good order of society. And it would be unjust to the members of the Convention who have shared in the lessons of the past, to suppose that they will not respond to the manifest expressions of the popular will. Nevertheless, it is proper to advise the Eastern friends of emancipation in Missouri that a so-called “radical party” has sprung up in St. Louis, and has some sympathy throughout the State, which demands “immediate and unconditional emancipation,” and seems willing to abide no other policy. The Convention will not be inspired by the counsels of this new party. Nor is it well that it should, for a more Quixotic party, if it should be dignified by such an appellation, has seldom illustrated the fierce politics of the fecund West. It is this same modest organization that recently demanded of President LINCOLN the expulsion of Mr. SEWARD and several others from his Cabinet, and the general reorganization of public affairs on a basis of radical Missouri ideas.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Emancipation in Missouri.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Emancipation in Missouri.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Missouri', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a6ef26c-2e7d-5682-a9a1-a7d4a6e8c7d0,620,nyt://article/0a6ef26c-2e7d-5682-a9a1-a7d4a6e8c7d0

Being of an enterprising turn, and with a mind for comprehensive combinations, he identified himself with the railroad work of the West, and for twenty years has been in the lead of the great internal improvements of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. He has achieved a more indisputable success as a builder and operator of railroads than any other man in those States, and has a reputation for integrity, sagacity and business habits, that is known and appreciated, and that makes his name a household word in every hamlet in Ohio. In addition, he is a War Democrat of the most unblenching sort. He has never slackened or varied in his support of the Government in its first duty to suppress the rebellion.

In fact, two of the loyal States are already invaded; but whether the movement will result in success or failure, remains to be seen. We find in the Baltimore papers of yesterday morning, an account of the movement up the Shenandoah Valley of a large rebel force, ascertained to be the corps of LEE's army, lately under command of Stonewall JACKSON, but now commanded by Gen. EWELL. This force, estimated at from ten to eighteen thousand men, was discovered on Friday last, moving up on the Strasburgh road. On approaching Winchester, on Saturday morning, they were met by the National forces, under Gen. MILROY, and a severe battle ensued, resulting in the repulse of the rebels. The engagement was renewed during the afternoon, and again on Sunday, and was in progress at last advices. The National force, at Berryville, in Clerk County, eleven miles from Winchester, were also attacked on Saturday, but it is believed that they succeeded in cutting their way through and joined Gen. MILROY at Winchester. On Sunday, a body of rebels, estimated at from three to live thousand, appeared in the vicinity of Martinsburgh, having passed around Winchester, and demanded, the surrender of the place, which was refused and a battle commenced, which was still in progress at 7 o'clock, when telegraphic communication beyond Harper's Ferry ceased. The National cavalry force stationed at Kearneysville, eight miles east of Martinsburgh, fell back to Duffield's depot, five miles west of Harper's Ferry. Some severe skirmishing also occurred at Middletown on Friday, between the rebel advance and our cavalry and artillery, in which the rebel troops suffered severely. This much we learn from the Baltimore papers. For a knowledge of subsequent events we have to rely upon such telegrams as have been allowed to come over the wires. From them we gather that the rebels have succeeded in crossing the Potomac, in forcing their way across the narrow part of Maryland, and have penetrated Pennsylvania. It was judged from this fact yesterday that Gen. MILROY had been finally overpowered at Winchester on Sunday, and forced to surrender: but a dispatch received last night from Baltimore brings as the assurance that, though surrounded by 18,000 men, he succeeded in cutting his way out, and uniting with our forces at Harper's Ferry. The force at Martinsburgh also succeeded we are assured, in reaching Harper's Ferry. Dispatches received yesterday afternoon from Greencastle and Bolton's Station, Penn., announced that Hagerstown, Md., had been evacuated, the troops falling back to Chambersburgh had probably been captured, but about the latter there appears to be no certainly. In the meantime we hear nothing of Gen. HOOKER, who is undoubtedly operating somewhere against the main army of LEE.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d0b2e71c-d2a1-5328-a5f8-7158790f5bbb,952,nyt://article/d0b2e71c-d2a1-5328-a5f8-7158790f5bbb

It may be thought passing strange that we were not permitted to hear of these important battles two days ago. They were known in Baltimore and Washington on Sunday, and details of them were published in the Baltimore papers of yesterday morning. It is the withholding of the news of rebel movements, that does more than anything else to precipitate the country into demoralizing excitements. We were assured last week, up to its very last day, that the rebel army was still at Fredericksburgh -- while the fact is, that they must have begun their march with the week, for on Friday they appeared before Winchester, in the Shenandoah Valley, with 18,000 men, and another force as high up as Martinsburgh, on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The people of Pennsylvania were in as great darkness as ourselves, and the rebel army, by a forced march might actually have filed into Philadelphia while its shad-bellied citizens were reading in their morning papers that all was quiet on the Rappahannock. Now, as a matter of course, on learning the facts, they are in an unparalleled condition of excitement; and even the Copperheads, who were preparing to hold their great Peace meeting in Independence-square, may first have to fight two or three battles with the rebels for its possession.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rebel Invasion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rebel Invasion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Maryland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f44ac3e5-a8fd-5cb8-8d5d-ad1da6b73a91,894,nyt://article/f44ac3e5-a8fd-5cb8-8d5d-ad1da6b73a91

Furloughs have been given out quite freely of late -- much exceeding, we believe, either two or three to the hundred men; and leaves of absence to officers of all grades have been extensively granted. We hope some of these gentlemen will now strain a point to get back to their regiments. We should like to have them among us always; but the rebels are now ravaging Pennsylvania, and every soldier we have is needed to drive them back. The nation sustains the prodigious burdens connected with its vast army at present in hope that the rebellion may be speedily crushed. Thus far, in the East, we have not been brilliantly successful; but, if ever circumstances demanded of us a great and united effort, it is at present. Patriotism and honor should lead every absent soldier, who can make it possible, to rush back to the ranks; as it has led thousands of our citizen-militia again to officer their services to the Government.

A short time must develop the truth in the matter. His plan and course are doubtless clearly enough marked out in his own mind. But their execution will depend very much upon us.

We conjectured that as soon as the South heard for the first time that the democracy of the North would “hail with delight” its return to the Union, it would take immediate steps for coming back. It is now evident that the leaders of the rebellion are desirous of meeting as many of their Northern fellow-citizens as can be got together in Convention at either Harrisburgh or Philadelphia; at the date of the last accounts it had not been decided which it was to be. And we may guess how hearty and zealous they are in this great movement, from the enormous size of the delegation which they are sending forward. There is no Peace Democrat who can avoid feeling a glow of satisfaction at the thought that 90,000 or 100,000 of the bone and sinew of the South should have started Northward, to confer and discuss, the minute they heard that the great Peace party would be pleased to see “them return to their allegiance.” We doubt if the South has ever yet been so well represented in any of the conferences which she has held with the Northern democracy.

The excitement of course to fever heat, and the manufacturers had a meeting on Sunday night, and resolved that business be temporarily suspended, that the workmen might have an opportunity of fortifying the city. On Monday a crowd of several thousand workmen gathered together, and rumors of the near approach of the rebels also gathered thick and fast. It may be thought that the men rushed headlong to work with pick and shovel, fortifying. Not at all. They marched up to the hotel where the local commander was stopping, and called for a speech! The officer did not gratify them, but the crowd was determined to have a speech from some one, and various gentlemen were called upon. Finally, it is reported, an “old soldier, three sheets in the wind, forced his way to the front of the balcony, and after waving his hand for silence,” began his speech, which was soon cut short; but he only gave way to another orator, who “proceeded to address the assemblage.” It is well that the rumor of the advance of the rebels, was a little ahead of the fact; for, had they been up to time, they would have found the citizens busily engaged -- one class in making speeches, and the other in listening to them.

The architectural views are truly remarkable, and afford a fine study of that branch of art; while the sculpture is reproduced with a roundness and truth that equals the original.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/18/archives/the-new-rebel-campaign.html,,"The news this morning from the Pennsylvania border is extremely meagre; and regarding the movements of LEE'S main body we yet know nothing whatever. We get not a glimpse of their general purpose, or the special end they propose to attempt. We have no new engagements to report -- no additional towns captured. The rebels hold Winchester, Martinsburgh, and Shepherdtown, in Virginia, and our troops lately at Harper's Ferry are reported to have crossed the Potomac and occupied Maryland Heights, which command the Ferry; the rebels also hold Williamsport, (at which they probably crossed the river,) and Hagerstown, in Maryland; and the farthest point their cavalry have reached in Pennsylvania is the town of Chambersburgh. The startling reports we had on Tuesday and Wednesday of the overwhelming masses of rebels that were filing into the State of Pennsylvania, appear to have been greatly exaggerated, and we should think, after sifting all accounts, that the force of rebel infantry that has crossed the Potomac is very limited. At each of half a dozen widely-apart points, it is thought that LEE is aiming directly at that point, and that all manoeuvres in the other directions are but feints. Pittsburgh in the West, and Harrisburgh in the east, are each anticipating the advent of the rebel army, while HOOKER's army in front of Washington, and Baltimore in its rear, are none the less on the alert for it. In the meantime, the most plausible theory of the whereabouts of LEE's army, is that which places it in the vicinity of the Bull Run Mountain, perhaps at Warrenton, though it may have pushed up as high as Manassas Gap and into the Shenandoah Valley. It is quite possible that LEE, when he struck in a northeasterly direction, had a purpose of making for Manassas Junction, with intent of setting between HOOKER's army and Washington, and attacking one or other of these forces before they got over their surprise, or could get themselves set for battle. But if so, HOOKER's equally rapid march from Falmouth to Bull Run, prevented this; and by this march, the latter officer planted himself in a position where he can cooperate with all the troops in front of Washington, and can receive reinforcements from all points with the greatest advantage. This march of HOOKER may have completely disarranged LEE's original plans, and compelled him to project an enterprise quite different from that which he set forth to accomplish. That enterprise would most likely be one into Maryland analogous to that which he attempted last year.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Rebel Campaign.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Rebel Campaign.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6bc49da-9ae4-5aaa-9a2c-5652f8a12a08,510,nyt://article/e6bc49da-9ae4-5aaa-9a2c-5652f8a12a08

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/18/archives/musical.html,,"WINTER GARDEN. -- Mr. EDWARD MOLLENRAUER'S tragic opera, called the ""Corsican Bride,"" was produced here Monday evening, The libretto is derived from a sanguinary piece called ""Rosa Gregoria,""and has been twisted into a lyric shape by Dr. A. KOEHLER, who is said to have a great deal to answer for. It will be remembered that some weeks since Mr. MOLLENHAUER gave a concert performance of some of the music at Irving Hall. The composer is a well-known orchestral conductor, and in this work proves that he possesses a vein of dramatic talent which, properly explored, might lead to valuable results. The opportunities for operatic composers in this country are few and far between. To get a single work produced requires the effort of a lifetime. The chances of improvement and increased facility, which much writing offer to really inventive minds, are consequently denied to Americans. This is the more to be lamented inasmuch as the earlier works in literature and in art, even of the most gifted men, bear distinct traces of the particular line of reading and fancy that has most pleased them. The labor of constant production can alone place a writer on the basis of his own ability, and enable him to be thoroughly original. Mr. [???] MOLLENHAUER's opera is the work of a young man whose memory is keener than his invention. The reminiscences which are noticeable in every act are the fruits of a well-cultivated mind, and prove that the composer has not forgotten his studies or the lighter impressions received in the opera house. We do not for a moment imagine that Mr. MOLLENHAUER would wittingly use a plagiarism, but he has undoubtedly repeated many ideas that have been used before. In other respects the music is fluent and graceful. We look in vain for those strong contrasts and overwhelming bursts of effect which are essential to the writer of serious opera. The combinations are quite ordinary, and the tempt and movements are singularly steady. It seems to us that Mr. MOLLENHAUER will find his talent best adapted to the treatment of lighter themes. We would at all events urge him to select a better libretto for his next work. No skill is displayed in the construction of the ""Corsican Bride,"" and some of the situations are positively ludicrous. The last tableau, in which everybody seems to be anxious to kill everybody, could be transferred bodily to a burlesque or a pantomime.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff4baf63-7643-5085-a5f2-a21911f0617d,527,nyt://article/ff4baf63-7643-5085-a5f2-a21911f0617d

The subject was referred to the Committee on National Affairs. An application from the City Inspector, for the use of a portion of the dock at the foot of East Twenty-third-street, for dumping purposes, was referred. Mr. FARLEY moved to direct the Clerk to furnish the proceedings of the Board to the Corporation papers designated by the Common Council. Mr. FROMENT questioned the propriety of adopting the motion, because the validity of the section of the law under which the Mayor and Comptroller selected Corporation papers, was now a question before the Courts. Mr. BOOLE disputed this, and remarked that the Courts were only considering the matter in respect to the meaning of the law. The action how proposed would bring the whole question to a direct issue. The newspapers concerned could publish the proceedings or not, as they might see fit, and such of them as chose to publish them, probably, would sue for their pay. Thus, without interfering with the action taken by the Mayor and Comptroller, it could be judicially determined whether the right of the Common Council, under the charter, to select their own advertising mediums, was abrogated. Mr. FROMENT thought this could all be done without adopting the motion made by Mr. FARLEY. Mr. BOOLE replied that it was desired that the papers should have the proceedings furnished to them officially. The motion was carried by 11 to 5.

At the State Convention which nominated VALLANDIGHAM for Governor they made bold to adopt the following resolution: ""That whenever it becomes practicable to obtain a Convention of all or three-fourths of the States, such body should be convened, for the purpose of proposing such amendments to the Federal Constitution as experience has proved to be necessary to maintain that instrument in the spirit and meaning intended by its founders, and to provide against future convulsions and wars.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Copperheads and ""the Constitution as It Is.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Copperheads and ""the Constitution as It Is.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ace13db-ba68-5902-b136-0be7e875985d,1191,nyt://article/2ace13db-ba68-5902-b136-0be7e875985d

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/19/archives/movements-of-city-regiments-departure-of-the-thirtyseventh.html,,"The noble response of the New-York State Militia of this City to the call for troops to meet the pressing emergency in Maryland and Pennsylvania, was exemplified yesterday by the departure of no less than three regiments -- the Thirty-seventh, Twenth-second, and Eleventh, making six regiments in two days, and the only reason why there were not eight, was because the requisite clothing and equipments were not to be had. The men were ready and eager to respond. And, it should be remembered these regiments marched with even fuller ranks than they have presented on the many parades in the City, of which the metropolis has been justly proud. No doubt, when they are all duly located, they will be joined by many members whose business would not admit of so sudden a departure, but whose hearts are still in the good cause The Seventh regiment, especially, will be largely augmented in a few days by members of this class, who are never known to shirk the duties of active service, and who feel proud of the reputation which the corps d???elite has achieved for promptness and efficiency in times of need. All of the regiments have experienced equal difficulty in procuring the supplies, owing partly to the uncertainty as to the number who would go, and partly to the necessary red tape with which all such proceedings are necessarily bound. Indeed the red tape has become quite a by-word with the soldiers, and it is shrewdly suspected that if the City of New-York were to be menaced to-morrow, by a fleet of rebel privateers, threatening to enter the harbor, it would be impossible to get the requisite ammunition or missiles for the guns in the harbor forts without an official order, duly signed, countersigned, inspected, revised, scrutinized, examined, tested by oath and affirmation, and duly delivered to the proper officer, at a convenient hour of the day. It can hardly be expected that the authorities can have the equipments and supplies for half a dozen regiments ready, to be available at the tap of the drum. But it would seem that since such emergencies as the present have arisen previously, and are likely to arise again, it would be a fortunate circumstance if some official could be found to take the responsibility and have things done in a common sense sort of way. By this it is not intended to censure the state officials, fort despite the malicious predictions of the peace ??? that Gov, S??? would never permit another soldier to leave the State, the State Government has do??? its part of the work with energy and will.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/20/archives/a-military-muddle.html,,"-- The curiously ""mixed"" condition of our military system, and the inefficiency resulting therefrom, has just had a striking illustration in Pennsylvania. When the first news of the projected invasion reached that State, Gen. COUCH, who had just been appointed to the command of the Department of the Susquehanna, summoned to arms, for the defence of the State, all citizens between the ages of 18 and 60, ""to serve during the pleasure of the President or the continuance of the war."" When the danger was more imminent, came the order of the Governor calling out the militia. When the rebels were actually on Pennsylvania soil, came the proclamation of the President, calling for one hundred thousand men, fifty thousand of whom were assigned as the quota of the Keystone State, ""to be mustered into service, and to serve for the period of six months."" The Pennsylvanians, however, did not like the terms or conditions of any of these calls, and did not fly to their rifles as promptly as was proper. Then Gov. CURTIN, spurred by the news that the rebels were advancing toward his capital, to adopt any expedient to save it, issued an address and also delivered an earnest personal appeal to the people to volunteer -- in the former of which he said he would ""accept men without reference to the six months' term,"" and that it ""never was intended to keep them beyond the continuance of the emergency;"" and imploring the people to trust in his and the Government's words.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MILITARY MUDDLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MILITARY MUDDLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bafd8962-3429-52ca-8d03-ca4aabdfb827,314,nyt://article/bafd8962-3429-52ca-8d03-ca4aabdfb827

Fillmore, Scott's Seedling, Peabody's Seedling, and especially a Seedling from the Austin of Mr. FAULENER's own producing, which took a premium in the exhibition. This last is a berry of exceedingly fine promise, extra sized, long necked, conical shaped, spicy flavored, and a liberal bearer. It will certainly become a standard fruit.

The Northern Gordian Knot,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/21/archives/the-northern-gordian-knot.html,The Northern Gordian Knot,"Austria has again become deeply interested about the Teutonic Schleswigers, and her representative at Frankfort has even proposed to the Diet that Holstein should be occupied with Federal troops, and held as a guarantee for the fulfillment of the stipulations entered into by Denmark in 1851, for the benefit of her German subjects. The Austrian proposition has been rejected through the influence of Bavaria and the jealousy of Prussia, and, as the Bund is impotent when its leading members disagree, the Government at Copenhagen need not fear any aggression for the present. The mere mooting of such a proposition, however, demonstrates to what length the Confederation would be disposed to go, if the several States belonging to it could be induced to act together. But, even though they could be brought to act in concert, they would have no right to attempt to coerce Denmark in this way. It is undoubtedly very impolitic of the Danish King to delay redressing the grievnces of the German Schleswigers. As they have become occupants of Cimbrian soil, they should enjoy the same privileges and the same liberties as its other inhabitants. Yet, between them and their sovereign, the German Powers have no business to interfere. Schleswig is not a part of Germany; and as for the pledges, the fulfillment of which is to be exacted, they are of no more validity than the oath that a burglar, pistol in hand, constrains a terrified householder to swear. Under what circumstances were those pledges obtained from the Danish monarch? An Austro-Prussian force, brought into aid in suppressing insurrection in Holstein, treacherously held possession of that province, and refused to evacuate it, till the pledges in question had been made. Yet we are told that these engagements are to be considered as binding, as if FREDERIC the Seventh was a free agent when he contracted them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Northern Gordian Knot.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Northern Gordian Knot.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Germany', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b77e2c5-f5c3-5bca-9a52-6b118a05e3a4,718,nyt://article/4b77e2c5-f5c3-5bca-9a52-6b118a05e3a4

And nearly twenty years have gone by since Sir ROBERT PEEL said: ""There should be a real and substantial equality of political and civil rights, so that no person viewing Ireland with an unbiased eye, and comparing the civil franchises of Ireland with those of England and Scotland, shall be able to say with truth that a different rule has been adopted toward Ireland; and that, on account of hostility, or suspicion or distrust, civil freedom is there curtailed and mutilated.""

The duplicate was made for one of the rebellious States, the order having been given before the war. But as it has not been paid for, and Mr. MILLS has nothing reliable as to the wishes of the ""rebellious State"" in the premises, he feels at liberty to cast about for another customer. The Corporation of New-York City is supposed to have the needed amount of patriotism, taste, and surplus funds to invest in so costly a specimen of the Fine Arts. In one way, we suppose, the equestrian statue could not be considered extravagant at the price. Mr. MILLS tells the City Fathers that $30,000 is less by ""two-thirds than the sum he received for the original."" One of two conclusions must be accepted. Either Mr. MILLS charged the Nation a great deal too much for the statue erected in Washington, or he volunteers a ""sacrifice"" in selling the duplicate to our City that exceeds in liberality the most ""prodigious bargains"" of any Chatham-street clothing-store.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A HERO ON SALE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A HERO ON SALE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8dba064b-d448-54ed-afa7-41d3f2fb4679,678,nyt://article/8dba064b-d448-54ed-afa7-41d3f2fb4679

"-- MARY ANN MCLAUGHLIN was placed on trial in the Kings' County Court of Oyer and Terminer, on Thursday, on the charge of murder in the first degree. The accused resided with her parents in Park-avenue, near Canton-street, in October last. The father, THOMAS MCLAUGHLIN, the mother, CECELIA MCLAUGHLIN, a son named FRANK, 12 years of age, and MARY, aged 19, comprised the family. They occupied the third floor of the house. Mrs. MCLAUGHLIN, the victim, had been blind for some years. With the exception of the son, all were addicted to drinking, and had frequent quarrels. On the afternoon of the 19th of October last, the mother was found dead in her room by the son. She was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, flowing from a dozen wounds. The stove had been upset and all the furniture was disarranged, indicating that there had been a struggle. The father was lying helplessly drunk in a connecting apartment. The son had bought brandy for the father during the forenoon. He went out to play, and on his return met his sister, who was crying. She stated that she had killed her mother, and then told him that the stove had fallen on her. Seeing her lying dead, he awoke his father, who lifted up her head, and, asking how it happened, commenced crying. The accused sent the boy for the Coroner, and requested that he should hold an inquest immediately, so that she could be buried. The Coroner, on visiting the house, at once saw the state of affairs, and caused the arrest of MCLAUGHLIN and his daughter. The latter denied that she was in the house at the time her mother received the injuries from which she died; but it was shown by the boy and other witnesses that she was in the room at the time the murder had evidently been committed. There was no direct proof before the Court as to the commission of the deed, but circumstances were so strongly against the accused at to leave no doubt on the minds of the jury that the injuries sustained by the mother were inflicted by the daughter. The most serious wounds appeared to have been caused by blows from a hatchet. A few witnesses were examined for the defence, but the evidence was unimportant. Nothing whatever was elicited to contradict the testimony of the prosecution showing her guilt. The jury retired about noon on Saturday, and after deliberating for about two hours, brought in a verdict of ""Guilty of manslaughter in the second degree."" On the announcement of the verdict the prisoner evinced considerable feeling, crying and sobbing most piteously. Sentence was reserved until Tuesday. The father had been discharged by the Grand Jury, and appeared as a witness against his daughter.

We think it must be something like fifteen months since the Fingal crossed the ocean from England, and ran the blockade into the port of Savannah. There she was covered with railroad iron and plates, converted into a ram, and was kept for a long time watching the chance to run out. It was intended that she should attack our blockaders at Savannah and Charleston, in the style in which our blockaders at New-Orleans were attacked by rebel rams shortly after the opening of the war. It was also feared she would attack our land forces stationed at Port Royal, and a great panic was produced there last September by the announcement that the Fingal was coming. The rebels for a long time threw out mysterious and menacing hints about her, and some months ago disting??? ???nnounced that the hour had almost co??? they were going to cry havoc and let ??? the rams of war -- of whom the Fingal was the most terrible. But when we sent the Monitors down to cruise around the harbors of Charleston and Savannah, the Fingal thought proper to lay very low; and the fearful example that the Monitors made of the iron-clad steamer Nashville was not of a kind to entice the Fingal to try her luck while they were around.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISFORTUNES OF THE REBEL NAVY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISFORTUNES OF THE REBEL NAVY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/25e08e9a-b306-5282-a535-369b67598a55,338,nyt://article/25e08e9a-b306-5282-a535-369b67598a55

The services were characterized with all the pomp and ceremony of the Catholic ritual, and derived additional interest from the presence and address of the Most Reverend Archbishop HUGHES. Among the clergy who officiated were Father MCNIERNEY, Master of Ceremonies, the celebrant, Father STARRS, who conducted the dedicatory services and the subsequent High Mass, assisted by Rev. Mr. MCGLYNN as Deacon, and Rev. Mr. MCSWEENEY as Sub-Deacon. Among the reverend gentlemen who participated in the services were Rev. Fathers Morrow, Nelligaa, Mooney, Farrall, MCCarthy, Kregan, Hecker, Curran, Boyce, (Pastor of the Church,) Daly, Duranquet, Quinn, and others. The music, which comprised a mass composed especially for the occasion, by Prof. GUSTAV SCHMITZ, was unusually fine, though somewhat extended, owing to the number of prominent artists who volunteered to assist. Among the voices most noted in the service were those of Mrs. CLARK, of Brooklyn, soprano; Mrs. P.H. CAREY. of New-York, soprano; Mrs. HOLBROOK, alto; Mr. HUBNER, tenor; Mr. HARTMANN, baritone. There was also a splendid chorus of sixteen voices. Prof. SCHMITZ presided at the organ. The solo by Mrs. P.H. CAREY, in the ""Benedictus"" -- selection from the ""Stabat Mater"" -- was particularly pleasing, and the performance of the entire choir unusually fine.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; DEDICATION OF ST.

Knoxville Register Proposes to Hang Dutch Soldier,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/22/archives/proposition-to-hang-the-dutch-soldiers.html,Knoxville Register Proposes to Hang Dutch Soldier,"Of late, in all battles and in all recent incursions made by Federal cavalry, we have found the great mass of Northern soldiers to consist of Dutchmen. The plundering thieves captured by FORREST, who stole half the jewelry and watches in a dozen counties of Alabama, were immaculate Dutchmen. The national odor of Dutchmen, as distinctive of the race as that which, constantly ascending to heaven, has distended the nostrils of the negro, is as unmistakable as that peculiar to a pole-cat, an old pipe, or a lager-pier saloon. Crimes, thefts, and insults to the women of the South, invariably mark the course of these stinking bodies of animated sour-krout. ROSECRANS himself is an unmixed Dutchman, an accursed race which has overrun the vast districts of the country of the Northwest. * * * It happens that we entertain a greater degree of respect for an Ethiopian in the ranks of the Northern armies than for an odoriferous Dutchman, who can have no possible interest in this revolution. * * * Why not hang every Dutchman captured?

L.; The Races of the Old World","The prominent place occupied in the public mind by inquiries relating to the subjects constituting the science of Ethnology is one of the most noticeable features of the time. It is only of late years that philosophers have agreed to group together under that head the researches now making into the families or races of man -- their affinities, dividing lines, and distinguishing characteristics. Yet in this brief space the science has taken titular rank with its elder sisters, and can show its societies, journals, &c., in three quarters of the globe -- nay more, it has been rudely invoked to the political arena, where its aid is demanded by contending parties as a new and potent ally. It is impossible to take up a newspaper without observing a tone of argument and reflection on the destinies of nations that would have been scarcely intelligible to our fathers. Struggling and oppressed races, long dormant but reviving nationalities, are the themes orators now delight to dwell on, when they would move most deeply the sympathies of their hearers. So recently as the Congress of Vienna in 1814, it is probable that no considerations of this nature were present to the minds of a single member of it, when engaged in the settlement of the map of Europe, they were volcanic fires smouldering below unconscious feet. Now, however, they are ablaze, and it would seem that events are tending to produce a comparative disregard of the old conventional geographical boundaries of States, and a remodeling of that very map on principles purely ethnological, as national sympathies, popular affinities, identities of language and religious beliefs. Old statesmen and ministers are vexed with thoughts beyond the reaches of their official souls, based on realities sterner than dynastic usurpation, subtler than political expediency. ""Celt"" and ""Saxon,"" ""Slave,"" ""Teuton,"" ""Scandinavian"" and ""Magyar,"" are no longer mere abstractions, but have become the watchwords of angry factions, the battle-cries of peoples struggling in the throes of political birth. The future of a continent even may hang on a despot's version of the theory of dominant races, and an appeal to that be considered sufficient to outweigh the ordinary considerations of right and justice. These facts, which it is impossible to ignore, meet us daily in some shape or other. They have a double operation; they stimulate men both of thought and action to the study of the races of man, and all such studies deepen the conviction that seeks expression by grappling with the facts to which they alone afford a satisfactory key or explanation. Some knowledge of the subject is indispensable to all intelligent persons, but the mass of information collected is so large that inquirers have been repelled by it, until the results are arranged and presented in some practicable shape. Neither French nor English literature offers us any portable work setting forth the existing landmarks of this progressive science. This task Mr. BRACE undertakes in the book now before us. A fair examination enables us to say that he has accomplished it in a manner eminently satisfactory. A traveler himself, and one who, like ULYSSES, has seen ""many men and many cities,"" he combines with these personal advantages a thorough acquaintance with the literature of the science in the various European languages. Though perfect uniformity of opinion on points so open to dispute cannot be looked for, Mr. BRACE may be recommended as always a safe and intelligent guide in whose judgment his readers may place reliance. It may be mentioned that the work has undergone the ordeal of English scholarship, and is now publishing in London by Mr. MURRAY, from whose establishment issue the writings of LYELL, MURCHISON, DARWIN, OWEN, and most of the scientific lights of the age.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

"The first call for militia was for three months, 'but this was before the full magnitude of the struggle in which the country was embarking had become apparent.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/23/archives/an-army-for-the-war.html,,"The first call for militia was for three months, 'but this was before the full magnitude of the struggle in which the country was embarking had become apparent. After Bull Run, when it was evident that ""a long and bloody war"" was in store for us, a call was made for men for three years. A year afterward, after our failure before Richmond, another call was made for men for two years and for nine months. The latest call is for six months, and the number that can be got to volunteer even for this period does not seem to be overwhelmingly large. Most of the levies who have taken the field in Pennsylvania have taken every possible precaution to insure their discharge in thirty days, or when ""the emergency"" is over; so that six months now seems to be rather more than the maximum period for which men will enlist in any great force, and this only under pressure of invasion. It remains to be seen whether they would enlist in much greater numbers for three months, as a call for that period has still to be made. But aside from their actual effectiveness in raising men, these calls for short periods are open to the very strong and very palpable objection that each of them is a sort of intimation to the South to hold out, and it will succeed. When we called an army into the field for three years, and made no arrangements for renewing it as it diminished, it was tantamount to telling the rebels that if they could protract the contest to the close of that period, we should leave them masters of the field. Since then, nothing we have done toward reinforcing it has had any tendency whatever to prolong its existence. In a year from this time, unless some steps are taken in the interval to avert it, the United States will not have a single soldier in the field, and yet he must be a very sanguine man who feels confident that there is not more than even this year's work left at the South for soldiers to do.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Army for the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Army for the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-06-23T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87a3c96b-eabe-5a78-a6fe-41861ea5e882,847,nyt://article/87a3c96b-eabe-5a78-a6fe-41861ea5e882

Yesterday morning he was out early visiting the various dumping-grounds, with the view of learning the management of the details of street-cleaning, and reached his office in good season. There he found the crowd that inevitably besiege each new incumbent of an official position commanding any patronage. Their main desire was to fill the new post of Deputy Superintendent of Sanitary Inspection, recently created by an ordinance of the Common Council. All uncertainty, if not all anxiety in the matter, was soon set at rest by the appointment of Ex-Alderman JOHN H. BRADY, for whom the place was specially created. A few months ago Mr. BRADY was appointed Inspector of Railroads by the Croton Board, by the influence of his former colleagues in the Common Council, and a short time ago he was turned out of this berth in order that a party who had been instrumental in passing, at Albany, the bill extending the term of office of the members of the Croton Board, might be rewarded with it. The Common Council were thus baulked of all their kindness to their old colleague, but as a salve, it was arranged that Mr. BRADY should have the new office which Col. DELAVAN had asked should be created in his department. Mr. BOOLE had about one hundred applications made to him for the place during yesterday, and the pressure brought to bear upon him by the applicants and their friends, to secure the prize, was tremendous.

"We have had no news whatever of operations by our forces on the James Peninsula for the last ten days -- or since LEE and his army struck out for the North.

"The elevation of Mr.  BOOLE to the office of City Inspector, has been received with singular favor by all parties, people and papers. Few men have reached the purple of office amid more general acclamations.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/06/26/archives/the-new-broom.html,,"-- The elevation of Mr. BOOLE to the office of City Inspector, has been received with singular favor by all parties, people and papers. Few men have reached the purple of office amid more general acclamations. Something of this is due to the belief that Mr. BOOLE is acquainted with the duties and dangers of the office, and will discharge the one and avoid the other to the best of his ability. But perhaps more is to be ascribed to the popular respect for the old saying, that a new broom sweeps clean. The virtues of a besom may not be apparent in every walk of life, but in our public promenades they are very conspicuous, and it is not a sweeping assertion to say that, in him who inspects the thoroughfares, the virtues aforesaid are all important. Mr. BOOLE is our new broom, and it is confidently hoped that he will cleanse the foulness of the Metropolis, and once more make it fresh and wholesome to sight and sense. In what way Hercules BOOLE proposes to set about ""his wonders to perform,"" does not yet appear. Perhaps those dirty and dusty dragons, the sweeping-machines, will once more make their appearance in the streets, scattering confusion and pulverized trap-block among the store-keepers, and bringing comfort to the hearts of the curious in clumsiness. Or, about midnight, we may again behold in Broadway, as of yore, a creature of vaguely bucolic instincts, bearing in his hand a watering-pot, and in an idiotic horticultural effort, vainly endeavoring to cultivate Belgian pavement.

It was on the 18th of May -- the day after that on which was fought the last of the five-victorious battles which illustrated GRANT'S march, that the investment of the city was effected. The three corps of the army moved up to the siege work after their field-struggles with irresistible determination and unflinching valor -- SHERMAN's corps on the right, MCPHERSON's in the centre and MCCLERNAND's on the left. During these forty days, the hard labors of the siege have been prosecuted steadily and unintermittingly. By day and by night, the great siege guns have flung their tremendous projectiles into the doomed city; while several times in the day and night, the bells of the clocks of Vicksburgh gave the signal to our mortar-boats in the river to open their fires and throw their death-laden bombs among the rebels. Latterly we have been informed that Gen. GRANT was about to use red-hot shot in his bombardment, which would probably have the effect of at least destroying the town; but as its people are all said to have taken refuge in caves dug in the hill-sides, they might escape any serious inconvenience from this cause. Since the general assault made upon the rebel works, four days after investment, nothing farther of the kind has been attempted -- though Gen. GRANT's action in dismissing from command Gen. MCCLERNAND, who was mainly blamed for the failure of that attack, indicates that GRANT did not consider the failure to take the works by storm to be owing to their impregnability to direct assault.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Siege of Vicksburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Siege of Vicksburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10b8eb77-8700-584e-87c8-12e9d8081c23,852,nyt://article/10b8eb77-8700-584e-87c8-12e9d8081c23

We stated that the stores had all been closed for a week, and the citizens had turned out almost en masse, and from 8,000 to 10,000 were working on the fortifications. We now find that we did not, in this honorable statement, do that brave community much over half justice. The Pittsburgh Gazette, of Thursday, says: ""The work is progressing on a gigantic scale -- 14,000 men at work to-day; and these 14,000, with 14,000 more to back them, can lay down their picks and shovels, and take up muskets and rifles, or man the batteries."" And the Gazette expects the people not to be contented with the defence of their city, but to take up arms and ""march"" to meet and expel the invader. That is a glorious voice to come up from the hallowed site of old Fort Duquesne. In sight of Pittsburgh the dark struggle took place which brought out the military genius of GEORGE WASHINGTON; and it is a happy omen that in the present day of Pennsylvania's discouragement and humiliation, a spirit so dauntless shines out near the field of WASHINGTON's maiden battle.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ALL HONOR TO PITTSBURGH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ALL HONOR TO PITTSBURGH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Maryland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-06-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/50c5968d-3a64-5da6-93df-bf2a904105f2,209,nyt://article/50c5968d-3a64-5da6-93df-bf2a904105f2

On the approach of the rebels to Carlisle on Thursday evening, Gen. KNIPE, not feeling strong enough to hold the place against so large a force as was supposed to be coming, evacuated it. He reported the rebel force at ten thousand. Up to a late hour last night, the rebels had not occupied the place, though they were expected to do so immediately.

The last corps, under A.P. HILL, crossed at Williamsport on Friday, and was yesterday at Hagerstown. The rebels recently on South Mountain and at Boonsboro, Md., appear to have left those localities, and to be concentrating at Sharpsburgh. Rebel wagon trains loaded with grain, plundered from the farmers of Pennsylvania, have begun to return by way of Smithsburgh and Hagerstown.

"A BOY, ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE, JUST FROM THE RICHMOND PRISON -- BUILDING IRON-CLADS. --- An intelligent boy, named ROBT. HAVEN, aged 11 years, arrived in this city yesterday from Richmond, he having been confined in the Libby Prison in that city for five weeks, and was then exchanged with other Union prisoners. From the statement of the boy, it appears that he resides at Lake Providence, Louisiana, and that his father is now in the Union army under Gen. ROSEGRANS. The boy left his home in April, to go to Nashville, on business for his mother, and after getting through with it, started for home on board the steamer Minnesota, and when near Greencastle, on the Mississippi, she was fired into by guerrilas. A ball struck the bo???ler, thus disabling the steamer, and her officers surrendered. The boy during the ???ring was slightly wounded on the head by a ???ce of shell. The party on board, numbering 19, were marched by the rebels to Vicksburgh, and from thence to Richmond, and confined in the Libby prison. While in prison they were fed on pea soup and corn bread, occasionally getting a little corned beef. One day the boy managed to escape the vigilance of the sentinels and left his prison, and took a stroll through the streets or Richmond. He visited the markets, and found everything enormously high, and at the Navy-yard he discovered that the rebels had two iron-clad gunboats nearly completed. He was informed that they would be launched about the 17th of June. The boats, he said, would carry eight guns each. They have sloping sides, and, from his description, we should suppose they are something upon the plan of the old Merrimac. He also visited the Government foundry, and saw a large number of men employed in making guns of all kinds, shells, &c. About this time he was missed from prison, and soon placed back in his old quarters. He saw but few soldiers in the city; but during their stay and some two weeks since a great many troops passed through the city, on their way to reinforce Gen. LEE. The boy left Richmond on last Saturday week, and was brought to this city by Mr. E.G.

One journal has just congratulated the country upon the fact that the control of the militia had not passed into the hands of the National Government, or we should not have been treated to the grand spectacle of patriotic energy presented by the recent departure of so many volunteers to the aid of Pennsylvania. If armies were raised for the sole purpose of proving the National courage, we should take as much delight in this exhibition as anybody, but we know by sorrowful experience that an army is raised to fight and win battles, and that an army which is not in a condition to do this, is simply a victim led to the altar. An army which marches to meet an enemy which it has no chance of defeating, may be an admirable spectacle, but it can never be a cheering one. For this reason, our last ""great uprising,"" or rather the necessity for it, is mainly a source of regret and humiliation. We read that on the arrival of the Seventh regiment at Philadelphia, Gen. HALLECK ordered it to report at Baltimore, and not at Harrisburgh, as according to its instructions when it left home. The Colonel proceeded to obey, but telegraphed to Gov.

It would save the public a great deal of useless vexing of the brain, if they would remember that it is not possible and will not be possible to decide whether LEE has outwitted HOOKER or HOOKER LEE, until the campaign is over. The operations in war can only be judged of by their results, which accounts for the fact that for the one strategical writer who is able to foretell how a battle or a series of manoeuvres will end, there are a hundred who knew how they would end after they are over. When the victory is won, we all know why it was won, and are astonished by the imbecility of the vanquished; but the number of us who can warn the vanquished of his impending fate is exceedingly small, and it were much to be wished that the number of those who occasionally undertake that task were still smaller. Whether HOOKER committed a grave error in letting LEE reach the Potomac without attacking him, we shall be better able to judge when we see in what position the rebel force will be a month hence. We have had in the course of the war abundant demonstration of the truth that the object of war is not to fight battles, but to destroy armies, or render them incapable of continuing their resistance.

HOOKER has been relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and Gen. MEADE appointed as his successor. We have had no hint that a change was anticipated; and probably it has not been anticipated long. No reasons for the change are given; but it is doubtless owing to the fact that the Government has at last come to entertain the feeling so widely prevalent in the country, of a want of that perfect confidence in Gen. HOOKER, which is so essential at a crisis like this. During the recent and present movements of the rebel army against Washington, the manoeuvres of Gen. HOOKER were, to a great extent, incomprehensible to the general public; but we had daily assurances from Washington that our army was being so handled and planted as to insure the circumvention of LEE in his designs. Those of us who knew what HOOKER's movements had been for the past fortnight, found in them some things that were admirable and others that were inexplicable. But we could only wait patiently for results, devoutly hoping that those who had the Government of the country and the ordering of the army in their hands, and who were thoroughly informed concerning much that was dark to mere observers, were working for the public salvation to the best of their knowledge and ability. If so it be that Gen. HOOKER has been removed for good cause, the country will cheerfully acquiesce in the removal.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Removal of Gen. Hooker Appointment of Gen.

"-- Among the names of the gallant men who fell on the 14th inst., at the second, assault of the rebel works at Port Hudson, La., is that of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN DENTON, First Lieutenant of Company A, One Hundred and Thirty-third regiment New-York Volunteers. Lieut. DENTON's death will excite a genuine sorrow in the very large number of persons in this City who knew and respected him. Prior to his entering the army he was an efficient officer of the Metropolitan Police force, having joined that organization in the dark days when party spirit ran so high, between the municipal authorities, under Mayor WOOD, and the friends of the law, that it showed true personal courage to take the side of the Commissioners and the right against mob violence. He was soon promoted to a sergeantcy upon his own merits, and continued faithful in that position until it was determined to organize the Metropolitan brigade. Then by the magnetic qualities of his character and his personal popularity, he drew around him large numbers of recruits until not only his own company was filled to the maximum standard, but there were men left to be distributed to other companies. With the modesty that always remarkably characterized him, he was content to accept the subordinate position of Lieutenant, in which capacity he left the City with his regiment, serving for some months in Virginia. The Metropolitan brigade was then ordered to the Banks Expedition, and Lieut. DENTON, although dangerously sick, insisted upon accompanying his regiment. He recovered, however, and was able to take part in every action in which his division has been engaged, always being conspicuous for his bravery. For the last three months he had been in command of his company, the Captain being detached on Provost-Marshal duty at New-Orleans, and it was while heroically leading a storming party to the rebel intrenchments that he fell. He was born at Stillwater, N.Y., and was about 32 years of age. Col.

The noble Marquis recapitulated the complaints which had been made a few weeks ago in reference to the proceedings of the American cruisers, contending that they were in contravention of international law, and that it was the duty of Her Majesty's Government to reinforce the North American squadron so as to afford adequate protection to our merchantmen. He also urged that the constant seizures which were being made by the Federal fleet were not for the purpose of maintaining the blockade, but of destroying, if possible, a large and legitimate British trade which had sprung up with Nassau and Matamoras. He altogether denied the efficiency of the blockade of the Southern ports, and said it ought not to be recognized by Her Majesty's Government. He read a letter from a Lancashire manufacturer, giving details in reference to four steam merchant vessels which had successively run the blockade of Charleston seventeen times in the course of one month, conveying £120,000 worth of British goods into Charleston, and taking out £200,000 worth of cotton.

Earl RUSSELL, in reply, justified the action taken by our Government in regard to seizures, considered the blockade sufficiently efficient to be entitled to be observed, and declined to produce the documents -- whereupon the motion was withdrawn.

The privateer Tacony is a recent and wholly unannounced rebel craft. The first we hear of her she springs, full armed, into the midst of the lesser craft of our coast, and plunders and burns with an audacity and prodigal destructiveness that appals our shippers and confounds the national authorities. The Navy Department makes haste to charter and dispatch a half dozen of the best vessels it can command in pursuit. Boston capital, afflicted by the privateer's ravages, offers a bounty of $10,0000 for his capture. The entire seaboard, from Port Royal to Portland, is aroused, and by minute descriptions from the officers and crews of captured ships, the bold rover is so advertised that it can hardly fail that the many sail that swarm in pursuit will purge the sea of the offender.
