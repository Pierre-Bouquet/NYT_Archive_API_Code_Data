",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/01/archives/fine-arts.html,,"A very meritorious, and in some respects remarkable,picture will be placed on exhibition to-day at the Institute of Art, (Derby Gallery,) No. 625 Broadway. It represents WASHINGTON IRVING and his friends at Sunnyside -- the ""friends"" being fourteen of the most prominent literary men of the country. There can be but little novelty in the design of such a work. Several artists have essayed to give the world an idea of its cotemporary statesmen, authors, &c., and the world has generally been interested in their efforts, notwithstanding that some of its friends thus congregated together looked as though they were stubborn mobs that ought to be dispersed by the Police. Since the war we have necessarily been inundated with military chieftains and heroes, all standing or sitting in painful positions, and all more or less oppressed by a sense of buttons and arms. It seems, indeed, that masses of men can only be treated in one way, and that way as stereotyped as the allegory of the old masters. When we say that the proprietors of ""Washington Irving and his Friends"" have succeeded in presenting the best group of figures which we have seen for many years, it will be perceived that our remarks are not intended to depreciate their work. On the contrary, the composition of the Irving picture is unusually free and good; a little full, perhaps -- as the library at Sunnyside must have been with fifteen persons in it -- but not crowded. The attitudes of the figures are remarkably natural. These results have not been obtained without forethought and much labor. In the first place, Mr. F.O.C. DARLEY, the well-known draughtsman, was called upon for the design, and the success we have referred to is entirely owing to this gentleman. Then special photographs were taken of all the leading characters; each individual being place in the exact position required by Mr. DARLEY. In this way wonderful accuracy of face and figure has been insured. After the results of these separate sittings had been incorporated in the whole, the design was twice photographed and finished with the greatest care. The engraving, which is nearly ready, is executed from this photograph and promises to be one of Mr. T.O. BARLOW's greatest successes. Mr. C. SCHUSSELH has since reproduced it in oil, being assisted in his task by additional sittings on the part of the principal figures. He shares with Mr. DARLEY the merit of having produced the best national picture ever painted in America. The portraits are excellently preserved, the flesh tints being delicate and truthful, the positions easy and pleasing, and the whole effect unlabored and interesting. Compared with those well-known engravings ""Walter Scott and his Friends"" and ""Shakespeare and his Cotemporaries,"" the present work is absolutely animated.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fine Arts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fine Arts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/405d5129-414a-5bbb-953b-822f900f564c,559,nyt://article/405d5129-414a-5bbb-953b-822f900f564c

GRANT to convey supplies. We do not think it would be feasible to maintain the army of Gen. GRANT even at Atlanta during the Winter; for, though the forces of BRAGG may be pretty thoroughly demolished or dispersed, there would still be bodies of them left to roam through the country, who would operate on our lines after the style of MOSBY in Virginia, and with a hundredfold the effect.

The bark, as it appears, was captured as a prize, and was condemned by the District Court, but that decree was, on appeal, reversed by the Circuit Court, which declared that the vessel was not a lawful prize, but that the seizure of her was illegal, and she must be restored to her owners. The owners thereupon applied to the Court for an order that the captors should pay the costs and damages occasioned by this illegal seizure. The Court denies the motion, holding that the prize suit, which is brought by the United States to obtain the condemnation of the vessel, is a proceeding to which the captors individually are not parties, and they are not, therefore, responsible for its result, and the Court has no jurisdiction to award costs and damages against them in that suit.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Navy Officers and Their Prizes.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Navy Officers and Their Prizes.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-01T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c195f8e-3dd2-5c8c-bd2c-7574aa878b6c,1075,nyt://article/7c195f8e-3dd2-5c8c-bd2c-7574aa878b6c

New-York Central; Election of Directors,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/02/archives/the-central-railroad.html,New-York Central; Election of Directors,"The election for Directors of the New-York Central Railroad takes place next week. The indication of a purpose on the part of the stockholders to effect a reform in its management, has aroused its present officers to unusual and remarkable efforts to retain their places. The President, who receives no salary, has spent a good deal of his time in this City for the last few days, backed up by the Vice-President, the Treasurer, the Superintendent, and other officers, and aided by a formidable corps of outside agents, buying stock, contracting for the use of proxies at so much per vote, and in every possible way striving to perfect and perpetuate his tenure of office. This of itself is rather a remarkable spectacle, and might well excite some little anxiety on the part of those whose property is invested in the road. It finds a satisfactory explanation in the fact that the President has the right of supplying the road, at his own prices and under his own supervision, with all its iron, and that agents appointed by himself are the sole judges of what the road wants. And it is perfectly notorious that this privilege, which is without a parallel in the management of any other work of equal magnitude on the face of the earth, is worth to the President not less than $250,000 per annum. Every dollar of this comes out of the pockets of the stockholders. If they are content to pay it, very well.

"Gen. HITCHCOCK, the officer who has had the general direction of matters referring to the exchange of our prisoners, has written to the TIMES a highly important letter upon the subject, to which we give place this morning.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/02/archives/the-exchange-of-prisoners.html,,"Gen. HITCHCOCK, the officer who has had the general direction of matters referring to the exchange of our prisoners, has written to the TIMES a highly important letter upon the subject, to which we give place this morning. The mystery which has enveloped the question, and the confused and contradictory statements which have been made about it, are for the first time cleared up by this letter. Our authorities, it would seem, are not to blame for the stoppage of exchanges. They have proposed to the rebel Commissioner to exchange, man for man, all the prisoners now held in the South, but this the rebels have refused to agree to. In all, we hold forty thousand rebel prisoners, while the rebels hold but thirteen thousand Union prisoners; and they insist, as appears from Gen. HITCHCOCK's letter, as well as from the correspondence between Commissioners MEREDITH and OULD, which we lately published, that the exchange shall be general; that is to say, that we shall deliver up to them all of the 40,000 prisoners in our possession, and receive in return about 13,000 men, leaving about 27,000 men who might, for a few days, be considered on parole not to take arms unless duly exchanged; ""and then,"" asks Gen. HITCHCOCK, ""what would Mr. OULD do with those men? Judging by what he has actually recently done, he would undoubtedly assume to discharge those men from all obligations under their parole, and put them into the field to fight against. National troops, standing under an unstained National flag -- the very troops who gallantly captured those men upon bloody battle-fields, within the past few months."" In this charge Gen. HITCHCOCK is not unjust; for in another place he states that ""already the question has come up from Gen. GRANT's glorious battle-field at Chattanooga, as to what shall be done with a body of the enemy, who, having been paroled as prisoners of war at Vicksburgh, have been recaptured in arms at Chattanooga, without having been properly exchanged,"" -- and this notwithstanding the explicit denial of Mr. OULD that any of the Vicksburgh prisoners had been sent into the field.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Exchange of Prisoners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Exchange of Prisoners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1bad85e0-7da4-53b9-8e64-1bde88e394e2,522,nyt://article/1bad85e0-7da4-53b9-8e64-1bde88e394e2

This magnificent vessel, the finest probably of all the naval structures of our great American shipbuilder, WILLIAM H. WEBB, Esq., is now completed, and will sail for the bay of Naples in l5 days. Her officers and crew arrived here from Naples in the line-of-battle ship Galantuomo on the 5th of November, and are now comfortably settled on board their new vessel, with which they all express themselves highly delighted. Before leaving New-York they were desirous of seeing something of our Metropolitan society, and Mr. WEBB anticipating their wishes, arranged for, and provided at his own expense the superb entertainment given last evening. Cards of invitation were issued to several hundred of our prominent citizens, who responded in large numbers to the invitation. Among the guests present were the Italian Minister. Signor Bertinatti, Signor Anfoie, the Italian Consul General, Capts. Boukatoff, Federoffski, and Croun, of the Russian fleet, Commander Baldwin, U.S.N., Capt. Worden, U.S.N., Engineer Steimers, U.S.N., Judge Daly, Judge Woodruff, Judge Roosevelt, Postmaster Wakeman, Collector Barney, Jas. W. Gerard. Jos. Hokie, Capt. Chas. H. Marshall, Jas. W. Beekman, Rev. Dr. Cummings, D.D. Field, Dr. Sayre, Dr. Gardner, Wm.V. Brady, Horatio Allen, and others, together with a large number of ladies. The frigate was thrown open for visitors at 3 P.M., and from that time until late in the evening was thronged with ladies and gentlemen, who came to pay their respects to the Italian officers and to view their magnificent vessel. At 7 o'clock in the evening a most luxurious supper was provided for the guests in the ward-room, under the supervision of the famous caterer of the Maison Doree, Mons. MARTINEZ, assisted by his chief steward, FRANCIS SCHMIDT. There was no formal speechmaking on the occasion, though several gentlemen, on being called on for a toast, prefaced their sentiments by appropriate remarks. Mr. GERARD, among others, congratulated the company upon the fact that the elegant vessel which they all so much admired, was going to that beautiful and classic land. Italia, the foremost among the nations in art and song, and the furthest advanced in freedom. He closed by offering the following: ""The King of Italy and the King of Shipbuilders"" -- which was drank with great applause. After supper the guests repaired to the gun-deck, where dancing commenced, and was kept up till midnight, to the music of Dodworth's Band. The officers of the Re d'Italia were all dressed in full uniform, and it was the unanimous expression of the ladies that they were the handsomest lot of men, taken as a body, they had ever seen. The decks of the vessel were brilliantly illuminated during the evening with calcium lights, and the engines were kept constantly in motion to enable the guests to witness the beautiful working at her machinery. The Re d'Italia has two engines, each of 800-horse power. They are similar to those of the Russian frigate Grand Admiral, built by Mr. WEBB in 1860. The cost of the Re d'Italia was $1,500,000. Her armament will be supplied after she reaches the Mediterranean. She carries with her from here only eight guns, furnished from the Galantuomo, which brought her officers and crew to this port. She will go into commission today, and it is in contemplation to give her a trial trip down the Bay previous to her departure for the Mediterranean.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/03/archives/the-lesson-of-our-victory.html,,"There is one ominous circumstance for the rebels in the recent victory of Chattanooga, as well as very favorable to the loyal cause -- and that is, that our opponents did not fight at all as they have been accustomed to fight. It is true that the manoeuvering on our side showed a most skillful hand, and the daring assault up different sides of a mountain, against large numbers of troops, defended by earthworks, and by at least fifty pieces of artillery, was one of the most brilliant exploits of modern history. Still, all this is not sufficient to explain this very complete victory. No army is ""surprised in open daylight,"" as our telegrams have pictured; nor can mountains, with fifty pieces of artillery on the summits, be taken by assault, if the defenders are united and fully in earnest. We know by this time that the Southern soldiers are quite as brave as our own, and yet we find this most important battle -- perhaps to be called by history the life-and-death battle of the rebel Confederacy -- having been fought by our men under the most disadvantageous circumstances, gained without apparently a greater loss in killed and wounded than has followed many an unimportant reconnaissance in force. At Chicamauga, where we lost but few prisoners, our losses footed up to some 17,000; at Chattanooga we captured over 6,000 prisoners, more than forty pieces of artillery, and an immense quantity of small arms, breaking up (so far as we can learn) BRAGG's army completely, and yet lose supposing this telegraphic estimate to be a correct one, only 3,200 in killed and wounded. We do not hear, also, that the rebels suffered any heavy loss in killed and wounded. Apparently, a great army, just after a victory, was beaten and broken to pieces with but very little hard fighting on its part.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Lesson of Our Victory.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Lesson of Our Victory.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15b21364-d512-5a37-986c-b8e72519f478,889,nyt://article/15b21364-d512-5a37-986c-b8e72519f478

It was on Thursday last that the great host, with high hopes, steady step, and ten days' rations, crossed the Rapidan to measure swords with the enemy, and before one-half of the ten days have passed away, it has wheeled round, retraced its steps, and is now promenading or encamping in the wretched desert that fronts Washington, where it can fight to its heart's content the hornets of MOSBY -- having in the meantime fought no battle, achieved no victory, and subserved no respectable purpose. On Monday, Gen. MEADE captured two corps, or the whole, of LEE's army, by the Philadelphia telegraph, and on Tuesday LEE captured the whole of Gen. MEADE's army by a telegram from Philadelphia; and this, with the heavy cannonading that the public heard for several days over the wires, and the gallant skirmishing of Friday and Saturday, constitutes the sum total of visible results from the late campaign. This morning's dispatch avers that Gen, MEADE's friends (we are all ""Gen. MEADE's friends"") claim that the object of the advance was not to give battle to LEE, but to prevent his sending reinforcements to LONGSTREET in Tennessee; and that the movement has consequently been a success. But we fear that those who argue in this manner do not study the newspapers with sufficient assiduity; for Gen. BURNSIDE crossed swords with LONGSTREET as far back as the 14th, or two weeks before Gen. MEADE began his advance, and during the whole of that fortnight he was in imminent peril until the 26th ult., the day of MEADE's advance, at which date telegrams were received from Gen. BURNSIDE, announcing that he was fully able to resist, the enemy until such time as aid was received from Gen. GRANT; and as BURNSIDE was under GRANT's command, and GRANT was then just putting the finishing touches upon his great victory, we may be sure that that energetic officer would not delay relief for a moment. Reinforcements were also hastening to BURNSIDE's help, via Cumberland Gap. Beside these all-sufficient aids, we cannot believe that the Army of the Potomac entered upon such a large and comprehensive campaign merely on the supposition that thus it might prevent LEE from sending some regiments to aid LONGSTREET in extricating himself from a position from which he bids fair to extricate himself without each aid.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Army of the Potomac Its Mysterious Manoeuvres.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Army of the Potomac Its Mysterious Manoeuvres.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d158e327-6921-5a0d-89bc-9cbb27d664fa,631,nyt://article/d158e327-6921-5a0d-89bc-9cbb27d664fa

SEYMOUR'S main pretext in justification of his opposition to the draft last Summer, at the period of the riots, was an alleged system of fraud in the enrollment, whereby undue levies were imposed upon certain Democratic Congressional Districts, among which the Second and Third were specially designated. The President, with characteristic complaisance, answered the Governor that, in consideration of his charges, only a fraction of the quota should be drawn from these districts, until a reenrollment should be had to verify whether the first was correct or not, and invited the Governor to appoint an agent to assist at that reeenrollment, so as to guard against any possibility of doubting its fairness. This reenrollment was accordingly ordered. But it seems that the Governor disrelishes being subjected to the practical test, and has notified the Washington authorities that he now withdraws all objection to the first enrollment, being convinced, on examination of the lists and the returns of the draft already made, which show very few non-residents, that that enrollment is ""as near correct as it is possible to make one.""

Two prominent physicians, after a full examination, have given certificates that he was of unsound mind. Since his arrest, it has transpired that upon two previous occasions he had attempted to take the life of his wife. At one of these times he drew a revolver upon his wife, while the two were in a bedroom, and was about to fire when her screams brought a third person into the room. The husband then quietly put up his pistol, at the same time remarking that he was about to shoot himself. The unfortunate man, it will be remembered, was a clothing merchant, doing business at No. 380 Grand-steet. The injuries of the wife are so serious that it is thought she will not recover.

We have just passed through one of the grand climacteric periods, resulting in a series of great operations in the West, and at least of portentous movements in the East; and the fact that the season naturally fitted for field-work is passed, and Winter and the ""skyey influences"" adverse to military operations are upon us, gives plausibilty to the opinion that we may now have a period of comparative quiescence, and that our armies will go into Winter quarters. This of itself, to be sure, would not absolutely determine the cessation of active work; and if we should judge by the history of last year, when the month of December witnessed two of the greatest battles of the war -- that of Fredericksburgh, in Virginia, and Murfreesboro, in Tennessee -- there would be little to indicate such an intermission of operations. But the circumstances of December, 1863, and of December, 1862, are widely different. In the West a great aggressive army, threatening the invasion of Kentucky, fronted ROSECRANS, and it was in the last degree desirable to foil that intention by dealing the rebels a telling blow. In Virginia the spirit of ""On to Richmond"" still controlled our military policy. No such necessity and no such prompting now weigh upon us. Our great army of the West holds a position which makes all attempts at the offensive on the part of the rebels madness. Gen. GRANT is master of the situation, and the mastery, too, is of a kind that makes military operations in Virginia of quite subordinate moment. Both our armies have secured coignes of vantage where they can securely rest for the Winter; and there is no commanding military necessity to instigate a Winter campain.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Military Prospects for the Winter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Military Prospects for the Winter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aa7cfac0-43d9-578c-9f1f-9c70cfc5e2ad,754,nyt://article/aa7cfac0-43d9-578c-9f1f-9c70cfc5e2ad

"Recruiting in this City, under the new call for volunteers is getting to be quite brisk, the number enlisting being daily on the increase.

The City bounty of $300 was stopped on Wednesday, the funds having run out, but Mr. BLUNT replenished the coffers so as to be able to resume payment on Thursday. The Assistant Provost-Marshal Gen. HAYES yesterday read a dispatch from the War Department, saying that enlistments for the regular army in this City would be credited to the quota of New-York, and that the usual premium of $15 and $25 would be paid to those furnishing recruits for the regular army as well as for the volunteer regiments. There is a difficulty, however, about recruits for the regular army getting the City bounty of $300. Mr. BLUNT declines paying the bounty except upon the certificate of one of the Provost-Marshals that the man was duly enlisted, while Gen.

T.; Great Stone Book of Travel","The remarkable series of occurrences detailed in this portly and beautifully executed volume, is yet too little removed from us by time, and still too closely connected with the hot and angry passions of political partisanship, to be susceptible of purely literary, or indeed of scientific historical treatment. All we can do is to bear witness to the zeal, industry and intelligence displayed by Mr. PARTON in the fulfillment of his task. Based on the most authentic documentary sources, and fortified at every step by copies of the original papers supplied to him by the great actors in the scene, the author has enjoyed for his book the advantage of unreserved personal intercourse with Gen. BUTLER and his military staff. All practicable sources of information were thrown open to him, with the sole stipulation that a faithful, honest, and not an apologetic use should be made of them, and it will therefore surprise no one acquainted with Mr. PARTON's previous writings, to be told that he has produced a work perfectly exhaustive of the subject in hand. He commences with the youth of his hero, Gen. BUTLER, whose professional career is briefly and pleasantly sketched, until the day when the sword and the camp superseded the pen and the court-house. The military narrative then begins, and details with minuteness the events of Gen. BUTLER's career, from his leaving Boston at the head of the Massachusetts regiments, until the successful attack on the Mississippi forts placed New-Orleans at his command, and afforded an opportunity for the display of administrative talent more momentous than the world has often seen. How the exigency was fully met, and how quickly it was proved that ""the right man was in the right place,"" the world knows, every page of the book tells, with a particularity that rarely trespasses on good taste, through a constant stream of laudation. The author has been anxious to preserve as much as possible, the writings of Gen. BUTLER, who is placed by him in a classification that will not meet with universal consent as chief among ""the three great writers of the war, Gen. BUTLER, President LINCOLN, and Mr. WILKES, of the Spirit of the Times!"" They are fine specimens of nervous English, hitting at once the point aimed at, and entirely free from the prolixity often attributed to legal papers and writers. As materials for the future Macaulay or Bancroft who shall, about A.D. 1950, produce the classic ""History of the Great Rebellion,"" Mr. PARTON's book will be invaluable, his natural bias as a hero-worshiper being allowed for, and far more than counterbalanced by his exertions and labors for the discovery of historical truth. The book is illustrated by a fine steel portrait of Gen. BUTLER, and military maps and plans. Its general effect is creditable to both author and publisher.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; GEN. BUTLER IN NEW-ORLEANS.

A great war is the greatest shock human society ever sustains; and it is sure to unlock agencies and causes, both material and moral, of tremendous force, which before were entirely unthought of, or, at all events, uncared for. Perhaps there may occasionally have been, in history, a barren and sterile war -- a war which literally left a people in statu quo ante bellum; but if they have ever existed at all, they have been very rare. At all events, it is certain that throughout all modern history, war has ushered in every great step of national progress. Modern England was made what it is by the civil war which carried CHARLES I. to the scaffold; modern Germany by the thirty years' war of the seventeenth century; modern France by the civil and foreign wars of the French Revolution; and modern Italy by the internal wars which have taken place within the last fifteen years. It is impossible to name a nation in Europe, great or small, that has experienced a real regeneration but by the baptism of blood. And in Asia too, so far as there have been any important national changes, the sword has invariably opened the way for them. It was the bloody force of England that broke up the dreadful religious and civil despotisms that had held India down for centuries and ages. It was the same violence that has opened the gates of China to every redeeming influence. And it is that also which alone promises to make Japan fairly accessible to civilization and Christianity. It is not the war itself that regenerates -- for that may spring from the most unjustifiable motives and be conducted in the most unwarrantable manner -- but the regeneration comes from the agencies which the war necessarily takes with it, or draws in its train.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War as Regenerative of the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War as Regenerative of the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cd213f52-032c-5eb1-8dcc-139dd787b1aa,1182,nyt://article/cd213f52-032c-5eb1-8dcc-139dd787b1aa

BRAGG was strongly entrenched on Lookout Mountain, and, probably, expected to have held his position there until, at least, LONGSTREET had driven BURNSIDE from Knoxville. His position was unexpectedly taken by assault, and he was compelled to retreat some miles with the loss of a few thousand prisoners and thirty pieces of artillery. The artillery had probably been captured from the Federal army, which does nearly as much toward supplying the armies of the South as the Southern Government. It was unfortunate for the South that BRARG had not been able to hold Lookout Mountains; for, iddependent of the advantages this position gave the Southern army, it would have enabled LONGSTREET to have driven BURNSIDE out of Knoxville. As it was, the greater part of the town was burned; but, judging by present accounts, the Southern General was compelled, by the retreat or BRAGG, to leave his work there unfinished. Gen.

The vase, which, with its base, is three feetsix inches in height, is designed and wrought in oxydized silver, by Mr. JES BARKENTIN, of No. 23 Berners-street. The design itself is Danish in all respects. Subjects from Scandinavian history and mythology cover almost the entire surface of the vase, in the form of medallions on the sides, or in low, subdued relief on the intervening spaces; while the very chasing and minute ornamentation is in strict harmony with the wild, legendary character of the chief figures. Among the principal personages sculptured are the Fates, Deities and Heroes of the Walhalla, not forgetting those famous artificers the dwarfs. Among the historical subjects appear. ""Queen Thyra Dannebod superintending the building of the Dannervirke,"" and ""Queen Dagmar interceding with her husband, Waldemar the Victorious, on behalf of the imprisoned peasants."" The cover supports a statuette of Canute. On the stem of the vase are medallions of their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales; on the base are representations of ""The Vikinger Fleet,"" a landscape in which are beheld a group of barrows and Druidical circles. Such are only a few of the subjects ingeniously designed and carefully elaborated by the Anglo-Danish artist.

Hardly anybody engaged in it, from the Commander-in-Chief to the private, pulls a trigger, or draws a sabre, without taking all possible pains to have it properly recorded. Every man in the army fights and marches, as on a stage, in a full blaze of light, with the whole nation, and, for that matter, the whole world, filling the parquet and the boxes, and watching his minutest gestures, taking note of his dinner, his camp-fire, his horsemanship, his skirmishing and assaulting.

Other fame than this was not to be had, or was only to be looked for in the pages of a quarto, long after the hero had been reduced to common dust. Of the great wars of MARLBORO, or NAPOLEON, or WELLINGTON, we know absolutely nothing beyond the general movements of the great corps, and the exploits of the leaders.

The studious reserve with which he abstains from any allusions to that subject might be supposed, in the popular theory which regards the French Emperor as the Sphynx of the century, to cover a well-laid plan, with which the world is to be astonished, as by a coup d'etat. * * * * It is perfectly proper, without indulging in any nonsense about French sympathy for us, or dreaming, of an absurd coalition of Southern against Northern power, to anticipate that the march of events may eventually force him, in the prosecution of a deliberate and determined plan, to assist the establishment of a Republic absolutely essential to his success. The mode and the extent to which he may desire or find it necessary to do this, depend, of course, greatly upon circumstances, which are mutable and uncertain. Time may greatly modify his views, and they may fall greatly short of our wishes. His silence at present affords as grant of his intention to abstain altogether from activity on this side of the Atlantic. It arises from his indecision as to future course in the present immature state of affairs, or from a desire to await the proper occasion before committing himself. Whatever may be his plans in the matter, they are no longer regarded by the South as even an element of calculation.

The argument only shows how little the real position of the soldier has been studied. First, it must be taken into consideration that a reform of the pay-roll is intended not only to benefit those men who are now going into the service, but more especially those who have already done good work for the country, and who are suffering under the present imperfect method. The recruit certainly gets his three or four hundred dollars on the start, a sum which we will venture to assert a large portion of those who are now enlisting never owned at one time before. The result of this achievement of such a pile is extravagance in nine cases out of ten, and in an equal number of cases, at least in the City, two weeks does not elapse before the newly-made soldier is penniless. The rule is the same whether he has a family or not, only that in the latter case it is supposable that a large share of it has gone toward adding to their comfort. This weighty matter off his mind, and out of his pocket, he stands ready for his pay, the prompt reception of which at short periods, will tend greatly toward making him a better soldier, discouraging extravagance, and leading him to realize what his income really is. Upon this point we cannot make any distinguishment between the soldier and the laborer, mechanic or clerk, who is dependent for his living on his weekly or monthly wages, and who would be seriously embarrassed were the payment delayed a week beyond the expected time, or made at uncertain periods.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pay of the American Soldier Bounties and Pay Rolls.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pay of the American Soldier Bounties and Pay Rolls.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/65f29c54-333c-54bf-977d-bac79adf3cac,1418,nyt://article/65f29c54-333c-54bf-977d-bac79adf3cac

Some of those who need sight to strengthen their faith are now falling into line in the Anti-Slavery army.

"LIVERPOOL. A meeting was held on Wednesday afternoon at the Rooms of the Board of Trade in this city, by invitation of a Committee of the Board, to consider the expediency of establishing an American line of steamships between Boston and Liverpool.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/06/archives/proposed-steam-line-between-boston-and.html,,"LIVERPOOL. A meeting was held on Wednesday afternoon at the Rooms of the Board of Trade in this city, by invitation of a Committee of the Board, to consider the expediency of establishing an American line of steamships between Boston and Liverpool. Mr. E.S. TOBEY, Chairman of the Committee, presided. Speeches were made by the Chairman, by His Excellency Gov. SMITH, of Vermont; Gen. STARK, of the Consolidated Railroad Line to Ogdensburgh; Mr. TWICHEL, President of the Boston and Worcester Railroad; Mr. GEORGE WARREN, of Liverpool, and by Messrs. J.C. CONVERSE, J.S. RODES, ISAAC RICH, HAMILTON B. HILL., and other gentlemen of this city. The statements submitted to the meeting were in substance as follows: That our present means of communication with Liverpool are altogether disproportionate to the wealth and importance of our city, and inadequate to the requirements of our commerce; that our European imports are reaching us by way of other cities, and that in our exports of Western produce we are seriously falling behind hand, it was urged that the recent strengthening of our various railroad connections with the West, the advantages offered by the wharves, warehouses, and elevators at East Boston now completed, and the prominent position which Boston at this time occupies before the country, eoncur in rendering of the first importance immediate and energetic action on the subject. While Boston has precisely the same number of steamships in the Liverpool trade as twenty years ago, viz: two a month; New-York has on the average a daily steamer to and from that great transatlantic port; and even Portland, in the Winter season, has two and sometimes three arrivals a week from Europe. Being one day's sail nearer to Liverpool than New-York, and upward of a hundred miles nearer to Upper Canada and the West than Portland, Boston would seem in its situation, and with its present and projected facilities, to possess peculiar advantages for sustaining a line of first-class freight steamships such as it is proposed to place on the Liverpool route; and as similar vessels have done a profitable business at other ports, it was argued that where others have succeeded so well, we should not be likely to fail. The railroad gentlemen present not only expressed their decided conviction that the time has fully arrived for initiating this mrvement, but they promised such Cooperation on the part of their respective companies as will ensure prompt and rapid transportation, and as will enable Boston to compete successfully in the vital question of rates of freight, for its full share of business between the West and Great Britain. We understand that another and larger meeting will be shortly convened to further consider the establishment of an enterpise which promises to be so remunerative to those engaged in it, and so advantageous to all the interests involved. -- Boston Journal, Dec. 4.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PROPOSED STEAM LINE BETWEEN BOSTON AND', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PROPOSED STEAM LINE BETWEEN BOSTON AND', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-06T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b349ca43-8a3c-5c90-8a83-efdd7346a162,476,nyt://article/b349ca43-8a3c-5c90-8a83-efdd7346a162

This organization designs to give an entertainment to the needy families of those who have gone forth to fight our battles, on New-Year's Day. From a circular issued by the Association the following is quoted in explanation: We propose to open our ball, No. 720 Broadway, on New-Year's Day, from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., for the purpose of furnishing refreshments to the needy families of our volunteers and to poor persons generally. The design of this movement is to afford these families an opportunity of mingling socially in the festivities of the day, and partaking of such cheer as the Society may be able to provide; to offer something to relieve the monotony of the long hours -- shut up, as a vast majority of these families are, in the compressed apartments of tenant houses. The tables will be under the management of a Committee of ladies, who have volunteered for the occasion, and a volunteer choir will discourse some music during the day."" Amid our reunions and festivities let us not forget those who have been left behind by the men who have gone forth to battle -- enduring privations and suffering in our behalf.

It was supposed that in a conflict with the North, avowedly undertaken for the purpose of confirming and extending the institution, the negroes would rise against their masters and paralyze the operations of the rebel armies in the field by recalling a large portion of them to the defence of their own firesides; and if this did not happen, it was supposed that at least the fear of its happening would cause a very large augmentation of the precautions usually taken against insurrection, and would thus diminish the number of white men available for service on the frontier. More overseers would, it was thought, be needed on the plantations, stronger guards and patrols in the towns, and larger reserves at central points, ready to march to scenes of possible disturbance; and this alarm would, it was thought, be maintained and stimulated by the attitude of the slaves themselves, who, though they might not actually rise in revolt, would be sufficiently mutinous and insubordinate in their manner to prove that the traditional reverence for the ruling race was weakened, and the bonds of the captive relaxed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Slavery as a War Force.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Slavery as a War Force.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Slavery', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aa3046ec-df8f-56a7-ba3a-df3e89803861,1184,nyt://article/aa3046ec-df8f-56a7-ba3a-df3e89803861

GOVERNMENT CONTRACT. Mr. WILLIAM J. WILLIAMS, of the firm of WILLIAMS KENNEDY, doing business at No. 58 Liberty-street, yesterday appeared before Justice DOWLING, at the Toombs Police Court, and made an affidavit against EDGAR D. SEELY, whom he charges with having defrauded their firm of the sum of $650. From the complaint it appears that on the 25th ult. SEELY called upon the firm of WILLIAMS & KENNEDY, and represented to them that he had an extensive Government contract; that for the sum of $450 they could have a part of this contract (which would nett them about $2,000) trasferred to them. Mr. WILLIAMS being desirous to secure a share in the contract, advanced the sum of $450 to SEELY, with the understanding that it should be consummated at once. SEELY was not seen again until the 1st inst., when he again appeared at the store of Messrs. WILLIAMS & KENNEDY, and stated that he had been unable to effect the arrangement at as cheap a rate as he had supposed. He therefore proposed that $200 additional should be paid to secure the contract. Mr. WILLIAMS paid the last-named sum, when SEELY left, and was not seen again until Sunday last, when WILLIAMS met him in the street. With the aid of Officer TEEHAN, of the Second Precinct, he was arrested, and yesterday he was taken before Justice CONNOLLY, at the Tombs, where he was committed for examination.

VINCENT, a native of Tennessee, aged 22 years, who died on Monday from the effect of stab wounds received at the hands of CHARLES H. WALTERS. The case, as our readers may remember, was reported in the columns of the TIMES at the time it occurred, Nov. 30. The testimony has, however, disclosed some additional facts of interest. The homicide was committed at a low dance-house, in the basement of No. 96 Centre-street, nearly opposite the Tombs. The physician who made the post mortem examination testified that there were eighteen distinct wounds -- some on the body, some on the arms, one on the head, and others on the lower limbs. The stabs were inflicted with the blade of a common jack-knife, and from their nature and position, there can be no doubt that they were given in rapid succession, and by a man who had no idea of what he was doing. WALTERS, so far as is known, has hitherto borne a good reputation. He is respectably connected, well educated, and of good appearance. He is about 31 years of age, and by occupation a carpenter and joiner. He was born in the State of New-Jersey, but for several years past has resided in St. Louis. When, after the rendition of the verdict, he was arraigned by the Coroner, and asked what he had to say to the charge of homicide preferred against him, he answered: ""I have no knowledge of the act at all."" He was much depressed in spirits, and expressed deep regret at the occurrence, but made no attempt at justification. He had been drinking to excess that night, and said if the deed was committed by him it was when he was deeply under the influence of liquor. Coroner WILDEY committed the accused to the Tombs, to await the action of the Grand Jury.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Homicide in Centre-street.; CORONER'S INQUEST ON THE BODY OF THE VICTIM."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Homicide in Centre-street.; CORONER'S INQUEST ON THE BODY OF THE VICTIM."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a84f5315-31c6-5734-a6c2-3bf0b478cbc3,325,nyt://article/a84f5315-31c6-5734-a6c2-3bf0b478cbc3

There is a touch of the ludicrous in this ready acquiescence in the scheme, of all those who have either nothing to lose by any change and some chance, of gaining something, or else who, having nothing either to hope or fear, enjoy the prospect of being allowed to sit at the same table, and share in the deliberations of ""the Great Powers."" Those who have refused to be present, or hesitate in accepting, are the ones whose ""manners and excesses"" the Congress is intended to correct, and they not unnaturally are rather shy about offering to sit in a court of inquiry on their own conduct. For instance, one of the questions to be debated, perhaps the chief one, is that of the future of Poland, and the influence which the Congress would exert in this would certainly be in favor of a reestablishment of Polish nationality, at least in a state of quasi-independence. Russia has, however, clearly made up her mind on this subject. She is determined to keep Poland as a Russian province, cost what it may. According to present indications, she will, unless prevented by interference from without, convert it into a howling waste sooner than lose her hold on it. On this point there is no wavering at St. Petersburgh. A year ago there was wavering. There was at that time some uncertainty as to the course the Western Powers would pursue; and their desire to meddle was evident; but all doubt was soon removed by the headlong diplomacy of Earl RUSSELL. He managed to say all that could be said, short of a threat of war, in three or four dispatches, and then astonished everybody, and probably nobody so much as Russia herself, by informing her at the close of a good deal of very strong writing, that if Russia did not mend her ways, she would be visited with the disapproval of other countries. This was by no means all that she looked for, and was doubtless considerably relieved when she knew the worst. It is needless to say that Lord RUSSELL would have served the Poles vastly better by remaining totally silent, than by saying just enough to make Russia sure of impunity. And the notion that this Power is likely to be influenced in her dealings with a conquered province by the moral suasion of the West, is a strange one for a statesman who has sat at the feet of those who witnessed the great partition of 1772, and who himself actually took part in the debates arising out of the ""reconquest"" of 1832.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Chances of a European Congress The Great Powers and Other Powers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Chances of a European Congress The Great Powers and Other Powers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-09T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc96acca-ab95-5713-ab6f-87b104ef036d,929,nyt://article/bc96acca-ab95-5713-ab6f-87b104ef036d

The fire broke out on a barge named the Cora Campbell, lying at the foot of Perry-street. It was laden with hay, and other combustible material, belonging to the Government, and was about being towed out into the stream when the flames were discovered. The wind at the time was blowing a gale. Those of our readers, who yesterday afternoon had occasion to walk the streets of New-York, can appreciate the remark when we say there was a ""stiff breeze."" On the river, in the neighborhood of the fire, where the wind had an unobstructed sweep, its force and effect were far greater. The alarm was promptly given for the Third District, and the firemen rallied speedily around the scene. Before any streams of water could be brought to bear on the barge, the flames had extended to several boats and barges lying alongside. The most of these were loaded with hay, straw, wood, grain and other combustible material. The gale swept the flames from one to another of these craft with great rapidity, and the numerous boats, barges, schooners, brigs, &c., which lined the shore for the distance of about four blocks down the river were soon enveloped in the fiery element. The spectacle about this time became highly exciting. The firemen of the Third District were, as we have said, on hand. They worked manfully amid the flame and smoke, and at times they had to throw themselves face downward upon bales of hay and boxes in order to get their breath. Although from more than a score of hose large streams of water were playing on the burning boats and their contents, the fire was spreading with such alarming rapidity that the order was given to ring the bells for the Fourth District for more assistance.",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""DESTRUCTIVE CONFLAGRATION.; Over Thirty Vessels with their Valuable Cargoes Destroyed.

The Command of; Gen. Meade,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/10/archives/the-commandership-of-the-army-of-the-potomac.html,The Command of; Gen. Meade,"There is a report, which is not unlikely to prove true, that Gen. MEADE is to be removed from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and Gen. PLEASONTON put in his place; the reason being, we suppose, the failure of the former in the recent movement against LEE. We shall regret this extremely, for several reasons. We believe, in the first place, that no army could fail to be injured, and seriously injured, by such frequent changes of commanders as have taken place in the Army of the Potomac; the General's confidence in himself, and the soldier's confidence in the General, are both weakened by it. Each General who steps into the vacant place is, of course, warned by the fall of his predecessors of the insecurity of his position. He feels that he is only on his trial, and that the presumptions of the Government, and it may be of the public, are against him. He knows that the least error in judgment will probably lead to his dismissal. If under these circumstances, he did not become over-nervous and over-sensible of his responsibility, he would be either more or less than human; and being nervous, he naturally becomes timid. Feeling satisfied that he will have to bear the whole burden of the blame of any reverse that may occur, he shrinks, and naturally shrinks, from running any risk; and at last, by way of being perfectly secure against miscarriage, he refuses to do anything in which miscarriage can possibly occur, and this, in war, means total inaction. Now, we will not say no modest man, with ordinary doubts of his own genius, but no man with ordinary self-respect, likes to accept any position, however high, which is surrounded by drawbacks of this kind. Nobody can do his best if he is conscious that his superiors are watching his work with hostile eyes, and are ready to make the first indication of moral or mental infirmity the signal for his dismissal. A generous confidence, and generous appreciation of difficulties on the part of the Government, is absolutely necessary to secure the display of his highest qualities on the part of the General. We do not mean by this that a blockhead is to be allowed to blunder on month after month out of one scrape into another as long as a regiment remains to follow him: but we do think that a man like Gen. MEADE, who won a great battle within three days of his assuming the command of the army, and who is the first officer opposed to LEE who has proved himself his match in marching and manoeuvring, is entitled to more than six months' trial.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Commandership of the Army of the Potomac.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Commandership of the Army of the Potomac.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88143cf5-4c15-5be1-a0b9-c7f9f39426ff,1156,nyt://article/88143cf5-4c15-5be1-a0b9-c7f9f39426ff

Secretary USHER reviews the operations of his Bureau in the fullest detail, and, in general, shows very satisfactory results, accompanied by sensible suggestions. One of these suggestions is that a moderate tax be levied on the product of the gold mines, which are now unburdened in that respect. Indian affairs are reviewed at length, and the setting apart of new and larger reservations is urged; the Pension Bureau is rapidly increasing in its number of pensioners, which now reach 13,659 from the army, and 1,132 from the navy, requiring an annual outlay of fully $1,500,000 per annum; the Patent Office has issued nearly four thousand patents during the past year; the Government Asylum for the Insane has greatly enlarged its sphere of usefulness by affording a refuge for many of the unfortunates of the war, and the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind has been managed with great success; good progress has been made on the Capitol extension, and nearly all the works of art designed to embellish the Capitol building have been completed and put in their places. In reference to the African Slave-trade, the Secretary says not a siugle vessel is known to have been fitted out for that purpose in our own waters during the past year. An indisposition on the part of the negroes to colonize is noted, and in view of the new policy of the Government toward them it is now questionable whether the effort should be kept up. It is suggested that thousands of free colored laborers may be profitably employed in the construction of the Pacific Railroad. The establishment of a Bureau of National Statistics is earnestly recommended, because it will contribute to the advancement of all the public interests -- commerce, agriculture, finance, &c. -- and enable the Government to permanently preserve the experience and statistical knowledge it has gained. The rest of the Report treats mainly of affairs in the District of Columbia, all of which are represented as in commendable shape.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b097895a-9709-5941-b340-f6a22a5dcd91,603,nyt://article/b097895a-9709-5941-b340-f6a22a5dcd91

After referring in general terms to the arduous labors of his department in enforcing a blockade covering a distance of over three thousand five hundred miles, and carrying on naval operations upon the rivers and other internal waters of the Southern States, he reviews rapidly the different squadrons into which our naval force is divided -- the North Atlantic Squadron, the South Atlantic Squadron, the Eastern Gulf Squadron, the Western Gulf Squadron; the Mississippi Squadron, the Pacific Squadron, the Potomac Flotilla, and the vessels in the East India and China Seas -- and shows that each of them has done important work. An exhibit of the present strength of our navy, as compared with last year, is furnished, and an exhibit of its prospective strength when the vessels under construction shall be completed. Everybody in the land will certainly study these tables with minute attention. The Secretary discusses various desirable improvements in naval vessels, and, we are glad to see, refers more than once to speed as a necessity of them. He again urges, at length and strongly, the necessity for a new Navy-yard on a large scale. Great delay has arisen from the inability of our public yards and shops to execute the necessary repair and refitment of vessels. He also refers to the fact that while we have several Navy yards for building wooden vessels, the Government possesses not a single yard and establishment for constructing those of iron, nor even for making plates and shafting; and says that there are no parties in this country fully prepared to build iron vessels of the magnitude and description required.

In Oregon the Indians west of the Cascade Mountains are at peace, but east of those mountains they are all engaged in active hostilities. In California the condition is not satisfactory. The reservations are nearly worthless. The mining operations of the whites are constantly encroaching upon the rights of the Indians, which gives rise to frequent hostilities. The Commissioner urges Congress to harmonize the conflicting interests of the Indians and whites. In New-Mexico the Indians are mostly hostile, and their government is very expensive, $3,000,000 being fruitlessly expended every year, without any adequate results. In Colorado there have been slight disturbances, due only to small, roving bands. The Indians are much divided, and it has been found very difficult to make any general binding treaty with them.

The President's plan of restoring our Federal system to its normal operation, therefore, finds us already thoroughly committed to it in every essential particular. But, apart from our own foregone conclusions, we cannot help feeling the convincing power of the mere enunciation of the President's programme. Feasibility, justice, consistency, and security, are so patently met by it, in the fullest measure, that it challenges at once the acquiescence of all truly loyal men. Of course Faction will bark at it. It is the very nature of Faction to fly at any public good. But this manifestation of instinct will only be corroborative of the intrinsic excellence of the plan. There has not been a great efficacious measure in this war whose first appearance was not assailed thus.

The duty then devolved upon him, by reason of the peculiar condition of the country, in respect to the great rebellion, and the unsettled question of the volume of national legal tender currency, required for the future conduct of the war, was alike complicated and perplexing. He met the emergency by a statesmanlike review of the resources of the nation, and an urgent recommendation that the direct issue of legal tender notes should be confined to a very moderate increase on the previous aggregate of two hundred and fifty millions authorized by Congress at its preceding session. For the rest he preferred to rely upon loans, temporary or permanent, bearing a rate of interest not to exceed 6 per cent. per annum. Coupled with these views he again submitted -- and, it must be confessed, in advance of the state of financial sentiment on the subject -- his plan for a National Free-Banking system, secured by the pledge of the Public Stocks of the United States, which, by a fair distribution through the States, would give a uniform national circulation of three hundred millions, after the general return of the country to specie payments, and after the emergency which gave rise to the more direct legal tender issues of the Government shall have passed away.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Treasury Report.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Treasury Report.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ffc7085b-eb1f-5d3e-ad81-51bb40bf8dc3,1754,nyt://article/ffc7085b-eb1f-5d3e-ad81-51bb40bf8dc3

HALLECK opens his very lengthy report by taking up the Army of the Potomac at the time Gen. McCLELLAN was relieved by Gen. BURNSIDE, at Warrenton, Va., on the 7th of November, 1862. Gen. HALLECK urged Gen. BURNSIDE to continue his pursuit of LEE toward Richmond, but Gen. BURNSIDE declined, desiring to move to Falmouth, but finally consented to cross the Rappahannock by the upper fords and occupy Fredericksburgh. Gen. BURNSIDE's final march to, and occupation of Falmouth, was never authorized or approved by the authorities in Washington. The plan which the President assented to was to cross the river by the upper fords and occupy the town. This Gen. BURNSIDE did not do. Gen. SUMNER asked permission to do so when he arrived at Falmouth, the river being fordable, but it was refused. In the meantime LEE got there and intrenched. The delay of the pontoons, which should have been at Falmouth when Gen. BURNSIDE arrived there. Is explained by the fact that instead of being in Washington, where they were supposed to be, they were at Berlin and Harper's Ferry, and had not been moved, because the officers in charge did not receive Gen. BURNSIDE's order to move them to Washington. The battle of Fredericksburgh occurred Dec. 13. Through an alleged misinterpretation of orders, Gen. FRANKLIN's attack on the left was only a reconnoissance in force, and the attack of SUMNER and HOOKER on the right was unsupported. We were repulsed with a loss of 1,138 killed, 9,105 wounded, and 2,078 missing. Gen. BURNSIDE has never made any official report of these operations.

The first, addressed by M. DROUYN DE LHUYS, on Jan. 9, to M. MERCIER, the French Minister at Washington, dwells on the wish to see the North enter upon pacific conferences with the South; another, dated Feb. 26, is equally urgent on the same subject. Then comes an exchange of dispatches on the Mexican question. M. MERCIER writes, on April 3, that the Government of Washington will avoid giving France any cause of discontent. Then comes a very energetic letter of M. DROUYN DE LHUYS to M. MERCIER, protesting against a letter of Mr. ADAMS, the American Minister in London, and some dispatches of M. MERCIER, which relieve the Washington Cabinet of the responsibility for the same. Another dispatch of M. DROUYN DE LHUYS (Sept. 13,) gives an explanation of French policy in Mexico; France has not desired a cession either of Texas or Louisiana, or of any other territory in America.

They further declare, with a most attractive modesty, that he could not have been elected without their aid. The fact is, so bewilderingly unendurable is the pressure, that C. GODFREY GUNTHER, the irrepressible depoiter of BOOLE and BLUNT's anticipated honors, has been compelled to declare himself ""out of town"" to avoid it. Although to a certain degree, not unexpected, yet it has exceeded all expectations, and neither mentally or physically could man stand it.

Murder of Women and Children in a Cab,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/12/archives/crime-in-london-nysterious-murder-in-london-the-detection-of-crime.html,Murder of Women and Children in a Cab,"Paris has no monopoly of mysteries. Nothing that EUGENE SUE has imagined can surpass the story of the triple murder in a four-wheeled cab at the door of a public house, in a crowded thoroughfare, on a busy Saturday night. If there was a Morgue in London, what would have been the sensations of the public at the exhibition of these three bodies, unowned and unknown, taken out of a hackney carriage by a Policeman and a Surgeon! It does, however, speak well for society that this murder should have been discovered by the simplest and most natural of means -- by the gap which the victims left in their own little circle of friends. At any rate, a mother and two children were not made away with without being missed. The poor creatures had their own place in the society of this city, vast as it is, and when that place was empty suspicion was aroused. But for this, it is terrible to think how complete the mystery might have remained. The murderer had time to put hundreds of miles between himself and the scene of his crime. The contents of the cab, strange to say, would have furnished no clue to the perpetrator of the atrocity. There lay three dead bodies, with the luggage which women and children might carry for a short journey -- a small bundle, a leather box containing a few eatables for the children on the road, shawls, &c. Yet it happened that in all this there was nothing to put the Police on the track. Only one article of linen was marked, and that not with the initials of the owner. No accurate impression had been left even of the appearance of the murderer. The cabman thought he had worn a moustache, but it seems that he was mistaken. Nothing led to the discovery except the published description of the bodies, which answered all the purpose of those horrible exposures in the Morgue. The neighbors of the victims recognized the sketch, the more readily, perhaps, from the juxtaposition of the three figures, and then the truth became known. Upward of a century ago a most barbarous murder was discovered by similar means, though after a shocking fashion. A woman killed her husband, cut off his head to prevent the identification of the body, and threw it into the Thames. There it was found floating the next morning, and employed to bring the guilt home to the offender. But in those days there were no organs of publicity disseminating information through every grade of society, and so the magistrates extemporized, as it were, a Morgue for the occasion. They ordered the head to be washed and combed, and stuck upon a pole in the churchyard of St. Margaret, Westminster. By the side of the ghastly object was stationed an officer charged to observe the countenances of all who came to gaze on it, and arrest those who evinced any suspicious emotion. It was not in that primitive fashion, however, that evidence was obtained, but in the course of a day or two the neighbours of the victim did recognise his features, and the woman expiated her crime, according to the law of those days, at the stake. We must now observe that this is not the only, perhaps not the most extraordinary story of mystery lately disclosed. In the middle of the Summer, while happy tourists were enjoying themselves, and great towns were half emptied of their industrious inmates, a discovery was made which almost exceeds in horror the spectacle at the bottom of that railway cab. In a small house at Wolverhampton the corpse of a man was found lying on a bed in an upstairs room. The head had been frightfully battered, and was soaking in a pool of blood. The body had been coated with tar, for the obvious purpose of retarding decomposition, but so much time had elapsed before it was found, and the heat of the weather had been so great, that the corrective had failed, and the sight was a dreadful one. There was no living occupant of the house, the door had been fast locked, and was broken open by the Police. Exactly at the same time, in another house, also unoccupied, at Dudley, half a dozen miles off, was found the corpse of a woman. This body, too, lay on a bed, shockingly decomposed, but the dress and the hands of the woman were stained with tar, and in the pocket of her dress was discovered the key of the house which contained the body of the man. A laudanum bottle seemed in this case to tell the tale of suicide, but was the suicide the sequel of a murder? That was the natural inference, but beyond such inference the conclusion could not be carried. It was proved that the woman had once cohabited with the man; that she had quarreled with him, and that she had cohabited with others. These revelations suggested a belief that she had been at least an accomplice in the murder, and that she had destroyed her own life afterward, but no proofs of the facts could be obtained, and an open verdict of the Coroner's jury terminated the case of the Wolverhampton and Dudley mysteries. But how many mysteries are there without even that much of a clue to their solution? Did the reader observe what appeared in our successive reports of this deed of murder in the cab? It seemed to be conjectured that such an act might very probably be followed by suicide, and so inquiry was instantly made for the latest self-murders discoverable. It was answered on the spot. The bodies had hardly been taken out of the cab when a suicide was announced from Southwark. A man had just been found dead in a bed at a coffee-house with poison by his side, and the time appeared to fit so exactly that the cabman was hurried off to the house to look at the body. It was not the body sought; but fresh chances turned up every minute. All through Sunday and Monday the cabman was taken about to various parts of the Metropolitan Police district that he might ""identify bodies supposed to include that of the missing man."" But to render this proceeding of the slightest utility, all these ""bodies"" must have been discovered under circumstances consistent with the hypothesis entertained -- in other words, they must have been bodies of men who had come by an untimely and unexplained end since 9 o'clock on Saturday evening. Is there usually such a crop of mysteries? Are we really to suppose that on any day of the week a dozen or half-a-dozen fresh corpses may be produced, each of which, for all that anybody knows, may represent the perpetrator of a murder twenty-four hours before? It deserves notice, however, that the present mystery, now that it has been revealed, contains nothing but the most ordinary story of domestic jealousies and unhappiness. A more commonplace tale, except for the catastrophe, could not be imagined. A man conceives an aversion for his wife, whether with or without reason it is impossible to say. He determines to rid himself of what he considers a burden, but then he devises the strangest, the boldest, and most incredible scheme ever known. He makes arrangements with his wife to drive with the children to a railway station in a cab and pick him up on her way. At the station he takes another cab, stops at a public house in a crowded street for a pint of porter, in which he administers poison to mother and daughters together, sits beside them till they are quite dead, and then gets out with directions to the cabman to go on with his load to the other end of London! Such a murder, so planned and executed, may well astound the public mind, and account for a sensation which we have not seen exceeded since the days of RUSH or MANNING.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CRIME IN LONDON.; Nysterious Murder in London The Detection of Crime.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CRIME IN LONDON.; Nysterious Murder in London The Detection of Crime.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-12T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d535c3e7-9c72-5d46-af1b-1e10f7d2e6bb,1346,nyt://article/d535c3e7-9c72-5d46-af1b-1e10f7d2e6bb

From the testimoney, so far as adduced, we learn that about the time named above, JOHN KANE, the deceased, met a colored man, named HARKLESS LITTLE, in Worth-street, near Cow Bay. A quarrel ensued, and after some skirmishing, KANE chased the colored man into his own house, in Worth-street, near Missio.-place. KANE here commenced an indiscriminate abuse, not only on LITTLE, but also on his wife and another female who were present. After some words had passed between the belligerents, KANE went up to LITTLE, and alter various demonstrations around his face, he finally knocked him down. About this time one of the females undertook to leave the house for the purpose of procuring the assistance of the Police. She was also prostrated to the floor by KANE. The latter then went outside and commended throwing brickbats at the windows. After breaking all the glass in the windows of the house on one side, KANE again went inside, where he made a sudden assault on LITTLE by striking him several times on the face and head with his fist. LITTLE became so incensed toward KANE for his re-attack upon him, that he caught hold of a carving-knife, the blade of which was about fourteen inches in length, and plunged it into KANE's left side, nearly to the handle. It passed entirely through the heart, and the victim fell to the floor dead. LITTLE fled through the rear yard of his premises immediately after having committed the deed.

The War in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/13/archives/the-war-in-newzealand.html,The War in,"The war in New-Zealand is a war of race against race, and both natives and colonists are straining every nerve to make adequate preparation for carrying on the deadly conflict. The Waikatoes are the prime movers in the insurrection, and their influence has drawn in most of the other tribes. The success of Gen. CAMERON, some months ago, seems not to have been of a very decisive character, since the natives have taken up a strong position on the banks of the Waikato River, where, in a place most difficult of access, they have constructed a network of rifle-pits. This pah has been twice shelled by a small steamer, which has recently been stationed on the Waikato, but this mode of attack has merely served to annoy the Maori stronghold, which, to be captured, must be assailed in a very different manner. Most important results depend on the issue of Gen. CAMERON's assault on this native stronghold; for should he fail to carry it, his failure would be a signal for the tribes that have not yet risen, to arm in support of the native cause. It is doubtless the conviction of the disastrous consequences which would follow from his repulse, that has kept the British General so long inactive. He still occupies the redoubt which his forces threw up beyond the Mauvgawhirri Creek, previously to the fight at Kohivoa, and there he awaits reinforcements from Australia and India, ere he ventures to resume operations. The expected Sikh reinforcements may be dilatory in making their appearance, but the mission of the military agent to Sidney and Melbourne, has been eminently successful, and already large numbers of Australian auxiliaries have arrived at Duckland, while still larger numbers are daily looked for.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War in New-Zealand.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War in New-Zealand.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/722653ec-55bb-58ec-a3c6-8bb7711ece79,732,nyt://article/722653ec-55bb-58ec-a3c6-8bb7711ece79

It was expected that Alderman WALSH would as present to read off the returns from the Sixth Ward, which were all the returns that remained to be canvassed, but illness, which had prevented his attendance on the previous day, still kept him confined to his house. Alderman HARDY was therefore elected to read off the returns from the Sixth Ward, which he did, and afterward he called attention to the protest from Alderman WALSH, which had been presented and laid over a few days before. Mr. HARDY said Mr. WALSH protested that the election in the Sixth District of the Sixth Ward, in the Fourth District of the Fourth Ward, and also in two or three other election districts in those Wards, had not been conducted fairly, and that frauds of various kinds had been committed. In support of these allegations, he would present affidavits of various parties, which had been intrusted to to him by Mr. WALSH. These affidavits showed that properly-made challenges had been disregarded by the Inspectors of Election; that in one case, a ballot for Mr. WALSH for Alderman had been received by an Inspector and thrown away upon the floor; and that in the Sixth District of the Sixth Ward, where Mr. WALSH had but 145 votes allowed him, over 200 persons had voted for him. The protest thus supported, he argued, should prompt the Board to investigate the alleged frauds, and if they should prove to be actual frauds, that the returns for Alderman in the Districts where the frauds were committed should be thrown out. This course, he continued, would be in accordance with the precedent given by the Board of County Canvassers in the case of BOSWORTH and MCCUNN. He thought the Board owed it to themselves and to the public to investigate the alleged frauds, and, being largely of the Democratic party, they owed a duty to that party to make the investigation. He believed that an investigation would be welcomed by Mr. JONES, the Alderman elect for the District, and also the powerful clique in it, of which Comptroller BRENNAN is the leader, in order that Mr. JONES might come into the next Board of Aldermen without any cloud of fraud hanging about his election.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Board of City Canvassers.

"-- The Mobile Register has discovered one good result from the war, which entitles it to the credit of ingenuity at all events. It says that one of the leading objects of the rebellion was the cheapening the price of negroes. They had become so dear that none but rich people could afford to own them. The great mass of the whites at the South were completely shut out from the invaluable privilege of slaveholding. Independence and the opening of the Slave-trade, it was believed, would remedy this calamitous condition of affairs. The Register thinks the object has been pretty well accomplished already. Nearly a million of slaves have left the Border States and gone down to the Gulf States, and the surplus thus created has lowered the market price of negroes very essentially, so that they are now sold every day at ruinous sacrifices. The Register does not think it so important now as it has been hitherto, to continue the war.

Independence and the opening of the Slave-trade, it was believed, would remedy this calamitous condition of affairs. The Register thinks the object has been pretty well accomplished already. Nearly a million of slaves have left the Border States and gone down to the Gulf States, and the surplus thus created has lowered the market price of negroes very essentially, so that they are now sold every day at ruinous sacrifices. The Register does not think it so important now as it has been hitherto, to continue the war. It makes very little difference what reasons the rebels may invent for abandoning the rebellion; the main thing is to have them do it -- and the quicker the better for them as well as for the rest of mankind.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOVEL REASONS FOR ENDING THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOVEL REASONS FOR ENDING THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/adef31bd-cfb9-59bf-8fce-43b3dcd0e387,203,nyt://article/adef31bd-cfb9-59bf-8fce-43b3dcd0e387

Nurses for the Army,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/13/archives/nurses-for-the-army.html,Nurses for the Army,"It is safe to presume that the time of inaction has come to our armies -- a time when the campaigns are necessarily closed for the season, when, resting upon their wearied arms, each soldier looks forward to the enjoyment of whatever reforms and benefits are to be initiated or carried out, and for the aid of legislators and civilians in any practical method of alleviating such hardships as he may labor under. In suggesting these reforms and benefits, those which bear upon the event of a battle take first importance. Whatever of manhood there may be in the soldier while in the flush of health, when wounded or sick, he is but a child, and, considered as such, should be the recipient of the most studied and delicate attentions. The letters of our correspondents on the field have told some sad tales of the suffering that has been endured by our brave men from a lack of ambulance and hospital accomodation after a battle. There is no department in our army in which there has been so great a lack of efficiency as in this last -- the hospital accomodation, especially that of field hospitals, having been always defective, and in some instances immediately following a battle, criminally so. From the very commencement of this rebellion there has been too great a stretch for high surgery, and too little attention to the after part. It is easy to relieve a man of a leg or arm, but the life of the wounded man is dependent on something more than surgery. Without skillful nursing, his chances would have been almost as good had he retained his maimed or crushed limb, and this nursing can only be got by a more perfect organization of our field hospital system, and by the introduction of responsible nurses. To the sick or wounded man, there is as much in the ideal as the real, and with this fact before us, we shall not leave him to the tender mercies of those who may only regard him as an object of professional interest, or to the hands of male nurses, whose very sex is a depressing circumstance, and not calculated to call forth that repose necessary to recovery. In a word, some organized system of women nurses is required for the army. Our field, if not the general hospitals, should have women nurses, and these, not of the moment, but of an organized and skilled responsibility. We know well the objections that will be cited against the introduction of women within the lines, but the very authorities who raise this objection, and are most vehement for shutting out amateur female nurses, are also the strongest indorsers of an organized system. Dr. LETTERMAN, who was medical director of the Army of the Potomac, and induced the issue of the famous order of Gen. HOOKER, in which every woman, without distinction, was sent away from the army, was at the very moment of having this order issued, and always has been, an advocate of employing women in these dirties, if any proper system could be inaugurated; but in common with every surgeon of the army, he would prefer to be without such aid if it was to be incumbered with the burden of amateurs who were unable to take care of themselves, to say nothing of taking care of the sick or wounded.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Nurses for the Army.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Nurses for the Army.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-13T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff7786b4-f490-57bb-a793-b92e5ec00aca,758,nyt://article/ff7786b4-f490-57bb-a793-b92e5ec00aca

Message; The Blockade and the British Government,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/14/archives/jeff-davis-and-the-blockade.html,Message; The Blockade and the British Government,"The charges made by JEFFERSON DAVIS against the British Government, touching its treatment of the Confederacy, are evidently intended rather to produce an effect at home than abroad. In England, as well as at the North, they have all been so effectually refuted twelve months ago that there is not one of them which will probably elicit more than a moment's attention. The first one, and that on which he lays most stress, is the recognition of the blockade by the British Government, in spite of his allegations of its insufficiency, and it is a model of absurdity. He declares that the blockade is simply ""a paper blockade;"" but it this is the case, it cannot seriously injure the Confederacy. If the various ports are not effectually guarded, or, as he asserts, are not guarded at all, why the traders of the world can send their cargoes as freely, or nearly as freely, as ever, and the Confederacy suffers nothing, or next to nothing, and he has no ground for complaint. If the blockade be notoriously ineffectual, and United States cruisers, nevertheless, in virtue of its having been declared, capture British ships on their way to Southern ports, the party aggrieved is certainly not the Confederacy, but the British Government. The message before us is, we believe, the first case on record of a belligerent's making a great uproar about a wrong inflicted on a neutral, of which the neutral himself takes no notice whatever. Mr. DAVIS seems to labor under the extraordinary delusion that the adhesion of Great Britain to the rules touching maritime rights, laid down by the Congress of Paris, lay it under an obligation to defend and enforce those rules on all possible occasions. International law is, however, intended for the benefit of those who choose to avail themselves of it, and whether it will do so or not is peculiarly a matter which each nation must decide for itself. Each Power has certainly the right to submit to such violations of it as it pleases, just as much as each man has the right, to submit to be insulted with impunity, if he be so disposed, without its causing offence to his neighbors. All the restrictions on blockades are made for the benefit of neutrals, and if neutrals do not insist upon their being enforced, nobody but neutrals has any right to complain. ""A paper blockade"" means a blockade which exists only on paper. If our blockade be of that nature, it cannot, therefore, be any bar to the trade of the South with other countries, and Great Britain's submitting to it affects Mr. DAVIS in about the same degree as would Earl RUSSELL's unmanly readiness to have his nose pulled.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jeff.

On the 28th of the month Peck & Co. assigned those notes and other bills receivable to John Mack. Mack was spoken to about the assignment, as alleged, on the day of the sale, and it was not claimed by the defendants, Peck and Mack, who were witnesses, but that the sale was made with a view to the assignment. The plaintiffs proved that House had been discharged under the insolvent law two and a-half years before the sale in question, and that the notes he gave were each protested as they fell due, and were now in suit.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Validity of an Assignment Authorizing the Assignee to Sell on Credit.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.

"THE SECOND PHILHARMONIC CONCERT, (BROOKLYN.)?The second concert of the seventh season of this popular and eminently successful organization was given on Saturday night, at the Academy of Music, before an audience which literally filled the spacious house from orchestra to amphitheatre.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/17/archives/amusements.html,,"THE SECOND PHILHARMONIC CONCERT, (BROOKLYN.) -- The second concert of the seventh season of this popular and eminently successful organization was given on Saturday night, at the Academy of Music, before an audience which literally filled the spacious house from orchestra to amphitheatre. A more brilliant assemblage has rarely been seen on any occasion. The programme presented an attractive variety of orchestral and individual performances, the former consisting of SCHUMAN's Symphony No. 2, ""Oscari,"" WAGNER's introduction to ""Lohengrin,"" and KREUTZER's refreshing overture to the ""Night in Granada."" The symphony was deemed an experiment, nearly all of the Directors and very many of the members objecting to it, on account of its authorship. Thanks to the perseverance of Mr. EISFELD, however, the audience were permitted to listen to one of the most scholarly and sympathetic productions of the age, which was rendered with great delicacy and a heartiness of appreciation by the orchestra, who felt the double inspiration of love for the music, and vindication of the composer. ""Lohengrin"" is probably the most singular work yet presented by WAGNER to the public. The introduction, with the exception of a single passage, is one prolonged squeak, which penetrates like the point of a needle so very far into the future, that the faculty of the present fails to appreciate it. It is fashionable in Brooklyn just now to be desperately in love with the music of the future, hence this selection. It fell dead upon the audience, and its rest was in no way disturbed by plaudit or encore. The overture, a musical gem which is always welcomed by the professional or the popular audience was eminently successful in its interpretation on this occasion. Mme. VIRGINIA LORINI, the vocalist of the evening, was received with genuine applause. This lady's operatic endeavors on the same stage have always been miserably supported and fearfully botched, by the illiberality of managers and the inefficiency of her associates, with the single exception of a recent appearance. Her individual merit and desire to do right have produced their normal effect, and no prima donna is more welcome in Brooklyn than LORINI. She sang a cavatina from ""Semiramis"" and a polacca from ""Puratini"" with all the freshness of voice and beauty of expression which characterize her operatic efforts. Hearty encores rewarded each appearance, and there is no doubt the people would have gladly remained in the Academy till this blessed minute, had she not thoughtfully retired. The sensation of the concert was the debut of a young resident of the City, Miss BLANCHE CARPENTER, a pianist. The fact that a girl of seventeen, pretty and all that sort of thing, who had never struck a note in public, and was entirely innocent of the mysteries and miseries of an orchestral accompaniment, had been invited to play before the Philharmonic Society, was of itself sufficient text for a moderate wonderment; but that the Directors were willing to intrust the interpretation of WEBER's famous ""Concert-stuck,"" with its four movements, its intricacies of manipulation, its bewildering orchestral combinations and its breadth of thought, to a novice, was something so unusual, that people, particularly those whose daughters know a thing or two, shook their heads and looked solemn. However, Mr. MASON, her teacher, indorsed her, the Philharmonic conductors who had heard her in private said she would do. The solid men of Brooklyn who manage all these little things, followed in the wake, and the time of trial was announced. No one who was present can doubt the result. A more genuine success we have never witnessed. The work, though not always reckoned a popular one, is nevertheless one which a musically educated community, like that before which she played, cannot fail to admire and appreciate. It abounds in refreshing combinations, is supported by orchestral passages of great breadth and beauty, and contains a march of unexcelled grandeur. The debutante proved equal to the emergency. Her touch is clear and crisp, her trill distinct and marked, her time perfect, her facility of manipulation most remarkable. As she rose from her seat, the audience, which had sat spell-bound for the moment, broke forth in a display of enthusiastic applause, like that of an operatic furore; wave after wave of popular approval followed her from the stage, and demanded her reappearance. With great good sense, Miss CARPENTER refrained from a repetition and contented herself with a courteous acknowledgment of the applause. This was not satisfactory to the audience, who had worked themselves into the condition of Oliver Twist, and were frantically calling for more. The President, Mr. WYMAN, then announced that he had prevailed upon Miss CARPENTER to play during the second part of the programme, with which the audience subsided.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aa5c2260-d1a8-5c47-b318-9cd842b2d7ca,964,nyt://article/aa5c2260-d1a8-5c47-b318-9cd842b2d7ca

"There are now in process of construction in this City, Brooklyn and Jersey City, twelve iron-clads, most of which are modeled after the first monitor.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/17/archives/progress-of-the-work-on-the-ironclads.html,,"There are now in process of construction in this City, Brooklyn and Jersey City, twelve iron-clads, most of which are modeled after the first monitor. With a few exceptions, our iron-clads vary from each other only in size and number of turrets. It is thought by many there are several vessels being built similar to the Galena. This is a mistake, which arises from the fact that when that gunboat was launched, it was thought she would prove a far greater success than the monitors. Experiments, however, have shown that no regular sea-going vessel can be made sufficiently strong to withstand the modern armament of forts. The Italian iron-clad Re Don Luizidi Portogallo, twin sister of the Red'Italia, which is being built at Mr. W.H. WEBB's ship-yard, foot of Sixth-street. East River, will probably come as near perfection, as far as strength and speed are concerned, as any vessel now afloat. But even the Portogallo and the Red'Italia are not to be fully plated, according to the original design, until they reach Indian waters, clearly showing that it is believed they will be more seaworthy without their armor than with it. The Dunderburg, another of Mr. WEBB's creations, now rapidly approaching completion, has the appearance of a sea-going crate, but when finished will probably only be used for harbor defence. The construction of this vessel, which is peculiar, has already been described. It is now determined that she is to have an engine of 6,000 horse power, and is to be clad with iron plates of a thickness sufficient to withstand the penetrating of explosive power of any shot or shell now in use. A large number of hands are employed on her, and it is expected she will be ready to launch the early part of next Spring. The unsuccessful attempt to launch the Dictator at the Delamater Iron Works, foot of Thirteenth-street, East River, has resulted in a partial suspension of work on the vessel. The attention of her builders is now being turned to the manner of getting her successfully into the water. There are many who assert that if a greater inclination is given to the ways than they now have the vessel when launched will founder. All opinions to the contrary not withstanding, the ways are to receive additional inclination, when the Dictator will go into if not under the water. The work on the iron-clads at the yard of Messrs. SECOR & CO., Jersey City; also at Green Point and the Navy-yard is progressing in the most rapid manner possible. Probably all of the vessels ordered by the last Congress will be ready for service by the middle of next Summer.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PROGRESS OF THE WORK ON THE IRON-CLADS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PROGRESS OF THE WORK ON THE IRON-CLADS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6a4843c-8449-5443-8b97-b809c3d4917e,447,nyt://article/d6a4843c-8449-5443-8b97-b809c3d4917e
Exchange; Gen. Hitchcock's Letter,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/17/archives/the-rebellion.html,Exchange; Gen. Hitchcock's Letter,"News from Richmond as late as yesterday morning, has been received at Fortress Monroe. Charleston telegrams give an account of operations in that vicinity, from which it appears that Gen. GILLMORE continues to fire upon the City -- Greek fire -- that burns fifteen minutes after explosion of the shell. A great many houses are damaged. A fire of accidental origin had occurred at Sumter, destroying the wood-work of the bomb-proofs and some ammunition. The casualties one day in the fort were ten killed. Information from LONGSTREET's command puts a brighter face on his prospects. He is reported to have formed a junction with several scattered bands of rebels in Northeastern Tennessee, and, with this additional strength, is capable of keeping possession of that region. The rebels say that reconnoissances of HARDEE's cavalry to Ringgold and beyond, in the direction of Chattanooga, resulted in ascertaining that Gen. GRANT has materially contracted his lines. This is interpreted as meaning that a heavy force has been sent against LONGSTREET, and another heavy force to check FORREST's conscripting and guerrilla fighting in Western Tennessee.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d96439e7-1d87-5ee9-8bf7-d1737f5298cd,381,nyt://article/d96439e7-1d87-5ee9-8bf7-d1737f5298cd

Financial Fallacies,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/18/archives/financial-fallacies.html,Financial Fallacies,"The financial delusion which has brought the Confederacy into its present unhappy plight is one which is well worthy of our attention, inasmuch as it is one in which a large number of people at the North also are rather prone to indulge. It consists in the belief that a nation can pledge its whole property for the payment of a large debt, and that such a pledge is a good and substantial security. Nothing has been more common here as well as at the South than to see in print elaborate summings up of the value of the whole real and personal estate of the citizens of the United States, followed by an assurance that this was the exact amount of the fund on which the Government was at liberty to draw for the expenses of the war, or of any other undertaking that public liberty or security might require. At the South the same calculation was made much more gradually and with much greater confidence, owing to the fact that it possesses a monopoly of the commodity and all but a monopoly of some others of which the whole civilized world is greatly in need. The value of the Southern cotton and tobacco crop, were, we were told, so much; and of its naval stores so much; and these two added together presented the exact amount of the security which the Confederacy is able to offer to anybody who is shrewd enough to lend it money.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Financial Fallacies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Financial Fallacies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d5b070c0-079e-5d71-af6e-81794464a1b3,1328,nyt://article/d5b070c0-079e-5d71-af6e-81794464a1b3

Morever, when we reflect that he is cut off from all base of supplies, and is without any line of communications, it is difficult to see what other course was open to him. And yet he has not done so. Having succeeded in getting to a point where he is free from the danger of having his retreat cut off by a Union column moving through Cumberland Gap, he turns about at Rodgersville -- a point on the railroad about forty-five miles east of Knoxville -- takes up a position at bay, and repulses the attack of our advance cavalry force under Gen. SHACKLEFORD. At Rodgersville LONGSTREET has been joined by several detached hands of troopers, and cavalry and all included, he may now muster a force of twenty thousand men.

The resolutions were adopted after remarks by Aldermen OTTIWELL and HARDY, eloquently praising the character of Alderman FROMENT. The message and resolutions were then transmitted to the Board of Councilmen, and on their presentation in that Board, Councilman BRANDON made a brief but very feeling speech of regret at the loss which the public sustained in the death of Alderman FROMENT, and of warm eulogy of his many virtues as a public officer and private citizen.

Two to one are freely offered on HEENAN, and freely taken. It is said that MORRISSEY is betting heavily against HEENAN, and whether the report is correct or not, it has gained currency, and made many more takers than otherwise there would have been on KING A private letter from HEENAN, received by last steamer, is full of confidence, and announces an ""easy"" success. KING, he says, is in splendid condition, but he (HEENAN) was never in so good. KING's tactics are to fight low -- body blows --and HEENAN is prepared for this, by, from the waist up, being a ""mass of iron."" Above his hips there is nothing but cords, muscles, bones. English residents are willing to take even bets, but the odds are so freely offered that they do not make the proposition. HARRY CLIFFORD, of Broadway and Eighth-street, has 83,000 placed in his hands to bet on KING. He is authorized to bet even, and awaits takers. A singular bet was made on Wednesday evening -- $150 even that HEENAN would win in thirty minutes. This is merely throwing away money, the knowing ones say; HEENAN's ""quick fight"" will not avail him with one who knows his tactics, is an old stager and an acknowledgedly courageous and enduring man. A chance blow, it is true, may early decide the contest, but, saving that, it will be iron muscle against iron muscle, iron will against iron will, and thorough training against thorough training. The matter of a ""prize fight"" is offensive even in its suggestion, but this is occupying a prominence in the public mind which fully justifies reference to it. That it is ""international"" is a mistake. The English papers have combatted this idea in order if HEENAN wins, to qualify the character of the defeat. This side of the water it can be claimed as not ""international,"" because there is neither a liking for, an approval or recognition of this most brutalizing, disgusting exhibition of the ""manly art of sell-defence."" HEENAN fights on his ""own hook."" and is likely to have a much fairer chance than he had with SAYRES. He has made many friends in England.

All the principal pieces of the opera were rendered with intelligence and good effect, many of the choruses being given with very remarkable ensemble and force. This was especially the case in the second act, (the Kerinesse,) and in the fourth, where, with the aid of the Arion Society, the soldiers' chorus brought down the house. The principal soloists were in excellent voice, Mme. FREDERICK distinguishing herself, and, in the third act, meriting all the applause that could be bestowed upon her. The fresh and charming voice of this lady needs but the ripening which singing will bring to it, because not only enjoyable in the highest degree, but in some respects remarkable. The music of Margaret lays easily within its compass, and was delivered with great good taste and skill. Her HIMMER sang the Cavatina with clearness, and was generally painstaking and acceptable as Faust. Indeed, the performance, in all leading respects, was so good that we cannot help expressing the regret that the opera was not produced at an earlier period of the season. The house was magnificent -- probably the largest that has ever assembled in the Academy. A few such would have insured the success of Mr. ANSCHUTZ's season.

Christmas Books,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/19/archives/christmas-in-the-bookstores-books-for-presents-what-the-publishers.html,Christmas Books,"-- The diligent reader of the publishers' advertisements in the NEW-YORK TIMES, will have little to learn respecting the attractions set forth by our Book Houses in anticipation of the business requirements of that time-honored period, dear to old and young -- the Christmas Holidays. Still, it may be useful to group in one view some of the leading novelties which they now offer in great abundance to the oftentimes bewildered purchaser. The gradual encroachment of Christmas, as a social festival, on the old Knickerbocker anniversary of New Year's Day, is a noticeable fact of recent growth. Within the memory of many storekeepers it was but little regarded, and the establishment of Messrs. STANFORD & SWORDS, the Episcopal booksellers, was the only one that was closed in Broadway. Now it is as a business holiday kept as the most important of the year, and the purchases of books, fancy articles, &c., for presents at ""Christmas Tyde,"" far exceed those made in the following week, in anticipation of New Year's Day. A walk in Broadway at this season is a high aesthetic treat, so lavish is the wealth of ornamental art displayed to tempt the varying tastes of the buyers, whether intent upon securing some token for the one beloved object that shall speak -- more eloquently than words -- in the giver's absence, of what most he wishes yet fears to say, or with a less romantic purpose of filling the children's stockings with gifts from Santa Claus. Leaving to more imaginative chroniclers the task of celebrating the rainbow-tinted, silken and satin tissues -- the gorgeous-hued porcelain -- the glittering bullion and sparkling gems -- and the perfect wilderness of toys that attract one at every step in this far-famed thoroughfare, we shall briefly note some of the leading ""specialties"" of the different publishing and bookselling houses.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHRISTMAS IN THE BOOKSTORES.; Books for Presents What the Publishers Have Done for the Holidays.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CHRISTMAS IN THE BOOKSTORES.; Books for Presents What the Publishers Have Done for the Holidays.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/47b8a139-521a-5f6d-9180-d6bdbd8fbae6,2514,nyt://article/47b8a139-521a-5f6d-9180-d6bdbd8fbae6

"A hearing was had before Commissioner OSBORN, yesterday, in the case of The United States vs. Michael Hurley, Henry E. Sorrenso, Evan Edwards, and William Smith.

On the 3d of September, 1863, being off the Cape of Good Hope, about three o'clock in the morning, Mr. GILL, a steward on the ship, heard a scuffle on deck in the forward part of the vessel, and went up to see what was the matter. He found the first mate missing, and asked the prisoners what had become of him. They declared that he had fallen overboard in trying to harpoon a porpoise, and they had been unable to save him. It was a clear, starlight night, and no vessels in sight, but the steward on looking astern could see or hear nothing of the unfortunate man. These circumstances being reported to the Captain he put the prisoners in irons, on suspicion that they knew something more about the matter than they had told. While they were thus confined the steward was in the habit of taking their meals to them, and they subsequently confessed to him that they had knocked the first mate down with a belaying-pin, and thrown him overboard.

SHELDON & CO. are giving to the public, arrayed in the choicest elegance of the Riverside Press, and illustrated by some of the most felicitous designs of the forcible pencil of DARLEY. It is consoling to find in these evil days of rebellion that literature is not particularly suffering with the times. Indeed, so far from this being the case, we have noticed, within the last year or two, a growing improvement -- a higher standard adopted by our publishers. There may be fewer books issued, but they are of more value; and they are certainly better presented in print and paper. If something more is charged for there, the purchaser gets more in proportion for his money. We have noticed in these times a recurrence to the old standard literature of the seventeenth century, in the republication of the works of BACON, Sir THOMAS BROWN, FULLER, and others of that class, which is a most favorable sign of the moral cultivation and intellectual development of the country; for with the worthies of the past, to think is to feel, and to feel is to think. There is a healthy manliness -- a bracing tone in their writings suited to a period like the present. These men knew the pressure of civil conflicts -for England was nurtured to greatness by such periods of trial; and now they speak to us as if no centuries were intervening. Old FULLER's Good Thoughts in Bad Times, republished the other day, reads as if some thoughtful spiritual counselor had just written it for our meditations. Taking up not long since HOWELL's letters, a volume full of the best table-talk of a gentleman of the age of CHARLES I., we came upon an epistle which we rubbed our eyes at reading -- it seemed so like an expression of our own situation, such as we may find in the correspondence of to-day. The war, evidently, is not injuring sound literature. Our publishers, more than ever, devote themselves to standard authors; and the times are likely to produce authors who in their turn will become standard.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHARLES DICKENS,; WORKS OF CHARLES DICKENS.

Lamar Scheme for Breaking Blockade,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/19/archives/the-lamar-scheme-for-breaking-the-blockade-ade.html,Lamar Scheme for Breaking Blockade,"-- Our readers probably recollect the letter we published some weeks since from G.B. LAMAR, of Savannah, to Ex-Mayor WOOD, of this City, in which he proposed a partnership in a scheme for running the blockade, he to furnish the capital and WOOD to bribe some authorized officer of our Government to grant permission for the vessel to enter -- the profits to be equally divided. Mr. WOOD denounced the letter as probably fictitious, but Mr. LAMAR acknowledged that it was genuine, and was vehemently abused in the Georgia papers for having sought to purchase favors of the Lincoln Government. We find in the Savannah Republican a card from Mr. LAMAR, in which he claims great credit for patriotic motives in making this proposition. It seems his object was not to make money, but to secure from the blockading Government permission for the passage of a single vessel, because that would at once destroy the blockade. He seems to think it would not have made the slightest difference how this permission was obtained. We think he would have been greatly mistaken in his calculations; indeed, we doubt whether he ever had any such hope or purpose. It seems much more like an afterthought to protect himself against the bitter censures of the rebel journals. His course in the matter involved him in a very sharp quarrel with two gentlemen of Savannah, who publish long cards in reply to his.",6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LAMAR SCHEME FOR BREAKING THE BLOCKADE.; ADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LAMAR SCHEME FOR BREAKING THE BLOCKADE.; ADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7f518be5-ba81-53b4-866e-7397365c32aa,239,nyt://article/7f518be5-ba81-53b4-866e-7397365c32aa

The haut ton, on the other hand, evince a holy horror at the vulgar theatre and the vile balls of tbe butchers, but compound for sins they are not inclined to by attending tableaux vivants, where divers beauties, contrary to every principle of good taste and Southern feminine delicacy, display their charms through picture frames or stretch their finely moulded limbs on the floor or on sofas and lounges in the picturesque attitudes of famous pieces of sculpture. These model artist exhibitions -- if that be not too harsh a name for them -- are extolled in rapturous terms by those who witness them, but the gentlemen declare that the living statuary is by no means so ravishing as the low-bosomed dresses which are now in vogue. The importation of stunning manners and astounding costumes, is one of the most deplorable results of the war, and one is not surprised to hear that marriages of very doubtful authenticity have occurrred in certain circles of the unfortunate Confederate Capital.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STATE OF SOCIETY IN RICHMOND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STATE OF SOCIETY IN RICHMOND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-19T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ae97de47-467c-5246-81ed-9b12e54b7b76,293,nyt://article/ae97de47-467c-5246-81ed-9b12e54b7b76
"An evening or two since, as the wife of Police Captain MILLS, of the Second Precinct, was riding up town in a Broadway stage, she was robbed of her pocketbook, containing a small sum of money, under the following circumstances: When Mrs. MILLS entered the stage there were three men inside. Two of them were apparently young gentlemen of good address, and for a time they behaved toward her with much politeness -- passing up her fare and rendering her other little attentions. The third gentleman soon left the stage, and Mrs. M. immediately thereafter noticed that one of the young men was trying to attract her attention by throwing out his handkerchief, and by various other actions, to which she gave no heed. About this time the other one took his seat near her, and she soon after lapsed into a state of half-consciousness, from which she did not recover until she reached her home.

Clark vs. James & Erastus Brooks, all proprietors of the New-York Evening Express, has reached the point where a sale has been ordered. The points are briefly thus: The plaintiff on the 30th of November, 1855, bought of James Brooks one-sixth of an interest in the Express for $13,333 33, and was, until July 1, 1863, the publisher and financial editor of the paper. At the close of January, 1863, the parties, for the first time made a formal partnership, (marked A in the pleadings,) which, by consent, was ante-dated Jan. 1, 1863, in which the interests of the parties were thus set forth -- that the paper is owned as follows: James Brooks, one-half part thereof; Erastus Brooks the one-third part thereof, and the said Stephen T. Clark the one-sixth part thereof, and as such owners and proprietors have heretofore published the said New-York Express under the name of J. & E. Brooks. At the same time was also delivered to Clark by James Brooks a bill of sale of the interest bought by Clark, Now. 30, 1803, and the bill of sale was by consent ante-dated Nov. 30, 1855, marked (B) in the pleadings. Very soon after making the partnership, and obtaining a formal bill of sale, the plaintiff gave the legal notice [???] the termination of the partnership, and proceeded to close the business under the articles of partnership and bill of sale, asking for a receiver and a sale of the common property.",10,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Express Newspaper to be Sold.; COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.

He says that he found the passages and ante-rooms of the prison piled up with boxes and bales of clothing and provisions which had just been received from the North by flag of truce. Upon ascending to the upper stories of the building occupied by the prisoners, he saw the greatest profusion of comforts and luxuries in the way of provant that even a riotous imagination could conceive. Hams, smoked beef, Bologna sausages hung from the rafters; tin cans of potted meat, oysters, sardines, green peas, etc., etc., were arranged on shelving against the walls; while the finest pippins rolled along the floors. Immense packages of new publications, sets of chessmen, backgammon boxes, etc., which had apparently just been opened for distribution, proved that the Yankees did not intend their unhappy brethren should die of ennui. The prisoners themselves were variously occupied, some lying at full length on the floor, deeply involved in the tragic incidents of Miss BRADDON's novels; others playing whist and euchre, or deeply pondering the gambits; others asleep; others again eating their dinners. Brig.-Gen. NEAL DOW was lapping up the soup furnished by the prison cook with evident satisfaction. One man only was reading the Bible. All looked in fine health and seemed remarkably cheerful. The receipt of boxes from home had no doubt something to do with their good spirits, but before these creature comforts had begun to arrive, they were contented and hearty. Maj.

And yet the general tone and temper of the House may be inferred with a reasonable degree of accuracy from the action taken upon them. Mr. WOOD's proposal to send Commissioners to Richmond, in the face of the distinct declaration of the rebel authorities, that peace was impossible except on the basis of independence, was not even allowed to come to a vote -- being laid on the table very promptly, and by a large majority. Fifty-six members voted against the disposition of it, -- many among them desiring its rejection without evasion of any sort. But the action of the House at that time probably settled the fate of all similar schemes for the remainder of the session. Mr. WOOD, himself, will not be likely to press his attention again upon the notice of Congress and the country. Indeed it is asserted that he has given in his adhesion to the decision of a Democratic caucus, that the Democracy shall sustain the war, and that all peace propositions will be abandoned.

The check purported to have been drawn by the firm of Messrs. COFFIN, BRUCE, BISHOP & CO., of No. 39 Warren-street, dealers in hardware, for the sum of $400. It was made payable at the Chemical Bank, to A.Z. or bearer, and dated Nov. 20, 1863. The paying teller, Mr. JOHN C. PARSONS, being acquainted with the signature of the above named firm, made a careful examination and at once pronounced the check a forgery. One messenger was forthwith sent for a policeman, and another to secure the attendance of a member of the firm. Meantime, the young man who presented the check, was detained at the bank on the pretence that the business of the day being over, it would require a little time to get at the funds requisite to cash the check. Officer MCARTHUR, of the Broadway Squad, soon made his appearance, and about the same time Mr. JOHN B. COFFIN entered the bank and made an examination of the check, which he immediately pronounced a forgery. The young man was thereupon taken before Alderman HALL, acting magistrate at the Toombs. A preliminary examination was there held, during which the accused stated that his name is ROBERT KARPELS, that he was about 19 years old, by occupation a broker, and resided at No. 367 Fourth-street. He further alleged that he had received the check from GEORGE O. MARSDEN, in the regular course of his business as a broker. Who MARSDEN is, or what business he follows, did not transpire.

It has long been plain to discerning minds that behind all this talk about habeas corpus, emancipation, State rights, and other questions which mere party men have sought to keep in the foreground, there has been a controlling influence quite distinct from anything that appeared in the controversy. It was something that shaped and colored the opinions of men, and predisposed them in advance to approve or denounce -- something that was ""the master light of all their seeing."" Between the supporters and opponents of the Administration there has been a higher issue, not so palpable as the others, because abstract, and yet that dominated all the others.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/20/archives/a-vessel-carried-over-niagara-falls.html,,"An obliging correspondent at Chippawa sends us an account of a melancholy occurrence which took place on the Niagara River on Monday last, which resulted in the death of one man by being carried over the Falls and caused imminent peril to five others, as well as the loss of a small vessel. About eleven o'clock in the morning the steam tug A.D. Griffin, of Buffalo, reached that port, having in tow two scows, the Abby and the A. Murray, of Port Robinson. The Captain of the steamer, not knowing the depth of water, kept too far into the river with not sufficient steam to keep headway on the scows. One of the latter, the A. Murray, striking against the ""spites"" at the entrance of the harbor, swung around with the current almost into the jaws of the mighty cataract. The Captain and four men who were on board, seeing the helpless position into which the vessel had got, and the great peril with which they were threatened -- being within less than five minutes' distance of the great fall -- leaped from the vessel and boldly struck for shore. Four of them, the Captain included, succeeded by great exertions in maintaining themselves above the surface; but, sad to relate, the fifth sank amid the leaping and boiling waters and was carried over the cataract. In the meantime a boat manned by two brave men shot out from the mouth of Welland River, to the assistance of the helpless beings in the scow. The oarsmen, Messrs. F. LAUZAN, JR., and GEORGE MORSE, pulled boldly and swiftly out, rescued the men from their perilous position and succeeded in reaching the shore just above the first rapid. One minute more and they would have been carried over the Falls to the great gulf below! Too much praise cannot be given to the men by whose presence of mind and courage four human beings were thus rescued from certain destruction. The scow glided along the stream till it reached a rock almost on the brink of the cataract, where its course was stopped, and where if will probably remain till broken up by the ice in the Spring."" -- Toronto Leader, Dec. 16.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A VESSEL CARRIED OVER NIAGARA FALLS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A VESSEL CARRIED OVER NIAGARA FALLS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/98a1a32e-71c8-5d61-8d16-2620b2bcfd8c,370,nyt://article/98a1a32e-71c8-5d61-8d16-2620b2bcfd8c

The document is by far the plainest and most positive in its assertions of any to which rebel statesmanship has yet given birth. Mr. MEMMINGER deserves credit for his boldness. He doesn't mince his words; he knows just how near the verge of ruin the Confederacy stands, and he tells the ill-starred rebels, in plain phrase, that there is but one possible hope of escape, and if that fails they must succumb. No doubt Mr. MEMMINGER will be berated by the ""last ditch"" gentry for his frankness and his exposure of the weakness of the rebellion. But he has the sense not to attempt to disguise the fact that the rotten hulk is sinking, and says, virtually, that they must make one more attempt to buoy themselves up with paper and rags, and if that fails, they must surrender. He presents a plan, on which he builds high hopes, and then notifies the rebel Congress that there is no time for discussion; the necessities of the case, and the perils of the situation, are so great, that the plan must be adopted and put in operation forthwith. Every day of delay, he says, is making the matter worse; and so if Congress stops to inquire or haggle about it, they will all be swamped in the abyss of financial ruin.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ways and Means of the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Ways and Means of the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6337115-4bb1-5f72-b371-bd6aa82f4a32,1081,nyt://article/d6337115-4bb1-5f72-b371-bd6aa82f4a32

British Accusations Against the North,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/20/archives/northern-cruelties.html,British Accusations Against the North,"Mr. BEECHER, in his speech at the Academy of Music, alluded to one matter which is familiar to all who read the English journals; we mean the reports of the Northern cruelties which have gained such credence in England. Nothing has ever shown the success which the persistent repetition of a slander may gain, as the popular belief of the middle classes of Great Britain in these imaginary stories. The denial of them, and the proving of their falsity over and over again, does not seem to produce the slightest effect. The organs, or the agents who circulate them, of course never spread these replies, and the great unthinking English public remains as firmly convinced of our enormities as ever. No American supposes that the Saturday Reviewers or the Times' correspondent can ever be governed in the slightest degree by any sense of honor or truthfulness in the case of these infamous slanders. They are paid to decry the Union cause. But when a gentleman like Mr. BUXTON, in a letter most honorable to himself, rebuking the horrible cruelty at Kagosima, alludes to the crimes of Gen. TURCHIN as a historical fact, it shows how little accurate knowledge of cotemporary events even a fair-minded and philosophical looker-on may have. The whole myth of TURCHIN and the ""boarding-school rape"" was never heard of here except by the few who read the Saturday Review. The acts of plunder and violence in Rome, (Ga.,) which gave a foundation to it, were fully explored by a Court-Martial and justified by the laws of war. A trustworthy correspondent of this journal exposed the story last Summer, and showed that the only act of violence committed was on a negro strumpet, whose character left it doubtful whether she was most ""sinned against or sinning."" Yet this explanation will doubtless never reach either Mr. BUXTON or any other misinformed Englishman.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Northern ""Cruelties.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Northern ""Cruelties.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe9fe72b-11b5-5826-8c2f-72fc0fd9a118,1126,nyt://article/fe9fe72b-11b5-5826-8c2f-72fc0fd9a118

It has proved the infinite superiority of English authority over the democratic Government of the United States, in the maintenance of law and order. A gang of mutineers, who had gone on board an American steamer as passengers, rise upon the officers and crew, kill some and overpower the rest, and take possession of the vessel. The ship is recaptured in British waters and the offenders handed over to the British authorities, for such disposition as justice may require. And a mob in the streets of Halifax rescues them from the officers of the law and sets them at liberty. So far as we can see thus far, the authorities were utterly powerless, and did not even attempt to maintain themselves against the mob.

About 1 o'clock the procession, consisting of the relatives and friends of the deceased, members of the Common Council, representatives of the Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows, Tammany Society, and the chief officers of the Police Department, proceeded to church, where a large number of people had already assembled. The coffin, beautifully decorated with flowers, was borne to the altar, followed by Mr. GUNTHER, Mayor elect, Judge DALY, Comptroller BRENNAN, Supervisor TWEED, Superintendent KENNEDY, City Inspector BOOLE, and others. The funeral sermon, or more properly oration, was delivered by the Rev. Dr. JAMES SCHOUCK, who, after reading from the Bible the words ""My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, my thoughts higher than your thoughts."" proceeded to make an application of the text to the occasion. The Doctor illustrated the fact that God's ways are not man's ways in the death of Alderman FROMENT, for had it been optional with the community of which he was so useful a member, he would have lived to the age of a patriarch. God had seen fit to remove him, for what reason none knew -possibly because He wished us to have a higher appreciation of the value of good men, that we might strive the more to emulate them. The Doctor's remarks were listened to with profound attention. At their conclusion, the burial service was read and an opportunity afforded the audience to see the remains. At 2 1/2 o'clock the remains were taken from the church, when the procession was again formed, and proceeded to the interment in Greenwood Cemetery.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Funeral of Alderman Froment.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Funeral of Alderman Froment.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-21T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28d464e4-52f9-5e95-b0ea-654ef8f11f5e,518,nyt://article/28d464e4-52f9-5e95-b0ea-654ef8f11f5e

This is attributed by the Supervisors' Committee to the action of the Government military authorities here, particularly in the matter of the order issued by Gen. HAYS, some ten days ago, forbidding the Provost-Marshals from certifying to the enlistment of any volunteer who did not get the $300 City bounty in his own hands. The motive of Gen. HAYS in issuing the order was most praiseworthy -- being the desire to save volunteers from the fleecing operations of what are called bounty brokers -- but its practical effect has been to lessen the number of recruits more than one-half, and if it is to continue in force, the ultimate result will be to prevent New-York from filling her quota by volunteering within the time allotted by the Government, or within any other reasonable time, A serious question arises here which demands the attention of the authorities at Washington. The City of New-York, it is claimed, is abundantly able o raise her quota by volunteering within the required time, if she is permitted to do it in her own way.

The upper portion of both buildings was occupied as the hotel. The lower part of No. 291 was a restaurant and lager-bier saloon. Mr. S. KAPPF was the proprietor. The flames rapidly spread through the two buildings, and, despite the efforts of the firemen, both were soon destroyed. No. 291 was four stories in height, and No. 293 five stories. Messrs. KELSEY & CADY, who occupied No. 293 as a pork-packing establishment, estimate their loss at $35,000. They are insured for $14,000, in the Harmony, Etna, Kings County, Firemens' Trust, of Brooklyn, and other Companies. Mr. KAPPF's loss is over $20,000. The loss on both buildings is about $15,000. The adjoining building, No. 295, occupied by REISSMAN & KAPPES as a tobacco warehouse, was much damaged by water. The upper floors were occupied by tenants. Their furniture was much damaged by water. Premises No. 289 were also considerably damaged by water. The Police were promptly on hand, and among them was Mr. Inspector CARPENTER, who was at the scene immediately after the breaking out of the fire and rendered most effective service. Capt.

"An accident, which was nearly attended with the most fearful results, occurred on the Morris and Essex Railroad, at Newark, on Saturday afternoon. The Morristown Express, which leaves this City, via Hoboken, at 5 P.M., was crossing the bridge over the Passaic, when, from some cause not fully explained, the iron rods supporting the west end of the draw suddenly gave way, causing it to sag nearly two feet. The locomotive passed on to the main part of the bridge, although the cross-ties for several feet were crushed by the great weight thus suddenly brought upon them; but the baggage-car was forced from the track, and the entire side of the smoking compartment was stripped off as if it had been of paper. The three passenger cars attached were also thrown against the side of the draw with great force, and each one of them had its sides crushed in to a greater or less extent, while in the rear car nearly every seat was torn from its fastenings by the violence with which the forward part of the train came against the string pieces of the main part of the bridge. Providentially and miraculously, as it seemed to those on the train, not a single person was killed, and only one passenger received serious bruises; but the impression that part of the train had fallen through the draw, which is thirty or forty feet from the water, and the fear that the rest might follow caused the wildest consternation among the passengers who filled the three cars, until the actual extent of the damage was ascertained. The accident caused serious obstruction of travel, but by the aid of the rolling stock of the Bloomfield Railroad the passengers for Morristown finally reached their destination. Various theories are urged to account for the disaster, one that the bridge-tender neglected to lock the draw properly; another that the structure itself was defective; but as there was no one on the spot to give an authoritative explanation, the result of an official investigation must be awaited. One is as imperatively demanded as if the draw had entirely given away or the locomotive had swerved to the right instead of to the left, in either of which cases it is difficult to see how a most appalling disaster could have been averted.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/22/archives/railroad-accident-a-narrow-escape-on-the-morris-and-essex-railroad.html,,"An accident, which was nearly attended with the most fearful results, occurred on the Morris and Essex Railroad, at Newark, on Saturday afternoon.

"MILITARY ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT. -- A rather novel proceeding was developed yesterday, in a hearing before United States Commissioner SERGEANT. A drafted man who was at the barracks, Twenty-second and Wood streets, had an altered note passed upon him at a tavern in the western part of the city, and upon the fact being communicated to Maj. FALLS, in command of the barracks, he sent a guard and had the bartender arrested and taken there. The prisoner was there placed in irons, and kept in custody the remainder of Wednesday, through Wednesday night, and up to 12 o'clock yesterday.

"Last Saturday afternoon, a young lady, the daughter of a well-known citizen residing up town, was shopping on Third-avenue, between Fiftieth and Fifty-first-strcets. One of her hands was ungloved, and she wore a very valuable diamond ring, which fact the sequel will show is pertinent to the story. After visiting several stores the lady walked to Forty-ninth-street, passing through it toward the Sixth-avenue. When between the Fifth and Sixth avenues she was checked by a pull on her cloak, and accosted by a young and gentelly-dressed man, who said, pointing to her hand. ""I'll take that ring you have on, and your money, and watch it you have one."" The lady was, naturally enough, startled and alarmed, and quickened her pace, the villain following and renewing his demand. She told him to leave her, or that he would be delivered to a policeman, when he tauntingly responded ""Ha! ha! there's no policeman in sight."" The lady hurried on, and he still pursued, reiterating his order for the valuables. On the lady reaching and turning into Sixth-avenue, the thief, deterred by the number of people then met, fled. He evidently had seen the lady on the Third-avenue, had noted the ring, and laid in wait to follow and rob her. The block selected was just the one for his purpose; there are few houses on it, and few passers through.

One of her hands was ungloved, and she wore a very valuable diamond ring, which fact the sequel will show is pertinent to the story. After visiting several stores the lady walked to Forty-ninth-street, passing through it toward the Sixth-avenue. When between the Fifth and Sixth avenues she was checked by a pull on her cloak, and accosted by a young and gentelly-dressed man, who said, pointing to her hand. ""I'll take that ring you have on, and your money, and watch it you have one."" The lady was, naturally enough, startled and alarmed, and quickened her pace, the villain following and renewing his demand. She told him to leave her, or that he would be delivered to a policeman, when he tauntingly responded ""Ha! ha! there's no policeman in sight."" The lady hurried on, and he still pursued, reiterating his order for the valuables. On the lady reaching and turning into Sixth-avenue, the thief, deterred by the number of people then met, fled. He evidently had seen the lady on the Third-avenue, had noted the ring, and laid in wait to follow and rob her. The block selected was just the one for his purpose; there are few houses on it, and few passers through. The lady anxiously looked for the appearance of a gentleman during the ruffianly following, from whom she could claim protection, but not one, unfortunately, was on the street, and but two persons, both old ladies, were met. The self-possession of the intended victim was most commendable. This act is about as bold a one as has been recorded; it was perpetrated in broad daylight, in a thoroughfare.

His conversion is the more remarkable, as he has always been severe in his denunciation, of scientific pretenders, and has exercised in the London journals a sort of police against all squarers of the circle, finders of the longitude, &c.

No one who saw the vessel when she arrived here in charged of the prize officer, could dream of her being turned into so formidable a looking ship as she is to-day. All the mercantile features have been replaced by a regular man-of-war aspect, and the weak timbers have been replaced by very sound and strong ones. When the Petrhoff came to the Navy-yard she was very much out of repair, besides being no more than an ordinary merchant steamer, having very good engines and reputed to be very fast. She was immediately taken in hand by the authorities of the yard, and a survey was held upon her to demonstrate the amount of work to be done on her in effecting her ""conversion"" into a regular naval vessel. The survey estimate having been approved of workmen were put on her. Her decks were newly laid down, her bulwarks strengthened and braced in the strongest manner, a whole suite of lower apartments put in her, an excellent wardrobe and officers' mess quarters organized, and first-rate accommodations for the crew arranged. Of course this took a long time to effect, and it is only yesterday that the vessel began her career as a man-of-war. The guard of marines marched down to her at 1 o'clock, the crew from the North Carolina went on board at the same house and at a few minutes afterward the Stars and Stripes were hoisted from her peak. She will now receive her coals and provisions and leave for active service in a few days.

BUTLER KING in June last, in refutation of the rumor that he was in favor of reconstruction. Mr. KING, in this letter, ""defines his position."" He claims to have al ways maintained the right of a State to secede from the Union, and to have urged Georgia to exercise that right upon the election of Mr. LINCOLN. He says he regretted the necessity for such an act, and even hoped, after the ordinance of secession had been adopted, that the Federal Government would adopt such measures as would permit their return. The war, however, put an end to these expectations, and he has sustained it to the utmost of his ability -- having given every male member of his family to the field, and two, who were most dear to him, to a soldier's grave.

"The authorities in this city, and through them those at Washington, have been made acquainted with what is believed to be a rebel plot to seize a bark about to sail from this port. A few days since two gentlemen, on the train from New-York to Philadelphia, were conversing together in regard to the capture of the steamer Chesapeake, when they were interrupted by a female sitting near, and who appeared to be somewhat under the influence of liquor. She interrupted the conversation of the gentlemen by remarking that what they were talking about amounted to nothing in comparison with what was proposed to be done in Philadelphia -- that in Philadelphia there was something more important, as a vessel was about to sail loaded with Government stores, and she was to be captured. The gentlemen paid little heed to what they at first believed to be the insane ravings of the woman, but concluded it would be better to watch her on her arrival in the city. They also took the precaution to inform the Police, and the vessel was watched. The woman, supposed to be in the cars, was seen to go on board the bark A One, a vessel belonging to Portland, Me., but which had been chartered to carry munitions of war to a distant port. It was concluded not to interfere at this stage, as the woman's visit to the vessel gave some color to her boastful story. The bark went to the Navy Yard, where a number of cannon were placed on board as freight for the use of the Navy Department. On Wednesday, the bark left for Wilmington, where she was to receive 3,000 kegs of powder at Dupont's wharf and then proceed on her voyage. After she had left this city, a tug boat containing a number of Philadelphia police officers was sent after her to watch her movements. The instructions were that as soon as the cargo was all on board, the bark was to be boarded, and her papers and crew examined, and if found wrong, brought back to Philadelphia. The captain had not joined the vessel when she sailed from Philadelphia. The result of the examination, has not yet transpired, but we understand that an order has been sent to Wilmington to have the bark sent back to Philadelphia. -- Philadelphia Ledger, Dec. 18.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/23/archives/a-supposed-rebel-plot-to-seize-a-vessel.html,,"The authorities in this city, and through them those at Washington, have been made acquainted with what is believed to be a rebel plot to seize a bark about to sail from this port.

That he possesses it no one can deny. Young ladies are to him what mosstroopers were to SCOTT, sentimental highwaymen to BULWER,"" or man-of-wars-men. to MARYATT. Their hopes, fears, loves, embarrassments, joys, and distresses, form the staple of his stories, and are depicted with the variety of nature itself. No English writer but Miss AUSTIN can be compared to him in this specialite, and even she yields to Mr. TROLLOPE, who is the more gentle, and consequently the truer, artist. Women can scarcely be trusted to portray women; the, sense of power implied in being ""behind the scenes"" makes them forget their own sex in their triumphant denunciation of offenders. Rachel Ray is a purely domestic, and realistic story. Not a character is introduced, not a sentiment expressed, but what is in agreement with the daily life of a retired English country town. A tale of successful love ruffled only by temporary disturbances, gives no opportunity for vivid interest or excitement. It must pall on the appetites of those who feast on sensation stories, but the quiet truth of the picture, the genial good humor and the fatherly interest which the writer seems to take in the fortunes of his own creations, give Rachel Ray a charm that books of higher aim and more ambitious, pretension too frequently want. If it does not add to, it well supports, Mr. TROLLOPE's well-deserved reputation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY.; NEW PUBLICATIONS. RACHEL RAY. A Novel.

Capt. MAFFIT, who commanded one of the fastest and most successful of the rebel privateers, writes from London in October, giving very discouraging accounts of the blockade-running business. ""Nothing,"" he says, ""has entered Wilmington for more than a month,"" while we were here making ourselves very unhappy over the reports that vessels were constantly carrying enormous cargoes into that port, and that it did not seem to be blockaded at all. Capt. MAFFIT adds that six of the last boats that tried to enter were caught, and that it was not of the slightest use to try the adventure with any steamer that could not run seventeen miles an hour.

Effect on the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/24/archives/repudiation-at-the-south-its-effect-on-the-war.html,Effect on the War,"The near approach of repudiation in the Confederacy is hailed with delight with a great many people at the North, in the belief that it will paralyze the resistance of the rebels and so at once put an end to the war. A little consideration will show, however, that this is, to some extent, a mistaken idea. If the whole Confederate currency were burnt up to-day, it would doubtless be a cause of a good deal of chagrin to those who hold large quantities of it; but that class is most probably a very small one. The community at large would not be a whit worse off than before. The land, slaves, crops, machinery, or in other words, the property of the country, would still remain and would still retain its value. The Government notes have no intrinsic value; they rest on nothing and represent nothing, but the ability of the Government to redeem them; but that no importance has been attached to this by the people of the South for a long time, is proved by the depreciation of the paper. The things for which the paper was given in exchange were a real loss, but these have been consumed long ago, and the country has become reconciled to doing without them.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Repudiation at the South Its Effect on the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Repudiation at the South Its Effect on the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/40105329-0e90-55db-8f83-670ca168697d,981,nyt://article/40105329-0e90-55db-8f83-670ca168697d

No sooner had the orders been received by the Admiral than he immediately sent for the commanding officers of the United States steamers Neptune, Kensington and Peterhoff, and gave them the necessary instructions. The Vicksburgh had gone down to the Narrows on Sunday evening, in company with the Sebago -- the latter gunboat ordered to sea, and the former remaining off the Narrows, where she is at present. The Vicksburgh yesterday overhauled the Government transport Arago and sent her back to the City for a pass, without which she was attempting to leave harbor. The Captain of the Arago thought it was not necessary to be provided with such a document, as he was in the Government service, but the Captain of the Vicksburgh undeceived him on this point. The following is a brief description of the vessels to take the position as stated: The Vicksburgh is a screw propeller, recently purchased from the Neptune Steamship Company with four others. She is a good-sized ship, having a capacity of 926 tons. Her dimensions are: Length, 185 feet; width, 33 1/2 feet, and depth of bold 18 feet. Her engines will enable her to steam very fast, their cylinders being 36 inches in diameter. The vessel was built recently at Mystic, Conn. She is commanded by Commander D.S.

Late in the night the officers saw a cart loaded with barrels drive up to the wharf where the steamer lay, when the barrels were hoisted on board. Before they were put into the hold the officers made their appearanceand ordered them to be put back on the wharf. On examination they were found to contain powder and percussion caps, surrounded with potatoes. Early yesterday morning, Surveyor ANDREWS and his Deputy, Mr. THOS. J. BROWN, boarded the steamer and took possession of her. Soon afterward Marshal MURRAY, with several of his Deputies, visited the steamer in pursuit of some noted characters who were expected to sail on her at 9 A.M. Several of them subsequently came on board and were arrested by the Marshal. The carman who drove the barrels to the steamer had meantime been followed up, and from him it was ascertained that the contraband goods were packed at a well-known house in Cortlandt-street, and that several more barrels were in waiting there to be carted to the steamer, had not the first load been seized. Mr. BROWN, by order of the Surveyor, seized the place in Cortlandt-street, and now holds possession of it. The officers of the steamer are also said to be implicated. The Government authorities are determined to break up the contraband trade with the rebels, which has been carried on to great extent in this City, and this is a good beginning.

Ringing out with joyous peals of music from harmonious bells, with carols, songs and laughter of happy children, Old Trinity annually says to Wall-street. ""Christmas is here; Venite Exultemus,"" and Wall-street closes its ledgers and cash-books and goes home, thinking of the empty stockings hanging by the chimney-side, and how if nature abhors a vacuum, young Wall-street abhors, it too, especially in his Christmas stocking. At 2 1/2 o'clock the Chimes commenced, Mr. JAMES E. AYLIFFE, ringing the following melodies on the Bells: No. 1 -- Fantasia, composed for Trinity Church Chimes, by GEORGE F. BRISTOW. No. 2 -- Christmas Carol, Silent Night, Holy Night. No. 3 -- Evening Bells. No. 4. -- Christmas Carol. No. 5 -- Christmas Carol, The Christmas Tree. No. 6 -- Vesper Hymn. The services in the Church commenced at 3 o'clock, with the Psalms for the 24th day chanted by the choir as usual. At the close of the evening prayer, Mr. CUTLER's carol, ""The Christmas Tree,"" was sung by the children of the Sunday School, Master HOPKINS taking the solo parts. The Rev. MORGAN DIX, Rector of Trinity, then delivered a short address to the children, after which they marched in procession to the Christmas Tree, and each child received a beautiful and appropriate present. The Church was tastefully decorated with evergreens, laurrel, &c., and the Christmas Tree brilliantly illuminated and festooned with ribbons and gifts, attracted a great deal of attention. The Church was crowded to excess by members of the congregation and strangers. The church will be open this morning, services commencing at 11 o'clock.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CHRISTMAS EVE AT TRINITY CHURCH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CHRISTMAS EVE AT TRINITY CHURCH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-25T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c59bfd70-06c8-50cd-8edc-d922f2af86aa,281,nyt://article/c59bfd70-06c8-50cd-8edc-d922f2af86aa

This interfered with Mr. MILLS very seriously, and he has now obtained the grant to use their track, on paying fair compensation, for the purpose of enjoying his original rights, and saving them from destruction. The Mayor vetoed the ordinance but approved of the main principle involved.

In certain branches of industry in America this principle has been adopted with great success, and our whale-ships, pilot companies, fishing fleets, as well as some manufacturing associations in Massachusetts show how practicable and profitable the idea has been.

How to keep up Strength; Union vs. Rebel Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/26/archives/how-we-and-the-rebels-propose-to-keep-up-our-armies-a-contrast.html,How to keep up Strength; Union vs. Rebel Plan,"It is a somewhat notable coincidence that, at this moment, both our own authorities and the heads of the rebellion are laboring at the same problem -- namely, to secure the continued services of the troops whose term of enlistment will expire in a few months. But the method of solving this problem in the two cases, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the different spirit governing the two communities. The Union armies will continue their existence by the voluntary reenlistment of our veteran soldiers. And the admirable feature of this is, that it is a spontanous movement, originating in the heart of our armies themselves. It is not the device of official wisdom, and is a great deal better than official wisdom could have devised. The plan was carried to Washington and not sent from there. It is, in fact, the inspiration of the patriotic impulses of our soldiers, and has for months been the theme of camp-fire conversation. At the time when the most serious anticipations were arising in the minds of those who reflected that, just at the time when the Spring campaign would be fairly entered upon, our armies would fall to pieces by the expiration of the term of service, and nothing be left our commanders but masses of raw undisciplined conscripts and substitutes -- it turned out that there was, throughout our armies, the greatest willingness on the part of whole companies, battalions, and even brigades, to enlist for another term, provided they were properly and liberally treated, and allowed to go home as organizations on furlough. There has been more delay than we could have wished in completing a system for giving effect to this patriotic proposal; but Gen. MEADE has at length embodied a plan for the Army of the Potomac which is fair and liberal in its provisions, and in accordance with which the great work of reorganization may be at once begun. This plan provides that where three-fourths of a company or regiment are willing to reenlist, they will be allowed to go home with their arms, equipments, etc., for a furlough of thirty-five days. With entire justice the ""three-fourths"" of a company or regiment is interpreted in the sense of three-fourths of the men of the organization actually in the field, not including those members who may be prisoners of war, or laid up in the hospitals, etc. In the plan devised for the Western army, these latter were counted in with the three-fourths, and this restriction has proved so distasteful to the men, that the spirit of reenlistment is said to be all but extinguished. We cannot but think this very unwise policy. It would be much better to apply the system adopted in the Army of the Potomac to all our armies in the field. In response to the order of Gen. MEADE, we understand that more than ten thousand men have already come forward to reenlist in accordance with its provisions. We have no doubt that the movement will extend throughout the whole army, and it is fair to anticipate that by Spring, two-thirds of the army will be enrolled for another term of ""three years or the war."" Nor is this all: no recruiting agents could possibly work with a tithe of the effect of those veteran regiments returned home with their grand traditions, and the emblems of many a glorious field -- each man personally interested in filling up his regiment to the full. These things make the military outlook as brilliant as could well be desired. We shall, in fact, enter upon the Spring campaign with larger armies than we have ever had before; and not only larger, but better disciplined, drilled and furnished with all soldierly qualities.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How We and the Rebels Propose to Keep Up Our Armies A Contrast.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How We and the Rebels Propose to Keep Up Our Armies A Contrast.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f5ee9bb-92e1-53ba-aba8-dace8d023a6a,1350,nyt://article/4f5ee9bb-92e1-53ba-aba8-dace8d023a6a

The places of business were closed, and everybody appeared to be out of doors. The streets were thronged. Thousands repaired to the skating ponds on the outskirts of the city. The Washington, Nassau, Capitoline and Union Ponds were in full blast, and filled with skaters of both sexes. Musical entertainments were given on sereral ponds, and would have been on all if bands could have been procured for the occasion. The numerous free ponds, to be found almost anywhere about the suburbs, were also filled, and all seemed to have a happy time. The Industrial Union Schools presented a lively appearance. The children, anticipating a treat, repaired thither in large numbers, and all were satisfied. Some received skates, others books, and all candies and other good things. There was an interesting time at the Baptist Tabernacle Church, corner of Hicks and Luqueer streets, in the evening. Some years since the children of the neighborhood were gathered together by some benevolent and christian citizens. The school grew in numbers, and at length a church was organized of which the Rev. T. EDWIN BROWN was chosen pastor. The congregation is now in a flourishing condition. The exercises last evening consisted of singing by the children, dialogues and declamation. A quartette of adults sung Christmas carols and Christmas anthems -- the entire musical programme being under the direction of Mr. H.E. MATHEWS, and excellently conducted. The church was finely decorated with evergreens and flags, presenting a very pretty appearance. About one thousand children were present, besides some four hundred grown persons who take an interest in the School, which is under the superintendence of Mr. J.F. DAVIS. The average attendance on Sundays is about eight hundred. A number of presents were given after the exercises were concluded. The Superintendent was presented with a photographic album containing cartes de visite of all the teachers. It cost $30. A panorama of the Holy Land and of battles of the rebellion were given during the evening by Mr. M.R. BROWN, which added greatly to the interest of the occasion. The children were provided with plenty of good things, and all went home satisfied and pleased with the proceedings of the night.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/98a1c727-12b2-53bb-8dca-f8d1ea023bee,1067,nyt://article/98a1c727-12b2-53bb-8dca-f8d1ea023bee

The fire worked on under the roof in such a manner that they could not reach it. The bridge was wholly of wood. The recent cold weather had dried it like touch-wood.

It seems the Times was guilty of a gross misrepresentation of Mr. BRIGHT's speech at Rochdale, and directly charged him with having advocated the division of the lands of the rich among the poor. Mr. COBDEN, who spoke at the same place and time with Mr. BRIGHT, takes up the charge in a terribly severe letter to the Times, in which he strips the ""impersonal"" shield from the editor, and lays bare the ""moral cowardice,"" and ""preeminent unscrupulousness"" with which the Times has always treated questions of politics and society, shielded by the impenetrable incognito of ""The Editor."" This letter the Editor of the Times received, and it seems, without reading it, announced in his ""notices to correspondents"" that it would ""appear to-morrow."" But upon reading it, or upon second thought, perhaps, ""The Editor"" decided not to print it, and sent Mr. COBDEN a note, stating his reasons. Mr. COBDEN thereupon addressed a letter to the Daily News, which published it in full. This irritated ""The Editor,"" who sent a copy of his note to Mr. COBDEN to the Editor of the News, with a request to publish, intimating in his missive that Mr. COBDEN acted unfairly in sending the letter to the News without a copy of ""The Editor's"" reply. We publish both documents, and the reader will see the masterly manner in which Mr. COBDEN exposes the dishonorable practices by which the writers or the editors of the Times, have always mercilessly assaulted persons and projects, and always taken refuge behind the great ""impersonal"" feature of the paper.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MR.

A copy of Mr. ROBINSON's reply to this claim accompanied the statement. Mr. ROBINSON declines to make the remission claimed, for the reason that the act of 1859 establishing the State Board of Equalization of Assessments requires them to determine the assessment of the various counties on which the State tax shall be levied, and that the amount of taxes levied upon such assessment ""shall be raised and collected."" Mr. ROBINSON reasons that if a county ""makes mistakes in its assessments, it is a matter with which the State has nothing to do."" The subject was referred to the Committee on Annual Taxes.

Pay of our Soldiers; Raids--Their Success,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/27/archives/pay-of-our-soldiers.html,Pay of our Soldiers; Raids--Their Success,"Our Government ought to make more thorough and effective provision than it has yet done, for the prompt and regular payment of our soldiers. Much has been done to improve their physical condition, and continual agitation has worked some reform in the sanitary arrangement of the camp, but there is a greater reform still to come and that is the reform of the pay-roll. Sooner or later this reform must be achieved, not only with the men, but with the officers. They must be put upon such a basis that they will know to an hour, when they are to receive their pay, and, by creating for them avenues for its use, they must be taught its value. As long as our soldiers are paid at long intervals, so long will they be subject to the incubus of sutlers, and so long will the vice of gambling exist in their midst to a destructive degree. A man kept penniless for months, and then given a sum which, magnified through his penury, seems a mint, must be more than human if he disburses it with judgment and economy. The chances are very strong that it melts rapidly away in dissipation, or is frittered upon objects which, in the poverty that is sure to follow, are parted with for a tithe of their value. This is precisely the position of our soldiers; they receive too much money at one time, and they do not receive it punctually. There is a, wonderful satisfaction to a man who is achieving any kind of labor, in knowing that his recompense is near at hand. He can work with greater spirit, and he can employ his gains to better purpose. There are many who argue that the rule suiting the mechanic or laborer, will not suit the soldier. This is simply nonsense. The same instinct is with them, and it is only a question whether the system shall be organized, and when organized, whether the soldier shall have an opportunity of spending the pay he so fairly earns, without being taxed from one to five hundred per cent. by sutlers, or whether he is to be left to feel that his thirteen dollars per month is really little better in camp than one quarter the amount would be if paid where the avenues for its absorption were open to competition. We are just now entering upon a winter in which there will be little done by the greet armies. It will be an imminent time; a time full of great consequences, even though a time of inaction. If, during this time, anything can be done that will add to the morale of the men, it should be considered, and executed rapidly. The alteration of the manner of paying the men is something that can be done in a day, but the relaxation of discipline that will throw the sutlerism open to competition, will have its opponents in high places, not only among civilians and contractors, who are now growing rich to depletion by it, but by army officers of elevated grades, who, as they are doing very well under the present monopoly, will not see the necessity for a change. And yet the change must come; and we will venture to say that when the hour arrives, it will be hailed by every enlisted man as his millenium, and in the same light by nine-tenths of the commissioned officers.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pay of Our Soldiers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Pay of Our Soldiers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'ARMY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a59da133-a675-50b0-85e7-27abbc6150f1,857,nyt://article/a59da133-a675-50b0-85e7-27abbc6150f1

That the rebels could be conquered, was more certain than that they could be safely dealt with when conquered.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/27/archives/reconstruction-the-difficulty-and-the-remedy.html,,"The great concern of thoughtful minds, during the prosecution of this war, has been not so much about victory, or about the sequel of victory. That the rebels could be conquered, was more certain than that they could be safely dealt with when conquered. It was plain that we had a superiority in strength, that had only to be fully and perseveringly exerted, to insure complete military success, sooner or later. The census tables sufficiently showed that. But military success is one thing; civil well-being quite another. There is many a victory in history which was not only profitless, but the very prelude of destruction. It is not victory simply that we fight for. Were that all, we might better ground arms at once. Victory, for its own sake, can gratify only pride or anger. Doubtless these were enlisted to some extent in the contest. Like the pagan deities of old, they mingle in every mortal fight. Yet they are not worthy to have one drop of blood spilt for them. It is patriotism solely that justifies this war. Not the patriotism either that lives in mere impulse. There is, indeed, something good in that, but it has no authority to require these terrible sacrifices. That can come only from the higher patriotism which has its seal in reason, and which looks ""fore and after."" We fight not merely because we feel, but because we think -- because it is our deliberate judgment that our country can be saved through fighting, and only through fighting. The conviction is a sound one. Peace with the rebels, without disruption and ruin, is impossible. But the safety is to be gained through fighting, not merely by fighting. Conquest of the rebels is needful, but it is not all that is needed. Unless the conquest shall be supplemented by a right civil policy, the Union, even with the conquest, will be left in a condition hardly worth the saving. It is just this doubt whether that policy might be found, and recognized, and adopted, that has particularly troubled reflecting men. It is just this belief that it has been found, and that with general consent it will be used -- it is just this, we say, that has done more than all things to consolidate faith in the salvation of the Union into positive assurance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reconstruction The Difficulty and the Remedy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reconstruction The Difficulty and the Remedy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af37fcc0-142c-5271-91c5-75a8a335368e,1289,nyt://article/af37fcc0-142c-5271-91c5-75a8a335368e

"The village of Kingsville, in the County of Essex, contains at present, in addition to its usual population, a number of ""skedaddlers"" and deserters from the American army, many of whom prefer hanging round the bar-rooms of Canada to serving their country in the field. Among the last-named class was an individual whom, for the sake of distinction, we shall call SAM. He came to Kingsville some two months ago, and, not long after his arrival, formed a matrimonial connection with a Rose-y daughter of the village -- said connection to last during ""three months, or for the war."" Matters went on pleasantly for some time, and would, no doubt, have continued to do so if the fine weather had lasted, but the recent ""cold snap"" put an end to it in rather an unexpected manner. SAM, finding that his habiliments, although comfortable enough in the region of Vicksburgh, were not proof against the chilling influence of a snow-storm, determined to send his temporary wife off to purchase warmer clothing, and, accordingly, dispatched her to Detroit, giving her $40 for the purpose. After enjoying herself for a day or two in that city, she wrote to him that she could not make a selection, and advising him to come up and choose for himself, saying, at the same time, that he need not have the least fear for his safety, as she had made every inquiry and found there was no one on the lookout for deserters, &c., &c. SAM believed every word she wrote, and, anxious to rejoin her, took the first stage for Windsor, and, on arriving there, at once crossed over to Detroit. In the meantime, Miss ROSEY had had an interview with the Provost-Marshal, and, ascertaining that she would be entitled to receive $30 for delivering up a deserter, had posted that functionary as to her friend's anticipated movements. He according had two of his deputies to watch the ferry-landing, and SAM had been ashore but a few minutes when he was nabbed and marched off to safe quarters. ""Phancey his pheelinx,"" as Jeemes would say. His betrayer, as soon as she found her game secured, called at the Captain's office and received the money. Then, without as much as calling on SAM to say good bye, she posted off for Kingsville, where she arrived $70 better off than when she left it.

"European Congress, the Proposed",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/27/archives/the-peace-congress.html,"European Congress, the Proposed","Earl RUSSELL'S rejoinders to M. DROUYN DE LHUYS have not, it seems, settled the question of the Congress. NAPOLEON is still bent on realizing his idee, if possible. The more so, probably, because of Madam VICTORIA'S contumacy. He is reported, indeed, to be negotiating with ""various European States"" on the propriety of convoking the Congress ""without England."" Should he succeed, however, in arranging for its convocation, it may chance that other great Powers will be absent therefrom as well as ""perfide Albion."" Despite the courteous tone of the first replies of Russia, Austria and Prussia, is it quite certain that they will ultimately give in their adhesion? As they begin, like England, by demanding definitions and explanations, may they not end, like her, by declining to have hand, act, or part in the matter? The notes of these Powers are merely introductory, and contain nothing conclusive. Before the Czar can return a final answer, he must have ""a categorical list of the debatable questions."" Ere the Kaiser can reply definitely, he must see ""the bases and programme of the deliberations."" While the Prussian King cannot make up his mind till his Imperial Brother shall have ""communicated to him his views respecting preliminaries."" Now, simple and reasonable as these requisitions appear, they place NAPOLEON in a most awkward dilemma. There is really in them more than meets the eye. They are intimations to his French Majesty of the conditions on which the said Powers will consent to attend; and yet they impose on him the necessity of clearly defining the terms of the compact. He can, of course, overcome their several objections to his scheme, by making the concessions which he knows each secretly desires. He can propitiate the Czar and the Prussian King, by narrowing down the Polish question to a discussion of Poland's rights under the Treaty of Vienna, and he can conciliate the Kaiser by engaging to keep the Venetian question out of Court. But what would the Poles and Italians think of such tergiversation? Or, how could NAPOLEON afterward affirm that his proposed Congress would be equal to its task?",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Peace(?)

Who called this Convention, and who composed it, we are not aware; nor have we any distinct statement of the precise object of its deliberations. t is quite safe to assume, however, that neither its members nor their constituents have been for any very long time citizens of Louisiana. They are probably men from the North, whom the tide of war has drifted into that State either as political speculators, or as social missionaries, and who deem the present a fitting opportunity for reforming the institutions of the South upon their own models. We infer from this brief statement of their action in convention, that they regard colored men as on a footing of equality, in all respects, with the whites, and that they intend to make the practical recognition of this equality the corner-stone of that new social edifice which they aim to erect in the Southern States.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Negro Equality in the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Negro Equality in the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Louisiana', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f2fceed-6653-5eb0-9e22-f4e869e16918,910,nyt://article/0f2fceed-6653-5eb0-9e22-f4e869e16918

Notwithstanding the fact that no tickets were issued, and that admission was confined to a few naval officers and the representatives of the press, the precincts of the vast ship-house, in which the vessel was built, were on Saturday crowded to excess. The launch was to take place at 10 o'clock, but long before that hour 13th street, as far as 9th avenue, was thickly studded with persons wending their way to the river. The harbor also presented a very animated appearance. Hundreds of crowded small boats plied to and fro, and the decks of all the mercantile vessels, near the wharf, were alive with spectators. The steamer Fargo was literally crammed with people, who shouted and cheered for hours before the ceremony. Conspicuous among the assembly was Capt. ERICSSON, who, for the first time, we believe, witnessed the launch of one of his vessels. We also noticed the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, (Fox,) Commodore STORER, Admiral GREGORY, Chief-Engineers STIMERS, ROBIE and LAWTON, C. GODFREY GUNTHER, Esq., Mayor elect of this City, Capt. WORDEN and many others. The vessel was launched quite unexpectedly to all -- sliding from her ways when the workmen had knocked away the blocks till within 50 feet of her stem. This occurred at 9 1/2 o'clock, and Mrs. GRISWOLD, who had been deputed to christen her, not being present, a workman seized the bottle of wine, smashed it across her bows, and named her the Dictator.

On Friday, a colored man named JOHN ALEXANDER, who is employed in the office of the Headquarters of the colored regiment, at No. 350 Fourth-street, was passing by Lafayette Hall, when he saw an aged colored man seized in the manner described, and stopping to ascertain the cause of such a proceeding, he too was seized and forced back into the pen at the point of the bayonet. On his demanding to know by what right he was thus treated, he was told that it was ""none of his d_____d business, and that niggers had better keep their mouths shut."" The officer who claimed to be in charge, and who was dressed in United States uniform, gave orders that if ALEXANDER attempted to escape from the pen to ""run him through with a bayonet."" After finding out where ALEXANDER was employed, they concluded that it would not be safe to detain him over night, and so let him go. After getting out, he told his story to his employers, and complaint was at once made to Gen. DIX. On Saturday, Gen. DIX sent an officer to Lafayette Hall to arrest the parties who had perpetrated the outrage, but they were not to be found. ALEXANDER says there were several other colored men confined there while he was detained, who said they had been kidnapped in the same manner. It is said that Gen. SPINOLA has received authority from the War Department to recruit, independent of the Provost-Marshals, who have no control over his operations.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Kidnapping Recruits--A High-handed Outrage,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Kidnapping Recruits--A High-handed Outrage,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce47274d-fdd0-5f36-a4bf-f5b43ce122f6,348,nyt://article/ce47274d-fdd0-5f36-a4bf-f5b43ce122f6
Literary Items,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/28/archives/literary-gossip.html,Literary Items,"--Few merely literary announcements have given more general satisfaction than Messrs. CROSBY NICHOLS' notice of the change in the editorship of the North American Review. The names of the new conductors, Prof. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL and CHARLES ELIOT NORTON, are accepted as a guarantee of the new spirit that will be infused into this veteran periodical--always respectable indeed under its late editor, Dr. PEABODY, but scarcely equal to the wants of the time, in vigor of tone and decided expression of opinion on the great topics of the day, whether in theology, politics, science, or social life. The North American was commenced nearly fifty years ago, and is only six years younger than the London Quarterly, which began in 1804. Its founder, and first editor, was WM. TUDOR, and the first number appeared in May 1815. It has, at various times, been under the management of ALEXANDER and EDWARD EVERETT, JARED SPARKS, Dr. PALFREY, Prof. BOWEN and the retiring editor. Dr. PEABODY. Its high character has been uniformly maintained, and scarcely a literary man of note can be named who has not occasionally contributed to its pages. Volumes I. to IX., forming the first series, partook somewhat of the character of a magazine, and BRYANT's first poem, Thanatopsis, originally appeared there. These early volumes are now excessively scarce, and complete sets of the Review are of rare occurrence and command a very high price.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LITERARY GOSSIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d195e417-9ec2-56f8-a1d3-cf21f5298d1d,1320,nyt://article/d195e417-9ec2-56f8-a1d3-cf21f5298d1d

Winthrop","By this noble volume Mr. WINTHROP is worthily acquitting himself of the debt he owes to a long and unblemished line of ancestors, as the heir of their reputation, derived from honored deeds in their country's service, and the inheritor of a good name, prominent among the really historic ones inscribed on the annals of America. The life of a gentleman of station, born in the stirring year of the Spanish Armada, and occupying various positions of responsibility and credit in the times of CHARLES I. and the early Puritans, must always be of interest, where the particulars are derived mainly from his own authority, as in the present instance; but how much is that interest heightened when the subject of the biography stands in the relation to a mighty country that JOHN WINTHROP, a preacher of the Pilgrim band and first Governor of Massachusetts, occupies towards the United State of the present day. The deified heroes of antiquity were no others than as this man was -- and in Greece temples would have been built to the fame of the leader under whose auspices the ocean was crossed and the foundations of empire laid widely and deeply on a foreign strand. The volume opens with a charming picture of the rural village of Groton, in Suffolk, where the author -- the seventh descendant of its ancient lords -- visited the cradle of their race with pure reverence. Existing documents and family papers enable him to trace satisfactorily the life of JOHN WINTHROP in his native land through a manhood not unchequered with cares, but on the whole fortunate and prosperous, until he set sail in 1630 from the country he was not again to revisit, although nineteen years of active life remained to him in the region so fervently adopted by him, to the exclusion of past interests and associations.

Section two imposes a fine of ten dollars on each conductor and driver for not taking out a license. Section three fixes the license fee at one dollar. Section four compels the conductors and drivers, when requested, to bring the cars to a full stop in setting down and taking up passengers. Section five makes it the duty of the railroad companies to designate, conspicuously within the car, the number of passengers such car is capable of accommodating with a seat. No riding on the platform is to be permitted, and no person beyond the number such car is capable of accommodating with a seat shall be required to pay fare. This section met with considerable opposition, and a motion was eventually carried to refer the matter back to the Committee for modification, until tomorrow (this evening.)

admission of ordering rams from England,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/29/archives/mallory-acknowledges-the-corn.html,admission of ordering rams from England,"It will be remembered that at the time of the excitement about the building of the rams in England and France, the rebel agents, together with Messrs. LAIRD & CO., tried to palm them off as being designed for this or that potentate. The ""Emperor of China"" was made to father one or more of these pachydermous monsters. ""The King of Egypt"" also came in for one or two more, and the bastard progeny were even baptized with Turkish names, such as El Massoun, &c., to make the cheat the more complete. Meanwhile nobody doubted for a moment that they were really designed for the rebels. And of this we have now direct testimony from the rebel Secretary of the Navy, MALLORY, who in his report roundly acknowledges the corn. He confesses that by order of JEFF. DAVIS he dispatched several agents to England and France ""to contract for eight iron-clad rams for the purpose of breaking the blockade."" Five were to be built in England and three in France. But, ""owing to the unfriendly construction of her neutrality laws"" (neutrality in the case of iron-clad rams is rather good of MALLORY) ""the ones built in England were not allowed to depart,"" while those built in France were subjected to so many official visitations that he has ""sent orders to have the work on them stopped."" Though this acknowledgment does not add the assurance of a straw to what was before the moral certainty of everybody, it is well enough to have the cat let out of the bag at once. We now know exactly what the ""Emperor of China"" looks like. He has hollow cheeks and high cheek-bones, wears a stovepipe hat and Yankee coat (rather rusty and the worse for wear), and is the very counterfeit presentment of that ornament of the ""Rogue's Gallery,"" JEFFERSON DAVIS.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MALLORY ACKNOWLEDGES THE CORN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MALLORY ACKNOWLEDGES THE CORN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/deb28d31-5796-5a9f-a9ef-f9fe08941e35,308,nyt://article/deb28d31-5796-5a9f-a9ef-f9fe08941e35

Mallory's report of rebel navy,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/30/archives/mallorys-report-of-the-rebel-navy.html,Mallory's report of rebel navy,"MALLORY's REPORT OF THE REBEL NAVY. -- In another column will be found the full report of the rebel Secretary of the Navy, of which we have hitherto had only fragmentary portions. It will be found a very interesting document. Mr. MALLORY states that ""the operations of this branch of the Confederate service have been chiefly confined to preparations for ridding our waters of the enemy's vessels now blockading our seaports;"" but as we have yet to hear that the blockade of any of ""our seaports"" has yet been raised, the' inference is that they have utterly failed in their main purpose; and as, according to the last Message of Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS, it is only a ""paper blockade,"" this failure tells badly for the rebels. If, however, there is not much that is encouraging in this direction, Mr. MALLORY finds great solace in the exploits of the rebel cruisers. The Florida has, it seems, during the past year, destroyed vessels and property ""amounting to several millions,"" while the Alabama (SEMMES) ""has captured upward of ninety vessels, seventy of which were destroyed, the others being either bonded or released."" The acknowledgment of the construction of iron-clad steam rams in England and France, already commented upon, is made in the most explicit terms. But although the British Government's ""unfriendly construction of its neutrality laws"" has put a stopper on ""the Emperor of China's"" rams, yet Mr. MALLORY tells us that another and larger one has been built, and that, in regard to her, ""precautions have been taken sufficient to exempt her from the fate of her consorts."" Those building in France had been subjected to so many official visitations that he forwarded instructions to cease operations upon them "" until the result of negotiations now pending shall permit our agent to resume work upon them."" These are little items that our authorities will doubtless have an eye to. Mr. MALLORY speaks affectingly of the ""proud spirit of our officers chafing at the inaction they are compelled to endure;"" but he sees in prophetic vision a grand future for the rebel navy. When they get their ""six turreted iron-clads,"" their eight rams and their "" hundred small wooden gunboats,"" they will no doubt have a great navy. But for the present it is all in the ""future in rus.""",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""MALLORY'S REPORT OF THE REBEL NAVY."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""MALLORY'S REPORT OF THE REBEL NAVY."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0226ce1b-40d4-5acf-8ae2-c6fc90b7a9a5,387,nyt://article/0226ce1b-40d4-5acf-8ae2-c6fc90b7a9a5

"There are no more unfortunate travelers, now-a-days, than those who reside in New-Jersey and are compelled to depend on the Morris and Essex Railroad to reach this City. Since its contract with the New-Jersey Railroad expired, and it commenced running ever the Hoboken extension, irregularity has been the rule, and regularity the exception. Trains run apparently to suit the convenience of the conductors, and the time-tables which were issued two or three months ago have probably been consigned to the archives of the New-Jersey Historical Society as interesting relics of the past. Now and then the tedium of delay is broken in upon by some hair-breadth escape from a startling disaster, such as that which occurred on the bridge over the Passaic a few days ago, when three hundred passengers were nearly plunged into me river by the partial giving way of the draw; but these little excitements are not so agreeable that their repetition is called for. All kinds of hypotheses are urged to account for this chronic nits-management. Some say that the necessity of running upon a single track between Newark and Hoboken is the cause of all the delays and accidents; others that the Railroad Company has not enough rolling stock to accommodate the travel which has been suddenly thrown upon its hands, and that in due time the evil will be remedied by the addition of sundry mythical, locomotives. Others still assert that a little energy and attention to business on the part of those nominally charged with the management of the road would go far to set matters straight, and those who persistently assert their belief in the existence of a superintendent, for no individual exercising the prerogatives of that officer is ever to be found when his presence is needed, say that his hands are so tied by the Directors that he is virtually powerless to apply the obvious remedies. Amid all these conjectures one thing is certain -- that complaints enough can be heard in the course of a single trip over the Road in question to disturb the slumbers of all those who are justly responsible for so much mismanagement, if each individual concerned only appropriated his own share. Unless a change is speedily made, real estate in that section of New-Jersey which has depended upon this Road will rapidly depreciate, and then, perhaps, the stockholders will begin to institute investigations into the mismanagement of their property. Such a movement would be most opportune, for the present Directors evidently labor under the impression that they are the masters of the public, and not its servants.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/30/archives/the-morris-and-essex-railroad-detentions-and-accidents.html,,"There are no more unfortunate travelers, now-a-days, than those who reside in New-Jersey and are compelled to depend on the Morris and Essex Railroad to reach this City.

In the original rules, touching the reception of the war vessels of either belligerent, defined by Earl RUSSELL in his dispatch dated Jan. 31, 1862, (republished by us in another column,) it was directed that no ship-of-war or privateer belonging to either belligerent should be permitted to enter or remain in the port of Nassau, or in any other port, roadstead or waters of the Bahama Islands, except by special leave of the Lieutenant-Governor, or in case of stress of weather. Now, doubts having arisen as to whether a belligerent ship-of-war or privateer should obtain the permission of the local authorities before entering the ports, roadsteads or waters of the Bahama out-islands when the Governor was not present, it is the object of the Duke of Newcastle's late note, under date of Oct. 6, to state that at the out-islands, as at Nassau, the special leave of the Governor himself is required, unless in cases of grave emergency and real necessity and distress. In such cases, as, for instance, where a sailing vessel is dismasted, or an accident happens to the machinery of a steam vessel, the vessel may enter by leave of a resident officer to whom the Governor shall have given authority to admit her. But such officer must receive copies of the regulations of the 31st January, 1862, and his especial attention must be called to the limits of the authority delegated, and to that clause in the regulations in which it is directed that vessels entering under stress of weather, or by special leave, shall be required to put to sea as soon as possible.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Discriminating Neutrality--Belligerent Vessels at the Bahamas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Discriminating Neutrality--Belligerent Vessels at the Bahamas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Bahamas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3215e369-f00d-531b-bc38-ba784efc0ce5,672,nyt://article/3215e369-f00d-531b-bc38-ba784efc0ce5
"-- It is almost too late in the day to recommend the sewing-machine as a useful article in a family. No well-regulated household is without one. This question settled, the next thing to do is to select the one best suited to your requirements. Both of the editors of the Home Journal have long had the Grover & Baker machine in their households, and can speak from experience. We therefore have no hesitation in saying that we like this machine, and for the following reasons: First -- It is more simple, durable and less liable to derangement than others. Second -- It sews from ordinary spools, and no rewinding of thread is necessary. Third -- It sews with equal facility all fabrics, the most delicate and the heaviest, and with all kinds of thread, silk, cotton or linen. Fourth -- Its seam is so strong and elastic that it never breaks. Fifth -It fasters both ends of the seam by its own operation. Sixth -- Its seam, though cut at every sixth stitch, remains firm, and neither runs nor ravels in wear. But, besides the above qualities to recommend the ""Grover & Baker,"" it has a faculty which no other machine possesses; it makes beautiful embroidery without any change of arrangement. Having come to the conclusion as to which machine to purchase, we would ask what more noble or handsomer holiday gift could be selected? Nothing could possibly be more acceptable in a house where it has not yet been introduced. It not only saves money and time, but is certain to preserve the health and very often the temper of the ""gude wife."" -- New-York Home Journal.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/30/archives/a-noble-holiday-gift.html,,"-- It is almost too late in the day to recommend the sewing-machine as a useful article in a family.

WEBB'S shipyard, met with an accident yesterday morning about 1 o'clock, which may prove disastrous to the vessel. The circumstances of the mishap are briefly as follows. Saturday afternoon the Re d'Italia, left her dock in Hobo ken, having on board a large number of invited guests, for the purpose of a trial trip. It was thought at the time the vessel would steam but a few miles down the Bay and return before nightfall. It appears, however, the Captain of the ship was disposed to give his visitors something of a voyage, and after taking on a board a coast pilot steered for Barnegat light. Nothing more was heard of the vessel until the arrival of the dispatch, early yesterday morning, announcing the accident that befell her. It seems everything had gone on pleasantly during the voyage up to the time when a question was raised between the officers of the ship, the pilot and some of the seafaring guests concerning the whereabouts of the vessel. The Captain, believing he understood the coast, gave orders for soundings, which were improperly reported to him. About 1 o'clock, while the convivolities incident to trial trips had not been entirely dispensed with, the ship suddenly grounded. A scene of considerable confusion followed. Efforts were made relieve the vessel and get her off, but without avail. In this connection, it should be stated that previous to the stranding of the ship one of her engines became disabled and for some time she was propelled by one engine only, assisted by her sails. These circumstances may be considered fortunate for the vessel and aid board, for, had she been going it full speed at the time she struck, the most disastrous consequences might have followed. As soon as it became apparent that the ship could not be got off without assistance signal guns were fired, which brought to the beach most of the citizens of Fresh Pond a small place about two miles north of the main hotels on Long Branch. An underwriter's agent, who live out a short distance from the spot where the vessel stranded, made his appearance soon after the signal-guns were fired, and at once dispatched a team to the Government house at Station No. 3 to procure a surf-boat. In the meantime, those on board the Re d'Italia were made acquainted with their exact locality and the preparations that were being made for their safety. Shortly before 3 o'clock the surf-boat arrived, when a difficulty arose who should man it. This was soon settled by the volunteering of five old surfmen named CHAS. H. VALENTINE, BORDEN WEST, ABRAHAM LIPPINCOTT, ELIJAH DISBROW and WILLIAM MAIHAN. The first desperate attempt of these brave men to reach the ship failed. As soon as their boat was fairly afloat, it was struck by a wave and sent whirling back to the shore. The surfmen finding that it was impossible to reach the vessel from a point immediately opposite her took their boat a considerable distance further south, and again launched it. This time they were successful, and after a half hour's have pulling reached the vessel. They did not attempt to board her, but at once offered their services for the rescue of the passengers. Previous to the arrival of the boat, however, it had been ascertained by the wrecked pleasure party that they were comparatively safe, and learning they were off Wardellic Beach, stuck fast in the sand, in a strong [???], they all, except an officer bearing dispatches to the Italian Consul and two other gentlemen, concluded to remain on board until morning. The surfmen, accordingly after finding no further assistance was required, pulled their boat to the shore, which they did not reach until nearly daylight. The citizens on Wardellic Beach showed a commendable disposition to render assistance, should any be needed. They were constantly on the alert doing everything that would have been required of them had the vessel proved a total wreck. Conspicuous among the number who were the most assiduous in their endeavors to launch the surf-boat, and who rendered other valuable aid were the brothers HERBERT and EDWARD WARDELL.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE ITALIAN IRON-CLAD RE D'ITALIA.; THE VESSEL ASHORE AT LONG BRANCH.

The news is interesting. Synopses of President LINCOLN'S Message and Proclamation of Amnesty had reached England, and were variously commented on by the journals. The offer of peace is generally considered impracticable in its conditions. The situation of affairs puzzles and mystifies the editors exceedingly. It is stated on the authority of the Liverpool Post, that Lord LYONS has hazarded a prediction to Earl RUSSELL that the war will end in three mouths, because of the exhaustion of the rebels. The message of JEFF. DAVIS was generally regarded by the press as evincing no signs of yielding on the part of the South. The rebel government are said to have made full provision to meet the payment of the £75,000 sterling Cotton Loan Bonds to be drawn for in March. Employes in the dockyard at Sheerness had been stringently dealt with by the British Admiralty, for connivance in fitting out the Rappahannock for the Confederates, and the names of persons connected with the Naval Reserve, who have served on any rebel vessels, have been stricken from the list, and their privileges forfeited. It was rumored that the Duke of Newcastle was about to resign his position of Secretary of State on account of ill-health. Our Paris correspondence gives important information concerning the building and litting out of rebel war vessels in French ports, and the measures which have been adopted by our Minister, Mr. DAYTON, to prevent their departure, from which it is likely that the rebel plans to get up a navy in that quarter will be defeated. Mr. SUPERVILLE, the new rebel Envoy to France, had arrived at Paris, it was said, with a mission to notify the French Government of the recognition by the Confederacy of the Empire of Mexico, and to try to persuade NAPOLEON to recognize the South in return for that acknowledgment. There is little change in the Schleswig-Holstein affair, but it was supposed that Denmark would not forcibly oppose the Federal Execution.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c57b143-49fb-508d-8165-8ef75088398d,369,nyt://article/9c57b143-49fb-508d-8165-8ef75088398d
"Cobden, Richard, and the Times' Anonymous Newspaper Writing",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/30/archives/mr-cobdens-quarrel-the-anonymous-character-of-journalism.html,"Cobden, Richard, and the Times' Anonymous Newspaper Writing","Mr. COBDEN's quarrel with the London Times is bringing up in England once more the much debated topic of the anonymity of, articles in the press. Mr. COBDEN, and nearly every other man who has passed long years in public strife, and is daily undergoing the rude buffetings of political controversy, is greatly annoyed at having any comments made upon his public doings by writers whose names are not revealed. The reason of this is quite obvious. There have been few, if any public men, in any country or in any age, equal to the task of discussing any question upon its merits solely, and without any reference, tacit or expressed, to the qualities or antecedents of his opponents or critics. No matter what the subject may be, however elevating, however sacred, however far removed from the passions, prejudices and interests of everyday life, nobody who deals with it ever seems wholly able to dismiss from his mind the personality of those taking an opposite view of it. This is true of religion and of philosophy; no wonder it is true of politics. The odium theologicum has been for we know not how many centuries a synonym for the bitterest rancor, and there have been few quarrels more envenomed than those arising from differences of opinion upon points of metaphysics and natural philosophy. A recent volume of the Peaks, Passes and Glaciers tells of the violent quarrel and separation in Switzerland of two intimate friends who came over from America to travel in Europe together, owing to an irreconcilable difference of opinion upon the glacier theory. In short, whenever an ardent man -- and all prominent men in every walk of life are ardent men -- discovers that an opinion differing from his own has been promulgated upon a subject in which he is much interested, his first and strongest desire, before devoting himself to a consideration of the arguments by which it is supported, is to discover who the author is and to get at him. All this is simply human and natural. We are none of us spiritual enough to be able to deal contentedly with abstractions alone. Both truth and error have to take a concrete form before we can either love or hate them as they deserve. Each is to have a man behind it, before it can be properly assailed or defended.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Cobden's Quarrel The Anonymous Character of Journalism."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Cobden's Quarrel The Anonymous Character of Journalism."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9efaddf0-d2fb-59e8-8d7a-c442ff2bac3a,1044,nyt://article/9efaddf0-d2fb-59e8-8d7a-c442ff2bac3a

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/31/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- The closing night of the opera gave us a performance of many encores and of such hearty appreciation and comely enjoyment, that every one regretted that it was not the first representation of a season instead of the last. That ""Faust"" is destined to become the most popular opera of the modern Italian repertoire, is indicated in the increasing murmur of applause which is heard in all art circles, and prefigured in every performance by fresh points of public approbation. The encores last night ""broke out"" in new places. Perhaps that was owing to a very manifest disposition to encore everything -- a disposition which was only regulated by the stubborn determination of Mr. MARETZEK to bring the performance to an end, and go to Boston. On the first night, it will be remembered, many of the best morceaux were passed over in silence. The change from then to now is noticeable as an indication of a decided familiarity with the music on the part of the public; for the public, rank and file was represented last night. And as this familiarity increases so will the popularity of the opera. If the cruel exigency of losing money -- without which operatic management would be a sham and an imposition -- did not compel Mr. MARETZEK to travel to Boston, he might, we are persuaded, play ""Faust"" here for a considerable season, and with profitable and otherwise astounding results to the exchequer.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46a9d2a7-4b03-51ae-a4fb-d49c59f64195,458,nyt://article/46a9d2a7-4b03-51ae-a4fb-d49c59f64195

Prizes and Sailors,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/31/archives/sailors-and-their-prizes.html,Prizes and Sailors,"-- Some short time ago we published the proceedings of a meeting of sailors in this City, in which the slowness of the payment of prize money was spoken of as a reason why there were so much fewer enlistments in the navy than is desired. And within a few days a letter has been published from a sailor on board the Florida, inquiring why the proceeds of the schooner Hattie, a prize captured by the Florida in last June, were not yet distributed. We publish this morning the decision of the Court in the case of the Hattie, which will furnish the desired information. It appears that she was brought in here and a decree of forfeiture rendered against her and her cargo by default in July last. Up to that time the proceedings had been rapid enough to satisfy any one. But this rate of progress was not kept up. For some reason or other the proceeds were not distributed, and now, in December, the former owners of the vessel apply to the Court, by consent of the District-Attorney, stating that the schooner was formerly theirs, but was taken from them by the privateer Retribution, and the Court, accordingly, directs the restoration to the owners of the vessel, or rather of her proceeds, she having been sold, on payment of one-eighth of her value as salvage. So that in this case the delay has been productive of good to the loyal former owners of the vessel, and no sailor will regret that they have thus been enabled to get their property back again. With regard to the cargo, no such results have followed, and the seamen of the Florida might perhaps rightfully complain that so long a time has elapsed before the settlement of the cargo, if that could have been closed up independently of the vessel. But as the case stood, that could not be done.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SAILORS AND THEIR PRIZES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SAILORS AND THEIR PRIZES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b038469-5b48-5341-9936-6772e71dba74,443,nyt://article/6b038469-5b48-5341-9936-6772e71dba74

"--The Richmond journals received yesterday publish some additional correspondence between Gens. HITCHCOCK and MEREDITH and the rebel Commissioner OULD, but nothing of a later date than Nov. 28.

It discloses hardly more than a third as many battles fought, as in the year which preceded. Indeed, one cannot survey the record without being struck with surprise at the fewness of the actual conflicts, considering the immense forces under arms. The Army of the Potomac, though it has often marched and countermarched, has only fought, in force, the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburgh. All its other engagements were by small detachments, and hardly rank above skirmishes -- and even these were very few in number. The Army of the Cumberland have scarcely fought except at Stone River and Chickamauga; and at Chattanooga after being consolidated with the Army of the Mississippi. The Army of the Mississippi did little actual fighting, except in the week's battles which preceded the investment of Vicksburgh, and at Chattanooga. The Army of the Gulf has been engaged, with its main force, only at Port Hudson; all its other fighting has been only in small bodies, and attended with comparatively little bloodshed. The Army of the Ohio has scarcely fired a musket, save at Knoxville the other day, in repelling LONGSTREET; and, being fortified as they were, they settled that affair with very little loss of life. The Army of North Carolina has had no general fight; that of South Carolina scarcely any fight at all excepting at Fort Wagner, and there only three or four regiments were actually engaged.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Closing Year.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Closing Year.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e22e11ed-45b2-5ea5-8d75-fc2e8348e434,871,nyt://article/e22e11ed-45b2-5ea5-8d75-fc2e8348e434

"Monitors, the Armaments of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/12/31/archives/armament-of-the-monitors-a-query-for-the-navy-department.html,"Monitors, the Armaments of the","The ordnance officer of the monitor Patapsco has furnished a transcript from his record of the expenditures of shot, shell, and powder by that vessel during her period of service of less than a year. The armament of the Patapsco is one 8-inch rifle and one 15-inch Dahlgren (smooth bore). The record shows that up to Nov. 4 this monitor expended, for the 8-inch rifle, 44 tons plus 640 pounds of shot, or altogether, 109,200 pounds. Expenditure of powder for rifle gun, 14,970 pounds. For her 15-inch gun she expended 7 tons plus 1,430 pounds, or 17,130 pounds of shot. Expenditure of powder for 15-inch gun, 12,095 pounds. A very simple calculation from these data, shows that the 8-inch rifle has fired 541 rounds (109,200 pounds of shot, divided by 200, which is the weight of each shot;) while the 15-inch gun has fired but 43 times -- (17,130 pounds of shot, divided by 400, which is the approximate weight of the shot of the 15-inch gun;) that is, more than twelve rounds have been fired from the 200-pounder rifle for every one from the 15-inch Dahlgren. This is a striking illustration of the comparative practical value and efficiency of these two types of guns, placed side by side in the turret of the same monitor. We believe there are at this moment but three 8-inch rifles in the armament of the total monitor fleet. And such is the incomprehensible policy governing the Ordnance Bureau of the naval service, that the new monitors are being armed with the Dahlgren 15-inch exclusively; and this in face of the fact that their commanders have begged to be allowed one rifle at least. It is the universal testimony of naval men that three-fourths of the inefficiency of the monitors is owing to their defective armament.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARMAMENT OF THE MONITORS; A QUERY FOR THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARMAMENT OF THE MONITORS; A QUERY FOR THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e55c55c8-33b6-5045-b54a-884e288d48c7,302,nyt://article/e55c55c8-33b6-5045-b54a-884e288d48c7
