"By the arrival at Halifax of the steamship Europa, we receive advices from Europe three days later. She left Liverpool on the 18th, and Queenstown on the 19th inst. The English shippers and merchants interested in the trade with Matamoras have worked themselves into a high pitch of excitement regarding the interference with their business by the United States cruisers. A deputation of them waited upon Earl RUSSELL on the 16th, in relation to the matter. During the interview the statement was made that Minister ADAMS had recently given a special license for a ship to proceed from England to Matamoras, free from any interference by American cruisers, to carry supplies of arms and ammunition for the Mexicans in their war with France.

Mr. BRYAN TYSON is a native of Randolph County in that State, where he has resided the greater portion of his life. He is a man of profound religious convictions and experiences, is about 33 years of age, of great simplicity and sincerity of manners. He rendered himself obnoxious to the rebel authorities by the publication of a small volume, entitled A Ray of Light, or a Conservative Treatise on the Sectional Troubles, with other essays of a similar character. In this work, a copy of which he has placed in my hands, he mildly but firmly urges upon the people of the South that the act of secession was uncalled for; that it was not brought about fairly, by submitting the question to the popular vote; and that the only wise and safe course is to return to the Union. He points out, in his brief review, the acts resorted to by the secession leaders to deceive the people, and to precipitate them into the rebellion; and sustains his allegations by facts and citations, some of which are familiar to the public on this side the lines, and some of which, I believe, are new to us.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INTERESTING FROM NORTH CAROLINA.; Eividences of Union Sentiment Among the People.

Touching upon the subject of loyalty, he declared that for a man to say he has no loyalty, it is to say he has no honesty. The child's love of his home, and the father's love of his family, was the patriot's love of his country. He would not consider himself, his family nor his property, safe within the grasp of a man who had renounced the obligations of loyalty for the purpose of adopting plans to overthrow the dominion of that authority which had furnished him all his social enjoyment and success, and under the protection of which he had peacefully lived and grown up. It was his intention to speak fearlessly and independently on the subject of loyalty, and that none might be taken unawares, be had previously announced his intention. His loyalty was not confined to a single State; but extended over the whole continent of America. He would never give his consent to its dismemberment, and desired not to live to see disunion upon any terms that could be devised. Still less would he recognize a combination of political intriguers to overthrow the established Government, He had roamod in other lands, and had not affected to despise their many advantages; but he had ever returned to his native land with renewed gratification and pride. Every part of his native land was his, and he loved every part equally well. South Carolina and Georgia was his as much as Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Massachusetts had planted her seed in every part of the country -- a seed that would grow and bear good fruit. To separate this land, to parcel it out to a set of traitors, was a transaction to which he would never, as one citizen, give his consent, He would never yield the right of his home to the power of adversity. Political questions and national debts were nothing unless our country was preserved. Let the land of our fathers be transmitted unbroken, solid, entire, untarnished to our children who succeed us. Some men had called the Constitution a mass of glittering generalities, but they had no affinity with the purpose for which it was designed and destined to be exercised. The fathers of the present generation, even on the very soil of Slavery, testified to the infamous curse of human bondage. Dr. TYNG then cited the authorities of WASHINGTON, JEFFERSON, MADISON, MONROE and other statesmen, to show how heartily they disapproved of the system of Slavery. We were certainly in the midst of a war for freedom, and it was the greatest and grandest contest which the world had ever seen. Slavery at last had received its inevitable destruction, its reconstruction could never be effected without a greater contest and more terrific scenes of violence than those we are now called on to witness.

Prayer was offered by Dr. OSGOOD, and hymns appropriate to the peculiar character of the day were sung. Dr. BELLOWS selected for his text the 29th, 30th and 31st verses of the 5th Chapter of Jeremiah, and began by alluding to the necessity our country has for prayer, and the eminent fitness of the President's setting apart such a day as this. Every nation has abundant cause to confess its sins and supplicate the Divine forgiveness; but ours has peculiar reason to acknowledge its unfaithfulness. For we have grievously sinned against light, humanity and love. With all our advantages of personal liberty, of a free religion, of schools and the pious example and teachings of our fathers, in all these so highly favored above other nations, it is not enough that we surpass foreign peoples, and even the best of them, in general morality. The question is, are we in any fair degree equal in our piety to our talents, opportunities and blessings? We have enjoyed, as a people, singular advantages, and our responsibility is relative. This American people must either be the best or the guiltiest people on God's earth. There can be no doubt that for twenty-five years past the American people has been making progress in everything rather than morals and piety. In all arts and sciences there has been rapid advancement. We have become a more cultured, more tasteful, more quiet and more graceful a people. Yet, although there is more good taste, good sense and decorum, there is no more principle, In respect of morals here is no corresponding advance. Nay, there has rather been a degeneration, and sufficiently so to deserve and invoke the solemn warnings of Providence. These twenty-five years have been essentially a time of externalities, of compromises and concessions. Every one has been seeking to make money, and everything has accommodated Itself to the money-maker. In politics, in theology, art, society, religion, there is less real sturdy principle than there was a quarter of a century ago -- less earnestness, less faith, less devotion. As a consequence, we have little substantial reading, almost no earnest poetry. we have twenty times as many artists, and a hundred times as many patrons of art, but fewer earnest and devoted in their profession. We have splendid churches; but where are the saint? We have eloquent preachers; but where is the old doctrinal strength? Religion has degenerated into an ethical system. It is polite, civil, gentle. popular, where it ought to be uncompromising, stern, unbending. The devotion of the people to money-making has withdrawn their attention from National questions, has giver, the control of State, city and county elections to grog-shops and corner groceries, has kept fit men out of Congress, and has suffered the South to gain and hold its imperious rule in the politics of the country. Another general cause of demoralization is the institution of Slavery. More than we are aware it has polluted our whole political system and undermined the morals of the whole people. We of the North have been bred to regard it with kindliness. We had accommodated ourselves to this sinful institution in commerce, in literature and religion, until it had extended its corrupting influence over them all. What effect it has had upon the South we have but lately learned. Now we see how it has so barbarized a people as to lead them madly to sacrifice themselves and a national existence to satisfy a spirit of revenge. Slavery has set fire to her own prison-house. Out of the annals of American Indians there never was a more savage immolation of all the rights of a people made for their revengeful feelings, Rather than yield to the most paternal Government that ever existed, they are burning cities, laying waste their fields, so that a hundred years' toil will not recover them to life and fertility, and sacrificing the very institution which they have so fiercely nursed.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sermon of Rev.

This has been shown in no Way so remarkably as in their choice of leaders, and in the measures they have employed for enforcing efficiency in their service. They had no sooner seceded than they placed the ablest man amongst them at the head of their affairs, and from that moment he has been permitted to deal with his subordinates precisely as he sees fit, without murmur, remonstrance, or even comment on the part of the Press or the public. Generals have been dismissed, removed, and changed from one department to another, torn from brilliant positions and consigned to obscure ones, raised from obscurity to places of prominence and responsibility, and the people and the army look on approvingly, or, at all events, silently. BEAUREGARD fought and won the first battle of the war, and what with strutting, posing and rhodomontade, unquestionably answers the Southern ideal of a hero; and yet he was, soon after Bull Run, thrown into the background. He has been driven backward and forward, up and down, from East to West, from a picayune command to no command at all, and latterly he has been assigned to the important, but not first-class position of taking charge of the defences of Charleston. And yet hardly a syllable of complaint have we had either from him or his friends. There is nobody, who has a drop of the milk of human kindness in his composition, who must not have been afflicted at the sight of the various fortunes which have chequered the career of the unfortunate BRAGG, and yet he bears it like a man, and the Confederate world seems not in the least moved by the spectacle.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Putting the Right Men in the Right Places.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Putting the Right Men in the Right Places.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-02T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/08834327-0f43-5263-9803-261d012c1ba8,929,nyt://article/08834327-0f43-5263-9803-261d012c1ba8

"Gothamites seem to move annually with the devout punctuality of a hegira. May-day is the cartman's harvest, the junk-dealer's delight, the old clo'man's rejoicing, the juvenile paradise of confusion, and all sensible people's horror. This year our necessary evil came in as mild a form as possible. Never was there a more propitious sky. Old Sol smiled serenely on the metropolitan upheavings, and though a somewhat free and easy gust would occasionally lift a box-cover, or raise a blanket, and expose more than tidy housekeepers care to show to the general public, the weather was quite as favorable as could rationally be expected in these days of tribulation and uncertainty. There were, of course, whole corps of draymen and regiments of laborers reaping the fruits of the harvest. Such sallies upon furniture, such onslaughts upon looking-glasses, such charges upon chairs, and such an appearance of debris on the battle-field can only be appreciated by those who have indulged in the delights of such migrative campaigns. If ""three movings are as bad as a fire,"" as the saying goes, one moving must certainly be both a tax on patience and pocket. It would be a good idea to have a company to insure people against moving. The scrip would certainly always remain above par, and it may be questioned whether it would not command a very high premium. Much of the moving this year was effected on Thursday -- making that day more effectually a day of fasting, though by no means more characterized by thankgtving and prayer, than it would otherwise have been. Not to have moved, is not to know the whole of human misery. The insolence of landlords, and the spurns which patient movers from the unworthy bear, are enough to entitle them to the designation of martyrs.

May-day is the cartman's harvest, the junk-dealer's delight, the old clo'man's rejoicing, the juvenile paradise of confusion, and all sensible people's horror. This year our necessary evil came in as mild a form as possible. Never was there a more propitious sky. Old Sol smiled serenely on the metropolitan upheavings, and though a somewhat free and easy gust would occasionally lift a box-cover, or raise a blanket, and expose more than tidy housekeepers care to show to the general public, the weather was quite as favorable as could rationally be expected in these days of tribulation and uncertainty. There were, of course, whole corps of draymen and regiments of laborers reaping the fruits of the harvest. Such sallies upon furniture, such onslaughts upon looking-glasses, such charges upon chairs, and such an appearance of debris on the battle-field can only be appreciated by those who have indulged in the delights of such migrative campaigns. If ""three movings are as bad as a fire,"" as the saying goes, one moving must certainly be both a tax on patience and pocket. It would be a good idea to have a company to insure people against moving. The scrip would certainly always remain above par, and it may be questioned whether it would not command a very high premium. Much of the moving this year was effected on Thursday -- making that day more effectually a day of fasting, though by no means more characterized by thankgtving and prayer, than it would otherwise have been. Not to have moved, is not to know the whole of human misery. The insolence of landlords, and the spurns which patient movers from the unworthy bear, are enough to entitle them to the designation of martyrs. Blessed, therefore, are they who do not move; who live in homesteads, or pay their rent, or do not get too proud to stay where they are, or abstain from of-f[???]ding their house-owners [???]r in any way manage to [???]intain their local ha[???] [???] throughout May-Day.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/03/archives/military-movements-the-activity-of-our-armies.html,,"The opening of the month of May shows an almost universal activity in our armies, great and small. Everywhere we are acting on the offensive, with the trifling exceptions of the affairs in Missouri and in Western Virginia. Sen. HOOKER's movements are, of course, those which most profoundly excite the interest and stir the heart of the nation, for they are more important than any other -we may say than all others put together. His army is the grand army of the nation, and his work is to strike the fatal blow at the rebellion's head. In the inception of the movement which commenced on Monday last, he certainly appears to have shown consummate skill. He moved both of the wings of his army rapidly and cleanly; and so well were his purposes and aims covered, that the rebels at each point seem to have been taken entirely unawares. The laying of the pontoons and the crossing of the river were admirably performed, and in less than two days from the time his movement commenced the main body of his army had made a march of twenty miles, crossed a difficult river, and was ready for action on the other side. It would appeal that it was by far the larger part of his army which marched north from Falmouth, and crossed the Rappahannock at Kelly's and adjacent fords. Judging by our letters, it is the lower movement that is a feint; but what is to be the real mode of action on the upper line cannot yet be told. What last week opened, however, this week will undoubtedly develop; and we prefer waiting for events to indulging in useless speculations. The movement which seems most obvious and likely to the non-military observer will probably be the movement which Gen. HOOKER will not make.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Military Movements The Activity of Our Armies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Military Movements The Activity of Our Armies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-03T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5bc7d9ef-6f56-58ef-88fc-0c33b7d6c927,598,nyt://article/5bc7d9ef-6f56-58ef-88fc-0c33b7d6c927

"Levi Robinson, Edward Van Buren and Charles Felmette, three colored men, charged with poisoning Martin Van Buren, also colored, a brother of the prisoner Edward Va[???] Buren, was brought before Judge MCCUNN, yesterday, upon a writ of certiorari, obtained by Wm. J. Howe, Esq., their counsel. It is a somewhat singular and mysterious case, and Judge MCCUNN ordered. hearing before him, when the following facts were brought out. It appears that these men have been confined in the City Prison since the 13th of March last by the commitment of Police Justice Connelly, upon the suspicion of poisoning Martin Van Buren, a steward on board of the steamboat City of New-York, based upon the affidavit of Andrew Murray, a Policeman of the Twenty-sixth Precinct, who swears that he was informed that poison was administered to Martin, who subsequently sickened and died at the City of New-London, in Connecticut, on the 11th of March, and that, from facts and circumstances within his knowledge, and from information received by him, he believed the parties charged were guilty of administering the poison to Martin. Martin had died in New-London, and the Coroner's inquest revealed the fact that he had died of poison, and that it had been administered to him by some unknown person or persons in New-York. The deceased's stomach and viscera were then sent by the authorities of New-London to Prof. St. John, of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of this City, with directions to analyze the contents. Dr. St. John reported to Judge MCCUNN that he had made a chemical examination, and found a sufficient amount of arsenic to destroy life, and that the examination occupied several weeks. Andrew Murray, the policeman, was then examined by Mr. Howe, when it appeared that he knew nothing of his own knowledge of the case. William Townsend, a colored witness, was then examined, who swore that on the 2d of March he was in company in this City with the deceased and the prisoners; that they went into a drinking-saloon on the corner of Leonard-street and West Broadway, and drank some liquor, when he saw Robinson, one of the prisoners, put his arms around the deceased, and when the bar-keeper called for the money for the drinks, deceased put his hand into his pocket to pay, when he exclaimed that his money was gone, and Robinson said he would make it all right for the drinks. Edward and Martin Van Buren had previously had a fight. On the same night he saw deceased on the steamboat City of New-York, when he manifested feelings and symptoms of great sickness. Witness asked him what was the matter, and deceased answered, ""I don't know, that he had been drinking all that day, and mentioned particularly a glass of ale."" He was in great pain, and remained sick until he died. Several other witnesses were also examined, but they knew nothing whatever of the case. There can be no doubt, from Dr. St. John's testimony, that Martin died of poison by arsenic, but when it was administered, or by whom, or from what motive, is shrouded in mystery. Mr. Howe, at the conclusion of the examination, moved for the discharge of the prisoners; and Judge MCCUNN said there was no evidence against these prisoners, and that the prosecution had had nearly three months to obtain any, if there was, and that longer to detain them upon suspicion he thought was wrong, and he would therefore discharge them.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/03/archives/alleged-poisoning-case-at-chambers-before-hon-john-h-mccunn-city.html,,"Levi Robinson, Edward Van Buren and Charles Felmette, three colored men, charged with poisoning Martin Van Buren, also colored, a brother of the prisoner Edward Va[???] Buren, was brought before Judge MCCUNN, yesterday, upon a writ of certiorari, obtained by Wm.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/03/archives/able-criticism-after-a-wellknown-style.html,,"-- We observe by our last advices from the Federal States of the North, that the army commanded by Gen. Fighting JOE HOOKER (as he is still called by the mob of New-York, though he has fought no battle, after being for three months in command of the ""finest army on the planet,"") has left its Winter camping ground at Falmouth, in Virginia, and marched for Port Royal; and one of the reliable newspapers of New-York informs us that after reaching the latter point JOE will move his troops in the direction of Bowling Green!. We rubbed our eyes and took a long breath on perusing these statements. Such movements, indicating such mingled madness, vanity and imbecility, were never heard of in war, from the days when, on the windy plains of Troy, (""Arma virumque cano Trojoe,"") the Hellenic heroes played at high strategy, down to the period of our own great war in the Crimea, which was illustrated and made memorable by the charge of the Light Brigade -- not to speak of several very heavy ones. For we suppose every Englishman knows that Port Royal, the first point to which Fighting JOE is said to be marching his military rabble, is situated on the coast of the State of South Carolina, some five hundred miles from his camping ground at Falmouth -- while Bowling Green, the other point mentioned as on his line of march, is located in the very heart of the State of Kentucky, nearly a thousand miles distant from Port Royal, and will be remembered as the place so long held against the Yankee threats by that brave Confederate, Gen. ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON. To reach his first point, Port Royal, JOE will have to march over the entire State of Virginia and through the midst of Gen. LEE's fine army of a hundred thousand men; he will also have to pass through the State of North Carolina, and through Charleston itself. To reach BOWLING Green, he will have to cross several rivers and hills, and traverse the entire area of the Southern Confederacy. How such stupendous folly could be contemplated, even by Fighting JOE, certainly passes British comprehension.

"-- Dr. WM. DARLINGTON died at West Chester Penn., on Wednesday, April 22. The Philadelphia Press gives these particulars of his eventful life: He was born in Birmingham township, Chester County, in 1782, and until his eighteenth year engaged in the pursuit of agriculture, acquiring in his leisure hours a fair English education. In 1800 he commenced to study medicine, under the tuition of Dr. JOHN VAUGHAN, of Wilmington, Delaware, and four years after graduated with the title of M.D., at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In 1806-7 he made a voyage to India as surgeon of a vessel. During the last forty-four years he filled several important positions of trust under the General Government, as well as that of the State. The degree of L.L.D. was conferred upon him by Yale College. He was President of the Bank of Chester County until his death -- a period of more than thirty years. Dr. DARLINGTON had devoted a large portion of his life to the study of botany, his favorite science. In which he acquired a vast fund of information. He likewise attained considerable celebrity as an author. In 1804 he published his Mutual Influence of Habits and Disease. In 1826 his most successful work. Flora Cestrica, appeared, and passed to three editions. It was favorably noticed by the greatest botanists of Europe, and established its author in the front rank of American scholars. In 1843 he revised and published Reliquioe Baldwinioe, and four years afterward issued his Agricultural Botany. In 1849 he gave to the public Memorials of John Barton and Humphrey Marshall. These were the principal works which gave him transatlantic fame, and most of them were favorably reviewed in the foreign journals of agricultural science. Dr. DARLINGTON, during the Administration of Gen. JACKSON, was a prominent candidate before the Legislature of Pennsylvania for the position of United States Senator, being defeated by very few votes. During the existence of the Whig party he took an active part in support of its principles, but soon after its death he retired from the political field.

Such a military organization, one would suppose, could hardly bear with inordinate weight, even on a moderately well-to-do population of nearly three millions.

Three considerable battles took place near Chancellorsville on the afternoon of Friday, in the first of which Gen. SYKES' Division attacked the enemy shortly after 12 o'clock, fought them an hour and a half with great valor, drove them a mile, and took fifty prisoners; but HOOKER ordered the attack to be suspended, and the men to return to their former ground. To this point the enemy came up at 4 o'clock, and attacked SYKES fiercely, but HOOKER himself was on the ground, and after a fight of three-quarters of an hour, the enemy ignominiously retired. At 6 1/2 o'clock, the enemy made a charge for our batteries, when the third fight of the day took place, in which they were again severely repulsed with heavy loss. After this affair there was no serious fighting, but the sharpshooters kept up their desultory work for some time. And thus ended Friday's operations. During the night our troops were kept actively at work building earthworks and abattis to enable them to hold the excellent position they had gained.

The Emperor and the Poles,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/04/archives/the-russian-emperor-and-the-poles.html,The Emperor and the Poles,"The text of the proclamation of amnesty offered by the Emperor of Russia to the Poles, enables us to requires only a very cursory perusal of it to understand why it has not only been rejected by the insurgents, but has stimulated them to fresh exertions. He offers a free pardon to all who have simply taken part in the insurrection, ""without having made themselves responsible for other crimes,"" if they will lay down their arms by the 13th of May -- a month from the date of the proclamation. He purposes, then, that everything shall return to the status quo, and asks the Poles to trust to the ""dictates"" of the imperial heart, ""and to such further development"" of the institutions then in existence as the Government may see fit to allow. This is, of course, simply a roundabout way of asking them to place themselves once more in absolute subjection to his will. It is rendered all the more absurd by the fact that it was under the ""institutions"" to which he invites them to return, that the razzia at the hands of the Cossacks took place which brought on the insurrection. In fact, it requires some experience of the simplicity of absolute monarchs, to enable one to believe that ALEXANDER is in earnest in seeking to tempt the Poles back into peace by the offer of a complete and gracious restoration of a state of things under which it was possible for the Governor, by a stroke of the pen, to have all the males of the upper and middle classes seized by Cossacks at midnight, and hurried off for twenty-five years' service in the ranks of the army.

Everything had so far progressed in the most satisfactory manner. There had been some hard fighting, but it had all been in our favor. Below Fredericksburgh, on Thursday afternoon, an artillery duel of considerable magnitude occurred at about the point where the operations under Gen. FRANKLIN were carried on during Gen. BURNSIDE's unsuccessful demonstrations against the enemy's lines in December. Although the firing was very rapid and continuous, the casualties were very few on our side. The enemy, during this cannonade, were drawn up in line of battle, apparently awaiting an attack. On Friday morning it was discovered that they had changed their position -- a movement rendered necessary by the operations of that portion of our army under the immediate command of Gen. HOOKER, on their left and rear. Near Chancellorsville, the point at which this portion of our army was at work, there was some severe fighting on Friday afternoon, caused by efforts on the part of the rebels, to dislodge our forces -- in which they signally railed. The strength of the rebels in that quarter was thus ascertained with considerable certainty, and preparations were made during Friday night for a struggle of greater magnitude, which was expected to take place on Saturday. Our correspondence also gives the destails of a dashing reconnoissance made by the Sixth New-York Cavalry, toward Spottsylvania Court-house, in which they encountered the entire brigade of rebel cavalry under FITZHUGH LEE. A telegraphic dispatch gives a report which reached Philadelphia yesterday, that our cavalry under Gen. STONEMAN, had succeeded in cutting the railroad in the rebel rear. There is no doubt of the fact that our army was in the best condition and spirits. During the forenoon, Thursday. Gen. HOOKER issued the following stirring and significant address:",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9815937e-032d-5fe7-b115-710bce944c38,1291,nyt://article/9815937e-032d-5fe7-b115-710bce944c38

The Magnificent Raid of,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/04/archives/a-magnificent-raid.html,The Magnificent Raid of,"-- There is no danger now of communication between the rebel armies at Vicksburgh and at Tullahoma. So far as railroad connection is concerned, they seem to be completely severed, and a foot march of the Vicksburgh army northward would be a long, difficult and slow affair. We gave the other day an account of Gen. DODGE's movement eastward from Corinth, on the line of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and his capture of Tuscumbia, Alabama: and if the reader, taking the bearings of the latter point, will follow the line and sweep of the magnificent raid of Col. GRIERSON through Central Mississippi and Alabama, of which we publish an interesting account this morning, and compare it with the rebel telegram concerning the affair, he will see how every line of road that connects the Gulf States with the rebel army in Tennessee has been cut, that is not already in our control. The Mississippi Central, the Mobile and Ohio, and the newly constructed line connecting Meridian with Selma, were all on his route. It was really a splendid swoop, and the startled rebel organ at the capital of Mississippi asserts that ""it exceeds in daring and boldness all former Yankee raids."" Our Memphis correspondent compares it with the raid of Col. CARTER into East Tennessee, in December last. It will be remembered that Gen. ROSECRANS attributed to that dash much of his success at Murfreesboro, as, by destroying the bridges on the Virginia and East Tennessee Railroad, it prevented the rebels from receiving reinforcements from Virginia. We published a statement some weeks ago from a rebel paper that these bridges had just been repaired, showing that Col. CARTER had rendered their great military line unavailable for three or four months. As that movement preceded ROSECRANS' great attack on BRAGG's army, so this one, which is very like the other in character and results, may have an important bearing on another advance, which he does not herald, but which he has been steadily preparing for. Col. CARTER's raid, it will be remembered, was over a distance of 200 miles; but the circuit of Col. GRIERSON through rebel territory must have been at least 500 miles.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MAGNIFICENT RAID.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MAGNIFICENT RAID.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-04T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eee02515-7199-5b4c-8425-8a6037f8650f,365,nyt://article/eee02515-7199-5b4c-8425-8a6037f8650f

This well-known Mexican port is no doubt Matamoras, and the object of the proposed company is the evasion of the Southern blockade, by furnishing goods to the South via Mexico. We are not prepared to say that the company or its objects are illegal, or that so long at least as the vessels which it charters do not carry contraband of war, those vessels would be subject to seizure by Northern cruisers; but can any one in his senses doubt that such a traffic would be in the highest degree offensive to the States, or that it would not tend to embroil us with the Government of Washington? It may keep within the letter of the law, but it will not the less be regarded as another blow struck by Englishmen at the North, and as another proof of our complicity with the South. We indeed fully acquit its originators of any Southern proclivities. They probably care nothing at all for the interests of the Confederate States, and are simply bent upon turning a penny to the very best advantage. They only send their ""asserted cargoes"" to Matamoras rather than to New-York, because the former seems the better speculalation.

Mr. JORDAN, who has been deputed by the Government to investigate the facts, commenced his sittings in the Customhouse at 12 o'clock yesterday. Reporters for most of the City papers were in attendance, and, before commencing the investigation, Mr. JORDAN stated that he deemed it advisable for the promotion of the ends of justice, and to prevent ex parte or one-slded statements from going before the public, to conduct the investigation in private, and he should therefore be compelled to exclude all reporters of the Press. The Government had employed a phonographic reporter to record everything that occurred, and, at the conclusion of the investigation, It would be submitted to the Department with which he was connected, accompanied by a full report by himself of the conclusions arrived at -- all of which would then be published.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/06/archives/arrival-of-the-hawkins-zouaves-their-welcome-to-this-citythrongs.html,,"As previously announced, the Ninth New-York Volunteer regiment (Hawkins' Zouaves) arrived in the Lower Bay Monday night, but, in consequence of a dense fog, the steamer Kennebec, which transported them thither, was unable to proceed up the stream till yesterday morning, and did not anchor opposite Pier No. 1, North River, till 8 A.M Here the steamer was detained three hours, in order to facilitate the execution of the arrangement as agreed upon by the Twelfth New-York Militia regiment and the fire companies, who volunteered to escort the Zouaves through the City. At about 11 A.M., the steamer came up to Pier No. 1, and, having been made fast, the troops immediately commenced to disembark. A short time previous the Twelfth regiment had marched down Broadway, and, when the Zouaves left the vessel, were drawn up in open order on the pier. From an early hour in the morning till the time the troops had fairly reached terra firma, not only Pier No. 1, but the adjacent piers, also the streets in the immediate vicinity and the entire space usually occupied by the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company for freighting purposes, were crowded with the relatives, friends and acquaintances of the Zouaves. At intervals the rain would pour down in torrents, but that event did not have the effect to disperse the crowd who evinced remarkable persistency under such trying circumstances. It must not be inferred that the assemblage consisted wholly of males, as the gentler sex was largely represented. Indeed, at one time the gentlemanly police officer who carefully guarded the entrance to the pier was almost thrown upon his back by the immense tide of fair and unfair damsels who pressed against the gate in such a confused mass that it was almost impossible to prevent some from being injured. Fortunately, however, tnrough the exertions of the aforesaid officer and one or two coadjutors, the anxious party were admitted safely within the iron railing. To appreciate fully the greetings extended to the Zouaves, and by them in turn reciprocated, it was necessary to be a spectator of the scene. As the brave fellows one by one stepped off the plank to the pier he was recognized by some one in the crowd, who caught him by the hand, congratulated and embraced him. The preparations for the ma ch up Broadway were not completed till about 11 1/2 o'clock. It was expected that a portion of the Fire Department would be in waiting on the cross-streets to fall into line as the column moved forward, but the heavy fall of rain caused them to abandon their design. The Twelfth New-York Militia regiment, preceded by a band, took the lead of the column, and was followed by thirty members of the Hawkins Zouaves who have been staying in the City for the past two or three weeks on account of wounds or disability, which were in turn followed by the main body of the Zouave regiment, numbering 450 men. The regiment arrived here without arms the order countermanding the order requiring them to deliver up their arms to Government before leaving the Military Department, not having reached them before their departure from Suffolk. Through the kindness of the Eleventh New-York Militia regiment, however, the Zouaves were provided with guns, a quantity, corresponding in number to the returned soldiers, having been sent to the pier prior to the disembarkation. The Zouaves were commanded by Col. HAWKINS himself. In passing up Broadway much attention was directed to the tattered, soiled and blood-stained flag, which was conspicuous in their midst. To gaze upon that flag, and not call to mind the many terrible encounters through which the brave fellows that had flocked round it had passed -- aye, and in so passing, how many had looked upon that noble emblem for the last time? -- would not be natural, would not be possible. There is not a man in that regiment who has not been through battles hard-fought and hard-won, and it needs no better mark of appreciation of their services than the hearty welcome which greeted them on their arrival yesterday. After marching up Broadway to Union-square, the column turned down Fourth-avenue and proceeded to Bond-street, where it was dismissed. The Zouaves will be mustered out of service the latter part of this week. It will be remembered that the regiment was formerly commanded by Lieut. Col. KIMBALL, who met with such a lamentable fate not long since. By request of the regiment the body of Col. KIMBALL was deposited in a vault at Greenwood, there to remain until their arrival, when the burial service would be performed. The day appointed for that sad duty has not yet been announced, but the ceremony will probably take place some time next week.

"We have intelligence this morning from the Army of the Potomac to the morning of Tuesday, though not so definite as we could wish.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/07/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"We have intelligence this morning from the Army of the Potomac to the morning of Tuesday, though not so definite as we could wish. The only fighting which took place with the main portion of our forces under Gen. HOOKER at Chancellorsville on Monday was late in the afternoon. Gen. HOOKER then sent out one division of the Fifth Corps to feel the enemy's lines toward Fredericksburgh. A brisk action ensued, resulting in driving back the rebel lines, when our troops returned to their intrenchments. We have reason to believe that a battle of much greater magnitude was fought on Tuesday, of the results of which we are yet uninformed, though it was probably undecisive. On the left, at Fredericksburgh, there was considerable fighting of a desperate character on Sunday and Monday. The accounts of this fighting and its results are very much confused, and we are unable to say exactly what has been done, either by the rebels or ourselves. It appears that a portion, at least, of the fortifications on the heights captured by us on Sunday, were recaptured by a rebel force coining up from below, and one account has it that they were all retaken by the rebels, and that Gen. SEDGWICK had withdrawn his troops to the north side of the Rappahannock, and hastened up the river to join Gen. HOOKER. We also have the statement that Gen. HOOKER has been reinforced by 30,000 men from Washington, under Gen. HEINTZELMAN. Nothing definite has yet been heard from Gen. STONEMAN, but it is believed that he has accomplished the work assigned to him.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-07T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31a06e79-a323-52ad-92af-2fe74650e214,441,nyt://article/31a06e79-a323-52ad-92af-2fe74650e214

Wounded Heroes of Our A???,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/07/archives/the-wounded-heroes-of-our-army.html,Wounded Heroes of Our A???,"Great and momentous as the crisis is to which Gen. HOOKER'S timely audacity has brought us within the last few days, and eager as we may be to learn the result of the tremendous game which he is now playing on the Rappahannock, the country must not forget that the last week has added several thousands to the long roll of the sick and wounded and maimed. We say nothing of the dead, for they reck little now of our remembering or forgetting. Whenever we recall these, it will be for our consolation and encouragement, and not for theirs. But those who were struck down in the fight, and are still alive and suffering, may be greatly comforted and much supported by the thoughtful charity and kindness of the millions at home whose honor and interests they have so well defended. No one can have read the story of the three bloody days through which our army has just passed without feeling proud, not simply of his country, but of his kind. To stand as fast as they have done, and fall as bravely, after two years of disaster and disappointment, does honor not simply to the United States, but to human nature; and happily our admiring their courage and constancy does not depend in the least on our opinion about the lawfulness or unlawfulness, expediency or inexpediency of the war. Nor does it depend even upon the value we may attach to the preservation of the Union. We therefore have no hesitation in challenging for our heroic army the admiration of men of every land in which bravery and fortitude are still virtues, and in which dying for one's ideas is still held to be a noble thing. Any cause which could by possibility be just, would have been ennobled by being maintained and defended as our cause was at Chancellorsville last Saturday and Sunday. It is a matter of no small moment for us and our posterity, that there should be in our history some of those great days, the memory of which is a more valuable inheritance to a nation than either riches, or territory, or power -- days that our children's children may read of with dimmed eyes, not because they were crowned with triumph, but because they were fought out manfully to the last. America is frequently reproached with its want of great traditions, but we must not forget that it is better still to furnish posterity with the material for them than to have inherited them from our ancestors. They are a precious legacy to leave, for they are the nurse and the support of all that is noblest and strongest in National life. Let us, therefore, be doubly grateful to the brave men who adorn our history in the tangled Virginian woods, with episodes, which will hereafter be held worthy of our destiny, even should it prove tenfold more brilliant than our wildest dreams have ever pictured it. And we must never forget that the greatest glory lies, after all, not so much in winning as in deserving to win. It is well to be proud of triumphs, but it is a far nobler thing to be able to be proud of defeats.

"This gallant officer, whose death took place on the 23d by typhoid fever at Washington, was buried on Tuesday in Greenwood the funeral services having been performed at St. Thomas' Church. Col. NAZER was a native of Suffolk, in England, and served for some years as an officer in the British army, having been Adjutant of the Ninetieth light infantry, one of the crack corps in that service, and was highly esteemed by his superior officers, both as a gentleman and soldier. On retiring from the British army he accepted the position of Treasurer of the Winter Garden Theatre, in which capacity he acquired in this City many friends by his obliging disposition and courteous manners. With the breaking out of the war the love for his old profession returned, and he accepted the position of Lieutenant-Colonel of the New-York Mounted Rifles, a regiment raised chiefly through the exertions and liberality of Mr. LOUIS LAFARGE.

Col. NAZER was a native of Suffolk, in England, and served for some years as an officer in the British army, having been Adjutant of the Ninetieth light infantry, one of the crack corps in that service, and was highly esteemed by his superior officers, both as a gentleman and soldier. On retiring from the British army he accepted the position of Treasurer of the Winter Garden Theatre, in which capacity he acquired in this City many friends by his obliging disposition and courteous manners. With the breaking out of the war the love for his old profession returned, and he accepted the position of Lieutenant-Colonel of the New-York Mounted Rifles, a regiment raised chiefly through the exertions and liberality of Mr. LOUIS LAFARGE.

She left Liverpool on the 25th, and Queenstown on the 20th ult. We receive by this arrival reports of important debates which have taken place in the British Parliament on American affairs. The Marquis of Clanricarde, in the House of Lords, called up the subject of the seizure of British merchant steamers while in the Matamoras trade, and inveighed against the proceedings of Admiral WILKES. In the course of his remarks he also alluded to the fact that Minister ADAMS had granted a permit to a steamer carrying arms and munitions to the Mexicans, and characterized it as a most unwarrantable act. After remarks by other members, Earl GRANVILLE, on behalf of the Government, deprecated angry discussion on imperfect information, and the subject was dropped. In the House of Commons, Mr. ROEBUCK led off the debate on the same topics, and delivered himself of a strong philippic against the Northern dis-United States. Lord PALMERSTON gave assurances that the Government was giving due consideration to the matters discussed. The debate was continued in the House of Lords next day, when the Earl of Derby denounced the proceedings of the American Government as monstrous. The case of the Alexandra was also under discussion, and it was stated positively, on behalf of her builders, that she was not designed for the rebels. These debates are commented upon very freely by the London journals. The news of the attack of our iron-clad fleet upon Fort Sumter had reached England, but had attracted very little attention. The Polish Revolution appears to be assuming still more formidable proportions. We have reports that the Russians had been defeated in several engagements, and that the Russian commander has called for heavy reinforcements.

Raid Toward Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/08/archives/stonemans-cavalry-raid.html,Raid Toward Richmond,"-- We publish this morning some exceedingly interesting accounts of the sweeping gallopade of Gen. STONEMAN's cavalry, which we find in the Richmond papers of Tuesday, and the Washington papers of Wednesday. That part of the force under the immediate command of STONEMAN himself, which went down in the direction of the rebel capital, and cut the communications on the Richmond and Fredericksburgh Railroad, is reported by telegraph to have arrived at White House, on the York River. It seems to have performed its work admirably, though, we are sorry to say, not as rapidly as Gen. HOOKER had hoped. The whole of the rebel army that has lain since December between Richmond and Fredericksburgh appears to have got up to Chancellorsville before Gen. STONEMAN's arrival, as a detachment of his force rode up within five miles of Richmond, and some of the men even within two miles. The raid created a great panic in Richmond, and it is evident from our extracts that hardly a regiment had been left in the rebel Capital itself for defence, as the Home Guard were called out to protect the city. It would certainly have been a beautiful manoeuvre, if after STONEMAN had destroyed the communications between the rebel army and the rebel Capital, our troops now scattered on the Peninsula, at Suffolk, at Norfolk, and on the North Carolina coast, had been so concentrated that they could have marched in the direction of Petersburgh and Richmond, and, accompanied by a Monitor or two on the James, have captured and held the city of JEFF.

"The rumors which reached us on Wednesday and Wednesday night, regarding the movements of the Army of the Potomac, involving battles, disasters and retreat, yesterday resolved themselves into positive and authentic reports that Gen. HOOKER had withdrawn his army to the north side of the Rappahannock.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/08/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The rumors which reached us on Wednesday and Wednesday night, regarding the movements of the Army of the Potomac, involving battles, disasters and retreat, yesterday resolved themselves into positive and authentic reports that Gen. HOOKER had withdrawn his army to the north side of the Rappahannock. It does not appear that any battle was fought on Tuesday, the only fighting of consequence since Sunday having been on Monday evening, when only a single division of the Fifth corps was engaged. The withdrawal of the army from the south side was commenced on Tuesday night, and was successfully accomplished on Wednesday morning, with comparatively small loss. The movement may be regarded as wholly a providential one, influenced in great part doubtless by the sudden and great rise in the rivers caused by the storm, which raged even more furiously in Northern Virginia than in New-York. It may be considered doubtful, however, whether it would have been made, had Gen. HOOKER been apprised of the entire success of Gen. STONEMAN in cutting the rebel communications. This success is learned from the Richmond papers of the 5th. Gen. STONEMAN, it appears, divided his force into three columns, each one of which comp[???]ed the week assigned to it. One column was commanded by Gen. STONEMAN in person. This force effectually destroyed the Richmond and Fredericksburgh Railroad at Hanover Junction and town to within five miles of Richmond. Another column was commanded by Gen. AVERILL. This proceeded through C[???]pepper, and, after skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry, compel the destruction of the bridge over the Rapidan River. The third column was commanded by Gen. BUFORD. This pushed on directly toward Gordonsville, and information has reached Washington that it succeeded in cutting the Railroad between Gordonsville and Richmond, and also between Gordonsville and Charlottesville, thus entirely breaking up LEE's communications, and very effectually cutting off supplies and reinforcements. In addition to these important operations, we have the statements that Gen. PECK is pushing rapidly forward from Suffolk in pursuit of the rebels retreating from the line of the Blackwater, and that Gen. KEYES is also moving his corps from Yorktown to cooperate with Gen. HOOKER. Our losses in the Spring campaign thus far have been very heavy, but those of the rebels have been much more severe -- necessarily so, from the fact that they have attacked our forces in intrenched positions.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-08T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc221521-42a4-5069-b7eb-367a618a36d8,956,nyt://article/dc221521-42a4-5069-b7eb-367a618a36d8

HOOKER to this side of the Rappahannock has been to the people one of the very sharpest of their many disappointments. They had counted with peculiar confidence on a triumphant issue. The superb condition and splendid spirit of the army, the personal prestige of its chief, who had never fought but to conquer, the remarkable ability with which the new campaign was planned, and the signal success with which its first stage was consummated, to all appearance justifying the bulletin of the commander that ""the enemy must ingloriously fly, or come out from behind their defences and give us battle on our own ground, where certain destruction awaits him"" -- all combined to raise the public expectations to the highest pitch.

"About 2 o'clock yesterday morning, an affray occurred in the porter-house of JOSEPH H. NIXON, at No. 68 Oliver-street, between a party of boarding-house runners, during which PATRICK MCGOVERN was shot in the left eye with a pistol in the hands of JAS. O'HARA. MCGOVERN was immediately taken to the New-York Hospital by Officer KENNEDY, of the Fourth Precinct, where he died soon afterward. Coroner RANNEY held an inquest upon the body yesterday. There was considerable testimony taken, all of which tended to show that there was a large party in the saloon at the time of the shooting, that they had all been drinking, and considerable language of an abusive nature passed between the deceased and JAMES O'HARA. Dr. GALEN HUNTER, made a post mortem examination of the body. He testified that the ball from the pistol entered the left eye, passed through the orbit, and pierced the brain. Death, he thought, must necessarily have resulted in a short time. At the conclusion of the testimony, the jury rendered the following verdict: ""That the deceased came to his death by a pistol-shot would, at the hands of JAMES O'HARA, on the 8th day of May, 1863.""

"The Fifth Regiment New-York State Volunteers, known as Duryee's Zouaves -- First Regiment -- were welcomed on their return to the Metropolis, yesterday, with a splendid military turn-out, and one of the most enthusiastic popular demonstrations that could be imagined. The corps has been in nearly all the battles for the Union in Virginia and Maryland, from Big Bethel to Chancellorsville, and has always distinguished itself for its esprit du corps, its splendid discipline, and its fierce fighting whenever opportunity offered. As is well known, it has been honored by being brigaded with the regulars under Gen. SYKES, and has received from him due meed of praise. No wonder, then, that New-York should be proud of it, and should do the utmost to show the regiment how patriotism and valor is appreciated in the Metropolis of the Empire State. Two of our best regiments of militia, the Seventy-first and Thirty-seventh, paraded to do them honor, while their late comrades in arms, the Tenth New-York, Col. BENDIX, temporarily supplied with arms, likewise turned out to receive them. It was arranged that the Fifth should leave Jersey City at 3 o'clock P.M., and ad interim the attractive red breeches could be seen scattered throughout the City -- everywhere the centre of attraction, the focus of ten thousand questions, the cynosure of all eyes, the envy of the men, the delight of the women. Probably no other regiment in the army is so well known -- certainly none from the City of New-York has more friends. They are the same dashing, daring, free and easy, glorious fellows that they were when they left. It seems but a brief period since they electrified the City by their appearance en route for the seat of war, and their then unequaled marching drill. But how pregnant has been that brief period with memorable events. The eleven hundred men have dwindled to about two hundred and fifty, by the ravages of the bullet and camp disease, together with the natural depreciation of the force from the various disablements which have occurred. They are all still staunch in their love for the Union. The baptism of fire and sword has sanctified the cause to them, and many of them say that after they have seen their friends and enjoyed a brief respite, they will be off to camp and field again to do or die for the good old flag.

There were several technical points of defence set up in the answer, which appear to have been abandoned at the trial. But there was one defence urged in which the public have some interest. The premises insured by defendants were a part of a large carpet factory at West Farms, Westchester County, known as ""Smith's Carpet Factory."" There were fifteen policies on various portions of the premises. Thirteen of the Companies promptly paid the losses on their policies, but two of them refused. It appeared that in the Summer or Fall of 1861, the manufacture of carpets was greatly depressed, in consequence of the war, and the proprietor, as others in the same trade did, appropriated the same machinery with some slight alterations, and the same material used in making carpets, in the manufacture of army blankets; and they moved some of the machinery into the particular portion of the premises insured by defendants. This, the defendants urged, was a breach of the warranty in their policy -that the business to be carried on was carpet manufacturing. Plaintiffs said this was not a material change, and did not increase the risk.

The testimony produced was very conclusive against the accused, in the judgment of the magistrate, it consists of two letters -- one received by Mr. ESCHMANN on the 4th inst., and the other on the 7th. The writer, who signed himself WM. SMITH MITCHELL in both of them, demanded the sum of $100, to be sent in a letter to Station D, New York Post-office, or in default of that, he (MITCHELL) would expose Mr. E. in his relations with the wife of a certain man whom he named in his letters, and in addition to this he would do other things of a violent nature. The letters of Mr. MITCHELL are too gross for publication in our columns. The way the detectives managed to effect MITCHELL's arrest, was by means of a decoy letter deposited by them in the office at Station D, addressed to MITCHELL, and purporting to contain the amount of money demanded by the latter of Mr. ESCHMANN. The officers testify that they saw him take the decoy letter from the office and read it, and that they then immediately arrested him.

GRANT, and his immediate advance thence upon Port Gibson, where he attacked and defeated an army of the enemy 11,000 strong, seems at last to cut the gordian knot of the Vicksburgh difficulty. Gen. GRANT is now on the high road to the rear of Vicksburgh, with his army in full force and high spirited around him, and the rebels defeated and flying before him. The pursuit will hardly slacken before the rebels rally and reinforce their broken columns; and when they do this and meet GRANT face to face in battle, the fate of Vicksburgh will be decided. The contest can thus be conducted on somewhat equal terms. It is a vast gain to the National cause to have turned the powerful batteries that for nearly twelve long months have laughed our siege to scorn, and to have gained an equal footing in the field with the enemy. Everything now depends on Gen. GRANT's so closely following up the enemy, that they will have no time to take and fortify a new position to ward off the coming attack in the rear. That this will be looked to by Gen. GRANT the country has every reason to believe.

HALL had had to contend with, in fitting out his second expedition, because of his strong desire that it should not only originate in, but be supported entirely by his own country. There being still a sum of less than $2,000 to make up in order that the required preparations may be completed, the learned Judge offered a resolution appointing a Committee of Three to solicit subscriptions to the amount required. The resolution was carried unanimously, and a Committee of Three was appointed to collect the money. If all goes well, Capt. HALL expects to be ready to leave the port of New-London, Conn., on his second expedition, on the 2d of June next. The Society then elected the following officers for the ensuing year:",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Arctic Expedition.; MEETING OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Arctic Expedition.; MEETING OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-10T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fdee24e3-8d88-5105-ab1c-92ac85eb2184,335,nyt://article/fdee24e3-8d88-5105-ab1c-92ac85eb2184

The article of Dr. HOLMES, ""The Human Wheel; Its Spokes and Felloes,"" with its mixture of fact, fun and fancy, could have been written by no one but himself. It is an exposition of the philosophy and practice of walking, in conoexion with an account of the admirable substitute provided by B. FRANK PALMER for a missing limb. NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE's ""Up the Thames"" is another picture from the gallery of English scenes, so peculiarly impressed on his mind by his residence abroad, and now reproduced with wonderful, though unapparent art. It includes the account of a visit to LEIGH HUNT, told with the tender and graceful sympathy common to minds of a kindred order. ""CHARLES LAMB's Uncollected Writings"" will be acceptable to all lovers of ""Elia,"" and shows how much remains to be done for their favorite author. The politics of the number are comprised in ""Shall We Compromise?"" by D.D. WASSON, where a conclusion is arrived at from which there will be few dissentients.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The May Magazines.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The May Magazines.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-11T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1783f4d7-0269-509c-9947-50556514ba8b,736,nyt://article/1783f4d7-0269-509c-9947-50556514ba8b

Not for a long period has New-York witnessed such an eventful Sunday. It seemed as though the entire population of old and young, great and little, rich and poor, had mutually determined to come out of their houses to witness the ovation extended to the returning New-York regiments from the field of battle. From the roofs of public and other buildings, the National flag was displayed, and in many instances mottoes of welcome in letters of evergreen were exhibited at the windows of private residences. That the troops had an earnest and sincere reception at the hands of the people will not be doubted by any one who saw the proceedings of yesterday. That the troops appreciated the feeling which prompted the manifestation of interest in their behalf was also apparent The absence of omnibuses and other vehicler which monopolize Broadway on weekdays, rendered that thoroughfare comparatively free for the occasion. Wherever the returning soldiers appeared they were greeted with repeated acclamations. On all the down-town streets, little knots -- the nucleus of which was one or more of the volunteers -- could be observed, and if one was near enough to listen, he could hear question upon question concerning experience of the regiment during its two years' service, asked the brave fellows who at times must have considered the ordeal equal to that to which they had been subjected on the battle-field. As a general thing, the troops looked well, although, of course, camp-life had taken from them their naturally fair complexions, and given in return a bronzed and hardy visage. According to the late order, they were permitted to retain their arms.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RETURNING REGIMENTS.; The Arrival in this City of the First, Fourth and Twentieth NewYork Volunteers.They are Welcomed by an Immense Throng.Soldiers, Firemen and Civilians in theProcession.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/12/archives/local-intelligence-excitement-among-the-fancy-a-prize-fight.html,,"At a late hour on Saturday afternoon last, quite a number of the ""fancy men"" of this City received a notice to the effect that on Monday morning, (yesterday,) about daylight, a prize fight would take place between JAMES ELLIOTT and JAMES DUNN, at Camp Scott, Staten Island. The stakes were $1,200 a side. A large number of the sporting men of this City went down to Staten Island by the last boat on Saturday night. All day on Sunday large crowds of those immediately interested in the fight, availed themselves of the chances of a leisure day and repaired to the place, where it was supposed the battle would take place. The parties most interested did everything they could to prevent the Metropolitan Police from learning the time and place of the fight. The Dunn party went down, on Saturday night last, and were safely rendezvoused in the vicinity of Camp Scott; but Elliot's party did not undertake to leave the City until a late hour on Sunday night. The Metropolitan Police had, in the meantime, received notice of the intended fight, and orders were immediately issued by the Superintendent to the Captain of the Harbor Police Boat, to arrest all persons who endeavored to leave the City in a certain boat, which it was supposed would leave the Battery some time during the night. Police Boat No. 1 was accordingly manned, and every preparation was made to overhaul the suspected craft. About 2 or 3 o'clock on Sunday morning, a sloop was seen to pass down the North River, past the Battery and as it answered the description of the suspected craft, the Police-boat, which had steam up for several hours, gave chase, and in a short time overhauled the former. It proved to be the boat containing the Elliott party. When the Metropolitan boat first hailed the other, no answer was given; a second hail and the Elliott boat reponded, ""Don't mind the Metropolitans, but crowd on the sails."" The Captain of the Police-boat then said, ""Unless you come to and surrender, shall at once fire upon you."" This threat had the desired effect. The Elliott boat took in sail, and the Police steamer took her in low, and brought her back to the City, with all on board.

Surely there must be something strange to account for the strange difference between the manly spirit of the soldiers and the unmanly spirit of civilians. All accounts agree that the troops on the Rappahannock came out of their late bloody fight game to the backbone. Their submission in retreating was as steady and heroic as was their courage in advancing. It did not take from them one jot of confidence, either in themselves or their leader. But the news of the retreat no sooner came to the people, than thousands of them began to curse, and other thousands to whimper and whine. HOOKER was denounced as a braggart, a blunderhead and a humbug; and the cause itself was besniveled and bemoaned as sacrificed, ruined and lost. We do not say these feelings were universal. They were not -- far from it. There were men whose hearts were firmer set, and whose faces were more like flint that day than ever.

GRANT is making in circumventing the rebel army in Mississippi is one of the most hopeful features of the war. The West is not divided into many separate topographical systems, each independent of the other, as is the case with the Atlantic Seaboard States. The New-England harbors might be blockaded by an enemy, and New-York not feel it. New-York harbor might be closed, and yet the States conduct a foreign commerce without limit. It is different in the West. The Mississippi Valley is a grand unit, and a blockade of its great river at a single point, as at Vicksburgh, acts as a paralysis on commerce throughout its whole vast extent -- from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico.

That journal, nevertheless, persists in its assertion that he must have known it, because he is too acute and too sagacious a man to be deceived in such a matter. We beg to ask the Courrier what evidence it has even now that the vessel carried arms and munitions? We have seen nothing more conclusive on this point than some unsupported statements of the London Times, repeated by Secessionists in the House of Commons. If the Courrier has any better authority, we should be glad to know it. But it has failed at any rate to show that Mr. ADAMS had any reason for suspecting that he was doing anything more than certifying to the bona fide neutrality of a British vessel seeking a market for British goods in a Mexican port. The Courrier thinks it quite right for the British to send arms to the Mexicans for the express purpose of fighting the French.

HAMBLETON, of Georgia, formerly editor and publisher of the Southern Confederacy, a paper rendered infamous by the publication several years ago of the ""black list"" of New-York merchants, (those not supposed to be favorable to the peculiar institution,) was arrested in this city having lately come from Georgia, and having in his possession $27,000 of Confederate money and bonds. When arrested, HAMBLETON claimed to be a Union man and to have opposed the rebellion from the start; but the fact of his having in his possession so large an amount of Confederate money, coupled with his own declaration that he intended soon to return to Georgia by way of Nassau, was regarded as sufficient cause for his detention, and he has since that time been in the custody of the Government authorities, nominally confined in the Park Barracks, but in reality allowed what might be called the freedom of the City. Last week a writ of habeas corpus was issued by Judge MCCUNN to Capt. ARMSTRONG, of the Park Barracks, and Gen. WOOL, requiring them to produce the body of HAMBLETON for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of his detention. On Saturday Capt. ARMSTRONG made return to the writ that he held him by virtue of an order from his superior officer, Gen. WOOL. He also produced the body of HAMBLETON, and Judge MCCUNN adjourned the hearing of the case to 3 o'clock Monday afternoon. At the hour appointed, SAMUEL G. GLASSEY, Esq., as counsel for Gen.

"The hearing in the habeas corpus case of JAMES J. HAMBLETON, the Georgia spy, reported in yesterday's TIMES, did not take place yesterday morning according to adjournment, owing to the absence of the parties on whom the writ was served. At the opening of the General Sessions. Judge MCCUNN presiding, WM.C. TRAPHAGEN, counsel for HAMBLETON, arose and stated to the Court that Capt. ARMSTRONG, who had his client in custody when last before His Honor, had not seen fit to obey the order of the Court for the production of the prisoner, and he therefore moved that an attachment issue against him for contempt. The Judge granted the motion, and Capt. ARMSTRONG will probably be arrested as soon as found. We learn, however, that he was relieved from duty at the Park Barracks on Tuesday night, and immediately left town. As for HAMBLETON, he also left town on Tuesday, having been sent to Fort Lafayette by order of Gen. WOOL. This action has probably been taken to avoid the trouble of a long argument upon the question of the jurisdiction of the military and civil authorities. It is not at all probable, however, that HAMBLETON would have been released by Judge MCCUNN, if Gen. WOOL had submitted to the investigation, for the evidence of his being here in the interest of the rebels is ample and decisive. Those who have been with him since he has been in custody, say that he is an open, avowed and rampant Secessionist, and before the late battles at Fredericksburgh he frequently expressed the wish that HOOKER would get cut to pieces, and offered to bet odds that he would be. But the course taken by the military authorities to evade an investigation, will afford the Copperheads an opportunity for another blow about the ""Lincoln despotism.""

ARMSTRONG, who had his client in custody when last before His Honor, had not seen fit to obey the order of the Court for the production of the prisoner, and he therefore moved that an attachment issue against him for contempt. The Judge granted the motion, and Capt. ARMSTRONG will probably be arrested as soon as found. We learn, however, that he was relieved from duty at the Park Barracks on Tuesday night, and immediately left town. As for HAMBLETON, he also left town on Tuesday, having been sent to Fort Lafayette by order of Gen. WOOL. This action has probably been taken to avoid the trouble of a long argument upon the question of the jurisdiction of the military and civil authorities. It is not at all probable, however, that HAMBLETON would have been released by Judge MCCUNN, if Gen. WOOL had submitted to the investigation, for the evidence of his being here in the interest of the rebels is ample and decisive. Those who have been with him since he has been in custody, say that he is an open, avowed and rampant Secessionist, and before the late battles at Fredericksburgh he frequently expressed the wish that HOOKER would get cut to pieces, and offered to bet odds that he would be. But the course taken by the military authorities to evade an investigation, will afford the Copperheads an opportunity for another blow about the ""Lincoln despotism."" Albeit, it will be hard for them to get up much sympathy in this community for Mr. JAMES P. HAMBLETON, the black-mail editor of the quondam Southern Confederacy.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Hambleton Habeas Corpus.; UNCLE SAM FAILS TO RESPOND AND IS ATTACHED FOR CONTEMPT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Hambleton Habeas Corpus.; UNCLE SAM FAILS TO RESPOND AND IS ATTACHED FOR CONTEMPT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06ed7d86-0b1f-5e56-8677-2bf60bae4f5e,330,nyt://article/06ed7d86-0b1f-5e56-8677-2bf60bae4f5e

STREIGHT, which the rebels claim has fallen into their hands, was on its way to Rome, Ga., to destroy the rebel powder-mill and ironworks at that place, and also to break up certain railroad communications. The expedition was projected by General ROSECRANS, and left Corinth under escort of a heavy infantry force, under General DODGE, some three weeks since. Gen. DODGE pushed as far east as Tuscumbia, Ala., and had four fights on his way -- two at Buzzard's Roost, and the others at Bear Creek and Town Creek; -- the precise location of the battle-fields it is difficult to give, but they are all near the line dividing Alabama from Mississippi, in the north. From Tuscumbia STREIGHT's horsemen started across Alabama for Rome. The preceding fights, however, had put the rebels on the alert, and a cavalry force, under the guerrilla FORREST, was detached from BRAGG's army to operate against them. They seem to have very soon fell in with a part of STREIGHT's raiders, and attacked them; but STREIGHT pushed straight on for Rome, relying upon the pluck of his men and the bottom of his horses, and fighting the rebels ceaselessly as he went. Finally the pursuing rebels overmastered him, and took, we know not how large a part of his force, captive -- BRAGG, in his brief report of the affair, claiming that the whole detachment are prisoners.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""STREIGHT'S CAVALRY RAID."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""STREIGHT'S CAVALRY RAID."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/531b76b2-c97f-5edf-b074-c91c0770e1f3,454,nyt://article/531b76b2-c97f-5edf-b074-c91c0770e1f3

Twelve rounds were fought in the space of thirty minutes. During the last round DUNN fell upon the ropes, and while in that position was struck by ELLIOTT, which was decided by the referee to be a foul blow. Such being the decision, the fighting ceased, and the crowd dispersed. The scene was witnessed by about 500 of the sporting fraternity, who crossed the river at the Barclay-street and Forty-second-street Ferries. The Sheriff of the county in which it was first proposed to have the encounter, appeared on the ground before the ropes were put up, and urged the ""roughs"" to advance a few rods on the road, which would place them within the precincts of another county. But the combatants had hardly clasped hands before opening the entertainment, when the Sheriff of that county suddenly made his appearance within the ring, announced his office, and stated that he had not with him a sufficient force to compel them to observe the law, but demanded that they should not disturb the peace. Cries of ""Pitch him out,"" ""Give him a clipper,"" &c., were instantly raised, and before the Sheriff could count ten, he was launched on all fours at a distance of fifty feet from the stakes. About half a dozen policemen in disguise were present, but they made no attempts at interference. As a general thing the betting was in favor of ELLIOTT. On the eleventh round 100 to 40 was offered that ELLIOTT would win. At the conclusion of the fight the combatants were driven from the ground in carriages. It is claimed that ELLIOTT won the first blood, and DUNN the first knock-down. The result of the affair is very unsatisfactory to ELLIOTT's friends, and possibly the parties will arrange for another meeting. ELLIOTT and DUNN are the parties that attempted to fight on Staten Island on Monday, but were prevented by the Police. ELLIOTT is from New-York City, and DUNN from Brooklyn. The ground selected for the fight, yesterday, is situated about two miles back of the Forty-second-street Ferry. Before the principals had arrived a number of rows occurred, during which several of the combatants had their countenances terribly damaged. Among the backers present were Kit Burns, Phil Clare, Mike Norton, Harry Hill, Mike Henry and Tim Riley. As a preliminary arrangement the principals made a private bet of $50. The stakes have not yet been paid over.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Prize Fight.; THE CONTEST BETWEEN ELLIOTT AND DUNN A FOUL BLOW THE DECISION IN FAVOUR OF DUNN AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP THE AFFAIR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Prize Fight.; THE CONTEST BETWEEN ELLIOTT AND DUNN A FOUL BLOW THE DECISION IN FAVOUR OF DUNN AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP THE AFFAIR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58d6a328-c5d2-5f58-ad36-be8aa2d3694f,421,nyt://article/58d6a328-c5d2-5f58-ad36-be8aa2d3694f

Immediately after the secession of Virginia he appeared on the scene, and ever since then he has been one of the foremost figures. He was the leader in the first hostile act of the Secessionists of Virginia -- the march upon Harper's Ferry. In the first great action of the war, the battle of Manassas Plains, he took part, and one of his characteristic personal and military qualities, expressed in his title of ""Stonewall,"" here first appeared. In every great battle fought since that time by the main rebel army, and in many minor affairs, he has been a leading actor -- in the Peninsular battles, where he was the first to attack our right; in the second battle of Manassas; at the battle of Antietam; at the battle of Fredericksburgh, and lastly at the battle of Chancellorsville, on the 3d, in which engagement he received his death-wound -- inflicted accidentally, it is said, by one of his own men. His campaign up and down the Shenandoah Valley, in the Spring of last year, and his series of engagements with Gens. BANKS and FREMONT, were only inferior in importance to the six or seven first-class battles in which he played his part. In each of the battles in which he acted subordinately, he was generally assigned to the peculiar and critical duties of opening the assault, making a dashing movement upon the flank or rear, or seizing and holding a point which might be called the key of the situation. In a short letter, written by him about a year ago, in reply to the accusation of having written a piece of sentimental poetry, he denied the poetical imputation, and said that the only ambition of his life was to serve the South, and ""give a practical illustration of some of the simplest rules of war."" These rules seem to have been celerity of movement, concentration of force, and rapid, persistent and heavy blows on his adversary's most vulnerable point; -- while the body with which he operated he kept in an extraordinary state of mobility. The numerical strength of that force seems to have varied from the twelve or fifteen thousand he commanded in the Shenandoah Valley to the forty thousand he was usually credited with in the great actions.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Death of Stonewall Jackson.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Death of Stonewall Jackson.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Jackson, Stonewall', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-14T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7df0d39c-2fce-5905-970a-cb256e434978,673,nyt://article/7df0d39c-2fce-5905-970a-cb256e434978

"Yesterday the anniversary of the above Society was held at Irving Hall. The exercises were opened with prayer and singing, after which the President of the Society, WILLIAM A. BOOTH, Esq., made a brief address. He alluded to the objects of the institution, and the general plan of its operations, and concluded by introducing to the audience Rev. Mr. WARREN, Secretary of the Society, whom he had invited to draw up a statement of facts connected with the management of that body. Mr. WARREN read a lengthy report, which covered in detail the system of operation adopted by the Society. The administration of it is divided into two parts -- the business and the charitable departments. The nature of those parts and the relation existing between them were next considered. It was the province of the business department to provide for the sale of all books, tracts and publications manufactured by the Society, and to attend to the accounts, and all matters pertaining to the financial branch of the institution. That department pays from the proceeds of its sales all its own expenses, of whatsoever kind, and all the general expenses of the Society, save those directly connected with its charitable work.

The exercises were opened with prayer and singing, after which the President of the Society, WILLIAM A. BOOTH, Esq., made a brief address. He alluded to the objects of the institution, and the general plan of its operations, and concluded by introducing to the audience Rev. Mr. WARREN, Secretary of the Society, whom he had invited to draw up a statement of facts connected with the management of that body. Mr. WARREN read a lengthy report, which covered in detail the system of operation adopted by the Society. The administration of it is divided into two parts -- the business and the charitable departments. The nature of those parts and the relation existing between them were next considered. It was the province of the business department to provide for the sale of all books, tracts and publications manufactured by the Society, and to attend to the accounts, and all matters pertaining to the financial branch of the institution. That department pays from the proceeds of its sales all its own expenses, of whatsoever kind, and all the general expenses of the Society, save those directly connected with its charitable work. It has also, during the past four years, paid in all $7,488 24 of the cost of administering the Charitable Department; and should its business increase as rapidly as it has done.

In this instance, the news from Puebla is no later than the 23d ult., when it should have been to the 29th. The reason given for this is, that Gen.

"EDWIN WHITE has now on the easel at his studio in the New-York University, a picture of unusual interest. The subject belongs to a period in whose picturesque and poetical art material he is perhaps more thoroughly at home than any other American painter, and is treated with a vivacity of composition and color which testify how fully heart and hand sympathized in the work. He calls it ""RAPHAEL explaining his fresco of the Incendie del Borgo."" The scene is one of the apartments of the Vatican, assigned for ornamentation to the great painter. In the centre is a group of visitors, consisting of three ladies of rank and an aged ecclesiastic, to whom RAPHAEL, standing a little to the left, is explaining his study for the fresco. This group affords a happy opportunity for the application of Mr. WHITE's studies in middle-age costume and is full of spirit and beauty. The rich draperies of the ladies, who stand with their faces toward the artist, and the fine sitting figure of the monk, with his sombre robes and beautiful old head, form a most charming harmony of lines and hues. Behind these, on the lofty wall, is seen the fresco in progress, its bold, nude forms in striking contrast with the quiet elegance of the living group below. Just over the heads of the latter, on a light scaffolding, some pupils and workmen are busily engaged on the fresco; one lays on the plaster and one mixes the colors, while GIULIO ROMANO rapidly applies to the moist surface. On the right, a dark massive curtain, which conceals the entrance and arranged with artistic skill to supply the depth of space and breadth of effect wanting in the bare and unarchitectural camera, sweeps from the ceiling to the floor.

Generalship and Political Sentiment,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/15/archives/political-sentiments-not-a-guarantee-of-generalship.html,Generalship and Political Sentiment,"The blast blown by the Abolitionists, at their recent meeting, against all Generals who do not hold their opinions on the Slavery question, is an exact and appropriate response to the lamentations of the Copperheads over the downfall of MCCLELLAN. TO neither of these parties are our officers' military qualities of the slightest consequence. The one thing they seek for in ""the chief of their choice"" is the profession of certain ""views,"" religious and political, which they think of the utmost importance to the State. In the laudations lavished by WENDELL PHILLIPS on FREMONT and HUNTER and BUTLER, and in his invectives against the Administration for not giving them the entire conduct of the war, there is little or no stress laid on their military skill, for about this absolutely nothing is known. Not one of them has had charge of operations of any magnitude for more than a few days, and not one has commanded in a general action of any importance. So that all this extravagant praise of them is based on the curious presumption that, inasmuch as they are strongly opposed to Slavery in principle as well as in fact, they would be sure, if placed at the head of great armies, to play havoc with any enemy fighting in defence of it. It seems strange that, after two years' experience of war, there should be any body of intelligent or educated men amongst us who suppose that moral sentiments are a measure of intellectual faculties; that such is the case, is a fresh illustration of the danger of devoting one's self exclusively to the contemplation of any one subject. It is as absurd to conclude from HUNTER's or FREMONT's hostility to Slavery that he possesses the necessary qualifications for conquering armed and organized slaveholders, as to conclude that he is a good architect because he admires fine buildings, or a good lawyer because he hates fraud, or a good mining engineer because he loves gold.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Political Sentiments Not a Guarantee of Generalship.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Political Sentiments Not a Guarantee of Generalship.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-15T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/97cd37f6-641d-5b13-a60e-302a732d7338,970,nyt://article/97cd37f6-641d-5b13-a60e-302a732d7338

"At the meeting of the Board of Aldermen yesterday, several papers were introduced in relation to the subject of street-cleaning. Six sub-contractors and the foremen of laborers in several Wards engaged under the present contract, remonstrated against any abrogation of it till provision is specifically made to pay them their arrears -- about six weeks' pay. These remonstrances and a message from the Mayor, stating that the Health Commissioners had ordered a transfer of the work of street-cleaning to the City Inspector, and requesting that a provisional appropriation be made to carry it on till the expenditure shall be recovered by a suit at law from the sureties of the Hackley contract, were all laid over. The Committee on National Affairs submitted a statement, which was laid over. It sets forth that, being without specific directions as to the manner in which to receive the New-York two year regiments returning home, they had used their own judgment in the matter, but as the costs of the receptions so far given have much exceeded their anticipations -- already amounting to over $14,000 -- and in view of the fact that many more returning regiments are soon to arrive, they ask for definite instructions how to receive them, and what expense to incur. A petition was presented from persons whose houses and furniture were injured by the recent powder explosion in Seventy-eighth-street, asking for reparation, the parties owning the magazine where the explosion occurred having located it there on a permit from the Mayor. Referred to a Special Committee of live.

National Intelligencer on Extravagant Journalism,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/16/archives/extravagant-tone-of-journalism.html,National Intelligencer on Extravagant Journalism,"-- The National Intelligencer remonstrates with great force against the habit of dealing in extravagant language concerning the merits and proposed projects of Generals in the field, in advance of expected engagements. The effect of such excessive laudation is to beget undue expectations in the public mind, and to induce a corresponding depression and disappointment in the event of failure. We concur fully in the timely justice of the Intelligencer's remarks on this subject: indeed, our readers would recognize in them little more than a repetition, after the event, of cautions and suggestions to precisely the same effect which we made before Gen. HOOKER's recent advance and failure. As long ago, for example, as on the 30th of April, we took occasion to protest against indulging toward Gen. HOOKER any of the extravagancies of language or of expectation with which it had been common to herald the movements of our commanding Generals. One sentence from that article will serve to show its drift, as well as the general tone of all our articles on that subject.

Heretofore little credit has been awarded GIGNOUX for any expression of tenderness in his pictures; aught in their treatment like poetry or sentiment, seemed foreign to this nature, and while he gave us, so to speak, the strong prose of autumn in brilliant reds and yellows, he never presented us with the delicate poetry of Spring-time with its light tints of green and blue. This feeling, however, is pleasingly apparent in the present picture, which is an eminently thoughtful and suggestive one, breathing the very spirit of rural peace and quietude. It is in marked contrast, both in its subject and color, to his ""Indian Summer,"" though it possesses the same freedom of execution and harmonious management of light and shade which characterise that work. The luminous nature of the atmosphere is skillfully expressed, and the aerial perspective, observable in the immense distance given to the mountains, is admirably carried out.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Alps by Sunrise.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Alps by Sunrise.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/40c0c106-eca7-5a89-b6f7-6d3f7148bfbb,454,nyt://article/40c0c106-eca7-5a89-b6f7-6d3f7148bfbb

"-- The operation of recto-vesical lithotomy was performed for the first time successfully in New-York, on Monday, by EDWARD H. DIXON, M.D., in presence of a number of our surgeons and physicians. The patient was Mr. GEORGE LOW, of Muscatine, Iowa. He had been afflicted with the disease for thirty-seven years. Peculiar interest attached to this case, from the fact that the stone, from its long presence in the base of the bladder, had sunk downward, and formed for itself a sack, and protruded into the bowel, making, as it were, two separate bladders. No instrument could be introduced to guide the knife, in the usual way of operating, from the fact that the large size of the stone made pressure upon the urethra. All had to depend on the tact of the surgeon, and his knowledge of the anatomy of the parts. In less than a minute the stone lay on the table, undergoing the surgical scrutiny of the gentlemen who were present.

Lecture on what shall be done with the negroes,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/16/archives/what-shall-be-done-with-the-negro-a-lecture-by-frederick-douglass.html,Lecture on what shall be done with the negroes,"The Brooklyn Academy of Music was filled to repletion last evening by an audience of ladies and gentlemen, assembled to hear the colored orator, FREDERICK DOUGLASS. The speaker was introduced by Postmaster LINCOLN, and commenced by saying that the great question before the public at present was, ""What shall be done with the negro?"" The word negro had become the most frequent word in the language. Amid the conflict of opinion and the thunder and smoke of battle, the negro looms up, and will continue to do so until the question with regard to him is settled on the basis of justice. He proposed to-night to advocate the adoption of the negro into the family of the nation on terms of the most perfect equality as the only salvation of the country. The only way to secure peace to the nation was to do justice to the negro. He must not only be given freedom, but must be admitted to all the privileges of a citizen of the United States. Heretofore the negro had been regarded only as the means of putting money in the white man's pocket, like a bale of cotton, but hereafter he must be regarded and treated as a man. Under the past treatment of the negro we had seen nothing but the most abject servility from the North to the South; and what was our reward? Half a million of armed men were now seizing at the throat of the Government and threatening the destruction of the Republic. Having sacrificed 250,000 of our youths in bloody graves by this rebellion in the interest of Slavery, it was now time that we adopted a new policy. Under the old system, the golden rule. ""Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you,"" had been found impracticable; the Declaration of Independence had been found impracticable; the Constitution had been found impracticable; even the worthless carcass of the Democratic party had been found impracticable, and the South had broken it up and destroyed it at Charleston. But what, is now asked, shall he done with the negro? There were three or four schemes put forth to settle this question. The first was to reduce all black men to Slavery throughout the entire country, and enact laws to make the system uniform. But the trouble with this plan was that it would create an aristocracy -- a master who would wish to rule all, whether white or black, so that those who did not own slaves would be like the poor whites of the South -- mere trash. The second scheme was to colonize them. This was a very pleasing scheme to a large number of people at the North, but it was like sending missionaries to the moon; it was easy to see what great good they would do when there, but the question was how to get them there. By the time this war was ended there would hardly be money enough left to pay their transportation. Besides, the great trouble has been in years past that there were not negroes enough at the South. They have now tried to revive the Slave-trade for the sake of getting more. And they will need more than ever after the war. It had been said that the negro was lazy, and would not work. This has been the favorite talk even of slaveowners; but how happened it that all Europe was at the point of starvation the moment the industry of the negro was interrupted? Again, it was said that some day or other a war of races would break out, and then the negro would be exterminated. There were men base enough to advocate this. Even in Brooklyn men had lately been driven from their work and mobbed, for no other reason than the color of their skin. The truth was, there was only one way of disposing of the question, and that was to admit the negro to full equality in political and civil rights. He did not wish to be misunderstood. He did not mean to insist on what is called ""social equality;"" he did not know -- in fact, he much doubted -- if there were such a thing; certainly it had never been developed to his knowledge in history. If it were possible, he did not know but the negro would have as much to dread from it as he white man. Thus far, in the history of this country, the negro had groped about among us un seen -- killed by Slavery in the South, smothered by prejudice in the North; but he was still a man, with aspirations, feelings, courage, hopes, fears. He was not an animal. The laws enacted about him showed that. It is not necessary to pass laws to prevent horses from reading. Congress lately came near passing a law that the negro should never be equal to the white man; thus showing that there was a possibility that he might become so. A great deal was said about the negro intermarrying with the white. He did not ask the Government to regulate this matter, it would regulate itself. All the negro asked was equality before the law. But it was said that the Constitution opposed this. They might he surprised to be told that not one in ten of the white citizens of the United States ever read the Constitution. They are not aware that the word slave is not in it. WENDELL PHILLIPS had said the other day that WM.H. SEWARD refused to give a passport to a negro. That could be explained from the fact that Mr. SEWARD was a lawyer, and knew perfectly well that the Constitution does not know the word negro. He gave passports to American citizens, not to Irishmen, Germans or negroes. The speaker know Mr. SEWARD well, and there was no man freer from prejudice against color than him. The Constitution had been tortured ever since the formation of the Government, to make it mean what it did not say, and what its framers never intended it should say -- all for the protection of slavery. Lastly came the old argument that the negro was an inferior race. If this were true, it would be a mean and blasphemous apology for enslaving him. When a man is on crutches, give him a kick. This was the apology for despotism the world over; the same used by us against the Mexicans, by the Russians against the Turks, by the English against the Irish. And, speaking of the Irish, he was amazed at their conduct here. There was no more generous, warm-hearted, hospitable people at home than the Irish; none who treated oppression and tyranny with a deeper hatred. He never had been treated more kindly than in Ireland; never had his good opinion of human nature more exalted and strengthened than in that Green Isle. And he never could understand how it was that when the Irish get to this country they become the most cruel, the meanest, and most vindictive of all the oppressors of his race. He could not account for it except on the principle that when a man gets suddenly rich he becomes more purse-proud and overbearing than if he were born to riches. Still he believed the Irish would yet become the warmest friends of the negro. There was a remarkable analogy in the history of the two races. Two hundred years ago the Irish were almost as badly persecuted for their religion as the negro is now for his color. When the bastile of Slavery is demolished all this prejudice will cease. When the white race begin to do justice to the negro then they begin to love them. The negro loves the white man and is going to stay with him; he is not going to die out as many think; he does not belong to the die out race; he will rather die in. He must remain with the whites -- even as slaves, it not as freemen; but it were better for you as for him that he be free than slave. And since this must be so, is it not better that he become a free and equal citizen before the law, than that he be an outcast, vicious and criminal? The speaker closed by alluding to the Fifty-fourth regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, (colored,) in which he said he had two sons, and which he expected soon to see march down Broadway, keeping step to the music of ""Old John Brown."" When the negro got fairly into this war, the end of the rebellion might be looked for. One thing was certain; they would not be in haste to get captured for the sake of being exchanged.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE NEGRO?; A Lecture by Frederick Douglass.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT SHALL BE DONE WITH THE NEGRO?; A Lecture by Frederick Douglass.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Douglass, Frederick', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-16T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bb367e75-8d6d-59cb-bbba-2446cc8cc97d,1486,nyt://article/bb367e75-8d6d-59cb-bbba-2446cc8cc97d

Annual Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/16/archives/annual-meeting-of-the-howard-mission-and-home-for-little-wanderers.html,Annual Meeting,"Thursday evening the Academy of Music was crowded on the occasion of the annual meeting of the above institution. GRAFULAL's Seventh Regiment Band was in attendance. Two hundred children of the institution were present, seated on an elevated platform at the rear of the stage, so that upon the rising of the green curtain an exceedingly beautiful effect was produced. Rev. PETER STRYKER was called to preside, and on taking the chair made a few appropriate remarks. The children then sung, with touching effect, a hymn, entitled ""Sweet Hour of Prayer."" The singing was under the direction of T.B. PERKINS, Esq., Principal of the Normal Musical Academy. A prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. FULLER, after which Rev. R.G. TOLES, Principal of the Institution, read the annual report. There have been received from all sources $15,713 36, of which sum $3,163 50 was donated by Mrs. MERCY M. CARTER, of North Wilmington, Mass., and $12,519 66 from donations and the sale of pictures of children and the Little Wanderer's Friend. The expenses amount to $13,680 69, of which $2,186 41 were paid for provisions, and the balance for salaries, traveling, rent, repairs, printing, &c. The balance in favor of the Mission is $2,062 67. During the year 312 barrels and boxes of provisions, 8 tons of coal, and 151 boxes and packages of clothing, containing more than 13,000 garments, pairs of shoes, boots, and pieces of bedding have been received. 1,224 children have been received and washed, fed, clothed and taught.

Denmark and Germany,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/17/archives/denmark-and-germany.html,Denmark and Germany,"The ""despots of Germany"" are hard to please. Formerly they were wroth with the Danish King because he denied liberty to his Teutonic Duchies; and now they are no less indignant because he has proclaimed these same Duchies autonomous. From the alacrity with which Prussia and Austria have protested against the tenor of FREDERIC's proclamation, and from the readiness evinced by Hanover and Bavaria to join in a war against the little Cimbrian Kingdom, it might be supposed that the Government of Copenhagen had inflicted some grievous wrong on the inhabitants of Holstein and Lauenburg, rather than conceded to them privileges which render them the freest and most favored of all of German race. But if the Holsteiners and Lauenburghers are not aggrieved, Fatherland, it seems, is. When a great Power wants to quarrel with a petty Power, a pretext can always be found, even though it may be as shallow as that under color of which the wolf devoured the lamb; and so it is in the present case. There is a ""river in Macedon as well as in Monmouth,"" and there are Germans in Schleswig as well as in Holstein and Lauenburg; and it is because the Danish proclamation presumes to draw a line of demarcation between the former and the latter, and to refuse those privileges to the Teutons of Schleswig which it has granted to their brethren of the Teutonic Duchies, that all this indignation has been manifested, and all these protests and menaces put forth, on the part of the German potentates. So anxious are those despots to establish a casus belli against Denmark, that they keep quite out of view the fact that Schleswig is not a portion of Germany, and that they have no right whatever to call FREDERIC to an account for his treatment of the Germans of that province, however justified they may be in doing so when the people of Holstein and Lauenburg are concerned. The Eyder is the boundary between Scandinavia and Germany; all who dwell north of that river dwell on Danish soil, and the despots in question are no more entitled to interfere between the Danish King and the Teutons of Schleswig, than they are to east the aegis of their protection over the Teutonic citizens of the United States or Mexico. Beside, the Teutons of Schleswig have no very terrible grievance to complain of, their worst one appearing to be that the Danish language is used in the schools and churches of that Duchy in preference to the German.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Denmark and Germany.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Denmark and Germany.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-17T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/763e176d-35c9-5d69-a136-8855216df98f,2008,nyt://article/763e176d-35c9-5d69-a136-8855216df98f

There were some fears that these vessels might suffer disastrously from the rebel batteries on the Red River which opened so fatally upon the Queen of the West, near the close of last year, and which, we were told, had been greatly strengthened of late. We also had statements from the rebels that an immense iron-clad fleet had been built or was building up the Red River, and that its whole line was swarming with rams -- if rams may be said to swarm. We characterized these statements at the time as being funny rather than fearful. And so the event has proved.

Time as an Ally of the North,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/18/archives/time-as-an-ally.html,Time as an Ally of the North,"In almost every struggle, Time is sure to figure as a great ally, on the one side or the other; and the whole result often depends upon the question whether this ally can be secured or not. FABIUS saved Rome from HANNIBAL chiefly by obtaining it, and turning it to the best account. The enemies of NAPOLEON were overthrown mainly because almost uniformly deprived of it by his terrible celerity. The Southern revolutionists owed all their first success more to the fact that the last Administration allowed them time than to all other things combined. It was Mr. BUCHANAN's fatal mistake. Had he garrisoned the Southern forts with promptitude, as Gen. SCOTT entreated him to do, and used with proper dispatch his other powers called for by the occasion, the secession movement might have been checked. He gave it time, and it soon acquired a breadth and strength that enabled it to sweep the whole cotton region, from the Atlantic to the Rio Grande. The different action of the Border States was determined entirely by the fact whether the Unionists obtained the advantage of time or not. In Virginia they did not, as the State was hurled out of the Union by the Convention in the storm of excitement following Sumter, before the people had time to deliberate. In Kentucky they did, the Unionists gaining time by the temporary device of what was called the neutrality plan. In Maryland they did, through the interposition of the President, who ordered the arrest of the legislators just on the eve of launching their secession ordinance. In Missouri they did, through the summary action of Gen. LYON in breaking up Camp Jackson. After the war had fairly opened, it was, however, by our own slow operations that time was given to the rebels to make their immense levies, and to arm and equip them, that they acquired such prodigious military power. Had we made a mighty effort to raise and arm soldiers, and struck both promptly and skillfully, the rebellion would probably have been crushed in its first year. But we gave it time to develop and compact itself, and the consequence has been that, for the last year, it has been quite our match.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Time as an Ally.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Time as an Ally.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Time', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-18T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4ba0c50d-a032-588b-a944-6bc88ef19433,1016,nyt://article/4ba0c50d-a032-588b-a944-6bc88ef19433

The meeting at the main stand was not organized until half an hour afterward, and then by dint of music and torches, and the fortuitous circumstance that about that time, large numbers of citizens passed through the Square en route for home, the crowd was augumented to about the number named. It was a peripatetic crowd, and wandered from one stand to another with listless curiosity. The few hundreds who kept their places in front of the stands, however, made up in noise and enthusiasm what they lacked in numbers, and vigorously cheered all denunciations of the Administration. The allusions to the Conscription Act were everywhere received with expressions of opposition to the [???], and a statement that VALLANDIGHAM would be rescued if brought through New-York on his way to Fort Warren, was vigorously cheered.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE COPPERHEAD COUNCIL; Three Thousand Citizens Assembled at Union Square.

"Mrs. JANE ENGLISH's experiment at Laura Keene's Theatre has shared the fate of the Opera. The lieges watch it with apathy, and the critics with regret. As a consequence, the benches are temptingly and luxuriously vacant. To account for this state of things we must remender, first, that Laura Keene's has ceased to be a popular theatre, and secondly, that Mrs. ENGLISH is a stranger, whose claims to the honors of Metropolitan management have not yet been recognized. Our people, in the matter of amusements, are singularly jealous of outsiders. They view with ill-concealed annoyance the occasional raids of hardy and enthusiastic provincials. It is seldom that the invaders get off with bag and baggage. We know not the extent of Mrs. ENGLISH's ambition, but for a couple of months at least she proposes to give us a species of entertainment based on the Ravel model, with variations that seem to have been suggested by the circus. The performances on the opening night were not of a very promising character, but they have improved since. We begin to hope that Mrs. ENGLISH may be successful. A novel entertainment on Broadway would indeed be a luxury to a craving community. Was there ever a city in the world with a million inhabitants so badly supplied with places of amusement as is New-York? In reality we have but one theatre on the west side of the town -- Wallack's; all the other places being mere show rooms and platforms for travelling ""stars"" who revolve in their little orbits punctually enough, but without adding an inch to the space traversed. If it were not for a constant influx of healthy foreigners and of utterly indestructable natives from the East, the proud metropolis of the New World would speedily be depopulated and reduced to a howling wilderness by the fatal agony of its amusements, by the dreadful pressure of its tragedians, by the evil influence of the ""stars."" Without these robust classes to throw into the arena, we should be roared into fits and tore into pieces by the two-legged furies who there pant and perform. But providential as is this provision, there is an inconvenience about it. The robust classes like their entertainment a little savage, and they have been gratified with a vengeance. The noises of a five-act play are as varied and appalling as those that issue from a menagerie. The secret of our well wishes for Mrs. ENGLISH and her success are thus revealed. Her artists do not speak and cannot howl. Moreover they must, as a rule, understand something of their profession, or they will flounder to the stage a mass of bruised and broken humanity -- sorely punished, indeed, for their pretence. And here is an anomaly that the philosophic mind at once detects in the two professions of tight-rope dancer and tragedian. The one, by a false step, may injure himself grievously, but with true art instinct, to hide all that is painful from the public, he will deliver a hop, skip and jump, and wobble playfully off the stage, to be conveyed, mayhap, by tender hands to the nearest hospital. Not a complaint escapes his lips; his face is wreathed in smiles, even if his body be racked with pain. The other one -- he who chalks his feet for tragedy, and goes on with Shakespeare as a long pole -- howls, yells, and writhes steadily for three hours, although there is not a bone in his body broken, and he knows that when it is all over there will be cakes and ale for him at home. For a cheerful view of life, it is always necessary to go to those who are in the greatest danger of losing it. And this brings us back to Laura Keene's Theatre, where, in addition to two remarkable performers on the tight-rope -- Mlle. ROSITA and ALEXANDER ZANFRETTA -- the lady manager has also provided us with a couple of wonderful gymnasts -- Prof. DONETTE and Young America -- and an Italian singer -- Signor MONTENARE -- who gives buffo scenes very acceptably, and a couple of dancers and a German violinist, who can imitate every thing except music, and, finally, a ballet pantomimic company. Of this latter we can only say, that it has improved in the interval between Monday and Saturday. The quick precision, and brief but intelligible dumb show of the RAVELS, were not attained in a day. Mrs. ENGLISH's pantomimists are profuse. They deliver an oration where they should only utter an exclamation; they are for ever scrambling about the stage; and stamp a great deal more than is good for them. An exception should however be made in favor of Senor CARON, a comic artist of talent, who will, we think, improve on acquaintance. In the ""Maison Rouge"" he was not always funny, although he tried to be so, but in the bed-room scene, and in the final opportunity of the piece, he was excellent. Let us add that there is an excellent orchestra, and repeat that we hope Mrs. ENGLISH will succeed. Anything as a relief to the necessity of going to a ""star"" theatre will be acceptable. Above all things we want variety, and when that is provided there will be room for a dozen more theatres in New-York. To-night, a prodigy, named ANGELO, makes his first appearance, and will ""perform his Icarean feat on the cloud swing.""

When the war began, the inexperienced public very naturally were possessed by the notion that a great leader must, above all things, love fighting; that he must have for it a certain amount of ardor, which will make him seek it whenever it holds out a fair promise of a satisfactory result. This notion was held down to the battle of Bull Run. After that memorable engagement, however, it fell into complete disrepute. The idea of subduing the South by hard knocks was scouted as the dream of fanatics and visionaries, and people became possessed with the idea that the proper way to overcome the rebels was, as Sam. Weller would say, to ""circumwent"" them. The ""anaconda plan,"" therefore, came into high favor. The revolted States were to be encircled with ""a wall of steel and fire,"" and, after a while, the revolt was to be extinguished by mere process of compression, or strangulation, with little or no actual combat.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Question of Generalship.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Question of Generalship.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01747c8c-1a56-5f8b-b5b6-374364170884,956,nyt://article/01747c8c-1a56-5f8b-b5b6-374364170884

CON OREM, of Colorado renown, and OWEN GEOGHEGAN of this City, took place at South Amboy, in Middlesex County, N.J. A large party left the City Monday night in the Keyport boat to witness the encounter, also many persons took private conveyances for the same object. The steam-tug John Tracy was chartered by a certain number of individuals, and at 2 o'clock yesterday morning left Jersey City and proceeded toward the fighting ground, reaching it at about 6 o'clock A.M. The boat, however, struck the bar, where she was held fast, and in order to reach land the passengers were obliged to take to a small boat -- the only one on board -- which made several trips back and forth. The people in the vicinity of the spot where the ring was pitched were greatly incensed at the proceedings, and notified the Sheriff of the County, who endeavored to prevent the anticipated fight, but failed in consequence of not having a sufficient number of men to aid him. The ring was pitched at about sunrise, and was considered one of the firmest that has been put up since the recent fighting-season commenced. All the available points for seeing what transpired within the ring were monopolized by the Geoghegan party, and the betting, as a general thing, was decidedly in that individual's favor. The party assembled, with some few exceptions, seemed determined that OREM should not be the victor, no matter how successful he might be in whipping his antagonist. As the appointed hour for the fight approached, the crowd became very noisy and boisterous, and one rowdy even went so far as to fire a barn which contained a considerable quantity of hay.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER PRIZE FIGHT.; Orem and Geoghegan the Contestants Nineteen Rounds Fought in Twenty-three Minutes A Forced Decision in Favor ofGeoghegan Arrests by the Police.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANOTHER PRIZE FIGHT.; Orem and Geoghegan the Contestants Nineteen Rounds Fought in Twenty-three Minutes A Forced Decision in Favor ofGeoghegan Arrests by the Police.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/43b63fa7-4e5a-5889-b3ff-4de1434e7d06,844,nyt://article/43b63fa7-4e5a-5889-b3ff-4de1434e7d06

The damage caused by the monster explosion surprised the Committee, being far greater than they had conceived. They first visited the residence of Mr. T.C. KEYES, at the foot of Seventy-sixth-street. Here the scene presented was quite astonishing, the buildings giving every possible evidence of wreck and ruin. Fences were prostrated and out-buildings more or less demolished. The main damage, however, was to the house occupied by Mr. KEYES' family, and the furniture in it. Not a room in the house escaped the ravages of the terrible concussion. The eaves and coping of the roots and piazzas were ruthlessly torn o[???] leaders were broken up as if they had been but pipe-stems, the sidewalks were cracked more or less throughout, ceiling walls had tumbled down everywhere, and furniture was broken up indiscriminately, doors, blinds and sashes had been torn away from their places, and forcibly thrown against opposite walls and windows, house timbers were wrenched from their strong joints and panes of glass were broken without limit. In short, the building is so torn and racked that it will be impossible to restore it to its former strength. The tremendous concussion played some curious freaks. Mr. and Mrs. KEYES, who were reading in their bedchamber at the time, were hurled across the room, fortunately with only sight bruises. The marble-top of a large parlor table, standing in the centre of a room, was broken in two, while a large vase on the top of it was unbroken; the cornices of rooms were considerably cracked and smashed, while pictures on the walls were not in the least harmed; a piano and the water tank of a bath-room were taken from their places and tumbled over and over, while lamps were taken from mantels and tables to the floor without damage. Lace curtains were torn to shreds, chairs were broken, some pictures were scratched and cracked and others were left untouched by harm; cartridges, inclosed in boxes, were thrown promiscuously into various parts of the house, and it seems a miracle that life itself did not meet with destruction.",5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Damages by the Recent Powder Explosion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Damages by the Recent Powder Explosion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-20T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fc65c13f-7826-5a2a-bb7a-f1fc3457e778,728,nyt://article/fc65c13f-7826-5a2a-bb7a-f1fc3457e778

Soon after their arrival at the latter place, the Court room was crowded to suffocation by the friends and partisans of the prisoners, and great was the excitement among those who, either from interest or curiosity, had congregated in the halls of justice. Sheriff CLARK, of Middlesex County, was present to make complaint that the laws of New-Jersey had been violated by prize-fighters, but neither he nor any other one present could identify the persons who were brought before the Court as the guilty parties. Justice DODGE was therefore under the necessity of discharging them from custody. Sheriff CLARK, however, succeeded in arresting about 30 of those who were present at the fight, and who were unable to leave the State, before that officer obtained the services of the Police of New-Brunswick.

Addressing Col. HAWKINS, Mr. KIRKLAND adverted to the magnitude of the interests involved in the contest, and complimented Col. HAWKINS upon the alacrity he had shown in organizing the noble Ninth regiment that had distinguished itself at Hatteras, Roanoke Island, Camden, Antietam, Fredericksburgh, Suffolk and other minor points of conflict. He assured the gallant Colonel that posterity would regard the officers and soldiers of the present war with the same grateful remembrance that the heroes of the Revolution have from us of this generation. He was certain of the final result of the contest. Our cause could not fail, because it was the cause of civil and religious liberty, of humanity and God. [Applause.] It was a grateful thing, continued the Speaker, for a generous people to do honor to the brave and gallant men who had periled their lives for their country, and nothing could be more grateful to him personally, than to be charged with the duty of presenting to Col. HAWKINS, as one of those brave defenders, a fitting token of the estimation in which his services were held. He would therefore present to the Colonel, in the name of fifty of his fellow-citizens, a sword and its accompaniments, trusting that the recipient might long live to enjoy the honors he had won, and hoping that, should the contest be continued, to hear of him and his glorious Zouave regiment again from other felds of honor and victory.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sword Presentation and Testimonial to Col.

"Trade of its, the Future",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/22/archives/the-future-of-southern-trade.html,"Trade of its, the Future","The notion that the grass would grow in Broadway, if New-York lost the Southern trade, on which the Pro-Slavery partisans used to rely so much in their appeals to Northern baseness and cupidity in old times, has at last been thoroughly disposed of. The hardiest plant in the American fauna has never had less chance of supporting life on Broadway than at this moment. The rush and roar of traffic, the hot haste of thriving trade, were never more unmistakeably manifest than now. There are no more planters at the St. Nicholas or New-York Hotels; the keenest-scented ""runner"" cannot discover a Southern dealer anywhere in the City; HAMBLETON himself might stalk abroad, pencil in hand, and find not a single merchant or huckster to whom his smiles or his frowns would be of the least consequence; and still we live and flourish. Even the dry goods men, who, more than any other class, were ready to endure anything that Southern insolence might have in store for them, sooner than reveal a shred of conscience or of self-respect, have never made so much money as this year. The delusion that twenty millions of the most industrious, ingenious, energetic people in the world, with half a fertile continent to toil on, were dependent on the custom of 300,000 Southern farmers, most of them living in a very rude and simple way, to save them from ruin, has at last been effectually exploded. The North had during the last twenty years many humiliations to undergo, but we doubt if there has been one of them half so mortifying as the general prevalence and great influence which this transparent humbug and deception once enjoyed.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future of Southern Trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future of Southern Trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b6216e2-35cb-5cc2-a517-aac5fe129dbb,1193,nyt://article/5b6216e2-35cb-5cc2-a517-aac5fe129dbb
On Enlistment of Colored Troops,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/22/archives/the-draft-the-enrollment-to-commence-immediately-a-heavy-force.html,On Enlistment of Colored Troops,"The requisite preparations for the commencement of the business of enrolling in the district assigned to Col. ROBERT NUGENT, A.A. Provost-Marshal-General, have been completed by that officer, and as soon as the Government blanks arrive from Washington the work will immediately begin. The blanks are looked for daily, and in all probability it will not be later than next Monday that the people liable to be drafted will be called upon to give their names. The same parties employed by the former Provost-Marshal -- Gen. DRAPER -- have been retained by Col. NUGENT. In addition, a large number of assistants have been appointed, so that as little time as possible may elapse -- say one month -- ere the work shall have been finished. The business consequent upon the enrollment in connection with other business dispatched at the office of the Provost-Marshal will, for the next few weeks, cause arduous labor in that Department. The known ability of Col. NUGENT, however, is a warrant that he is equal to the task, and many of the officers and clerks under his command have already proved their efficiency. As an evidence that the officers connected with the Provost-Marshal's Department are faithful and vigilant it is only necessary to state that, on an average, twenty arrests are made daily. The parties arrested include numerous citizens who have exhibited ample proof that they are either Southern spies or Southern abettors. It seems to have become a ruling passion of many to embark in the contraband trade. Only three days ago a man was arrested for fitting out a schooner with an assorted cargo for some secesh point. It is known that vessels for the rebel South have cleared from this port, but of late the business has become rather precarious, and probably it will nut be long before that class of traders will be completely broken up. In order to meet the exigencies of the time, Col. NUGENT has appointed a force of detectives, whose duty it will be to travel in different portions of the Department of the East and arrest all parties found aiding and abetting the enemy.",1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DRAFT.; The Enrollment to Commence Immediately.

"Our correspondent at Fort Snelling on the Upper Mississippi, furnishes rather a surprising idea of the magnitude of the military operations being carried on under Gen. POPE against certain Indian tribes of the Northwest.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/22/archives/our-lesser-wars.html,,"Our correspondent at Fort Snelling on the Upper Mississippi, furnishes rather a surprising idea of the magnitude of the military operations being carried on under Gen. POPE against certain Indian tribes of the Northwest. Of the ten regiments of Minnesota Volunteers raised for the war, five only are operating against the slaveholding rebels of the South while five are employed against the savage rebels of the farthest North. A military expedition, consisting of three full regiments of infantry, a regiment of mounted rangers, and a battery of artillery, all under the immediate command of that old Indian fighter, Gen. SIBLEY, is about to move from Fort Shelling, to begin war in earnest against the Sioux Indians, who are charged with keeping Minnesota in a condition of disquiet, and the settlers in a state of terror, for some time past. The Sioux have 5,000 warriors encamped near Devil's Lake, in the northwestern part of Minnesota, not far from the British line, and they are under command of the chief LITTLE CROW, whose name will be remembered in connection with the Sioux massacres of last Summer. This is a larger force than that of the whites who have gone out to attack them; but the superior military appliances of the whites will, of course, give them a vast advantage. About two thousand only of the Indian warriors are said to be possessed of muskets, while the majority are armed with bows and arrows and war-clubs. A desperate battle, or series of battles, is expected very soon, unless, as our forces advance, the Sioux retreat to British territory, where it would be impossible for our troops to follow them. They would thus play the part of the insurgent Poles, who lately fled across the frontier into Prussia, where the Czar's soldiers could not pursue them. Should the Sioux adopt this expedient, it would be well, both for them and for us, if, when they get across the lines, they would stay across. For it is a noteworthy and instructive fact, that in all the vast possessions of England in North America, with their tens of thousands of aboriginal Indians, there has hardly been an instance of any difficulty within any of them during the present century.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Lesser Wars.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Lesser Wars.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-22T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da817c9c-e8e7-5cf5-bec7-a38f53b5e872,567,nyt://article/da817c9c-e8e7-5cf5-bec7-a38f53b5e872

After the capture of Jackson, his army, being provided with eight days' rations, he ceased communication with Grand Gulf, on account of the large escorts required for that service. From Jackson, it was understood to be his intention to force his way through to Haines' Bluff, on the Yazoo, and secure the enemy's transports. He held the bridge across the Big Black River with five thousand men, and had destroyed several miles of the Vicksburgh and Jackson Railroad near the latter place. Here information from our side ceases. Rebel dispatches state that our forces evacuated Jackson at 2 o'clock on Friday, the 17th, and proceeded toward Vicksburgh. On Saturday, the 18th, there was a heavy battle near Edwards' Station, on the Vicksburgh Railroad, between Gen. GRANT and the rebels from Vicksburgh, under Gen. PEMBERTON, in which the latter were driven back to their intrenchments -- one account states with the loss of sixteen pieces of artillery. Baker's Creek is stated as the exact locality of the battle. Gen. JOE JOHNSTON, in an official dispatch to the rebel War Department does not attempt to disguise the fact that Gen. PEMBERTON was defeated. This dispatch is dated at a point between Livingston and Brownsville, which would make his location westward of Jackson -- the direction in which he retreated when driven out of that place by Gen. GRANT. JOHNSTON says the battle lasted nine hours, when PEMBERTON was compelled to fall back behind the Big Black. The rebel Gen.

The Poles seem to feel as sanguine in their expectations of aid from France as the Piedmontese did before the Emperor entered on the Italian war. This confidence must be founded on something more solid than vague hope. The question has been put from Paris to the Secret Committee which conducts Polish affairs, whether the insurgents are in a position to maintain themselves for two months more, and the reply has been in the affirmative. It is reported that a manifesto will be issued by that mysterious body which still eludes the grasp of the Russian Police, and organizes its bands from Warsaw, announcing that a loan, to a very large amount secured on the property of the wealthier Poles, is about to be raised, for the purpose of carrying on the war.

And the Great Powers,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/24/archives/poland-and-the-great-powers.html,And the Great Powers,"The rashness of Prussia in committing herself to a close alliance with Russia, and in undertaking, in defiance of the opposition of the Chambers, to make common cause with her against the Poles, is becoming every day more apparent. The answer returned by Russia to the remonstrant notes addressed to her by France and England is pronounced by both countries unsatisfactory, and everybody is now asking himself what next? France is anxious to go further, in conjunction with Austria and England, and promises in this case not to look for any exclusive advantage for herself; but in case she acts alone, she hints that she will expect some compensation for her expenditure of blood and treasure. But then the chances are all against any united action on the part of the three Powers. They will all readily enough unite in protesting, but when it comes to enforcing their protests by deeds, the matter takes quite a different aspect. In England the popular dislike to military enterprises in conjunction with France, has, ever since the Crimean war, been very strong. The alliance on that occasion never worked well, and the English came out of the struggle, leaving all the glory in the hands of the French. Their recollections of that episode in their history have recently been still further embittered by KINGLAKE's history of the war, in spite of the efforts of the Times to bring the work into disrepute. It has unquestionably had a large influence in confirming the impression, already current among a portion of the public, that the British Cabinet was beguiled into undertaking it by the French Emperor, for his own purposes, and that he appropriated, rightfully or wrongfully, every particle of the credit and profit resulting from it; so that there has ever since been a very strong determination current not again to undertake a war jointly with the French. The Chinese expedition took place by force of circumstances, rather than as the result of a settled plan, and, like all the Indian wars, the British public felt little or no responsibility for it, and but a minor degree of interest in it. Moreover, the British force was considerably larger than that contributed by the French, and the ascendency consequently remained in the hands of the former.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Poland and the Great Powers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Poland and the Great Powers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-24T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24a1f90d-6d57-5669-8e7d-732a067891f6,748,nyt://article/24a1f90d-6d57-5669-8e7d-732a067891f6

Earl RUSSELL'S dispatch, dated April 10, instructed Lord NAPIER to protest against the infraction of the treaty stipulations of 1815 by Russia, and expressed the opinion that the insurrection of the Poles was justified by the course of action which Russia had pursued. Prince GORTSCHAKOFF replies in turn to these divisions of the protest; first claiming, in explicit terms, that the treaty stipulations of 1815, in behalf of the Poles, were annulled by their revolt in 1830; and insisting, in the second place, that the continual conspiracies in Poland have brought affairs to their present condition, and that Russia cannot safely make further concessions.

The President has announced, by proclamation, that inchoate citizens, as well as those fully naturalized and those to the manner born, are liable to draft in the forthcoming conscription. The fact was established previously by the simple reading of the statute. There was no ambiguity in the act. The full extent of the exemption, indeed, is therein set forth with a verbal punctiliousness, as well as brevity, which has few precedents in the construction of public laws. No ordinarily well-informed person could have been taken by surprise at the official interpretation put upon the Conscription act.

That every individual, whether native or foreigner, may freely travel or move about within Portugal and the adjacent islands, without a passport or any other similar document.

An application was made to the Common Council of this City for a donation, but failed to pass both Boards, and the Managers are thus left without funds to enable them to receive the many children daily applying for admission.

At Vicksburgh,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/24/archives/gen-grant-at-vicksburgh.html,At Vicksburgh,"Our telegraphic columns this morning contain an official dispatch from Memphis, which the President has furnished to the Press, announcing a great battle in the vicinity of Vicksburgh, and the capture by Gen. GRANT of the outer works of the place, with a large number of prisoners and fifty-seven pieces of artillery. The battle, it is said, was still raging on Wednesday. We are not told when it opened, nor its precise locality; but if we really hold the points mentioned in the dispatch, it must have been close in the rear of the great stronghold. Haines' Bluff, as our readers know, is directly north of Vicksburgh, and has always been considered the key of the position; and ""Big Black River bridge"" is twelve miles in the rear, or east of Vicksburgh, on the railroad. Looking at the bearing of these points, and considering that we command the line of the Big Black below Vicksburgh to its mouth at Grand Gulf, it is difficult to see how the Vicksburgh garrison can escape, unless JOHNSTON's forces succeed in getting in GRANT's flank or rear, and turning the tide of battle against him. It would seem that JOHNSTON's forces, at latest advices, were still somewhere north of Jackson, which we also hold; and as they did not succeed in effecting a junction with PEMBERTON's army at the heavy battle of Saturday, it is not likely that they effected a junction afterward; for, after that victory, GRANT pushed right on after the rebels, captured the bridge, and advanced to the very environs of Vicksburgh.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

The regiment numbers 313 men. The original number was enlisted principally in this City, although two or three of the companies were from Brooklyn and Willamsburgh. The regiment was organized by col. E.C. PRATT, and by him led into action at the first Bull Run battle. Upon the promotion of Col. PRATT to be Brigadier-General, the command of the regiment was given to Col. JONES. During the early part of the Peninsular Campaign it was in Gen. FRANKLYN's brigade, and distinguished itself at the battle of West Point. It was subsequently engaged at the battle of Garnes' Mill and other battles on the Peninsula and before Washington, and more recently made itself conspicuous in the storming of Fredericksburgh Heights by SEDGWICK's division. On their arrival here they were marched to the Park Barracks, where they stacked Arms and remained till about 4 P.M. At that time Co. A. Seventy-first regiment N.Y.N.G., entered the Park for the purpose of escorting the Thirty-first up Broadway. After the parade the men returned to the barracks, and partook of a dinner prepared by Mr. WOOD, of the Astor-house, whose experience in that speciality has secured him an enviable reputation. The following is a list of the field-officers of the regiment: -- Colonel, FRANK JONES; Lieutenant-Colonel, L. Newmann; Major, Robert Daniels, (dead;) Adjutant, Charles C.

This past Winter has seen the successful establishment of German Opera in America, which as an ""institution"" has been in abeyance as long as was the Italian Opera, now so firmly fixed. No systematic and thoroughgoing attempt has heretofore been made to place English Opera upon a plane with habitually recognized public amusements. We have had charming but brief glimpses at its beauties through the skillful instrumentality of Miss PYNE. Miss RICHINGS and Miss ADELAIDE PHILLIP's, but nothing permanent has resulted. At last the same hand which so handsomely guided the German Opera to public favor, has taken hold of English Opera. When we know that Mr. CARL ANSCHUTZ is to be the conductor of the musical elements of the new enterprise, we have at the outset assurance of experience, fidelity and rare skill in the most important position, though perhaps the chief attraction of the whole affair will be the welcome reappearance of Madame FELICITA VESTVALI, to whom we are indebted for the enterprise itself. This lady's reputation for beauty of person and of voice needs no trumpeting. We are glad to see that the first attempt is to be made with GLUCK's celebrated ""Orphee,"" a lyric, comic opera, with which all Europe, and especially all Paris, has been simply wild. The incidents, based on a burlesque rendering of the classic story of the luckless Orpheus hunting after his abducted wife, Eurydice, in the infernal realm of Pluto, are side-splitting if not heart-rending, and the music brilliant and fascinating beyond words.

"It is claimed that the Prize Courts in Boston, in disposing of the steamer Aries and cargo, did it with unparalleled quickness, and the Prize Court of this district is asked to follow the example there set. The truth is, the Prize Court here disposed of the steamer Princess Royal in a shorter time than was consumed in the Boston Prize Court over the Aries and cargo. The Princess Royal was reported to the Court on the 9th of February, and the libel was filed on the same day. On the 11th of February an order for the survey and appraisement of the vessel and cargo was made, and on the 17th appraisement of the vessel was returned. The appraisement of the cargo was returned on the 24th of February, and on the 6th of March the condemnation of the vessel and cargo took place, and on the same day, less than one month from the time of the arrival of the vessel, the steamer was transferred to the Government for $112,000. As the cargo was a very valuable one, there were three sales, and the whole was closed up by the 16th of May, the whole amount realized being $344,000. In the Boston case referred to thirty-eight days elapsed between the time of the vessel's arrival and her condemnation and transfer to the Government, while but twenty-five elapsed between the arrival of the Princess Royal and her condemnation and transfer to the Government. The delays that arise in prize cases are for the most part attributable to the claimants. Time is frequently asked by them to obtain additional proof, and often months elapse before the proof is forthcoming. The delay in forwarding the money to Washington, for distribution, is generally caused by the disputes among the captors. Often the officers and crews of vessels claim a share in the proceeds, which the capturing vessel is not disposed to allow. The rule is, that all vessels in sight, or in signaling distance, at the time of the capture, are entitled to an equal share in the sum realized, and it often becomes a nice question which vessels are in sight or signaling distance. -- Philadelphia Ledger, May 23.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/25/archives/the-boston-and-philadelphia-prize-courts.html,,"It is claimed that the Prize Courts in Boston, in disposing of the steamer Aries and cargo, did it with unparalleled quickness, and the Prize Court of this district is asked to follow the example there set.

For fourteen years the editor, Mr. WELLS, has performed this invaluable service, and the entire series now condenses a greater quantity of sterling matter than any other set of books of equally modest and unassuming pretensions, in the world. There is no English publication that can for a moment stand in comparison with it, for though we believe the idea of the work was originally derived from the London Year Book of Facts, the care and intelligence employed in the preparation of the ""Annual,"" place it at once in a higher class than its predecessor ever aimed to reach. Though the past year has not been distinguished by any one or more discoveries or inventions of surpassing value, yet the active investigations now carrying on in every branch of science and art, offer in their results abundant matter for a record like the present, of great interest and importance. In the first section, ""Mechanics and Useful Arts,"" is given the best summing up we have seen of the actual net gain to science from the English Great International Exhibition of 1862. It is prepared by the Editor from notes taken and material derived during a careful personal inspection and study. Every word of this will repay careful reading. In the same division the article on ""Progress of Improvement in War Implements and Constructions,"" embraces the whole subject of iron-clad ships, rifled cannon, and the other thousand destructive and defensive devices that have taxed the ingenuity of military engineers since LOUIS NAPOLEON and the events of the last two years gave an impetus to the study. In Natural Philosophy, light and heat are the properties or substances that afford the greatest novelties. The splendid discoveries of Prof. KIRCHOFF on the physical condition of the sun and the presence of terrestrial elements in the solar atmosphere are detailed, and his researches on the Solar Spectrum and the spectra of the chemical elements, by which they were arrived at, are fully described. The latest improvements in Photography, celestial and terrestrial, are satisfactorily elucidated, and a careful abstract is given of Prof. TYNDALL's conclusions, drawn from the remarkable facts recently developed tending to show the connection or possible identity of mechanical force and heat. In Chemical Science, ""The manufacture of color products from coal-tar,"" the source of the much admired Mauve and Majenta, and other brilliant hues, is, perhaps, the most interesting article. The editor describes a cylinder of mauve paste, shown by the inventor, Mr. PERKINS, at the Great Exhibition, so small as to be easily carried under one's arm, but which required for its production the tar derived from 2,000 tons of coal. Its value was $4,000, and its ""tinctorial potentiality"" equal to 100 miles of calico. In ""Geology,"" the recent evidence for the antiquity of man, and in ""Zoology,"" his place and distinct position in the animal kingdom claim most attention, while the discovery in the past year of four new planets (asteroids) and four comets, recorded under ""Astronomy,"" shows that our observers of the heavens have been watchful at their posts.

It is based on two assumptions, which are false throughout, though they may doubtless be used to delude a good many of the ignorant or unreflecting. The first is, that it is possible to frame a conscription law which will impose the burden of defending the country on all men equally; and the second is, that a conscription which did not allow the purchase of substitutes would be more fair than one which did. If there be one of these more absurd than the other, it is unquestionably the first. It would be difficult to conceive of any burden imposed by the State on its citizens more unequally distributed than a forced levy of soldiers must always be. The nearest approach to fairness, in a measure of this sort, that it would be possible to make, would consist in calling the whole male adult population into the field, but even this, in spite of its semblance of equality, would inflict vastly greater hardship on some than on others. A levy en masse is, however, neither practicable nor necessary, nor even expedient. A very much smaller force is all that is required, and all that the highest and most lasting interests of the nation authorize the Government to raise. Therefore, a selection has to be made from the whole body, and in making this by the best conceivable process, the inequality in the distribution of the burden becomes greatly aggravated. Drawing lots is the recognized and most satisfactory mode of deciding who shall go and who shall stay at home. There is no better attainable method, but it is absurd to say or to suppose that the results worked out in this way are not gross violations of abstract justice. There is no reason founded on anything higher than expediency why 100,000 men who have had the misfortune to draw 100,000 tickets from a box with certain numbers inscribed on them, should march off to the battle-field, nolentes volentes, leaving the rest of the community quietly at home, with their families and business.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Inequalities of the Conscription.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Inequalities of the Conscription.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-26T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/515bd780-227b-50f3-8aca-1bc7793af988,1171,nyt://article/515bd780-227b-50f3-8aca-1bc7793af988

"A special meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday to listen to a delegation from the Board of Trade of Oswego on the subject of ""A Ship Canal around Niagara Falls.""  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/26/archives/local-intelligence-chamber-of-commerce-a-ship-canal-around-niagara.html,,"A special meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday to listen to a delegation from the Board of Trade of Oswego on the subject of ""A Ship Canal around Niagara Falls."" The meeting was addressed, on behalf of that body, by Hon. DEWITT C. LITTLEJOHN, who commenced by remarking that he would proceed in a conversational way to give his views in relation to the subject before them. A Convention had been called by members of the last Congress -- over 100 in number -- to meet at Chicago to take into consideration the expediency of enlarging the facilities or transportation between the West and the East. In 1836 a survey was made with a view of connecting the Lakes with the Hudson River by means of a ship canal around Niagara Falls. Some three or four plans were submitted, and a large expense was incurred in making surveys. The subject had lain dormant for some time, not because it lacked merit, but in consequence of some few local prejudices. We had now arrived at a point when we must have more avenues of transit from the great producing West to the Atlantic The enlargement of the Erie and Oswego Canal had just been completed, and that line was now worked to its utmost capacity. New-York City, in seeking trade with the West, must take an interest in the means of communication between the two points. While we were projecting avenues we had a powerful rival at the North. The Canadian Government, weak herself, but aided by the Mother Country, was fixing her eyes upon the Western trade. The trade of Montreal had been rapidly increasing for the past five years. Mr. LITTLEJOHN then produced a map, by means of which he traced out the various canals connecting the lakes, and stated that by the present route the West was five hundred miles nearer Montreal than it was to New-York. The strong argument in favor of constructing a ship canal was a commercial one. The vessels that now float on the canals in use are confined to a tonnage of 450. By constructing the contemplated canal, ships of 1,000 or 1,500 tonnage would be enabled to land their cargoes on Lake Ontario. The distance from Oswego to Troy would be 172 miles by canal. The construction of a canal around the Falls would enable a ship of 1,000 tons burden to bring her cargo to within 22 miles of tide-water on the Hudson. Why had not this canal been built before? Because necessity had not demanded it. The time had come for action. The projected improvements from Canada and the laws of trade demand that the great State of New-York should examine this whole question most carefully. We represented the interest of the Metropolis of this continent, We had moved on with rapid strides, and the time was not far distant when we would dictate commercial laws to London. It was for the interest of New-York to take hold of the project he presented, and to open up an avenue for her own use, now and forever. It was true the enlargement of the Oswego and Erie Canals had done much good, but we must have a way to get our vessels into Lake Ontario. In the unfortunate event of a war with England, we could improvise our large canal-boats into gunboats, and also have an avenue for getting other war vessels into the lakes. As a military necessity, it was evident that the ship canal should be constructed. It was the intention or the delegation to present the views already given to the Chicago Convention. It was the true interest of the great commercial emporium of this nation to open up an avenue, so that the products of the West might be brought to the nearest point of tide-water, wherever that might be.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

"The world of art is not always faithless to its first loves. They who wield the palette and brush have recently gone back to the examples of medieval times in their search for simplicity and truth. Whether the pre-Raphaelites have succeeded is a question which we do not propose to discuss. In robbing the ancients we are governed more by wha we can quickly lay our hands on than by what is most valuable. Following the example of painting, the sister art of music -- after toying dully with the ""future"" -- has also directed her attention to the past. GLUCK, who has been dead and buried for the greater part of a century, has been ""revived."" The good people of Paris brought him from his grave, and galvanised him into life, and put him on his musical pins once more, and gave him ""a run"" in the gay Metropolis. Revived, rescusitated and restored in this manner, the old gentleman is in fine fig for a new career. Indeed, the proof of this is found in the fact that he has already trotted across the Atlantic to America. Mlle. VESTVALI, a lady who will be remembered as a favorite contralto during the seasons of GRISI and MARIO, signalized her rentree upon the American stage last night, by the production of the Maestro's ""Orpheus."" The version performed was nearly the same as that recently played with so much success in the French capital. It differs from the ordinary one in being denuded of certain modern excresences and inversions, and in following strictly the poem as originally written, and, historically considered, much of the interest of the revival lies in this fact, for GLUCK was a reformer who, with real genius, attempted to do a hundred years ago, what the ""School of the Future"" pretends to do now. He has himself written very explicitly on the subject of Italian opera, and his theory corresponds singularly with the wordy doctrine of the modern non-melodists. It is -- broadly stated -- that music should be subservient to poetry; that melody, except as a temporary vehicle of expression, is not the sole end and aim of composition, and that ordinary recitative, where a voluble singer gallons through a lengthy speech to a single chord, is nonsensical and childish. The converse of this is that a man may use every kind of elaboration, provided he does not stop the action of the piece by the superfluous introduction of melodies that are intended only for the popular ear. It is difficult now to estimate the extent of GLUCK's influence on art. It is conceded that he imparted largeness to the prevalent Italian style, and gave to the scena a simple intensity and an earnestness that were unknown until then. What was good in his theory was long ago absorbed into the ordinary practice of opera writing; what was bad is not likely to be accepted by the present or any other revival. The general public, however, in listening to ""Orpheus,"" will be struck with the fact that it is melody alone that now imparts zest to the work; melody that is old-fashioned, to be sure, but still, simple, graceful and tender. M. BERLIOZ, the eminent critic, regards it as the best kind of melody the world has ever seen, or is ever likely to enjoy, but on this subject M.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/26/archives/gen-grant-and-his-splendid-success-at-vicksburgh.html,,"The track of this war is strewed with faded and with ruined military reputations. As we look back to the first year of the war, we are absolutely amazed to find how few who then stood out as Generals of mark have retained their place in the public regard. Of course we leave those who have lost their lives -- such as LYON, SMITH, KEARNEY, MITCHEL, RENO, STEVENS and SUMNER -- out of the question. They died illustrious, but whether they would have kept that lustre, had they lived, no one can say. Aside from these, we think it would be rather difficult to name more than five or six of all the early Major-Generals whose military career has justified the expectations of the people. Their names have all suffered more or less, some from one cause, some from another; MCDOWELL's from a humiliating defeat, for which he was not at all responsible, STONE's for a disastrous miscalculation, PHELPS' for a foolish proclamation, BENHAM's for a proneness to strong drink, MCCLELLAN's for ""pedantic slowness,"" FITZ-JOHN PORTER's for jealousy and treachery, FREMONT's for deserting his post because of personal feeling, MILES' for drunkenness and suspected treason, BUELL's for lack of earnestness and energy, POPE's for falsehood and bombastic vaporing, SIGEL's for unjust treatment of a fellow-General. BURNSIDE's for self-distrust, HOOKER's for unfulfilled promises, CURTIS' for mercenary dealing in cotton, &c., &c. This loss of former prestige probably has not been in all cases fully deserved, but it is none the less an undeniable fact. Of the very few who have escaped it, BANKS, ROSECRANS and GRANT are the chief, and of these, the last named is the one most notable instance.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

Incendiary Letter on Vallandigham's Arrest,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/27/archives/ventilating-revolution.html,Incendiary Letter on Vallandigham's Arrest,"Gov. SEYMOUR's incendiary letter to the Vallandigham meeting is thickly posted through all the viler parts of the City. There plainly is a systematic attempt to stir up against the Government all the bad elements of our community, and to prepare the way for the practical application of the Governor's flagitious sentiments. With all of FERNANDO WOOD's characteristic shrewdness, it is at once appreciated what a power for mischief lies wrapped up in those few studied sentences. Its nicely proportioned exaggeration of statement, counterfeit alarm, and affected indignation, were adapted, with consummate art, to fire the passions of the unthinking, and to put them in the mood of adopting and acting upon the final suggestions that the war against the Richmond Government be ended, and war against the Washington Government begun. The official odor, too, of the proclamation, was duly rated. What came from the hands of HORATIO SEYMOUR, as a private citizen, was of little account. What comes from him as the occupant of the Executive Chair of the State of New-York, must be, to the undiscriminating, of great account. Whatever it may be, it strikes their vision as a vermilion edict. They associate authority with it; and, if its language is in the line of their old party prejudices, they are almost sure to accept it implicitly, and shape their action accordingly. It was a clever thought in the rebel allies to placard that missive. It is worth to them all their covert wire-pulling, and all their platform rant, a thousand times over.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Ventilating Revolution.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Ventilating Revolution.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-27T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c159c0cd-cb43-5650-afa9-53e96a4613a5,896,nyt://article/c159c0cd-cb43-5650-afa9-53e96a4613a5

Some of the correspondents infer that the remarkable silence of the rebel newspapers of late is owing to the fact that they have intelligence of a great disaster, which they are not permitted to divulge. But it can hardly be believed that if GRANT had captured Vicksburgh by Saturday or Sunday last, that the Richmond papers of Monday would have contained articles showing that the place was impregnable. We give an article from the Richmond Examiner of Monday. It considers it certain that two assaults had been made on the land defences of Vicksburgh, both of which were repulsed; and adds that nothing could excuse or explain a want of success on the part of the defence. It gives a vivid picture of the position and strength of the rebel stronghold by saying that Vicksburgh is a mountain situated in a bend of the river -- that on all sides of it are high bluffs, crowned with batteries -- that an attack can nowhere be made with a force equal to the garrison -- that on no side can more than eight thousand men be deployed in line for assault, and that the character of the ground renders regular approaches difficult. The Examiner claims that PEMBERTON's army is the most important Army of the Confederacy; and the value of the position is evidently fully appreciated by the rebels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Vicksburgh News.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Vicksburgh News.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-28T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21091e2c-42f5-5af7-bdcf-d2c64311eb45,401,nyt://article/21091e2c-42f5-5af7-bdcf-d2c64311eb45

There is not a more thorough hater of Slavery in the land than he; not a man who has spent more money or more effort for the propagation of Abolition principles. His name has not only been prominently connected but completely identified with the Anti-Slavery movement from its earliest days. And yet in this crisis, he plants himself squarely on this high mark of unconditional Unionism. When Pro-Slavery men, of the Free States and the Border States, with equally rooted convictions in favor of the institution, come up to this same mark, and live up to it, as GERRIT SMITH proposes to do -- when they will say that Slavery shall sooner die the death than the Union, and shape their practical action accordingly -- then, and not until then, will they, too, fulfill their duty to their country.

"A SINGULAR CAUSE OF DEATH. -- Coroner FARREL, of Jersey City, concluded an inquest at 1 o'clock yesterday morning, upon the body of a child 4 years of age, son of Mrs. WOOLEY, residing corner of Warren and Bergen streets, who died on Sunday under circumstances which led to the supposition that his death was caused by poison. It appears that a little over four weeks since the child was taken ill, and medical aid was called in. The physician found that the child had the measles, and prescribed a simple remedy, and cautioned the mother to be careful and not allow him to take cold. A few days after the physician called again, and found that the child was getting well, and his services not being required further, he did not call again. On the day following the mother discovered that the upper part of the child's mouth was inflamed, and applied borax and honey and other remedies, but the child's mouth continued getting worse, and several of the upper teeth dropped out. After the lapse of some eight days, another physician was called, and attended the patient. At that time the gum had sloughed off from the upper jaw; a large portion of the bone was bare, and the breath was feted. The patient continued getting worse, and finally died on Sunday. The mother and some of the friends supposed that the medicine first administered contained poison, put up by mistake. The medical evidence went to show that while the child was sick with the measles, it took cold and its mouth became salivated, and the neglect, for several days, of proper medical attendance caused the disease to assume the form of gangrene, and a verdict to that effect was rendered.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/28/archives/newjersey.html,,"A SINGULAR CAUSE OF DEATH. -- Coroner FARREL, of Jersey City, concluded an inquest at 1 o'clock yesterday morning, upon the body of a child 4 years of age, son of Mrs. WOOLEY, residing corner of Warren and Bergen streets, who died on Sunday under circumstances which led to the supposition that his death was caused by poison.

Copperhead Curses Coming Home to Roost,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/29/archives/curses-coming-home-to-roost.html,Copperhead Curses Coming Home to Roost,"Considering the length of time which Copperhead politicians managed to look on, if not with satisfaction, at least with contentment and in silence, at the practical suspension of the habeas corpus throughout the entire South before this war broke out; considering the placid approval or indulgence with which they witnessed, for nearly forty years, the nullification by every one of the Slave States of that essential and vital clause of the Constitution which guarantees to every citizen of the United States freedom of speech and trial by jury all over the Union; considering the eagerness with which they supported those provisions of the Fugitive Slave act which shamefully set aside the time-honored presumption of the common law, that every man is free till the contrary is proved, and imposed on the people of the Northern States the humiliation of seeing persons who might be their fellow-citizens carried into life-long bondage on the dictum, not even of a Court, but of a Commissioner -- we cannot, for the life of us, much as we value forms, and much as we respect honest human lamentations, help taking a little dismal pleasure in the sight of their present griefs. When we remember that when Slavery daily and hourly either trampled our laws under foot or wrested them for the confusion or destruction of liberty, and for the deification of brute force, these men deprecated all protest and all indignation, we have no bowels of compassion for them, in their present affliction. Seeing how much violence and illegality they could endure for the benefit of Slavery, we know that they can endure very much more than they have yet encountered for the benefit of freedom. They are shocked by Judge LEAVITT's refusal of a habeas corpus to VALLANDIGHAM -- they, who thought it no shame that a Washington Judge should simply fine BROOKS $300 for beating in the skull of a United States Senator in the Senate Chamber itself. They are horrified that a man may not in the North say his say in favor of peace -- they who applauded for long years the system which forbade any man to say, in two-thirds of the Southern States, one word against Slavery, and who voted with the men who upheld this system as the highest political good. When Northern men, or non-slaveholders, were tarred and feathered and robbed every month, not by the sentence even of courts-martial, but by the wild will of ruffianly mobs, the voices that are now so eloquent on behalf of law and order, did nothing but shout approval. Not one note of protest or of warning ever came from them; not one syllable did they ever utter, to admonish the nation of the demoralization which familiarity with such unchecked wickedness and illegality was sure in the long run to work. It is awful, now, forsooth, that men may not preach against war, under the protection of the Constitution; but it was simple and natural, that under that same Constitution no man dared say a word against either the morality or economy of treating the whole laboring population of one-half the Union as beasts of the field.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Curses Coming Home to Roost.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Curses Coming Home to Roost.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/37c1a4d4-dbb8-5f13-8aa5-704bb87293c1,1004,nyt://article/37c1a4d4-dbb8-5f13-8aa5-704bb87293c1

National Convention at Utica,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/29/archives/a-waste-of-labor.html,National Convention at Utica,"-- Our neighbor, the Herald, wastes a great deal of space and labor in canvassing the relative success of the two Conventions which met at Utica on Tuesday and Wednesday, in what it assumes to be their objects. The first seeks to make Mr. CHASE President, and the other aims to achieve the same feat for Mr. SEWARD, according to the Herald. Being just now especially devoted to the renomination and reelection of Mr. LINCOLN, that journal naturally opposes both. It can take comfort. Its candidate is in no danger from either of the others, so far as the action of the Utica Conventions are concerned. Both those bodies, according to the best of our knowledge and belief, utterly ignored the claims of the distinguished statesmen named, and, indeed, of everybody else to the Presidency. We did not see nor hear of a single man, in either meeting, who would express himself in favor of CHASE, SEWARD, LINCOLN or anybody else for President. There seemed to be a very general conviction that unless we were to have a country, it would be a matter of very little consequence who should be President; and that the first thing in order was, therefore, to crush the rebellion and restore the Union. When that has been accomplished, we can begin to talk about Presidential candidates.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A WASTE OF LABOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A WASTE OF LABOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4f901280-b46a-52b5-b78e-fe4f7b516ef8,222,nyt://article/4f901280-b46a-52b5-b78e-fe4f7b516ef8

"Street Cleaning, City Inspector Delavan's Letter",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/29/archives/the-streets.html,"Street Cleaning, City Inspector Delavan's Letter","-- The contractor, or sub-contractor, for cleaning the streets of this City, having completely failed in his duty, the City Inspector took the job in hand a fortnight ago, in compliance with a resolution of the Commissioners of Health, directing him to do so. The work was commenced with a force of from seven to eight hundred men, including cartmen; and it is claimed that, in a fortnight, fifty thousand loads of stuff, including ashes and garbage, have been removed from the streets. Having accomplished thus much, the City Inspector now reports that ""the nuisance arising from filthy streets no longer exists."" We are very grateful to the City Inspector for what he has done, and cheerfully acknowledge that it is not a little; but we suspect it would not be very hard work to get another ""fifty thousand loads of stuff"" from the streets of New-York. Many of the densely populated streets running north from Canal-street are still in a shocking condition, not to mention many others in other sections of the City. Now that the City Inspector has been authorized to take the work in hand, we hope he will have it properly done, as it is impossible to deceive the people in this matter. The evidence daily presented to four, at least, out of five of their senses, forbids deception. It would be well for the City Inspector to actually inspect the City, as his title implies he will do, and not merely be satisfied with the reports of subordinates. It was bad enough to have dirty streets before, and be forced to pay heavily for their being kept dirty; but under our present duplicated and complicated system, or want of system, of keeping them clean, we ought at least to have perfect results, as we will certainly be taxed for them. The City Government, we suppose, will not scruple to pay for work actually accomplished by the City Inspector, though we do not see that it could be called upon to pay the other parties for work not accomplished.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE STREETS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE STREETS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/81161622-64f4-5982-98cd-05f3f3a17f8e,373,nyt://article/81161622-64f4-5982-98cd-05f3f3a17f8e

""Historicus,"" who has lately published such excellent letters on international questions, has written one upon this subject. He cites the ancient claim that a neutral convoy privileged the vessels under its charge from search and capture, which England resisted, and destroyed the Danish fleet in resisting; and he shows very clearly and forcibly that the claim of inviolability set up for the Peterhoff's mails because they bore the official seal is the same claim, but in a stronger form. For if the convoy of a national ship-of-war is no guarantee of the good faith of a vessel, how much less is the mere presence of an official seal a guarantee of the contents of a mail-bag? And he goes on to show, what is obvious to any one who has given the subject a moment's thought, that the instant the rule is established that a mail-bag is inviolable, that moment all the true papers connected with a vessel and her cargo are sure to be deposited there, leaving only false and simulated ones for the inspection of belligerent vessels.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Peterhoff Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Peterhoff Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-29T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bcd1bedf-6831-553e-bc0f-fe31ae30ec91,630,nyt://article/bcd1bedf-6831-553e-bc0f-fe31ae30ec91

It was very large, very enthusiastic, and distinguished by the entire absence of party feeling and the paramount determination to sustain the Government in its efforts to quell the rebellion and preserve the Union. A large portion of those in attendance were Democrats, brought thither probably, at least in part, by the expectation of hearing Mr. BRADY or Mr. VAN BUREN, whose participation had been promised: -- but in no instance was the slightest inclination evinced to give party feeling any prominence, or to make party interest the leading motive of effort and of action. Hon. HENRY A. FOSTER, who presided, has always been a Democrat, but, like Judge DENIO and others who sent letters to the meeting, declared that in such a crisis he knew no party and would suffer no political prejudices or preferences to interfere with the duty which he owed his country as a citizen and a patriot. The resolutions, which were adopted unanimously and with the most hearty applause, expressed the same sentiments and evinced the same purpose. They were explicit in repudiating all party interests, in postponing all political differences until the supremacy of the Constitution is reestablished, in pledging full and complete obedience to all laws so long as they remain upon the statute book, appealing for the redress of wrongs and the establishment of political preferences to the judicial tribunals and to the ballot-box, and in repelling all thought of any peace which shall involve the disruption of the Union or the recognition of the right of secession.

"Whipple, Gen. A. W.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/30/archives/the-late-gen-whipple.html,"Whipple, Gen. A. W.","Gen. A.W. WHIPPLE, who was mortally wounded at the battle of Chancellorsville, was born in Massachusetts, entered the United States Military Academy in 1837, and was graduated from that institution in 1841. As a cadet he gave promise of that distinction which he afterwards won in so many different spheres of duty. Having graduated with high honor in a class including such men as Gens. TOWN, WRIGHT, LYON, GARESCHE, BRANNAN, HAMILTON, REYNOLDS, BUELL and RICHARDSON, he was promoted to the corps of Topographical Engineers, and at once entered upon the duties of his profession. For two or three years he served in various unimportant capacities, until, in 1844, he was selected by the the Commission for establishing the Northeastern Boundary as assistant to Major (now Colonel) J.D. GRAHAM, and in the capacity of assistant astronomer he established a reputation for scientific ability that afterwards led to his promotion to still higher positions. After the close of the Mexican war he was intrusted with the location of the boundary line between California and Sonora, in which duty he remained till the close of the war. On the completion of the Southwestern boundary he was called to take charge of an exploration for the location of a route for the Pacific Railroad. He had charge of the line from Fort Gibson, in Arkansas, along the 35th parallel to San Diego, in California. The zeal and fidelity with which he discharged this duty is shown in his report, published in the third and succeeding volumes of the thirteen volume report to Congress. His report of this survey, was extensively circulated, not only in America, but also in Europe, where it fell into the hands of HUMBOLDT. This report, from its ability, attracted the attention of the illustrious savan, and gave rise to a scientific correspondence which was continued during the life of the world's most eminent scientist. At the breaking out of the present rebellion, Gen. WHIPPLE was serving as a Captain of Topographical Engineers on the upper lakes, and he at once applied for service in the field. He was assigned to duty as a Major on the Staff of Gen. MCDOWELL. In this capacity he served at the first battle of Bull Run, and, if we may credit the reports of those who were present, he established for himself a reputation for coolness, intrepidity and daring second to that of none who were engaged in that memorable conflict. During the battle he was ever in the thickest of the fight, unmindful of the bullets that were failing like hail around him, and in the retreat he passed the entire night in the saddle, rallying the broken masses, and contributing in no small degree to the safety of those who were obliged to share in the disgrace of that hurried retreat. For his gallantry on this occasion he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General of Volunteers. During the Summer of 1862 he commanded at Arlington, but in the Fall of that year he asked to be assigned to a command in the field. He was in command of a brigade in SICKLES' division at the time of the late advance under Gen. HOOKER, and, as is well known, he was mortally wounded whilst in the act of penning an order. In his death, which took place on the 7th of May, Science was called to mourn one of its most distinguished votaries, and our country one of its ablest Generals.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Late Gen.

"Sons of Rhode Island, First Anniversary of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/30/archives/the-sons-of-rhode-island-the-first-anniversary-of-the-society-an.html,"Sons of Rhode Island, First Anniversary of the","The Sons of Rhode Island, residents of this City, held their first anniversary last evening at the rooms of the Historical Society, corner of Tenthstreet and Second-avenue. The Chairman on the occasion was Mr. JOHN G. WILLIAMS, the Vice-President of the Society. Conspicuous on the platform was the elegant banner of the Association, bearing on its folds the coat-of-arms and motto of the State of Rhode Island. After a few remarks by the Chairman, announcing the programme for the evening, he introduced to the audience Rev. Dr. FRANCIS VINTON, who proceeded to deliver an address on the history of his native State. Rhode Island, he said, although the smallest State in the Union, was the cradle of civilization of the nineteenth century. The foundations of free institutions in that State had been maintained, and spread over the whole country. Its freedom was asserted by ROGER WILLIAMS. When, in the seventeenth century, all Europe was convulsed with revolutions, it was the event of modifying institutions, while in this country new institutions were to be erected. The civilization of the nineteenth century owed to the experiments of Rhode Island men the familiar blessings of liberty and freedom of thought which we prize as our birthright. In reviewing the early history of the State, the speaker remarked that its old Norman name was Vineland. He next spoke of the old mill in Newport, built in the style of the eleventh century, and cited authority to prove that the structure could not have been of later date than the twelfth century. As other relics of antiquity, there were discovered in the excavations made for the improvements of the Fall River and Old Colony Railroad, numerous skulls, with chains of silver and wampum and coins bearing date of LOUIS XIV. These antiquities had been made the subject of a lecture before the Historical Society of this City. The lecturer next alluded to Mount Hope as the country seat of King PHILIP, and pictured in glowing terms the valor of that Indian chieftain, and his intercourse with the early white settlers, not omitting the trials and sufferings he endured, and finally the circumstances attending his death. There had been four eras in the State of Rhode Island -- the settlement, the charter, the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and the adoption of the State Constitution. The first two eras he would combine. With reference to the charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation, it was the first written Constitution in the world, and had survived all the attempts of demagogues to supersede it. The principles of free democracy which it embodies were planted there by ROGER WILLIAMS. The men who govern the State own the State. Religion is not interfered with, and that was one thing which conduced to the prosperity of its people. In the language of our honored countryman -- GEORGE BANCROFT, whom he saw before him -- ""Nowhere in the world have life, liberty and property been safer than in Rhode Island."" In alluding to the men who had emblazoned the banner of the State with their exploits and pervaded the nation with their heroism, the orator cited the name of JOHN WHIPPLE as the first man to shed blood in the war with England, and discharge the first broadside into Her Majesty's navy. The navy of the United States was nurtured in Rhode Island, as is attested by the act of HOPKINS, who trained JOHN PAUL JONES to sweep the seas. That State gave New-York her first Mayor. The name of Bishop BERKELY was next mentioned, and his career dwelt upon. In treating of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States, and the subdivisions under the heading of that era, the lecturer stated he had seen an article in an old Newport Mercury, in which the writer predicted that at some future day New-York would rival the commerce of Newport. Dr. VINTON then spoke of the tenacity of the people of his native State to State sovereignty, and produced a copy -- one of the original 300 -- of the Constitution of the United States, dated May 29, 1790, having attached twenty-one amendments as the only conditions on which the State would consent to enter the Union. In mentioning the names of THOMAS SLATER, GILBERT STEWART, JOHN BROWN, WHEATON and OLIVER HAZARD PERRY as among the eminent men which the State had produced, the speaker could not help referring, although a brother, to JOHN ROGERS VINTON, who fell at the battle of Vera Cruz, while gallantly leading forward his column, and of whom Gen. SCOTT said, that had he lived he would have led armies with heroic valor and skill. The fourth era was next dwelt upon, and with it the attempted insurrection of DORR and his followers. Dr. VINTON closed his address with a beautiful peroration, which, together with his preceding efforts, elicited the unbounded applause of his hearers.",8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SONS OF RHODE ISLAND.; The First Anniversary of the Society An Address by Rev.

On Thursday evening the students in the ""School of Design for Women"" invited their willing friends to come and examine how female genius and talent was able to develop itself under the fostering instruction of capable teachers, and the flag festooned rooms, ablaze with light, were pleasantly full of an assembly as appreciative and cultured as is ever apt to be drawn together. There is a wide-felt interest in this ""School of Design for Women."" Many years since it was founded by a number of benevolent ladies, who felt that among the poorer classes of the City there must be females possessing innate artistic talent that only needed opportunity to make itself apparent. The school was established, therefore, with competent teachers, to gratuitously instruct any such persons, and many a poor girl who now lives in happy competence as a teacher of drawing, or as a painter, engraver, designer or modeler, blesses the day that her talent for either one of these branches of art found a field in this establishment for its cultivation. When the Cooper Institute was opened the managers of the ""School of Design"" saw that it was for the best interests of their enterprise that it should be absorbed into Mr. COOPER's praise worthy project. For the past four years, therefore, its sphere of usefulness has been much extended and its good results are constantly augmenting. The roll this year presents the names of about 200 pupils. These young ladies are under the general direction of such a competent artist as Mrs. FIELD, who is ably assisted by Messrs. GRAY, WHITTREDGE and FARR[???] as teachers of drawing and painting, and Mr. O'BRIEN as instructor of engraving.",2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Art at the Cooper Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Art at the Cooper Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-05-30T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b17581d3-6068-5112-ac48-f2e132aed1f0,974,nyt://article/b17581d3-6068-5112-ac48-f2e132aed1f0

Republican has of late been exploiting the theory that the reason the Army of the Potomac was defeated at Chancellorsville, and the reason it has been defeated in so many campaigns, is that the soldiers do not fight as well as the rebels. It has recently been backed up in its position by the opinion of a Massachusetts officer who was taken prisoner at Chancellorsville, carried to Richmond, and has recently been exchanged. It is rather a curious theory certainly to preach in New-England; after what we have seen and heard of the valor and endurance of the troops from that section. But as this officer suffered himself to be taken prisoner by the rebels instead of fighting to the death, it is interesting to hear what he says for and against those of his kidney.

"Temple, Hon. Wm., of Delaware; Jones, Col. J. Richter",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/31/archives/obituary.html,"Temple, Hon. Wm., of Delaware; Jones, Col. J. Richter","-- Col. J. Richter Jones, of the Fifty-eighth regiment Pennsylvania volunteers, who was killed near Newborn, was a son of the late Rev. Horatio Gates Jones, D.D., of Roxborough, Philadelphia County, Penn., and was born in the year 1804. He received his academical education at the German-town Academy, and graduated with high honors at the University of Pennsylvania in the year 1821, in the same class with Hon. John Cadwalader, Antony Caussat and Robert M. Barr. Having studied law, he was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar on Nov. 17, 1827, and continued to practice until the year 1836, when he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas for the County of Philadelphia, and held that office until his term expired by limitation under the new Constitution in 1847. When the rebellion broke out Col. Jones took high ground in support of the Government, maintaining that the preservation of the Union was worth all the blood and treasure that could be expended. He early offered his services to the War Department, and in July, 1861, received authority to raise a regiment, which by great exertion he succeeded in doing. He was commissioned as Colonel of the Fifty-eighth regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, in August, 1861, and located his camp in Roxborough, where it remained until January, 1862. On the 8th of March, 1862, he left Philadelphia with his regiment for Fortress Monroe, and was in the advance when the attack was made on Norfolk, and was among the first to enter that city. He remained at Portsmouth, Va., until October, 1861, when he was sent to Suffolk, where he performed some bold movements on the Blackwater. Lo[???]ding for more active service, he was transferred to the Department of North Carolina, under Gen. FOSTER, and reached Newbern in January, 1863, and his regiment was marched to the outposts, about eight miles from Newbern, which position it has occupied ever since.",3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3f9fc011-c395-5b69-9ff8-950a1bb4d7cf,621,nyt://article/3f9fc011-c395-5b69-9ff8-950a1bb4d7cf

"-- A pecular case of conjugal infidelity has lately transpired in this city, and is causing so much talk in the streets among those who love to dwell upon such matters, that no harm can result from a reference to the affair in print A week ago the wife of an enterprising young man, engaged in the manufacturing and mercantile business on Exchange-street, suddenly left her husband and an infant, and went westward -- just where does not yet appear. She was accompanied as far as Batavia by a young man, who returned to the city immediately, it is possible that she may be residing in that village or vicinity. What makes this case peculiar, and, we may say, peculiarly aggravating, is the fact that the deserted husband purchased, some time since, the house and lot where he resided, and had it conveyed to his wife, that she and her children might enjoy it in any emergency which might deprive him of his property. As a mark of gratitude to the confiding husband who thus made provision for his family, the wife lately conveyed this homestead to another party without the knowledge or consent of her husband, and after she bad departed he found that she had taken with her the proceeds of the sale or had squandered them here.

"RAILROAD POLICE. -- The Legislature of this State, at its last session, passed an act empowering the Governor to appoint policemen on railways, on the application of the proper officers of the respective Companies. The salaries and other expenses are to be paid by those parties who make the application. The bill was prepared by Mr. HUGH MASTERSON, a detective on the New-York and Erie Railroad, and the passage of the law was mainly due to his exertions.

The Cabinet and the Lower Chamber,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/05/31/archives/the-prussian-cabinet-and-the-lower-chamber.html,The Cabinet and the Lower Chamber,"Never, during the height of his power, did STRAFFORD dare to treat with such insolence the Commons of England as M. VON BISMARK and his colleagues show toward the Prussian Deputies. The Government are evidently bent on provoking an outburst on the part of the Lower Chamber, and if they fail to do so, the fault will not be theirs. Hardly a question has of late been brought forward in that assembly on which one or other of the Ministers has not heaped insult on the popular Deputies. When the motion of M. TWESTEN, touching Schleswig-Holstein, was under discussion, M. VON BISMARK told the House that if the Government thought proper to go to war with Denmark, it would do so whether the members of that body approved of the act or not, although constitutionally the said Government could raise neither a thaler nor a soldier for any such purpose, without the consent of the Chambers. This was a tolerably audacious expression of contempt for the Deputies, but the Minister-President had not yet given full vent to his insolence, and at a subsequent period of the day, the Deputies had to endure another slight at his hands. VON BISMARK's second breach of policy and good manners was occasioned thus: It is customary for some at least of the Ministers to be present during every important debate. All of them, however, chancing to be absent at the time referred to, Dr. VIRCHOW proposed that the Chamber should in consequence adjourn. Whereon the Minister-President suddenly reentered from an adjoining apartment, and assured honorable members that the debate might continue, as he could hear outside every syllable uttered there. The sang froid of the Premier roused the ire of one of the Deputies, who remarked that such conduct was highly disrespectful to the House, which had assembled not to [???] thus trifled with, but to transact the national business. This reproof, however, did not disconcert his Excellency in the least, and he replied that he cared not what the Deputy thought of his conduct or language, that he thanked Heaven the gentlemen were blessed with such strong voices, since he could at once listen to their eloquent strains, and engage in official duties which would not brook delay. The Minister, in the absence of his colleagues, was bound to attend during the sitting of the Chamber, and his withdrawal before the close of this debate was an insult to the Deputies; but it was not the act itself, so much as the insolence of his deportment and his bantering tone, while justifying it, that provoked their indignation.",4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Prussian Cabinet and the Lower Chamber.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Prussian Cabinet and the Lower Chamber.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-05-31T05:00:00+0000,article,None,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3d2a94a-3a6f-50af-9251-95265f5cc267,939,nyt://article/c3d2a94a-3a6f-50af-9251-95265f5cc267

Thither they went to arrest him, and they made the arrest; but before they had passed out of the saloon, a party of roughs fell upon them and rescued their prisoner, without whom they were compelled to retire and report to their superior officer their inability to complete the arrest; likewise, that the crowd that stood at the bar boisterously threatened them, and swore that no United States officer should arrest a deserter there, nor should any enrolling officer record a name in that house. On Friday they awaited instructions, and yesterday afternoon they were sent to the saloon under orders to arrest any deserter that they might find.

Missionary societies, foreign and domestic, Bible societies, tract societies, church organizations for numberless local objects, sectarian and secular, have found their incomes greatly reduced since the beginning of the rebellion. The ""sittings"" in numerous places of worship have fallen off; in hundreds of instances, especially in the Western rural districts, churches and meeting-houses have been closed; the ""sheep"" have wandered off to the war, and the ""shepherds,"" having nothing left to tend, have followed them, seeking position and support in the army as chaplains.
