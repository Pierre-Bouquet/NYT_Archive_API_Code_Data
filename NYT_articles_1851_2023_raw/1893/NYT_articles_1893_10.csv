The Australians went in for rapid scoring, and the result shows they got what they were after.",https://www.nytimes.com/1893/10/18/archives/canadians-badly-beaten-the-australian-cricketers-win-at-toronto-by.html,,,,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CANADIANS BADLY BEATEN.; The Australian Cricketers Win at Toronto by 70 Runs and an Inning.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CANADIANS BADLY BEATEN.; The Australian Cricketers Win at Toronto by 70 Runs and an Inning.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cricket', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1893-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a64fca8-d9c6-53fe-8681-1c51a437db16,0,nyt://article/4a64fca8-d9c6-53fe-8681-1c51a437db16,
