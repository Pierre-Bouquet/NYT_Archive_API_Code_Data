The Condition of Affairs at,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/01/archives/the-operations-in-charleston-harbor-the-singular-aspect-of-affairs.html,The Condition of Affairs at,"The operations against Charleston leave us who are distant from the scene in a quandary which, while tantalizing, does not fail to be a little entertaining. We have very great faith in the skill, energy and resources of Gen. GILLMORE, and doubt not that he sees rifts of light through the clouds which are opaque to us. But we do not see what is to come next. Sumter lies a mass of ruins. Every gun in it is dismounted, and the erstwhile formidable fort is prostrate and helpless for a single offensive effort. It is now ten days since the Chief of Artillery reported ""the destruction of the fort so far complete that it is to-day of no avail in the defence of the harbor of Charleston,"" and respectfully submitted his opinion that ""a continuance of our fire is no longer necessary, as giving us no ends adequate for the consumption of our resources."" And yet it has been so far a perfectly barren victory. We have not taken Sumter: our flag has not waved for a moment over the ruins which we have made. On the contrary, the symbol of the rebellion still flouts defiance there. The ruins we have made are the proof of our power; the rebel flag planted on those ruins is the proof of the limitations to our power and the challenge to what remains yet to be done. On the whole, it is a very curious pass to which things have come, and quite unlike anything we remember to have read of.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Operations in Charleston Harbor-- The Singular Aspect of Affairs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Operations in Charleston Harbor-- The Singular Aspect of Affairs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Charleston', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/001dddb6-0fad-5678-9ef8-4f9e2c5a92d2,821,nyt://article/001dddb6-0fad-5678-9ef8-4f9e2c5a92d2,

on Confederate Prospects,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/01/archives/views-of-american-affairs-the-times-correspondence.html,on Confederate Prospects,"The Times publishes a letter signed M.F. MAURY, on the prospects of the Confederates, He asserts they were never brighter. The North, he points out, is fighting for conquest and makes the attack; the South is fighting to be let alone and acts on the defensive. The South, therefore, cannot stop the war, but the North can. The Union, the bond of which was voluntary fraternizing, cannot be restored by force of arms. The Union is gone -- neither party can subjugate the other -- and it follows that the war is not to be ended by the sword. Other agencies must be called into play. The war is becoming more and more unpopular in the North. New-York is threatening armed resistance to the Federal Government. New-York is becoming the champion of States' Rights, and to that extent is taking the Southern ground. There are, besides, dissensions in other quarters. Even now Mr. LINCOLN has to keep an armed force not only in New-York and Kentucky, but also in Ohio, Indiana, and other States. He is even now marching upon Iowa to put down there a cry of peace. He is likely to have occupation for all the recruits his conscription will give him in keeping down his own people. The writer concludes by saying that all we (the Confederates) have to do is to maintain the defensive, watch our chances, and strike whenever there is an opportunity for a good blow.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""VIEW'S OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS.; THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENCE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""VIEW'S OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS.; THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENCE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'A LETTER FROM M.F.

"Yesterday the Brooklyn Navy-yard was the scene of an interesting and unusual occurrence. The second vessel constructed at this port, too large to fit in the regular ship-houses, has been commenced, and to-day her frame will begin to go up. The keel of the United States steamer Wambanogue, or the second Niagara as she is called, from the fact of the ship-house having proved too small for her, was laid in the presence of a large number of the employes of the yard and several officers. In the front and rear of the ship-house the gables have been taken away to enable the hull to protrude from the launching ways some distance toward the Lyceum. The vessel is to be built on whatever plan Mr. DELANO may see fit to adopt, the only requirement absolutely indispensable being speed. She will be over 3,000 tons burden, and some 360 feet long, having greater length than either the steam frigate Niagara or the Royal mail steamer Persia. The body of the ship is to be composed of the best live oak; the frame is to be fastened with extra braces, and every beam secured in the most substantial manner. Her width will be as great as circum stances will permit, but her depth will not probably be so great. She will resemble the Niagara, as that vessel appeared when she was first built, more than any other craft in the navy, although between both there will still be very important points of difference. The manner of arming the vessel will be the same as that adopted in all first-class frigates. She will have broadside guns protruding through porls in the usual manner. The rig is not yet decided on. Her guns will be of the heaviest calibre, and Capt. DRAYTON, the Ordnance Officer of the Navy-yard, intends to have as fine an armament ready for her as can be got up. It is in the engines that she will differ most from all our vessels, iron and wooden. Mr. DELANO is determined to ask for as powerful ones as he can get, and the Navy Department is partially bound to give them. The great strength and enduring qualities of the ship will render her able to stand the working of any machinery, no matter how powerful; and it is reasonable to suppose that she will have cylinders of as great a diameter as those of the iron-clad Puritan or Dictator.

SHERMAN. This is an excellent idea. Those who are chosen will combine every element of success, as they will be selected solely for their ability, and without regard to political effect. The young Cadets now at West Point also will have comrades who have been in actual battle, and have enjoyed the baptism of fire.

Before giving the Tribune's comments we may say that the Rochester paper was quite unhappy in its selection of an instance or an occasion upon which to throw doubt concerning the authenticity or reliability of the information for which we vouched. It was on the 22d of August that we made the exclusive and positive announcement, received by special advices from the Army of the Cumberland, that Gen. ROSECRANS had left his old camping ground near Tullahoma, and was advancing with his entire army upon Chattanooga; and it was only three days afterward, or the very day that the Rochester paper made the above remark, that the announcement was made through a telegram, which was published all over the country, and we suppose in the Rochester Union, that ROSECRANS' advance had actually arrived at Chattanooga, and was shelling it, to which was added the news two days ago, that the whole Army of the Cumberland, with Gen. ROSECRANS at its head, had crossed the Tennessee River. In every detail the news, which the Rochester Union borrowed from us, but pretended to doubt, has been confirmed by subsequent facts. We advise such journals as are published outside of this City, and which find it necessary to copy the greater part of their matter from the Metropolitan Press, to avoid, at the same time, insulting their benefactors, who, at a heavy cost, furnish them the news with which they cheaply fill their columns.

First and greatest is the statement that ""both armies have drawn off terribly shattered from the battle-field,"" and that the Federal army drew off ""because it feared its inability even upon the vantage ground to repel another attack."" This is utterly untrue. Our army never ""drew off"" from the battle-field of Gettysburgh. At the close of the struggle on Friday, July 3, our army held the field and our pickets were advanced. On Saturday, according to another statement of this same correspondent, both armies staid in position, and ""the big guns frowned at each other in angry silence."" On that night the rebels moved off.

Letter on the Confederacy,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/03/archives/maurys-deepsea-soundings.html,Letter on the Confederacy,"-- The last ditch of the rebels is not to be in the South, but in the North, probably in New-York, most likely in Second-avenue. In other words, after they have been defeated, and have reached the last ditch on their own soil, they still look for aid and the construction of another ditch by their friends in the Northern States. Their hopeful prospect in this line is now the burden of the rebel song on both sides of the sea. It is the North which is to rush to their assistance in the final moment; it is the ""mudsills"" which are to sustain the Confederacy; it is the ""small-fisted farmers"" who are to ply the rebellious spade; it is the ""greasy mechanics"" who are to mend up the cracked Confederacy. It is in this view of the case that the scientific and political quack, M.F. MAURY, writes to the London Times that the prospects of the Confederates were never brighter than now. The brightness which he beholds is exclusively in the Northern heaven. ""New-York is threatening armed resistance to the Federal Government; it is taking Southern ground."" ""Mr. LINCOLN has to keep an armed force not only in New York and Kentucky, but also in Ohio, Indiana, and other States."" ""He is even now marching upon Iowa.""

And Steele's Western Campaigns,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/04/archives/two-western-campaigns.html,And Steele's Western Campaigns,"We have two inland-armies of considerable strength operating at the present moment beyond the reach of the telegraphic wire, but whose footsteps and progress deserve to be watched with the deepest interest by the nation. We refer to the army under Gen. BURNSIDE in East Tennessee and the army under Gen. STEELE in Arkansas. Our latest news from both these armies is just ten days old, or up to the 26th of last month. At that date Gen. BURNSIDE's columns were filing over the mountain region of East Tennessee, at a point about forty miles west of Cumberland Gap, and were marching toward the town of Kingston, situated at the point formed by the junction of the Clinch and Tennessee rivers, and only a short distance from Knoxville and the line of the great East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad -- the ""backbone"" road, as it is called -- and which, when once reached, will give us an opportunity of literally cracking the rebellion's backbone. Gen. STEELE, operating in Arkansas, had marched from Helena on the Mississippi to the White River, which he crossed and struck directly for the Arkansas River and the Capital of the State, by way of Brownsville. The latter point, a dozen miles or more from Little Rock, he had reached, and had there a fight with MARMADUKE's cavalry, which were defeated and driven off. We suppose that by this time his army has arrived on the banks of the Arkansas; but as all the rebel forces in that region have been gathered and concentrated at Little Rock, under Gen. SMITH, or somebody else, it may be a little time before Gen. STEELE is fully prepared to offer them battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Two Western Campaigns.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Two Western Campaigns.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0200908-8e2a-5a43-97ab-10f1e18f4b7a,739,nyt://article/a0200908-8e2a-5a43-97ab-10f1e18f4b7a,

It was made up of men of widely varying party antecedents, and indeed of different shades of sentiment in respect to some of the minor topics of the present time; and yet it may be doubtful whether there ever was an assemblage of the kind in this State whose proceedings throughout exhibited greater harmony. This came simply from the fact that every man thoroughly understood the necessity of redeeming the State from its false position, and felt bound by every consideration of patriotism to act with exclusive reference to that end.

BRONSON, which occurred at Saratoga Springs on the night of Sept. 3, has already been announced. Judge BRONSON was widely known throughout the State and in this City, as an active politician, an able lawyer, and a man of unflinching integrity. He came from an old New-England family, and was admitted to the Bar, as an attorney-at-law in 1817. For twelve years he practiced his profession at Utica -- serving one term in the Assembly meanwhile -- when he removed to Albany, having been chosen Attorney General by the Legislature, which was then strongly favorable to JACKSON and VAN BUREN. In 1836, Gov. MAR??? appointed him a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State, and in 1845 Gov. WRIGHT named him Chief Justice of the same Court as Judge NELSON'S successor. On the adoption of the present State Constitution in 1846 he was elected one of the four Judges of the Court of Appeals and drew the four-year-term. He resigned this position a short time before the expiration of his term of office, and removed to this City in 1851. In 1853 President PIERCE appointed him Collector of the Port, but he held the office only a short, time, as his independent line of policy prevented his being made a party tool by those who hoped to use him. In 1859 Judge BRONSON was elected Corporation Counsel and continued to discharge the duties of that position until last January, when he retired to private life.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b67a5806-8b86-52f7-9309-531b8e760eb6,252,nyt://article/b67a5806-8b86-52f7-9309-531b8e760eb6,

Yet no State has furnished so many soldiers in proportion to its young men. None has treated its soldiers with such liberality; for it not only starts them with a complete outfit in every needed comfort and medicine, but has from the beginning engaged to give every man of them seven dollars a month during service, in addition to the Government pay. No soldiers have fought with greater bravery. A Vermont brigade held the key of the position at Gettysburgh, and did more than any other body of men to gain the triumph which decided the fate of the rebellion. To crown all we, now have this crushing defeat of Copperheadism at the ballot-box.

The Maori War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/06/archives/the-anglomaorian-war.html,The Maori War,"England's third war against the Maori has been hopefully commenced. Gen. CAMERON, the present commander of the troops in NewZealand, is evidently a soldier who knows how to deal with the native strategists. Instead of taking the field, like his predecessor, at the head of an unwieldy force, and making his approaches to the strongholds of the enemy by the process of sap and siege, he has adopted the plan of subdividing his army into small detachments, which move from place to place with celerity, and carry the pahs by storm. The efficacy of this style of action was first put to the test on the morning of the 4th of June. After the massacre at Faranaki, the Maori had thrown up earthworks at Tataraimaka, and stationed a garrison two hundred strong there. To signalize the opening of the war, and to strike terror into the foe, Gen. CAMERON determined on the surprise and capture of this work. Accordingly, 650 men, with three pieces of artillery, were ordered to leave New-Plymouth on the night of the 3d, and to proceed to the accomplishment of the enterprise. An armed steamer was also ordered to sail up the Katikava River, on which the pah stood, and to cooperate with the land forces by shelling it from the shore. The result was such as might have been anticipated. Though the Maori made a stiff defence, they were speedily overpowered and driven from their stronghold, after losing forty of their chief warriors in the struggle. Such was the first blow struck by the British in the new Maorian war. It shows that Gen. CAMERON is the ""right man in the right place,"" and that under his leadership the white troops are pretty sure to conquer. There is, however, nothing in the capture of a rude fort and a garrison of a couple of hundred half-armed savages, by thrice their number of disciplined soldiers, aided by a battery and a vessel equipped with Armstrong guns, about which to be at all vainglorious. Yet, owing to the many reverses which the British met with in the former war, their Press is quite jubilant over this unlooked-for success, and magnify it extravagantly. But were the achievement as important as it is insignificant, no glory could accrue from it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/181332f8-9411-54a9-9604-ecc5e32f4f2b,733,nyt://article/181332f8-9411-54a9-9604-ecc5e32f4f2b,

Mr. GROSS said talk was unnecessary -- the people understood the matter well. Mr. BRANDON explained his vote, saying that he had voted against the pledge to overrule the Mayor's veto, because he thought it was unnecessary to make the pledge; hut he had been in favor of the ordinance from the first. The Mayor sent in a message vetoing the resolution directing the Street Commissioner ""to take such measures as may be necessary to cause the immediate removal of the artillery and cavalry from all the squares, parks and other public places be-longing to the City."" The Mayor says the correspondence between Gov. SEYMOUR and Gen. Dix, recently published, demonstrates the necessity for the presence of the troops to insure the peaceful enforcement of the draft; that Gen. Dix proposed to leave this duly to the military power of the State, but the Governor refused, stating that ""under no circumstances could the State authorities perform duties expressly confided to others."" The Mayor continues: ""Inasmuch, therefore, as the enforcement of the act, one of the supreme laws of the land, was left to others, we cannot fairly find fault with those others for their presence here, especially in view of the fact that they have saved our City from another disgraceful outbreak."" The Mayor concludes by saying that ""the necessity for the presence of the troops is hut temporary and will soon be past. So long as they are here, we have no other places so suitable for their accommodation as the public grounds which they now occupy.""

B.. history of","If it were probable that the gallows would have received their due loyal well might unite with rebels in lamenting the death of John B. Floyd, which transpired at Abingdon, Va., on Aug. 26, according to the Richmond papers. For one whose name has received such frequent mention during the last two or three years the record of his earlier life is singularly barren and uninteresting. He was born in Virginia in 1805, graduated at South Carolina College, studied law, removed to Arkansas to practice, returned to Virginia, was elected to the Legislature in 1847 and 1849, was made Governor in the last named year, and again in 1855; but, although personally popular in his native State, he did nothing to make himself felt outside of it until he was fortunate enough to be chosen Presidential elector in 1856, when he voted for James Buchanan, -- a service for which he received ample compensation by an appointment to the Secretaryship of War. He availed himself of the advantages afforded by this high position to equip to the best of his ability with arms from the Government arsenals the rebels who were plotting to overthrow it, and for this treachery he was rewarded with a Brigadier-Generalship in the Confederate army. Possibly he helped to restore to the Government nearly as many arms as he robbed it of, for his career in Western Virginia was a constant series of failures, and he was instrumental in throwing Fort Donelson into Gen. Grant's hands, although, as every one will remember, he took good care to evacuate the position on his own account, leaving his troops to take care of themselves. This and his previous failures brought him into discredit with those whom he had turned traitor to assist, and for the last few months he has virtually been deprived of a command.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

These, however honest in spirit, must necessarily be one-sided, from the fact that they were written only on one side, without knowledge of the other. This volume opens with probably the least reliable report in the whole collection -- BEAUREGARD'S report of the battle of Manassas. It is full of falsity in essential particulars. He states that "" the Federal army consisted of at least fifty-five regiments of volunteers, eight companies of regular infantry, four of marines, nine of regular cavalry, and twelve batteries, 119 guns;"" and would give the reader to understand that, making allowances for sick and details, the Federal force engaged amounted to at least fifty thousand men. His own force he states to have been in the aggregate thirty-two thousand. He does not distinctly state how much of this force actually participated in the conflict; but nearly all must have done so, since he virtually admits that it was the arrival of JOHNSTON'S columns in the afternoon, by railroad, that decided the fortunes of the day. Now, we have Gen. MCDOWELL'S statement in his official report that ""he orossed Bull Run with about 18,000 men of all arms."" Gen. MCDOWELL docs not attempt to specify the number of his adversary; but after a general description says: ""What all this amounted to, I cannot say, certainly much more than we attacked them with. BEAUREGARD'S own statement proves this. There was a difference of at lenst ten or twelve thousand in favor of the Confederate forces. BEAUREGARD states that he had fifty-five guns, and that we had one hundred and nineteen. Major BARRY, Chief of Artillery under MCDOWELL, in his report, states that ""the whole force of artillery of all calibres was 49 pieces, of which 2S were rifled guns,"" and he gives a particular specification of the different batteries. He states that of these 49 pieces only 24 actually crossed Bull Bun to the battle-field. The rest were held in reserve. BEAUREGARD, therefore, enormously exaggerates the real fact. Taking his statement of his own artillery strength, it seems that he had six. more pieces than our army, including our reserve, and 31 pieces apart from that reserve.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL BATTLE REPORTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL BATTLE REPORTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/836cf9bb-dbd0-5d0a-b42e-4c379dd29267,4700,nyt://article/836cf9bb-dbd0-5d0a-b42e-4c379dd29267,

Mr. SUMNER was elected to the United States Senate in May, 1851, while I did not become a member of the Massachusetts Legislature until January. 1852, and, therefore, could not have voted for SUMNER, as stated. Hon. ASADEL BUCK, my immediate predecessor, voted steadily against SUMNER. If the antecedents of so humble a person as myself are to be paraded before the public, I may, in self-defence, be permitted to say that I am a South Carolinian, and have ever been true to the principles and traditions of my native State; that I have never given nor received an Anti-Slavery vote in my life, and that I was the first, while a member of the Massachusetts Legislature, to oppose the celebrated ' Personal Liberty bill,' and all other measures of an Anti-Slavery tendency.

Coroner NAUMANN proceeded to take the girl's statement. The following is its substance: On the evening of the 7th of July last Mrs. MARGARET REHMANN, residing at No. 311 Fifth-street, discharged GERTRUDE from her employ as a servant. When the girl went to her sleeping-room for the purpose of obtaining her trunk, Mrs. REHMANN undertook to prevent her; a quartet ensued, during which the girl, as she testifies, was severely beaten by Mrs. REHMANN. The latter undertook to eject her late servant from the house, but being enable to do so alone, she called to her aid Mr. HERMANN, a brother of hers. The two finally managed to get her out, but not until she had been badly beaten, and, according to the testimony of the doctors, several of her ribs were broken. Her injuries are such that death will probably be the result. The jury rendered a verdict o the effect that GERTRUDE WEBER came to her injuries from blows received at the hands of Mrs. MARGARET REHMANN and her brother HERMANN.

The ""Conservative"" party of this City, represented by the Aldermen and Common Council, go a long step further, and hold that no man ought to be obliged to serve, or to purchase his own exemption, if he is ""unwilling"" to do so: and they propose to pay out of the pockets of the taxpayers whatever sum may be necessary to secure everybody's exemption, rich or poor, married or single, fatherless, motherless, or blessed with both parents. The former of these doctrines is being put into practice by the Board of Supervisors, while the Aldermen and Common Councilmen have made desperate efforts to carry out the latter. Whichever party succeeds in keeping the field to itself, it is quite certain that nobody will be sent to the army from New-York who can give any good reason either for not serving, or for not purchasing his own exemption; and it is also quite certain that if the Common Council can get into the field ""for the relief of the drafted."" what with sham ""indigents"" and runaway substitutes, some three millions of dollars will pass into the pockets of the scum of the City population, and few or no men into the ranks of the army.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Exemption Mania and its Tendencies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Exemption Mania and its Tendencies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/838e4a25-33dc-5bb5-842f-be70f09586da,963,nyt://article/838e4a25-33dc-5bb5-842f-be70f09586da,

The news is of considerable importance. There was a report that a rebel pirate steamer, named the Atlanta, had put into Brest for repairs, and having no bill of health on board, had been forced to go into quarantine. It is stated by the Paris correspondent of the London Globe, that a number of vessels on the model of the Alabama, are being constructed for the rebels in French ports. The writer points out the fact that there will be no difficulty in fastening responsibility upon the French Government, as it has supreme control over all matters relating to the shipyards. A memorial from the British Emancipation Society was, on the 25th ult, presented to Earl RUSSELL, on the subject of the new iron rams alleged to be in process of construction for the rebel Government in England. The memorial states that two powerful iron-plated steam rams have, for sometime, been in preparation in the Mersey, by the builders of the Alabama, one of which was expected to fail about the 27th, and to be received by the Florida then hovering off the coast. Still another is mentioned as being built on the Clyde. Earl RUSSELL is urged to order a prompt investigation into the circumstances detailed. It does not appear from our dispatches, however, that his lordship had taken any action in the matter. The response of Mr. SEWARD to the Address to President LINCOLN, adopted by the Anti-Slavery Conference at Manchester on the 3d of June last, is published. Mr. SEWARD says that the President received the Address and the papers that accompanied it with lively satisfaction, and that he readily accepts and avows, as an additional and irresistible motive to suppress the insurrection and maintain the Constitution, the suggestion made by the friends of America in Europe, that the success of the insurrection would result in the establishment, for the first time in the history of the human race, of a State based upon the exclusive foundations of African Slavery.

The King of the Belgians recommends him to insist upon certain conditions, winch are equivalent to a refusal; and it is understood that the Imperial family at Vienna are resolved that his acceptance must be followed by a renunciation of all his political rights as a scion of the House of Austria.

It implies that secession is not only possible, but an actual fact -- that South Carolina and Georgia are to-day no more integral parts of the Union than Sonora and New-Brunswick -- and that the progress of the Union arms into their domain is conquest pure and simple, to be followed by just such a disposition of the people and their property, as the conqueror, under the law of nations, may see fit to ordain.

Fast Day Sermon in Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/10/archives/the-southern-confederacy-in-straits.html,Fast Day Sermon in Richmond,"-- Rev. Dr. STILES, formerly well enough known in these parts, preached a sermon in Richmond, on JEFF, DAVIS' late Fast Day, which he seems to have thought deserving of publication, and in which opinion we certainly concur. His text was ""Righteousness exalteth a nation,"" and the celebrated Southern Confederacy was of course the grand ideal of moral, social and political righteousness. He thought the changes which were now going on in the political and Christian world, and which were likely to result in the establishment of the Confederacy, were premonitory of the rapid approach of the millennium; and he cogently inquired, ""Is it not reasonable to suppose that God will inaugurate this glorious era of the Church by wheeling some one nation out of the ranks of the world, to take ground for God and man under the banner of the Gospel?"" -- and what nation could this be but the well-known Southern Confederacy. He seemed to think that it had already been ""wheeled out of the ranks of the world,"" for he inquires: ""Why should it seem a thing incredible to you that God should raise this nation from the dead, and raise hernow?"" -- by which defunct nation he means the so-called Southern Confederacy. He further calls on the rebels to ""arouse and seize this one great niche of time in the history of the world, and occupy that national position.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY IN STRAITS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY IN STRAITS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58301885-90a5-5bb2-a122-52f4ed7df5c2,603,nyt://article/58301885-90a5-5bb2-a122-52f4ed7df5c2,

There would be nothing singular in this feeling, if they imagined that it was really effecting, or was likely to effect a complete abolition of Slavery at the South, or even to exercise any influence on it whatever, because we all know that they consider the maintenance of Slavery not only not objectionable, but essential to the preservation of the Union. But nothing can be more notorious than that they ascribe to it no such potency. For them it is a brutum fulmen -- the. ""Pope's bull against the comet,"" the ""King's proclamation forbidding belief in God,"" the decree of the inquisition against the earth's motion -- everything, in short, that is vain, foolish, null and void. It will, they tell us, liberate no slaves; it has liberated no slaves; it has not withdrawn a single soldier from the Confederate ranks; or caused a pang of apprehension on a single plantation. All the negroes that have been lost to their owners would have been lost if it had never appeared; all that still remain to them will remain to the end, in spite of it. It is the march of the Union armies that is injuring Slavery -- the touch of the iron hand of war which blasts everything it passes over, scorches up the fields, ruins the villages, and spreads desolation like a tide. The Proclamation has nothing to do with the crumbling of the institution. It is but the silly words of a foolish man, inscribed on a sheet of paper, of about the same efficacy as the verses of the Koran, which Eastern Muftis write on a plate, to be licked off by sick believers as a remedy for their maladies.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Will He Do With It?""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Will He Do With It?""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8116a4a0-5038-5f9a-8d82-78e2fe07ecb2,1105,nyt://article/8116a4a0-5038-5f9a-8d82-78e2fe07ecb2,

When standing into Pernambuco Roads saw the United States steamer Venderbilt, and signalized her; she sent a boat on board to whom we gave the whereabouts of the Georgia, and how they might be likely to find her, as she secretes herself under the island and cannot be seen more than four or five miles off.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL PIBATE GEORGIA.; Capture of the Ships Constitution and City of Bath.

Tammany and Mozart at the Democratic State Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/12/archives/tammany-and-mozart.html,Tammany and Mozart at the Democratic State Convention,"For the past month that venerable damsel, Tammany, has been arrogant and boastful of what she would do at the Democratic State Convention. To read her organs and hear her leaders, one would suppose that young Mozart was, in advance, hidden from sight and sound beneath the amplitude of her crinoline. So confident was the old lady of this that it was declared she would not sit in the same Convention with the wild, reckless, unprincipled Mozart, and that, with maidenly modesty shocked and outraged, she would retire if this bold, vigorous, and at times indecorous youth, was admitted. On getting to Albany, however, the question was found not so much to be whether Tammany would sit with Mozart, as whether Mozart would sit with Tammany; whether the latter would be allowed to sit at all. Mozart, with becoming and commendable gallantry, came to her aid, however, and while rejecting the billing and cooing which sought to propitiate, at the same time did service toward her retention. Her delegation, headed by the old War Horse, and composed of seventeen, who with very few exceptions were office-holders, instead of withdrawing as threatened, found great cause for thankfulness in that they were not wholly excluded, and stood ready to gratefully pick up such crumbs from the political platter as were too small for the attention of Mozart.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tammany and Mozart.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tammany and Mozart.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'TAMMANY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/458e60e3-2500-59e3-a383-5cf4fbdeb9fe,461,nyt://article/458e60e3-2500-59e3-a383-5cf4fbdeb9fe,

His Tennessee Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/12/archives/rosecrans-campaign.html,His Tennessee Campaign,"Strategy, which was first the mania and then the mockery of our fickle public, has never had a more perfect illustration than the campaign in Tennessee, which has culminated in the capture of Chattanooga. Indeed, there is some reason to fear that the very bloodlessness of the victory which Gen. ROSECRANS has achieved will blind us to the surpassing importance of the victory itself. Victories won in the awful shock of arms, by their brilliant picturesque effects and sensational elements, readily address themselves to the public eye and ear; but victories won by simple superiority of generalship demand for their appreciation a finer sense and a deeper study. Besides, the very vastness of the theatre of war on which Gen. ROSECRANS is operating, and the imperfect knowledge people generally have of that theatre, compared with the familiar geography of the Virginia battle-fields, make an intelligent appreciation of his operations rare. Strategical operations -- which are operations conducted out of sight of the enemy, in contradistinction to tactical operations, which are conducted in sight of the enemy -- require for their appreciation a full knowledge of times and places: of roads, distances, lines of communication, lines of retreat, and the positions and relations of the contending forces.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Rosecrans' Campaign."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Rosecrans' Campaign."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/573991c7-6739-5113-a7a1-f2903006544b,874,nyt://article/573991c7-6739-5113-a7a1-f2903006544b,

It is something which has long been needed. One of the strangest things of this strange time has been the quietude with which our Congressmen have submitted to these breaches of international law and good faith. They have seemed to ignore entirely the fact that it particularly devolved upon them to appeal to the judgment of the civilized world. Our Secretary of State, and our Ministers in England and France, have done their own appropriate duties well. But their duties were purely diplomatic. Their arguments and their remonstrances were necessarily addressed to the private car of Government only. They were bound not to know any such tribunal as public opinion. It was for our Senators and our Representatives in Congress to make manifest the indignation of the American people they professed to represent, and to invoke the severest condemnation of all people everywhere against the monstrous injustice we are suffering. It was for them to proclaim how international law, and how American precedent, debarred foreign governments from showing our rebels the slightest favor, and how every moral principle of the age entitled our struggling Government to the moral support of every civilized Power. They did nothing of the kind. From the beginning to the end of the last Congress, there was not a solitary debate, in fact not a solitary speech, of any weight, upon the subject of our foreign wrongs. The everlasting flood of Parliamentary impertinence on the other side of the water was met only by a dead Congressional silence on this. So far as depended on the men in our Capitol, Europe had a right to conclude that the once imperious Republic was thoroughly heartbroken, and ready to submit to any fate PALMERSTON and NAPOLEON might see fit to allot her. This quiescence was the more remarkable, because in such absolute contrast to the old habits. Time was, nay it always was, when a suspected clipper stopped, a stray loafer seduced into enlistment, a Mosquito Indian patronized, a patch of Pacific sand camped upon, a cod and mackerel ground curtailed -- anything, even the ninth part of a hair sometimes, was sufficient to bring down Senatorial thunders which would shake the two continents. And yet here, when there was vital occasion, when foreign Powers were recklessly tampering with the very lifestrings of the nation, there was not the slightest whisper.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Our Foreign Wrongs Mr. Sumner's Speech."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Our Foreign Wrongs Mr. Sumner's Speech."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb876ae0-c8ad-5f83-935c-debaa3e412c5,1244,nyt://article/cb876ae0-c8ad-5f83-935c-debaa3e412c5,

Mr. SPENCE has only made his appearance once in print since the capture of Vicksburgh, and that was to make head in the Times against the rapid depreciation of the rebel loan, not, however, on the ground that the case of the Confederacy was not hopeless, but on the ground that, whatever happened, the South would still form an influential portion of the Union, capable of maintaining its own honor and seeing that its engagements were fulfilled. At the last meeting of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, his statement that he had better not say much ""about American affairs,"" in allusion to the formal repudiation of him by the Richmond Enquirer, was received with shouts of laughter. His colleagues have not borne up with even as much fortitude as he. ROEBUCK, who usually stars it in the provinces at this season, and gives the men of Sheffield, at least, a bit of his mind on the conduct of foreign Powers, has not opened his lips since he made his motion early in July for a recognition of the Confederacy. Messrs. LINDSAY and LAIRD have followed his example, though the former warned Lord PALMERSTON that the news expected every hour at that date (of the capture of Washington by LEE) would probably cause him to change his resolution not to recognize the Confederacy, with a rapidity which would certainly appear humiliating. As these were almost the only prominent friends of the South who went so far as to advocate recognition, we shall probably hear no more on this branch of the subject. The fact that Parliament is not in session, and will not be in session until February next, furnishes them with a reasonable excuse to the Southern agents for not bringing it up again at present, even if they feel loth to hurt their feelings by urging on them the necessity of retrieving their late reverses.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Right or Wrong of Secession.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Right or Wrong of Secession.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SECESSION', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/30e793d8-f864-5e71-b18b-746c07fed839,846,nyt://article/30e793d8-f864-5e71-b18b-746c07fed839,

A crowd of no less than 500 men, partly armed, and all infuriated, had got as far as Irvington, (two miles distant,) on their way to Tarrytown, and were only deterred from invading, and perhaps burning the place, by the salutary intelligence that the Provost Guard and a body of loyal citizens were determined to make deadly resistance. The latter had provided themselves with a brass field-piece, plenty of grape and canister, and good United States rifles, and would have made good their words. Their force, however, was feeble in numbers, and they stood guard for three days and nights, by turns, until relieved by troops sent from this City. In the meanwhile, however, they managed by way of precaution to ship some $80,000 worth of United States uniforms, held by the Marshal on board the Nyack ferry-boat, and send them down to Fort Hamilton for safe keeping. The draft lists and other documents connected with the office were concealed for nearly a fortnight, and all the operations of the draft were suspended.

Mr. SUMNER is to be thanked for his thorough exposition of the course of England and France in respect to our great struggle.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/13/archives/our-foreign-wrongs-mr-sumners-speech.html,,"Mr. SUMNER is to be thanked for his thorough exposition of the course of England and France in respect to our great struggle. It is something which has long been needed. One of the strangest things of this strange time has been the quietude with which our Congressmen have submitted to these breaches of international law and good faith. They have seemed to ignore entirely the fact that it particularly devolved upon them to appeal to the judgment of the civilized world. Our Secretary of State, and our Ministers in England and France, have done their own appropriate duties well. But their duties were purely diplomatic. Their arguments and their remonstrances were necessarily addressed to the private ear of Government only. They were hound not to know any such tribunal as public opinion. It was for our Senators and our Representatives in Congress to make manifest the indignation of the American people they professed to represent, and to invoke the severest condemnation of all people everywhere against the monstrous injustice we are suffering. It was for them to proclaim how international law, and how American precedent, debarred foreign governments from showing our rebels the slightest favor, and how every moral principle of the age entitled our struggling Government to the moral support of every civilized Power. They did nothing of the kind. From the beginning to the end of the last Congress, there was not a solitary debate, in fact not a solitary speech, of any weight, upon the subject of our foreign wrongs. The everlasting flood of Parliamentary impertinence on the other side of the water was met only by a dead Congressional silence on this. So far as depended on the men in our Capitol, Europe had a right to conclude that the once imperious Republic was thoroughly heartbroken, and ready to submit to any fate PALMERSTON and NAPOLEON might see fit to allot her. This quiescence was the more remarkable, because in such absolute contrast to the old habits. Time was, nay it always was, when a suspected clipper stopped, a stray loafer seduced into enlistment, a Mosquito Indian patronized, a patch of Pacific sand camped upon, a cod and mackerel ground curtailed -- anything, even the ninth part of a hair sometimes, was sufficient to bring down Senatorial thunders which would shake the two continents. And yet here, when there was vital occasion, when foreign Powers were recklessly tampering with the very lifestrings of the nation, there was not the slightest whisper.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Our Foreign Wrongs Mr. Sumner's Speech."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Our Foreign Wrongs Mr. Sumner's Speech."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be575f08-1c1f-5bd2-a69a-2c489d88c579,1342,nyt://article/be575f08-1c1f-5bd2-a69a-2c489d88c579,

His Speech on Foreign Relations; Correspondence with the President on Peace,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/13/archives/the-exmayor-and-the-president.html,His Speech on Foreign Relations; Correspondence with the President on Peace,"FERNANDO WOOD, in his correspondence with the President, made his representations of what ""the Southern States"" were prepared to do, on the strength, as he said, of ""authority which I deem likely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful."" Whether that authority was an official personage or not, he does not say. If it were not, of course no importance could be attached to it -- no more than could be attached to his own representations of what the Northern States are prepared to do. If it was, how can it be reconciled with the speech made by ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS at about the same time? Surely, if there is anybody connected with ""the Confederate Government,"" who would be more likely than any other man to favor arrangements for the return of the South to the Union, it would be its Vice-President. He was the last public man of the South to yield to the secession movement, and did so then apparently because it was no longer possible to withstand the pressure. Of cool temperament, of magnanimous spirit, and of great discernment, possessing more of the respect of the North, both as a statesman and a man, than any other rebel functionary, and known also to have very little confidence in most of the rebel chiefs, he was the very man of all others to have this desire for reconciliation with the old Government, if there were any such feeling anywhere in the rebel councils. Yet it was just before the date which Mr. WOOD gives as the time when he was advised of what he communicates to the President, that this same ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS delivered a speech in Crawfordville, Ga., published by us soon afterwards, the entire burden of which was an exhortation to the people never to give up.

Mr. KAY was commissioned by the Senate of Cambridge University, England, to travel through Western Europe for the purpose of examining the comparative social condition of the different countries, and the result is the work whose title we have just mentioned. Summing up his estimate of the position of England's population, he says on the last page of this volume: ""The poor of England are more depressed, more pauperized, more numerous in comparison to the other classes, more irreligious and very much worse educated than the poor of any other European nation, solely excepting Russia, Turkey, South Italy, Portugal and Spain."" The kind of social anatomy attempt by the author requires a cool and steady hand and scalpel. Mr. KAY succeeds only moderately well.

On Tuesday last the Ironsides and monitors engaged the batteries on Sullivan's Island and a shell from the Weehawken exploded one of the magazines in Fort M[???]ultrie. Half the town of Moultrieville was destroyed by fire, occasioned by the shelling of the Ironsides, and all the shore-batteries were extensively damaged. After the bombardment had closed, Admiral DAHLGREN ordered a boat expedition to advance upon Sumter, in the hope of taking it by storm. The attempt, however, ended in the repulse of the expedition with a loss of sixty men -- among whom were six Lieutenants and an Ensign -- and five boats. Gen. GILLMORE's forces were busied in erecting batteries from which to shell the city. Four additional pieces of ordnance had been exhumed from the sand on Morris Island, making an aggregate of thirty-six pieces captured by our troops. Rebel advices two days later have come to hand in a Richmond paper received at Fortress Monroe. BEAUREGARD claims to have captured 113 prisoners -- including 13 officers -- in the affair of the navy at Fort Sumter, besides four boats and three colors, including the original flag of Fort Sumter, which was lowered by ANDERSON, and which Admiral DAHLGREN hoped to replace. On the night of the 10th a steady fire was kept up against our batteries on Morris Island, which was unnoticed on our part. Gen. GILLMORE was getting guns in position at Battery Gregg bearing upon Sullivan's Island, and a shell from the rebels on James Island exploded the magazine in that work.

The expedition seems to have been very badly planned and very incautiously executed. Indeed, the story of the affair reads like a skylark of a set of boys. A hundred and fifty men row up to Sumter, as if on a frolic. They land, and attempt an entrance into the fort, when they are fired upon by musketry, and, on the signal, all the batteries bearing on the fort open fire. The result is that the party is badly repulsed, and a hundred and thirteen men, including thirteen officers, are taken prisoners. It is a wonder any of them escaped at all. It was surely unwise in Admiral DAHLGREN to have sanctioned so senseless an enterprise. Fort Sumter is perfectly useless to us until the batteries opposite are reduced. Gen. GILLMORE is steadily preparing to do this; when he has his batteries ready, he will pound Johnston, Moultrie, Beauregard and Bee into surrender, just as he has already done with Sumter, Wagner and Gregg.

EVERETT was about proceeding to California, and was stopping at the Pacific Hotel, intending to take passage in the steamer to-day. ALLEN cultivated his acquaintance, and discovered his destination, and forthwith said he also was going the same way. EVERETT was a little shy of him at first, but gradually let him into his confidence and became his friend. ALLEN showed his victim a check, signed S.P. STEINWERT & Co., drawn on the American Exchange Bank, and made payable in gold, to the amount of $350. The two computed the number of ""greenbacks"" this check would bring, and EVERETT thought he had found a pleasant companion for the voyage. On one of their walks about town, ALLEN stated he desired to buy a harness to take to California for his brother, and, as they were near a harness-shop, he thought he would then do it, providing EVERETT would lend him $180 on his check, which he did, and ALLEN passed into the building by one door and out at another, leaving his comrade to find him. This, of course, he did not succeed in doing. The police were more fortunate, however, and on Saturday the operator was taken. He was brought up before Justice DOWLING yesterday, and committed for examination. ALLEN is a rather good-looking young man, of good address, and well calculated to gain the confidence of a stranger. It is stated that he has obtained $350 at one time, and $150 at another, in a similar manner, from unsuspecting countrymen, who could not stay on[???] enough to prosecute him. Mr. EVERETT, however, will remain to appear against him.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d89e79eb-8826-5d04-8ca0-bea5b372d21f,969,nyt://article/d89e79eb-8826-5d04-8ca0-bea5b372d21f,

The rebel agents will find it impossible to impeach the accuracy of any part of it. It is perfectly free not only from any statement which can be disputed or doubted, but from all that grouping and coloring which, if it be skillfully done, is quite as potent as any misstatement, to ""make out a case."" Throughout, there is a singular air of strict judicial fidelity. The facts are set forth with extraordinary clearness, and exactly as they are. There is no attempt to increase their effect by argument. They are left to force their own conclusion; and to every fair European mind they make the conclusion unavoidable, that the quickest and surest way for European nations to obtain a peace in this country is ""to withdraw support and favor from the insurgents, and to leave the adjustment of our domestic controversies exclusively with the people of the United States.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Mr. Seward's Diplomatic Circular"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Mr. Seward's Diplomatic Circular"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/41770bef-28cd-53a6-b0d9-e7b912bf1ec8,1192,nyt://article/41770bef-28cd-53a6-b0d9-e7b912bf1ec8,

The difference between our mode of raising troops and theirs, has formed for some time past a prominent element in their calculations. They have watched closely the expiration of our short terms of enlistment, and endeavored to strike heavy blows after the discharge of large bodies of our troops. LEE's last invasion was carefully planned and prepared so as to take place alter the discharge of the two years' men of HOOKER's army. It failed, mainly because our loss from that cause, great as it undoubtedly was, was very much smaller than was supposed at Richmond, and the terrible series of disasters which have followed it would unquestionably cause much greater despondency than even that which exists at the South, if the leaders did not cherish the hope of being able to hold out until next May, when we shall lose at one stroke all the men in our army, except those who are being raised under the present draft, and the few who have voluntarily entered during the past Winter. They will, therefore, now probably concentrate the remnant of their forces, which together will constitute at least one tolerably formidable army, and play a strictly defensive game, offering every possible obstruction to our advance, obstinately defending all defensible positions, and using the spade vigorously, but carefully avoiding all actions likely to he decisive in their result.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Policy of the Rebels Our Present Duty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Policy of the Rebels Our Present Duty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6542a5cc-9ddc-5eca-a743-7b32e8ed6af5,822,nyt://article/6542a5cc-9ddc-5eca-a743-7b32e8ed6af5,

An alarm being immediately given in the neighborhood, parties with lights hastened to the scene of the disaster, and succeeded in rescuing the unfortunate children from their perilous position just in time to escape a passing train, which a few seconds later swept over the spot upon which the helpless little ones were lying prostrate and insensible. The whole party were borne to a house near by, where they received every care and attention that their bruised and breeding state demanded. Medical aid was procured, and upon examination, it was thought that none of them were fatally injured. When fully restored, the children were removed to their homes in Brunswick-street, Jersey City. The boy driver proved to be in a state of complete intoxication. Apparently fearful of punishment for the injuries he had occasioned, he refused to give his name or furnish any particulars whatever of the affair. The other children stated that he had been sent with the horse and wagon for grain from some brewery, where the men had given him beer until he became drunk. The wagon was smashed, but the horse escaped with but slight injury.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FEARFUL ACCIDENT AT BERGEN', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FEARFUL ACCIDENT AT BERGEN', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59f5a26a-6896-51d7-becd-27634d9b2913,254,nyt://article/59f5a26a-6896-51d7-becd-27634d9b2913,

JIM LANE. When Lawrence was sacked in 1856, by ruffians from all parts of the South, the general verdict of our Copperheads was, that it served it right, for what was it but a nest of horrible Abolitionists. Providence, however, sometimes so arranges matters that crime shall, even in this world, bring on its own punishments, and the present condition of Slavedom is, perhaps, the most awful example the world ever saw of retributive justice. Feriocity on one side of the line naturally produced a desire for vengeance on the other. The ""Red-Legs,"" who now propose to invade Missouri, and lay waste a whole ""tier of counties,"" by way of retaliation, are the moral offspring of the Missouri ""Red-Shirts"" of 1856. If there be anything fanatical and ferocious about them, the Missourians have themselves to thank for it. If you treat men as wild animals, they acquire at last the fiercest passions in self-defence, and Northern Copperheads have to-day no more right to be astonished or horrified by the threats of LANE than to be shocked because a dog, pursued with a red-hot poker, bites his assailant.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Curses Coming Home.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Curses Coming Home.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1062ed91-4cd5-58e3-9be0-ba11d52b28bd,623,nyt://article/1062ed91-4cd5-58e3-9be0-ba11d52b28bd,

Stumping the North,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/17/archives/gen-lee-stumping-the-north.html,Stumping the North,"It would appear from the Richmond Enquirer, that fraternal feeling has so far revived at the South that Southern politicians are anxious to act once more with their old allies, the Northern Democrats, at the approaching election. We have always doubted the statements made by FERNANDO WOOD and others of his way of thinking, as to the willingness of any considerable portion of the Secessionists to cooperate with their old associates in winning victories at the polls, but the article to which we have referred so strongly confirms the view of the matter taken by these gentlemen, that we cannot permit ourselves to doubt any longer. The Enquirer expresses the greatest anxiety for the success of the ""Northern Democratic party,"" which it appears is already so nearly on a par with its antagonist, that ""the least advantage thrown in its favor will insure its success."" The mode in which the writer proposes that the South should lend its aid in the matter, will probably be pronounced by some captious persons somewhat irregular; and there is no denying that it does seem a little singular. But the eccentricity can easily be accounted for by ascribing it to the warmth of the Southern temperament, and the extreme violence which has of late characterized the proceedings of the Abolitionists. The Enquirer suggests, in short, that the South should aid the Democratic party by deputing LEE ""to advance once more on MEADE."" ""Let him,"" says it, ""drive MEADE into Washington, and he will again raise the spirits of the Democrats, confirm their timid, and give confidence to their wavering.""

"A few days since Coroner NAUMAN held an ante-mortem examination at Bellvue Hospital, in the case of a domestic, named GERTRUDE WEBER, who had been beaten so badly that she was not expected to recover. The testimony then given went to show that GERTRUDE had been in the employ of Mrs. MARGARET ROMING, or REHMANN, a German woman, living at No. 311 Fifth-street. Mrs. R. for some cause discharged the girl, and the latter, a day or two after her discharge, went back to the house for the purpose of obtaining her trunk. Mrs. R. tried to prevent her from taking the trunk, whereupon a quarrel ensued. The gir[???]testified that during the mel[???]e she was badly beaten by Mrs. R., who tried to put her out of the house. Being unable to do this alone, she called to her assistance a brother of hers, who was living in the same house. The two finally put GERTRUDE into the street, but not until she had been severely bruised and maltreated. The testimony of the physicians showed that several of her ribs were broken, and she was otherwise much injured. The jury, upon the ante-mortem, rendered a verdict that the girl came to her injuries from blows received at the hands of Mrs. R. and her brother. The two were thereupon arrested and held to bail. Yesterday a notice was received by the Coroner that GERTRUDE had died at the Hospital. A post-mortem examination of the body was made, when the physicians found that in addition to her broken bones, there were indications of a positive character going to show that an abortion had been effected upon her very recently. This state of the case has rendered it necessary for the Coroner to adjourn the inquest for the purpose of obtaining testimony which will enable him to sift the matter, and, if possible, to bring all the guilty parties to punishment.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/17/archives/an-alleged-murder-and-abortion-a-mysterious-case.html,,"A few days since Coroner NAUMAN held an ante-mortem examination at Bellvue Hospital, in the case of a domestic, named GERTRUDE WEBER, who had been beaten so badly that she was not expected to recover.

The restoration of the Union, however, to the living form it had when traitor hands were raised against it, ""with not a star dimmed nor a stripe erased,"" is the cherished idea of the great majority of the American people; and not until all hope is lost of the return of the seceded States to the Union, with their old names and under loyal organizations, will they consider any new mode of dealing with them.

It is highly important as being the first decision reported upon the effect of the recent habeas corpus Proclamation. Judge CLERKE, in the Supreme Court, made similar decisions in two cases, but his opinion in the matter has not been published. Judge BETTS, as will be seen, holds that the effect of the Proclamation is such as not only to prevent the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus in the cases which it specifies, but also to stop all proceedings in such cases in which the writ has been already issued, and he accordingly leaves the man whose case was brought before him in the hands of the military authorities, to be tried by them for the crime of desertion, with which he was charged. His argument, in brief, is as follows: The Government has the right to defend its national existence, and in order to do this it has the right to call for the services of every man, whether he be under age or not. And it has the further right to say, if it deems it to be necessary, that in the proceedings which it thus takes to defend itself, it will not have the military interfered with by the civil Courts, but will have any questions which arise as to the payment of this military service by the citizen, passed upon by the military tribunals, to whom the decision of such cases belongs. This is effected by suspending the writ of habeas corpus in such cases as the President has the power thus to suspend it; if not from his position as the head of the Government, then by virtue of the act of Congress. This power he has seen fit to exercise, and the civil Courts accordingly must take no further action in such cases.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Effect of the Habeas Corpus Proclamation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Effect of the Habeas Corpus Proclamation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Habeas Corpus', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1370ed19-7cd8-5bf1-858d-fe5687f952ab,590,nyt://article/1370ed19-7cd8-5bf1-858d-fe5687f952ab,

is going to die when all is lost,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/18/archives/robert-toombs-and-jeff-davis.html,is going to die when all is lost,"-- Senator TOOMBS, of Georgia, so far from being an advocate of reconstruction, has announced his intention, ""when all is lost, of uniting with the thousands of his countrymen who have found honorable deaths, if not graves, on the battle-field."" His announcement is highly characteristic. It proves that TOOMBS is as great an enemy of the useful and practical as he ever was. Nothing can be plainer than that now is the time for him to die. To wait till ""all is lost"" is simply to throw his life away. If he wants to turn his existence to some account, the plan is to place himself at the service of the Confederacy while there is yet hope, and when soldiers of any age are so much needed. If the rest of the Southern people were to follow his example, and stay at home, saving themselves for the sacrifice until all sacrifice was in vain, there would soon be an end to the rebel armies. So we hope he will reconsider his decision. We think we are but speaking the sentiments of most Northern people, when we invite him earnestly and affectionately to expose his person to our fire at once. We make this appeal as much for his own sake as that of the Confederacy. Little as we value him, we should surely prefer hearing of his having fallen on the battle-field, to hearing that he had been reduced to the painful necessity of making away with himself after the fighting was all over.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ROBERT TOOMBS AND JEFF.

But the fact is that in those immense States the breadth of an army's march is but a line, and the farms wasted bear a small proportion of the myriad farms that remain unvisited and unharmed.

We know that BRAGG has evacuated his great stronghold at Chattanooga, for we occupy it. But beyond, we are in the dark. Good authority places the bulk of LEE's army around Richmond; better authority places at least two of its three corps on the Rapidan; and highly reliable authority has hurled at least a half of it down between the ranges of the Alleghanies to overwhelm Gen. BURNSIDE. Gen. BRAGG, again, performed the last of the series of masterly retreats that carried him out of Tennessee by flying from Chattanooga in the first two days of this month; and we know that his retreat was in a southerly direction. But where did he stop? Has he got as far down as Atlanta, as some say, or is he resting his legions at Rome, or is he still hovering in the mountains near Chattanooga, preparing to retrieve his fortunes, and to start with a reinforced army upon some startling venture? If LEE is at Richmond, what then? Has he gone there to stay till we make another call upon him? If he has but one corps at Richmond, and two on the Rapidan, will he expose the latter to assault from the Army of the Potomac, which has now advanced to the Rapidan?

"Frankfort Congress, the Close of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/20/archives/german-politics-the-frankfort-congress.html,"Frankfort Congress, the Close of the","The Frankfort Congress have closed their labors, and dispersed. The propositions of FRANCIS JOSEPH underwent little or no modification, and his Majesty professes to be perfectly satisfied with the result, which he thinks will prove most beneficial to Germany. That the Kaiser is satisfied with the issue we may well believe, since it places him at the head of the Confederacy, gives him a right to German aid in defence of his non-German possessions, and authorizes the employment of Federal troops in the suppression of State revolutionary movements. But whether it will prove as beneficial to Fatherland as the Kaiser imagines, or afford as much satisfaction to the people at large as it does to himself and his brother sovereigns, may be fairly doubted. How, for instance, can a scheme prove beneficial to Germany, to which the must enlightened and the most powerful, save one, of the Teutonic States, is wholly opposed, and the forcible carrying out of which may lead to the creation of two hostile confederacies instead of national unity? Or how can a scheme prove beneficial to Germany which will oblige her, in the event of a Hungarian or Venetian insurrection, to send forth her sons to sustain, beyond the Danube or the Alps, the schemes and cause of Austria? But if the Austrian scheme is little calculated to prove beneficial to Germany, still less is it calculated to give satisfaction to her people. Neither the Kaiser nor his colleagues condescended even to notice[???] the suggestions of the deputies simultaneously assembled at Frankfort; consequently the proposition touching the election of the Lower Chamber remains unaltered, and the choice of its members is vested in the Legislatures of the several States. Yet it is expected that the people should be satisfied with a system which allows them no representation in the Federal Diet -- no control over the Federal Government -- and which denies them as Germans a right that as Prussians, Saxons, Bavarians, Wurtembergers, &c., they have long enjoyed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'German Politics The Frankfort Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'German Politics The Frankfort Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6fb3315c-df86-538e-b06d-f3eba914cc2a,826,nyt://article/6fb3315c-df86-538e-b06d-f3eba914cc2a,

"Houston, Gen. Sam., Ex-Governor of Texas",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/20/archives/obituary.html,"Houston, Gen. Sam., Ex-Governor of Texas","-- The Richmond papers record the death of Gen. Sam Houston, of Texas. His decease has been so often reported that its present announcement will be received with many doubts. The event is stated to have occurred at his residence in Texas, on the 25th of July last. It is a little singular that this intelligence was not received long since. Still the report may be correct. The life of Gen. Houston has been a most eventful one, full of strange and stirring incidents. He was born in Rockbridge County. Va., in 1793. His father, an officer in the war of the Revolution, died in 1807, leaving a widow and nine children. Soon after, Mrs. Houston and all her children crossed the Alleghany Mountains and took up their residence near the Tennessee River, then the boundary between white men and the Cherokee Indians. Sam was soon placed in a country store; but was thus employed only a few weeks when he ran off, and spent several months among the Cherokee Indians. When eighteen years of age he enlisted as a private in the United states Army, and was soon made an Ensign. He distinguished himself at the battle of the Horse Shoe, under Gen. Jackson, in 1814, and was dangerously wounded. After peace he was made a Lieutenant, but resigned, and studied law in Nashville. He was soon after elected District-Attorney of Davidson County, Tenn., and Major-General of the State, and in 1823 was sent to Congress. He was re-elected in 1825, and chosen Governor in 1827. This latter office, in consequence of u domestic affliction, he resigned in 1829, and again made his home among the Cherokee Indians, with whom he remained for three years, and became exceedingly popular with them. Subsequently he was elected a member of the State Convention which met at San Felipe de Austin in 1833, and after adopting a Constitution, addressed a memorial to the Government of Mexico setting forth the reasons why Texas should be recognized as one of the States of the Mexican Confederacy. The distinguished part Gen. Houston took in the war that followed this movement is well known. He was the first President of the new Republic in 1836, and was again elected to the same office in 1841.

Congre ational Address to American Congregational Union,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/20/archives/religious-bodies-and-the-war-congregational-address-to-the-american.html,Congre ational Address to American Congregational Union,"At the last meeting of the Congregational Union at Dundee, it was resolved to send the customary fraternal address to the members of the American Congregational Union. An address has accordingly been drawn up, and appeals in the Scottish Congregational Magazine for this month. The address is signed by Rev. ROBERT SPENCE, Mr. DAVID M'LAREN, Mr. JOHN LANG and Mr. WILLIAM J. COX. After noticing how closely the two countries are united ""by the ties of common parentage, language and religion,"" and stating that they regard the present unexampled calamities which have overtaken America as God's judgments against national sin, and especially the sin of Slavery, the address expresses the hope that their American brethren may be enabled to look away from man, and say this evil is from the Lord, and that they may put away from them the sin of Slavery. The address then proceeds: ""There are not wanting tokens that this will be the happy issue. Most heartily do we congratulate you on those recent measures of your Government which have tended so much in this direction. In the treaties spontaneously entered into for the effectual suppression of the African Slave trade: in the abolition of Slavery in the District of Colombia; in its prohibition 'in the Territories of the States;' in the facilities which other enactments give to the ultimate extinction of Slavery in all your States; and in the recognition of the free Governments of Liberia and Hayti, we see evident indications of a just perception of the great cause of your present troubles, and have hope that it will are long be taken out of the way.

"The Texas Expedition will not be baulked for any length of time by the unfortunate repulse of our three gunboats at Sabine Pass.

The disturbed condition,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/22/archives/trouble-in-missouri.html,The disturbed condition,"Gen. SCHOFIELD has just published a most stringent order in his Department, and it is to be hoped that he will have the nerve to execute it, and that the Administration will have the courage to suffer him to do so. The condition of Missouri is at present, and for months past has been, a disgrace to the American Government. It was the State the least struck, of all the Slaveholding States, with the madness of treason. It was the most quickly and easily rescued from the perils of rebellion. It was the most fully prepared for the abrogation of Slavery, and has been the first to abolish it, and thus remove forever the exciting cause of the existing war. But, notwithstanding these facts, Missouri is to-day more dangerously disturbed, if not more dangerously disloyal, than Mississippi. More contempt for the army and the Government is daily poured forth there -- more turbulence in talk and in action is indulged in -- and human life is less safe than anywhere else within all the military lines of the United States. In this latter respect, the condition of Missouri is fearful. Not a day passes that does not chronicle house-burnings and murders. The border between Missouri and Kansas is a scene of general terror and flight, resulting from threats of mutual slaughter by opposing parties, which threats are in process of execution. Two days since the North Missouri Railroad trains were fired into and driven back from their trip, and yesterday we were treated to the report of new plots to burn the City of St. Louis!",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trouble in Missouri.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Trouble in Missouri.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Missouri', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/18718522-2c02-50c6-9813-b0adab9fae24,799,nyt://article/18718522-2c02-50c6-9813-b0adab9fae24,

Neutrality--Laird's Rams and the Foreign Enlistment Act,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/22/archives/the-anglorebel-rams.html,Neutrality--Laird's Rams and the Foreign Enlistment Act,"The most important feature in our European news this morning is the semi-official announcement put forth by the London Morning Post that the two rams -- ""powerful iron-plated steam rams,"" as Earl RUSSELL, described them -- which are lying in the Mersey, all but ready to start out in Confederate service, are to be detained by the British Government, under the terms of the Foreign Enlistment act. Their case will be brought before a Court of Law, which will be called upon to determine whether the detention is legal, or whether the owners can recover them from the hands of the Government. The allegation against them is that they are fitted out for the purpose of carrying on hostilities against this country; but, on the other hand, it is contended that they were built by order of a French house for the late Pasha of Egypt, whose successor has repudiated the contract. ""Pasha of Egypt"" is really, however, but the latest alias of Mr. JEFF, DAVIS, who, having become too well known to the police by his alias, ""Emperor of China,"" has taken a new name under which to perpetrate his crimes. There is no doubt whatever that these rams were intended for the rebels. The English journals themselves give abundant proof of this, and all the quibbles that Pasha DAVIS' tools, the of Messrs. LAIRD, have raised for the purpose evading the law, as well as all the quibbles that Earl RUSSELL has raised about the construction of the law, have only served to establish more clearly the main facts in question. We have great hope, therefore, that if the rams are detained, and their case brought before a British court of law, that the decision will be such as not only to agree with the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment act, but with national comity and international justice. We have the more ground for this hope in the new spirit of fairness with which this case is treated by nearly all types of the British Press. The Daily News, the Star, the Spectator and other friendly organs, are energetic in their remonstrances, decided and bold in their tone, and persistent and powerful in their arguments; the Morning Post and so called neutral journals give a remarkably fair statement of the case; even the Times and Saturday Review, which heretofore have been ready to apologies for any breach of English or international law, if done in the interest of the Confederates, which have been anxious to damage the Union cause by fair blows or by foul, have come out vigorously against the present evasion of the law attempted by the rebel agents and the Messrs. LAIRD. The Times desires that the law on the subject, whatever it may be, should be enforced, and if the present law is not sufficient to secure the ends aimed at, ""it concerns us (the English) more nearly than any other nation to get the laws thoroughly revised,"" it further makes this remark, which, if it be accurate, we consider one of the best signs of the day in England: ""As things now stand, there seems to be a kind of moral obligation making itself felt in advance of the law."" There is no doubt that, when once public sentiment in England attains a just standard and an unbiased expression on the questions at issue between our Government and theirs, we shall have an easy solution for all difficulties that may arise, and the best security for the maintenance of peaceful relations between the two countries.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-Rebel Rams.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-Rebel Rams.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1dc06a55-a368-5904-a810-c29f60d647cf,666,nyt://article/1dc06a55-a368-5904-a810-c29f60d647cf,

The action continued until long alter dark, both armies fighting stubbornly and losing large numbers of men. We captured ten guns and lost seven. From a special dispatch to the Washington Chronicle, we learn that at Gen. GRANGER's headquarters, at Nashville, it was believed that the contest closed with no disadvantages to the Union arms. A telegram from Louisville, dated 12 3/4 A.M., Monday, states that the fight was renewed on Sunday morning, resulting in the defeat of Gen. ROSECRANS' army and its compulsory retreat to Chattanooga, but a later dispatch received by the Washington National Intelligencer, puts a more cheerful complexion upon the matter. This brings the news down to 8 P.M. on Sunday, when the advance of the rebel army is reported to have been driven back. The dispatch states that the battle was resumed on Sunday morning -- the rebels attacking with overwhelming numbers -- and the action continued furiously all day.

Prize Courts and English Complaints,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/22/archives/delays-in-the-prize-courts.html,Prize Courts and English Complaints,"The English have complained a good deal, from first to last, about the action of our Prize Courts. They have not been suited with the law by which our Courts have been governed, even though we showed them the best English authority for it. It is not unnatural, perhaps, for they looked at their own legal principles from a point of view to which they were not accustomed, and their aspect was entirely changed. The views which English Courts took of the cases of prizes captured by English vessels, seemed to be very different when it concerns English prizes and American Courts and captors. Nor have their complaints been confined to the general rules of law. The action of the Courts in different cases has been the subject of sharp animadversion. They have intimated pretty broadly that our Courts would not give them a fair hearing -- interposed delays of all kinds to their just claims -- imposed too heavy expenses upon them, and in various ways were guilty of practices which were very offensive to the sensibilities of the British Lion. The allegations of undue delay have been quite prominent. It is but a little while since we saw an article in the London Shipping Gazette, complaining, among other things, that in the case of the Labuan and the Empress, although the vessels had been restored, ""no compensation has as yet been awarded to the claimants for the loss of time, damage, or other injuries incurred in the protection of their property."" But it appeared by our law reports a few days ago that the reason why nothing has been done in the matter of the Labuan, at least, is that the claimants of the vessel have failed to move the proceedings before the Court, understanding, as they said, although mistakenly, that the matter was already before the Court for decision, -- so that the delay has been the consequence of their own blundering. We are confident that the same rule will hold good in other cases of delay.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Delays in the Prize Courts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Delays in the Prize Courts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d0a9c30-3053-59bb-ab3a-9698a8747071,618,nyt://article/7d0a9c30-3053-59bb-ab3a-9698a8747071,

He was received by a splendid audience, and with a degree of enthusiasm that testifies unmistakably to the favor in which he is held by Ms friends.

We are long past that stage of the war in which a single defeat can stay our progress. The fact, for fact it seems to be that the rebel army of Virginia has been largely drawn upon to supply BRAGG with the means of striking the blow under which ROSECRANS is now reeling, proves that the surmise which gave them but one army remaining of the various hosts which they possessed, a year ago, is well founded. They have no longer an army of the East and an army of the West, an army in Virginia and an army in Tennessee. When they seek to accomplish great things at any one point, it has to be by forces drawn from all others. This is unquestionably a game in which great skill and judgment, celerity and audacity, may be displayed, and it would be childish to refuse the rebels the credit of displaying every one of these qualities. But, then, it is a desperate game -- a game which Generals play rather to save their honor than to retrieve their fortunes. It was probably never played so magnificently, and may never he played so magnificently, as in that brilliant campaign by which NAPOLEON sought to save Paris after the fatal field of Leipsic. There was something awful in the genius with which, during that terrible month, he shot small masses of raw levies up and down the chord of the arc, in the vain effort to stem the great tide which was gradually hemming him in. and under which he soon after sunk in the court-yard of Fontainebleau.

The London Post announces, on undoubted authority, that the Government has ordered the two steam-rains which have been the subject of so much discussion, to be detained; and in relation to the same matter the Times is of opinion that in view of the common belief that these vessels are for the service of the rebels, the Government would not be justified in letting them depart from the Mersey. The Herald refuses to believe that the Ministry will interfere, and in a characteristic editorial denounces such a monstrous piece of tyranny and placid acquiescence in the outrageous demands of the Federal Government. A French journal describes four suspicious steamers that are in process of construction at Nantez and Bordeaux, evidently designed for war-vessels, and states that they are to be delivered up at sea, twenty leagues from Belle Isle. The journal adds that it is believed the steamers are for the Confederates. The Paris correspondent of the London Herald repeats his assertion that both the recognition of the South and the defensive league between the Confederate, French, and Mexican Governments are decided upon.

The information entirely disproves the brief dispatch from Louisville on Sunday night announcing that Gen. ROSECRANS had been badly beaten. The battle on Saturday ended in a clear advantage to our army, we having captured most of the artillery and sustained less loss in men than the enemy. On Sunday, at 9 o'clock, the engagement was renewed by the rebels, who massed their forces and attempted to carry the left of our position by a series of fierce onslaughts. These assaults were gallantly and successively repelled, and the carnage on both sides was appalling. Foiled in their object, the enemy a few hours later threw themselves against our right and centre, and succeeded in piercing our line, exposing Gen. THOMAS on the left to a terrible flank attack. This advantage was not long held, however, as reinforcements under Gen. GRANGER opportunely arrived, and our broken columns again rallying, with united front they dashed upon the enemy, driving them back, and punishing them severely. Throughout the day Gen. THOMAS' corps gallantly held its ground, repulsing the enemy in every attack, but at 5 o'clock, in order to reestablish our lines in a new position, he fell back to Rossville, in the direction of Chattanooga. Our losses in prisoners and wounded are estimated at 3,000. Gen. ROSECRANS has determined to concentrate his entire army at Chattanooga.

If, failing to win a "" magnificent victory,"" he then fell back a short distance to a stronger position, he will probably only remain there until he receives such reinforcements as will enable him to achieve a victory that even a Copperhead will be reluctantly compelled to own as ""magnificent.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""ROSECRANS' BATTLE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""ROSECRANS' BATTLE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/77bb7b8a-7087-55c3-9cbf-a8790789ab7f,242,nyt://article/77bb7b8a-7087-55c3-9cbf-a8790789ab7f,

Recognition has been so much talked of, and so often threatened, that a large portion of the public have come to look upon it as something inexpressibly horrible -- so much so, that there is hardly a doubt that a well-authenticated announcement that France had recognized the rebel Government would spread a panic through the whole country. People cannot, therefore, be too often reminded that it is a mere piece of etiquette, whose significance is entirely conventional. If we choose to consider it important, it is important; if we choose to consider it of no moment, it is of no moment. It is on our own nerves that it would be intended to produce all its effect. The position of the Confederates would not be changed by it in anything but the name. Their Minister in Paris would not in consequence of it enjoy a single advantage that he does not now enjoy. He already has access to the Emperor and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs just as readily as Mr. DAYTON, or any other Ambassador. What he says is listened to, and treated with just as much consideration as if he were in full possession of all the honors of the Plenipotentiary of an acknowledged Power. All that he would gain by ""recognition"" would be the privilege of bowing to the Emperor on New-Year's Day, and wishing him the compliments of the season.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Effect of Recognizing the Rebel Confederacy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Effect of Recognizing the Rebel Confederacy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90a2cc69-472c-5aab-9d21-bf66b8a249fe,1041,nyt://article/90a2cc69-472c-5aab-9d21-bf66b8a249fe,

Such feats of artillery practice amaze and confound them, and have already given them more of respect for us than any other of our achievements. The London Army and Navy Gazette 8ays that the Americans have constructed and put to service at Charleston cannon of calibres which to the English are known only as of theoretical and probable attainment. ""Before such projectiles as these guns carry, the breaching of masonry, whether of brick or stone, is but a question of short time."" ""Had such guns been available in the trenches before Sebastopol, the Allies would have made short work, not only of the Redan and Malakoff, and bastion du mat, but of the shipping and of the forts on the other side of the harbor."" ""It is undeniable,"" continues Mr. RUSSELL, "" that the establishment of a few of Brig.-Gen. GILLMORE's batteries before Sebastopol, on the 17th of October, 1854, instead of the 'tremendous armament' of which Lord GRANVILLE boasted, would have 'knocked the place into a cocked hat' in twenty-four hours."" Even that terrible ship the Warrior would not be safe against the new American artillery, they are beginning to suspect; for the same authority says: ""Unquestionably the Admiralty would be rather nervous about the result of firing a 450-pound shot against the side of the Warrior, at the distance of 200 yards, notwithstanding the experiments,"" &c. The question then arises, Have the English any such guns? And they are forced to a loud negative. ""In face of these facts, we are obliged to record that our scientific officers are of opinion that the best English gun for breaching purposes is the old 68-pounder!"" It is a lamentable confession, but it seems to have an excellent effect upon the soul; for the Army and Navy Gazette deduces the following remarkable bit of philosophy from the startling facts which have been revealed, to it: ""Do not let us pooh-pooh the Americans. If we are wise, it is the last thing we ought to do."" Yes. yes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ECHOES OF FORT SUMTER. Gen.

The Raleigh Standard and the party for which it speaks in North Carolina, are now ready to treat for peace, and are willing once more to return to the Union, not, according to their own account, because they love the Confederacy less, or love the old Government more, but for that most cogent of all cogent reasons -- because they cannot help it. The Standard frankly confesses that it is for peace, because a continuance of the war involves subjugation, and subjugation means ruin. It confesses that North Carolina went into the war unwillingly, but that once in, honor as well as interest required that she should spend in it ""her last man and last dollar;"" but says, that the last man and last dollar have been spent, and that therefore it is now time for her to make terms.

And to this the Rebel adds that ""from the signs of the times it begins to look very much as if that obstinate man meant what he said."" JEFF. DAVIS has just made a desperate and obstinate effort to snatch Tennessee, but it looks as if he had undertaken too big a job, even with the united armies of the South. His object was to overwhelm ROSECRANS at the first onset, and while the Army of the Potomac was inactive, and its ranks depleted. But BRAGG and his ""brilliant galaxy"" did not succeed even in setting their foot on Tennessee soil; and ROSECRANS now telegraphs that Tennessee's gateway, Chattanooga, is impregnable; while the menacing advance of Gen.

The massing of troops in solid body and hurling them with rapidity from one part of the field to another, engaging in succession the different corps of an enemy, is a feat which so few Generals have shown themselves capable of, in this or any other war, that we have been wont, in this instance, to assign it to such Generals as have been previously associated with it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL COMMANDER AT THE BATTLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL COMMANDER AT THE BATTLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f85cbf9d-d32b-55ad-8767-1d529fe16609,251,nyt://article/f85cbf9d-d32b-55ad-8767-1d529fe16609,

The base-ball match, yesterday, was hardly up to the mark, or equal to the great reputation of the two Clubs; a great deal of money changed hands on the result.

WOLLENHAUPT, THE PIANIST AND COMPOSER. -- The sudden death of Mr. HERMANN A. WOLLENHAUPT has created a profound feeling of regret in the public mind, and a sentiment of sincere sorrow among a large circle of our citizens. Mr. WOLLENHAUPT was universally respected for his brilliant musical abilities, and beloved for the noble and generous qualities which adorned his character. These endeared him to all who knew him, but though his well merited successes may have caused some a jealous pang, it is probable that he had not one enemy in the world. HERMANN A. WOLLENHAUPT was born at Schkenditz, Province of Saxony, Prussia, in 1827. His rare musical talents brought him early before the public, and he achieved signal successes wherever he appeared. In 1845 he came to New-York, where his piano performances at the Philharmonic, and other concerts, rapidly gained for him a brilliant teaching connection, so that in two years he was enabled to send for his parents and his brother and sisters. These he educated and maintained, devoting all his energies and means to their comfort and advancement. Observing great talent in his brother BRUNO, he sent him to Germany to study, keeping him there seven years, until he had achieved the position of a first-class artist. During the years of his residence in this City, HERMANN WOLLENHAUPT produced a large number of brilliant piano compositions, which have become famous, not only in this country, but throughout all Europe. They have become standard works, and have made his name respected wherever they are known. The art has lost much by his sudden and untimely death, and no one can calculate the deep grief that follows him to his grave from his home circle and his hosts of friends. His life was one of utter devotion and self-sacrifice, and he has surely met his reward, where deeds and not words are considered in a life's account. He was buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery, and his funeral was attended by every musician of eminence in the City. On the day of his funeral all the principal music-stores and piano-stores were closed as a mark of respect to his memory.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3df2a64d-2342-53af-9550-e16df61efb62,365,nyt://article/3df2a64d-2342-53af-9550-e16df61efb62,

We are there established in the centre of the so-called Confederate territory, and from his lofty lines Gen. ROSECRANS not only defends Tennessee and Kentucky in his rear, but menaces the upper regions of Georgia and both Carolinas, and practically nullifies all rebel operations between the Coosa and the Mississippi. So long as Gen. ROSECRANS shall hold Chattanooga, we shall regard his Fall campaign through Middle Tennessee as a great success, even though, unfortunately, we cannot claim the late battle in Northern Georgia as a victory. We have reason to believe that the possession of this point was the sole immediate object of Gen. ROSECRANS. It was undoubtedly his purpose to fight BRAGG as soon as his strategy drew the latter out from Chattanooga, or while the rebel army was in course of getting out, but it was not his intention to pursue BRAGG down through Central Georgia until such time as he had secured his position and his line of communications, and established a secondary base on the Tennessee River. His advance southward of Chattanooga was not for the purpose of fighting the then escaped army of BRAGG, as the position and line of advance of the three corps of his army prove.

THOMAS. It appears that this gallant soldier bore the brunt of the rebel attack unharmed, on both days of the fight, though the onset in each case was impetuous and overwhelming. It is no discredit to the corps of Gens. MCCOOK and CRITTENDEN that they were broken by the outnumbering hosts of the enemy. The metal of these men had been tried before, and they are known and approved as among the bravest of our Union soldiers. But if a part of the gallant army of ROSECRANS could be driven back without disgrace, it must not be denied that unusual credit and renown are due to that portion which withstood every shock, and dealt horrible slaughter upon a foe so numerous as to be deemed invincible. This is the signal merit of the corps of Gen. THOMAS in the sanguinary battle in Northern Georgia. The stubborn fighting of this portion of the army is all that saved the fortunes of the day, as we understand the contest at this distance; and if the enemy fails to follow up his supposed advantages, it will be mainly because of the damaging blows inflicted by this heroic General.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MAJ.-GEN.

Liberal Sentiment of England,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/26/archives/the-liberal-sentiment-in-england.html,Liberal Sentiment of England,"We commented recently upon the extent to which the scarcity of labor, combined with the rapid growth of trade in Europe, had lessened that abhorrence of Slavery which thirty years ago everybody either had, or affected to have. In fact, it is one of the lamentable results of the prodigious expansion of commerce and industry which this century has witnessed, that material progress has come to be looked on in almost all countries rather as a means of making money than as a means of improving the condition of the human race. Capital is somewhat outraged by the pretensions of labor, and unwillingness to labor to any extent that may be necessary to make ""investments"" profitable, has gradually come to be looked on as a crime. This is at the bottom of most of the furious denunciations that we so constantly hear of the Jamaica and Hayti negroes; and when one of the apostles of this new school of political philosophy shows you that fifty thousand dollars, put into a plantation, would bring thirty per cent. if he could get labor, he is scandalized by your doubts of the lawfulness of his seizing as many men and women as he can lay hands on and lashing them into industry. What is perhaps strangest and saddest in it all is, that the chief of this school should be THOMAS CARLYLE, who thirty years ago preached the young men and women into furious quest of the ""better life,"" and made the welkin ring with his denunciations of fraud, injustice and all other species of Slavery.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Liberal Sentiment in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Liberal Sentiment in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c2bc8dc9-e529-5af8-8eb9-9d83d0176c08,959,nyt://article/c2bc8dc9-e529-5af8-8eb9-9d83d0176c08,

"The time must come when we shall see the end of this rebellion, and the consequent disbanding of the greater portion of our armies now in the field, and it is not inopportune to look at the return of our soldiers, and the effect...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/27/archives/social-effect-of-the-war.html,,"The time must come when we shall see the end of this rebellion, and the consequent disbanding of the greater portion of our armies now in the field, and it is not inopportune to look at the return of our soldiers, and the effect that they are destined to have on our general social condition. We had somewhat of an opportunity to test this upon the return of the two years' regiments, but not fully, from the fact that they were but a small portion of those in service: and, again, a large percentage reenlisted within a few weeks. At the close of this war the State of New-York alone will have over one hundred thousand men returning to their homes, once more to become citizens and an immense element for good or for evil. There is no disputing the fact that some of these will find it hard to settle into their old avocations, and will be a restless, non-laboring portion of the people, always ready for fillibustering, and hard to repress on that point. But it is of the main body who will become distributed through the people, of whom we speak. They have been taken from every grade of life, and from every trade, pursuit and profession, and upon each respective grade and profession they will bring to bear the results of the military education they have received. This education, extending over a period of nearly three years, is one based upon the very first principles of society, discipline, both mental and physical, and a recognition at once both of the sovereignty of the individual and the authority of the ruler. The man who has been taken from the plow and the workshop, without ever having felt the power that was invisibly over him, and always working to restrain his passions and to protect him, will come back with a knowledge of that unseen law or discipline which makes him either a good soldier or a good citizen. The one who was a ne'er-do-well in the past, has been taught the value of personal struggles, and the worth of personal pride, and, while forced to a life of temperance, and social consideration for his fellows, has had, if he was capable of reform, one worked upon him, that will last a life, time. The man who went away, leaving behind him money, or the love or pursuit of it, or leaving behind some petty, trifling, or dishonorable attachment to which he had devoted his life, will return, having forgotten the goddess of his idolatry, and become awakened to the real business of life. He who enlisted from absolute friendlessness at home, generated possibly by his own faults, has, by commencing a new life, made new associations, and placed himself in a regenerated phase with the old ones; has, while he has shaken off the past, learned from his experience that a man cannot live without ministering to the comfort or enjoyment of those with whom he comes in contact. The mechanic or laborer has been instructed in the value of time and punctuality, and will come back to the workshops and the fields, not only believing in the justice that should be rendered him, but in that which he should render. If their officers have done their duty, they will know that ""cleanliness is next to godliness,"" and will understand the simple laws that govern health. They will have learned that, not only life but health can be supported without indulging every appetite suggested. They will know the meaning of manly, honorable pride, and indulge it, and that pride which will teach them to speak of their past, will keep them careful in the present and in the future. The soldier who would ""shoulder his crutch, and show how fields were won,"" will be careful what, he does to blacken that reputation for which he served in peril, and of which he is so proud to speak. This education will be carried into their homes, and be transmitted to their children. The soldier who has for so long a time been debarred the society of women will be trebly appreciative, and whether he is beginning his matrimonial venture, or continuing it, will more thoroughly understand the importance of woman to every hour of his life, and the weight of his enhanced toils in her absence. The discipline he has been taught in the army he will insensibly introduce in his family, and his children will find a benefit from his education, which, like bread cast upon the waters, will be returned to him after many days. Last upon the list is the fact that the returned soldier, in most cases, is always in the midst of those who were once his military comrades. He has enlisted from a locality, and returns to it, and among those comrades he has a character to uphold that cannot be sacrificed lightly. He stands in the same relation that a man does to his family. They have passed through sunshine and storm together, and a fellowship has been created that must last, as long as life, and have an influence in the cultivation of those social qualities that bind them together, and break down the barriers continually built by men whose entire soul is absorbed in the one idea of gain.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Social Effect of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Social Effect of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/65ead231-2e67-5d21-b761-889e5414faed,971,nyt://article/65ead231-2e67-5d21-b761-889e5414faed,

Our lesser armies, too, had successes and reverses, but no serious actions, if we except one. Gen. STEELE seized the capital of Arkansas; Gen. FRANKLIN was repulsed from Texas; Gen. BURNSIDE captured Knoxville and Cumberland Gap; Gen. GILLMORE, after a brisk struggle, reduced Fort Sumter and the two works on Morris Island. During these months of comparative repose, everything military looked bright and hopeful. Rebel armies defeated, strongholds captured, territory occupied, rebel lines contracted, rebel forces demoralized, and the rebel Confederacy apparently in the throes of dissolution. Our armies all strong, well planted, well led, filled with the spirit of victory, and needing only to deal a few more blows upon the enemy, and then fold up their battle-flags and contemplate the glories of the triumph achieved. The thought of defeat, the possibility of retreat, the idea that the rebellious storm, so nigh quelled, would again gather force and break in devastation over the land, entered into no man's mind, or, at all events, found no expression. Public confidence has never been as high during the war as in July, August and September of the current year; and there never was such good ground for it. It seemed as if we could almost descry the dawning of the morning of peace over a Union reconstructed, and a nation braced up and made stronger by the bloody hurricane under which it had passed. In common with all others, we saw the brightening prospect, and gave expression to the universal hope. From time to time we earnestly warned the public not to give way to over-confidence -- not to consider the struggle as over while the rebels had hundreds of thousands of men in the field and gave vent only to expressions of defiance. But as things stood a fortnight ago, we certainly considered that, if only our good fortune were maintained, the Confederacy must speedily totter to its fall.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Military Aspect.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Military Aspect.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/229c30f4-ccb5-5e9b-a6b7-acb4cf7d98cd,849,nyt://article/229c30f4-ccb5-5e9b-a6b7-acb4cf7d98cd,

And in everything which is dependent upon individual energy there is abundant evidence that our boasting is well founded. But anybody who had no better proof of it than is afforded by the management of some of our public enterprizes would be greatly amused by these pretensions. Our Post-office, for instance, as compared with that of either France or England, has been in most particulars, and is still in some, almost mediaeval in its clumsiness, slowness and uncertainty. It was the rule in the Post-office of both those countries that an unpaid letter should be forwarded to its destination in the regular course, and delivered on payment of double postage, for thirty years before this simple and effective expedient was adopted here. Until this Spring, the practice of our Post- office was the truly Turkish one of retaining the letter in the office in which it was first dropped, writing another letter to the person to whom it was addressed, requesting him to send on a stamp, waiting till his reply came, and then, having secured the stamp, and protected the revenue against all risk, forwarding the letter at last. This was in every way worthy of the Duchy of Potztausend. But there was another arrangement which was even more brilliant, and which also survived till the present year -- that by which the postage to be prepaid on all City letters was one cent, and the carrier was condemned to collect one cent more on its delivery. By this means we suppose the Government undertook to see that the expense of intramural correspondence was equally divided between the senders and receivers, but one result of it was that the carriers passed two-thirds of their time on door-steps waiting for a cent. Some genius, however, discovered that after all a great deal of labor might be saved by making the prepaid postage on City letters two cents, and as so many years passed before this contrivance was hit upon, and it must have been pretty difficult to devise, the Post-office ought to honor him with at least a bust.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Postal Facilities in New-York Suggestions for Reform.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Postal Facilities in New-York Suggestions for Reform.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/74545222-9f27-5024-b8b2-2e5c33218121,1115,nyt://article/74545222-9f27-5024-b8b2-2e5c33218121,

Lime and chloride of lime are freely sprinkled about them, and there is a constant supply of fresh water from the Brandywine Creek, and steam condensers introduced lately. The hospital for prisoners and our own men contains six hundred beds. It cost the Government about $37,000, and has been occupied but a couple of weeks. An hotel and several boarding-houses will shortly be erected on the island. The chapel will be dedicated in about three weeks. It is nearly ready to be put together, and a large gang of men are at work upon it.

Her news is two days later, but we are without our usual telegraphic summary, in consequence of the disarrangement of the line at St. Johns, N. F., where the Associated Press dispatches were left. The Courrier du Harre states that the rebel steamer Alabama would probably visit Cherbourg at an early day. The seizure of the pirate Florida, at Brest, had been opposed by the maritime Prefect at that port, with the object of preserving the inviolability of the harbor as a military port. Capt. MAFFIT has written a letter to the Patric, denying the assertion made by that journal that the Florida had been seized to satisfy an indemnity claim, and explaining that his vessel was not a privateer, but a regularly commissioned ship in the navy of the Confederate States. The rebel rams were still detained in the Mersey, pending further inquiries and until fresh instructions are given respecting them. The London Post is of opinion that the bona fide character of the original order for their construction will be established, and that eventually they will be released. The news from Japan via Hong Kong shows that the anti-foreign Damios still continue hostilities. In addition to the attack on the American steamer Pembroke, the French dispatch steamer Kiluchung had been assailed by batteries and two war vessels while at anchor, and was very nearly being sunk. One of the Damios also made an attack on the Dutch man-of- war Medusai, but that vessel silenced his forts and sunk an armed brig.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/896ff9b0-f134-5bb4-bad1-6e82bf0a2b9c,267,nyt://article/896ff9b0-f134-5bb4-bad1-6e82bf0a2b9c,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/29/archives/arrival-and-reception-of-col-grahan.html,,"Brig.-Gen. CHAS. K. GRAHAM, of whose military career as an officer of the Excelsior Brigade a detailed notice was given in yesterday's TIMES, arrived in this City yesterday, having left the Libby prison at Richmond on Tuesday last. His numerous friends in this City being desirous of giving him a reception befitting his gallant services, and the sufferings he has endured in the cause of his country, arrangements were made for them to proceed in a steamboat to Amboy to receive him on the arrival of the train from Philadelphia, and convey him to the City. Surveyor ANDREWS, a warm personal friend of Gen. GRAHAM, on hearing of the proposed action, immediately tendered the use of the United States barge Addison F. Andrews, and at 11 o'clock yesterday morning a party of one hundred gentlemen, more or less, embarked for the trip, at the foot of Whitehall-street. The barge was under command of Capt. FAUNCE, formerly of the Harriet Lane. Among the party were Surveyor Andrews, James T. Brady, Judge Hilton, of the Common Pleas; Ex-Alderman Dayton, Judge Elias J. Beach, Alex. D. Munson, Chairman of the Committee of reception; Judge Van Cott, Judge Stewart, J.M. Motley, Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher, Col. Hamlin, of the Third regiment Regulars, son of the Vice President of the United States, Capt. Wm. H. Farrar and Lieut. George M. Dusenbury, of the Thirty-seventh New-York Volunteers; Capt. Woodward, of the Third army corps; Capt. Street, of the Twentieth Indian regiment; S.J. Strong, Assist. Postmaster; Alex. Isaacs, and Thos. J. Brown, Deputy Surveyors, and many others, of more or less note. Before leaving the wharf the Committee of arrangements ascertained by telegraph that Gen. GRAHAM was coming by the New-Jersey Railroad, and would arrive in Jersey City instead of Amboy. This necessitated a change in the programme, which proved to be a very agreeable change to all concerned, for it gave the party an opportunity to take a sail around the battery and view the Russian fleet lying at anchor in the North River, while waiting the arrival of the cars at Jersey City. Each of the vessels of the fleet was visited in turn and greeted with rousing cheers from the party, which were cordially responded to from the Russian decks. After calling upon each member of the fleet, and calling three times round the flag-ship of Rear-Admiral LASOF[???]KY, the Andrews turned her prow toward the Jersey docks. Gen. GRAHAM had already arrived at the depot, where he was met by Mr. MUNSON, Judge HILTON, Judge BEACH, and JAS T. BRADY, and escorted on board the Andrews. The General was accompanied by Mrs. GRAHAM, who met her husband at Fortress Monroe, and to whose perseverance and energy his early exchange and release from the rebel prison is mainly due. As the General came on board, he was welcomed with the most enthusiastic and prolonged cheers from his friends, the band meanwhile playing ""Hail to the Chief."" The boat was immediately headed cown the bay, and before Gen. GRAHAM and his lady had got through receiving the congratulations of their friends, the party found themselves passing through the Narrows and out into the open sea. The bright sunshine, the placid waters of the ocean, which was as calm and smooth as a lake, and the general enjoyment of the scene by all on board, to which the harmonious strains of the Seventh regiment band greatly contributed, tempting the Committee to prolong the sail, and the pilot was directed to round the light-ship oil Sandy Hook. Just as this had been accomplished, a dense volume of black smoke was descried in the Eastern horizon, which the Revenue officers on hoard conjectured came from the steamer City of Washington, just row due here from Liverpool. The Andrews was directed to steer for her, and after an hour's sail, encountered the craft, which proved to be the French naval steam frigate C[???]reur. On drawing near the frigate the [???] st[???]uck up the ""Marseliaise."" which was responded to by the frigate's band playing the ""Star Spargled Ban[???]."" The Emperor NAPOLEON's favorite National air was also played by the Seventh regiment band, and several rounds of cheers were interchanged between the Andrews and the Coureur: though it is worthy of rem[???] that the Yankee cheers were much less spontaneous and ne[???]rty than those which greeted the Russian fleet at the outset of the excursion. After paying all the respect to the new French visitor [???] the party thought she deserved, the Andrews was i[???]led for the Narrows, and soon felt the Coureur far in her stern. On the return trip an ce[???]ent [???]tion was spread out on the main deck, and all hands proceeded to enjoy it with a relish which a se[???] p[???]etite alone can give. At the close of [???]re; JAMES T. BRADY, Esq., was agreed upon, and in all ch[???]t and touching speech, filled with re[???] of his early acquaintance with Gen. GRAHAM, and with his father and his two brothers, THOMAS and DAVID GRAHAM, tendered [???]m a hearty we come home to his friends. He closed by proposing the health of Gen. GRAHAM.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION OF COL. GRAHAN', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION OF COL.

The effect of this, in the gross and scope, is to transfer the main weight and interest of the war from the wings of our long line of operations to the centre in Southeastern Tennessee. In that region both we and the rebels are bending every energy to mass two great armies, which must henceforth become the cynosure of all eyes. A battle, which will make all the previous battles of the war secondary, must ere long take place there. On that battle, in a great measure, hangs the issue of the war, for both the magnitude of the proportions of the contending forces, and the strategic relations of the theatre of war, conspire to give a decisive character to the coming contest. If a victory shall crown the Union arms, nothing can be imagined to stop their conquering, onward march.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/29/archives/rosecrans-at-chickamauga.html,,"-- FREDERICK AT HOCHKIRCH. -- Military critics, whose experience entitles their opinions to weight, have considered ROSECRANS the most military General that we have. His conduct throughout this war, especially his manipulation of his troops, prove that he understands his business professionally. His conduct in this last battle so nearly resembles that of FREDERICK the Great at Hochkirch that it is worth while to signalize roughly the comparison. Maj.-Gen. THOMAS likewise played his part with as much zeal, discretion and courage as FREDERICK's Lieutenant-General, DE ZIETHER, whose prescience and intrepidity saved the Prussians from a greater disaster. DAUN had 90,000 men, FREDERICK 43,000. The former took advantage of FREDERICK's confidence to deal him a ""malicious blow."" He attacked him by surprise, Oct. 14, 1758, in a mountain region, and, with a loss of about 6,000 men and five Major-Generals, (just the number the rebels are reported to have had killed,) drove him from his position, with a loss of 9,000 men and 101 cannon. Yet, notwithstanding, the King made such a magnificent retreat that the Austrians did not dare to renew their attack. In a few days the Prussian army was as formidable as before the battle. Such, too, was FREDERICK's vigor and activity, that, despite this reverse and its attendant consequences, he was able to raise the siege of Neisse, drive the Austrians out of Silesia, relieve Dresden, besieged by the victorious DAUN in person, and force him to fall back across his own (the Austrian) boundaries. With this analogy to FREDERICK, let us see if ROSECRANS can emulate his after energy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ROSECRANS AT CHICKAMAUGA', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ROSECRANS AT CHICKAMAUGA', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-09-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edcfc0a1-a315-5d95-93e2-e52940eb4f2d,474,nyt://article/edcfc0a1-a315-5d95-93e2-e52940eb4f2d,

Members of the various lodges were present, decorated with the emblems and honorary insignia of the Order. The officers and speakers, on coming upon the stage, were loudly applauded. The exercises were opened by singing the song. ""Thrice Welcome, Brothers,"" after which an eloquent and impressive prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. TEMPLE, of New-Brunswick. The Chairman for the evening, Mr. S.L. CARLETON, M.W.P., of Maine, thanking the audience for the honor they had done him in selecting him as their presiding officer, indulged in some reminiscences connected with the Society at the period of its earliest existence -- of the one who, now no more, first presided over their deliberations, and who, he said, was ever faithful to their glorious motto.

A compilation from the records of the National Division, giving the number of lodges now and at different former periods, and the prospects of the Order for the future, together with a statement of some of the benefits already flowing from it, was read by Mr. STEARNS, at the close of which reading another song, ""Our Glorious Order,"" was sung by the Club, many of the audience joining in the chorus. After a few pertinent remarks by an old member of the Order, Rev. Mr. LATHROP, of Connecticut. Mr. BARNUM, who had been alluded to by the Chairman as one of the many good things that they had at their anniversary, responded to the loud calls of the audience, and made a few humorous and characteristic remarks, declaring that he was the great showman showing himself, as he had not arisen to make a speech, but only because there might be some in the audience who had never ""seen BARNUM."" He was followed by Rev. THEODORE L. CUYLER, whose speech was brief and to the point, abounding in illustration and sentiment, and concluding with an eloquent and touching allusion to the present unhappy condition of our country, imploring his countrymen, each and all not to give up the old ship. The concluding speech was made by Mr. CARSWELL, of Canada West. His speech abounded in anecdote and illustration and was loudly applauded by the audience. He thanked the people of the United States for sending the red, white and blue, in the form of their badges to Canada, where many lodges had been established. He closed his remarks by declaring that Canadians were not all Secessionists, that the bone and sinew of the country were sympathizers with our Government in its attempts to crush the rebellion, that many had come from Canada to join our armies and fight for the Union, and that thousands would rejoice when our efforts should be crowned with success. The Glee Club then sang medley, and the assembly dispersed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ORDER OF THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE.; Celebration of the Twenty-first Anniversary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ORDER OF THE SONS OF TEMPERANCE.; Celebration of the Twenty-first Anniversary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-09-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/036c2f6b-98cc-5a45-9ff5-d237e823c2b0,553,nyt://article/036c2f6b-98cc-5a45-9ff5-d237e823c2b0,

Those who sustained the Confederacy because of its successful display of power, now sustained the Union, because it showed itself possessed of still greater power. Those who had been against us because they thought the job we had undertaken an impossible one, now turned in our favor when they saw that it was not only possible but well nigh accomplishment. Those who were demanding the immediate recognition of the Confederacy, were now willing to wait and see whether the Confederacy would remain in condition to be recognized. Judging from the tone of the English Press, and by private letters, we should say that the Union cause never stood so well abroad, as the United States certainly were never treated with so much fairness, as during the three months past.

A Russian naval squadron goes always prepared to make a descent on land, to assault and carry a fort by storm, or do any other work that a land force may attempt.
