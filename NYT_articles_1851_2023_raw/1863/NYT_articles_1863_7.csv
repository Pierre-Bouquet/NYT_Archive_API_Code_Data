Subjoined, we give a full list, corrected up to July 1, 1863, of the regularly constructed ship-of-war of the United States, as there appears to be a very general misunderstanding in regard to the [???] vessels comprising our national fleet. [???] London paper recently stated that ""although there are ever 400 ships in the United States navy, not [???] of them were built for war purposes."" Similar ignorance being common at home, it may be well to show our friends and foes, that since the rebellion broke out, nearly 140 vessels have been constructed expressly as men-of-war, and of these nearly fifty are iron-clads. Many of the purchased steamers are now as formidable as navy-built craft, but the names of all are excluded, in order to present the reader, for the first time, with a list of our ""regular navy.""

Fortunately cannot be President,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/01/archives/the-new-commandera-fortunate-circumstance.html,Fortunately cannot be President,"There is one circumstance is Gen. MEADA'S history, for which, now that he is in command of the army, we may all feel devoutly thankful. He was born in Spain, and consequently is not eligible for the office of President of the United States. Owing to this happy accident, there is no danger that the approaching campaign will be political as well as military; or that he will have one eye on LEE and another on "" the Radicals"" or "" the Democrats"" at home, or that he will march and fight with a view to the appearance which his exploits will make on "" the record."" We of course do not imagine that the fact of his haying been born abroad had any influence in causing his appointment, but it ought to have had, if it were known or remembered. As things stand, it constitutes one of his highest qualifications, and, we are quite satisfied, will contribute largely to his efficiency. It enables him to give his undivided attention to his work, and to consider his acts and speeches solely with reference to their effect on the enemy, and nut on his own political fortunes. It may seem strange that a man having been born in a foreign country should increase the chance of his making a good General in America; but so it is. ""A pity 'tis, but 'tis true."" We know by sorrowful experience that to the great mass of politicians the war is but a political campaign on a grand scale, and every General's ""points"" are scanned the minute he makes his appearance in the field, with a view to ""running him"" at some future period. The small extent to which Gen. MEADE is known to the public is, considering the good opinion generally entertained of him as a soldier, a subject of general comment and surprise; but we feel satisfied that the real explanation of it lies in the fact that he is not ""available."" If his nomination were even a possibility of the remotest kind, be would, by this time to a certainty, have had a knot of admirers, let it be ever so small, spreading the fame of his deeds to the four corners of the continent. The enemy would have trembled at his name; his soldiers would have worshipped the tracks of his boots; the persecuted Unionists of the South would have worn miniatures of him next the skin; the contumacious treatment of him by the President and Cabinet would have exceed shouts of horror and execration at various mass meetings; and, finally, thousands or, perhaps, millions of soldiers would be waiting for him to assume the command-in-chief, before enlisting and rushing on the foe. From all this, and much more, he has been providentially delivered by the lucky circumstance that his father and mother, lived in Spain when he first saw light. He consequently eaten on his duties in a far higher character than that worn by any man who has preceded him in that office -- simple soldier and honest gentleman, who loves his work and does it well, and whom politicians and wire-pullers and intriguers, of all sects and parties, pass by without notice. He has the satisfaction of knowing that he is not fit to be their tool, and that he will consequently never be besmirched by their slaver. We wish him all possible success, and take pleasure in calling the attention to the fact that all puffs and orations bestowed on him will be utterly wasted.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Commander--A Fortunate Circumstance.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Commander--A Fortunate Circumstance.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9588de83-5861-5aa3-90fd-54a87d300497,589,nyt://article/9588de83-5861-5aa3-90fd-54a87d300497,

The contest is the most remarkable that has taken place since the year preceding the Canadian rebellion. The differences of the situation, however, are so marked as to supply a subject of contrast, rather than comparison. The Ministerial party have gained, apparently, a working majority in the Assembly. Out of the one hundred and thirty member constituting the Lower House of Parliament, they can safely reckon on having secured from sixty-eight to seventy thorough-paced followers. But the singular part of the story is, that out of this aggregate, the Ministers count no less than forty-four from Western Canada; leaving them in a Lower Canada minority so great as to threaten a revival of the worst sectional strife that has ever beset the Province.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Canada Elections--New Phases in the British Provinces.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Canada Elections--New Phases in the British Provinces.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c19443a3-7ff1-5a7b-80b8-e4b51b6a701b,987,nyt://article/c19443a3-7ff1-5a7b-80b8-e4b51b6a701b,

Everybody admits that, in the main, the industry of the North is very flourishing. The farms teem, the workshops and the factories whir, and the bustle of trade fills the streets. Labor was never in greater demand, or more largely paid. The industry of the country has recovered from the terrible shock given it by the first outbreak of the war; it has adapted itself to the new condition of things, and in new channels is putting forth its energies with an activity, and with a success, seldom if ever surpassed before. Taking all classes of society into account, it may, with very little risk, be averred that in no year in the history of the country has there been so little destitution and so much physical the North, as has prevailed thus far in this third ef the war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Northern Prosperity a Damage to the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Northern Prosperity a Damage to the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f70bc409-2363-58cc-a75f-434308949d11,1046,nyt://article/f70bc409-2363-58cc-a75f-434308949d11,

The lower class of liquor-dealers in this City have formed a combination to resist the collection of this tax, and have engaged counsel to contest the, matter.

The war in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/03/archives/the-honors-of-war.html,The war in,"The War Department has sanctioned the issuing of medals and chevrons to the veterans who may rejoin the service after their regular period of enlistment has expired. Public virtue will not suffer by conspicuously distinguishing the men who have nobly offered their lives to maintain it. In every European army the gallantry of regiments, and even of individuals, is thus commemorated. The French soldier would rather part with his life than with one of the little medals that adorns his breast, and the English private who has been decorated for good service is notoriously more tractable, sober and amiable than he who has missed that honor. We have been too jealous of rewarding our humbler heroes with tangible tokens of their merit, arising mainly, perhaps, from the political fiction that to be a citizen is the highest honor to which one can aspire, and that beyond that nothing in the shape of medals and chevrons can be desired to complete the round of human happiness. It is true enough that the sacrifices made in the present war, by almost every one connected with its prosecution, can only be adequately rewarded by the restoration of peace, and of that universal prosperity that prevailed before war was in the land. But the distribution of official honors, representing the applause of a nation for which the soldier fights, will not retard this consummation, whilst, if it but contribute a thrill of patriotic pride to the recipient, it will serve a worthy purpose. Will not the younger members of the army be emulous of the deeds that have thus won recognition?

It was called up by the same Marquis of Clanricarde, who brought on the former debate, and, as our readers will recollect, fared so ill in it. His motion this time was for copies of any reports from the Admiral of the West India Squadron, concerning the protection of British merchantmen by British gunboats from seizure or visitation; and he supported his motion in a long and quite remarkable speech -- stating, in the first place, that ""a considerable amount of British commerce was engaged in, violating the blockade;"" he said there had also sprung up ""a large and perfectly legitimate trade with Mexico and the colonies, which was intercepted by the Federal cruisers."" Upon this bead he dilated, talked about the possibility of war, laid down some of the principles of the law of reprisals as being applicable, whatever were the decisions of our Prize Courts, one of which he spoke of as ""so absurd that no Court of high standing could come to it,"" and declared that nothing ""could justify war more completely than the defence of our trade and maritime rights."" He then proceeded to quote from shipping reports of the London Times, which narrated the proceedings of the British men-of-war in convoying British vessels. In one case ""Admiral WILKES had given characteristic orders that a British steamer, named the Ruby, was to be seized wherever found;"" whereupon the Ariadne was dispatched in search of the Ruby -- found her coming out of Matanzas and convoyed her to Havana, where, on returning from a voyage to Key West, he found Admiral WILKES ship lying near her. ""And of course,"" added the Marquis, ""the Ariadne did not limit her services to convoying her from Matanzas to Havana. We shall probably Lear by the next mail that she saw her clear of the attentions of Admiral WILKES and his cruisers before she left her finally, and that the Ruby has escaped the fate with which she has been threatened."" Before this lime the mail has brought the news to the Marquis that the Ruby, whose protection by convoy in this way he says was in accordance with what he had recommended, lies a wreck on the beach off Charleston, sunk by our fleet in endeavoring to break the blockade.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Blockade in the House of Lords.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Blockade in the House of Lords.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4f4858f-9698-5aa0-a4bf-56b406f1d3ca,1138,nyt://article/d4f4858f-9698-5aa0-a4bf-56b406f1d3ca,

It will figure as the starting point of State emancipation. The Constitutional Convention of Missouri on that day adopted an ordinance providing for the complete extinction of Slavery in that State. No act of the kind has been done since the formation of the Federal Constitution, save in a single instance; and that was on so small a scale that it scarcely deserves mention in this connection. We refer to the act provisionally abolishing Slavery in this State of New-York in 1799. But Slavery never existed here as a social system. At that time there were only about twenty thousand slaves in the State. In all the other so-called ""Free States"" combined, the entire aggregate of slaves, when they were most numerous, was only about seventeen thousand; and provision had been made, long before, for the emancipation -- Massachusetts and Pennsylvania doing this in 1780; Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New-Jersey, in 1784. Of the abolition in Western Virginia a few months since, we make no account, not only because the slaves there were but a mere handful, but because, considering the anomalous civil condition, it could hardly be called State action at all.

The regular closing time is some day next week, but to let the pupils ""have a mind unfettered and free"" for the Fourth, the vacation commences just before that day.

The reports which have previously reached us have been incorrect in essential particulars -- especially in regard to the battle of Wednesday. On that day the action was brought on by Gen. REYNOLDS, simply because he thought himself in superior force to that of the enemy. The action was not general, and was not intended to be so by Gen. MEADE. Our forces engaged on that day were repulsed, be-cause overpowered and outflanked, but they subsequently fell back to a position which they held, in the rear of Gettysburgh. On Thursday there was no fighting until 4 1/2 o'clock P.M. At that hour a bloody engagement was commenced, lasting until dark, and resulting in a substantial success to our arms -- the enemy being repulsed with great loss. The battle was commenced by the enemy with terrific force. Their entire army was engaged, and suffered a signal reverse. Yesterday the third day's tattle commenced, at 4 o'clock in the morning, the field of contest being on the south side of Gettysburgh, and the musketry fighting being wholly within the woods, while the artillery was posted on eminences, from which the timber had been cut. The attack on this day, as on the day previous, was commenced by the rebels, our right being the main point aimed at. There the fight was unceasing, until the date of our last dispatches from the battle-field -- 10 o'clock A.M. LONGSTREET'S and HILL'S corps were said to be engaged there, while EWELL was on the front. The enemy, as well as ourselves, had suffered heavily in prominent officers. Gen. BARKSDALE, of Mississippi, had been killed, and his body was within our lines. Prisoners on Thursday reported the death of Gen. LONGSTREET, and prisoners captured yesterday confirmed the report. Sixteen hundred prisoners had up to 10 o'clock been sent to the rear, and more were arriving. The result of the day's battle could not then be predicted, but the determination of our officers and men was to win. Gen. MEADE was managing his forces with admirable skill and prudence, and the troops were in the best of spirits. Important dispatches from JEFF DAVIS and the rebel Adjt.-Gen. COOPER had been captured by our scouts, which indicate anxiety for the position of Richmond, and refused to send LEE reinforcements from BEAUREGARD.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c104c69-780b-58c6-b678-da3018b1efef,848,nyt://article/3c104c69-780b-58c6-b678-da3018b1efef,

"Moran, Charles, Money",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/06/archives/personal.html,"Moran, Charles, Money","-- The New Haven Journal has this curious paragraph. ""Some ten months ago, Mr. Charles Monroe, of Fair Haven, was at Lagos and at Accra, on the Guinea Coast, whither he had sailed as Mate, with Capt. Post, in the Bark Elizabeth, and while there he drank of the water of that part of the world, without thinking to take the precautions commonly in use among the natives for the prevention of a terrible disease known as Guinea worm. It appears that the Africans always boil this water before drinking in order to destroy the minute, invisible egg of the worm, which is so small that it is absorbed by the blood vessels from the stomach, and is in that manner distributed in different parts of the body, usually the legs, where it is hatched, and after a long time, makes its appearance in the shape of a white, thread-like worm, pointed on both ends, and it twines and twists all about the muscles and veins and arteries, producing no particular feeling of uneasiness until some part of its body comes near the skin, when bad inflammations take place. It was in March last that Mr. MONROE began to be troubled with them, and for three months he has not walked a step. He is now in the Connecticut State' Hospital under treatment, and one worm has been taken from the bottom of his foot that measures over two feet long. The way it is done is this: When the surface of the skin is so pricked or irritated as to show where the ""critter"" is, a thread is fastened to him and a small weight attached to the other end of the thread. The worm gets tired of pulling against so steady a strain and gives ground a trifle day by day, and as he comes out, a little spool winds him up until he is all out. The pain is very great -- for forty nights Mr. MONROE hardly slept on account of the suffering. One worm is now in process of being drawn from his heel, and those medical men who have never seen a case of the kind are much interested. Great care has to be taken not to pull too hard, because the worm would break and the trouble be much prolonged. It first appears under the skin like a varicose vein, and after a painful boil has been formed and broken, the head of the animal is discovered.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/300cf876-c211-5167-b4a1-c15da4f352c6,414,nyt://article/300cf876-c211-5167-b4a1-c15da4f352c6,

The meeting, held at the Academy of Music, was gotten up under the auspices of the New-York Democratic Union Association, and the announcement that Gov. SEYMOUR. of this State, Ex- Gov. Seymour, of Connecticut and Gov. Parker, of New-Jersey, had accepted invitations to be present and address the meeting, drew together a very large audience, in which the ladies were well represented. At two o'clock, the hour appointed for the exercises to commence, but few seats remained unoccupied, and these were soon filed. The musical part of the programme was well executed, though it was observable that selections of a national and patriotic character were not given the greatest prominence. Among the distinguished persons upon the platform, in addition to the speakers for the occasion, were Ex-Gov. BANTLEY, of Ohio, Hon. W.H. ARMSTRONG. Secretary of State of Ohio, GIDEON J. TUCKER, Prof. MO[???]. Prof. CY[???] MASON. Hon. S.J. TILDEN, Rev. Dr. CUMMINGS and HENRY GRINNELL AS the speakers came to the front of the platform, they were received with enthusiastic applause, and ""three times three"" were given for Gov. SEYMOUR. PHILIP W. B[???]GS was selected as the presiding officer. C. Go[???] GUNTHER read the Declaration of Independence and Hon. BLI P. NORTON read the guarantees of the Constitution. During these readings, all those passages which could be construed into parallels between the tyrannical usurpations of the King of England and the so called usurpations and [???]ies of President LINCOLN, were loudly applauded.

The great battle of Friday -- the third in the series -- proves to have been by far the most desperate one of the war, and to have resulted in the complete discomfiture of the enemy. At daylight LEE's right-wing batteries opened upon our left, and shortly afterward those of his centre followed, but little damage being done by his fire. Soon afterward an impetuous infantry attack was made upon our right, which was repulsed after a sharp struggle -- the enemy leaving a considerable number of prisoners in our hands. There was then a lull of several hours, and at 10 o'clock LEE, having massed about 80 pieces of artillery, opened a terrific cannonade upon our centre, but their range being imperfect, it did comparatively little damage to us, and was replied to by our artillery with the best effect. Under cover of this fire, LEE advanced his columns of infantry, and made several desperate attempts to carry our lines by assault, but each successive charge was repulsed with terrific havoc in the rebel ranks. About 4 1/2 o'clock P.M., the fire of the enemy's artillery slackerred, and at 5 it had entirely ceased, and their infantry had withdrawn to cover. During the latter we captured upwards of 3,000 prisoners, and lost but very few. LONGSTREET is very positively stated to have been mortally wounded, and to have fallen into our hands. Gen. MILL is said by prisoners to have been killed outright during the battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION. GENERAL NEWS.

Extravagant Estimates of the Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/07/archives/danger-of-extravagant-estimates-of-the-late-victory.html,Extravagant Estimates of the Victory,"There is some danger that, after LEE has been driven from Pennsylvania, the Government, as well as large numbers of the public, will cheat themselves into the belief that the result is greater than it really is, and forget the vastness of the task which still remains to be accomplished. We have all been so scared by the invasion, and the consequences of any failure in resisting it have assumed such monstrous proportions in our eyes, that we shall be, probably, tempted to forget, after it is over, that just as the invasion was a means to an end, and not the end itself, so is our repulse of the invader. LEE came into Pennsylvania not simply for the purpose of harrying the North, but that by harrying the North he might coerce it into peace, and into an acknowledgment of the independence of the Confederacy. And so also we, in rising to resist him, have been seeking not simply his expulsion from free soil, but the destruction of the power which he serves. The battle of Gettysburgh has not been fought solely to save Baltimore and Philadelphia, but to crush the Confederacy, and it is highly necessary that through all our rejoicings over our successes this should be kept constantly in mind. People are apt, when they find an enterprise very much more difficult than they expected when beginning it, to narrow the circle of their desires as they proceed, and to sit down satisfied at last at a point far short of the original goal.

It is undoubtedly to see that the defeat of the rebel army of LEE be made complete and irretrievable. All other duties are secondary; all other necessities less necessary. To this work every energy should be bent, and all available columns, regiments and soldiers should be assigned. It would be an excellent thing to capture Richmond, and we should like to see it done; there are a hundred other duties to which troops could be put, -- none of which could be called altogether needless or contemptible. But the comprehensive duty -- the one thing the achievement of which, involves in itself success in a thousand other things, is the destruction of the main rebel army. It is that which for two years has barred our progress to Richmond; it is that which has prevented our establishing the National authority in Virginia and the Carolinas; it is that which has twice driven our banners back from Manassas -- from the Peninsula -- twice from the Rappahannock, and twice from the Upper Potomac. It is that army which stands, and has for two long years stood, as the great bulwark of the rebel Confederacy. It is that which at last had the audacity to assume the offensive on our soil, penetrate the great and populous State of Pennsylvania, threaten the capital of the nation and imperil the very existence of our Government. It is that army which on Thursday and Friday last dashed itself again and again upon the Army of the Potomac; but which, thanks to Heaven was driven from the field with appalling loss, defeated and discomfited. It was discomfited, but not, as it must be, utterly destroyed. Until it is destroyed, our prime work will be to effect that object. If it were destroyed, the rebel monster would be pierced in the head, pierced in the heart -- and death in all its members, from Richmond to Charleston, Chattanooga and Vicksburgh, would speedily ensue.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Imperative Work of the Hour, and How to Accomplish It.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Imperative Work of the Hour, and How to Accomplish It.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b03e0a4b-6f19-574e-ac6e-fb21e13ef655,650,nyt://article/b03e0a4b-6f19-574e-ac6e-fb21e13ef655,

In all the details that reach us of the Titanic conflict that raged during three days about Gettysburgh, no fact shines out more conspicuously and cheeringly than the fortitude and unflinching valor of our men. They were equal to every crisis in the varying fortunes of the fight. Was it needed to stand firm and unswerving in line of battle, while the air was darkened by the missiles of a hundred guns parked by the rebels to clear the way for an infantry assault? -- there was not a corps in the Union Army that was not equal to the duty; and at least half of the corps composing the army at some time during the battle, were called on to endure this fearful, fiery trial. Was it needed after standing for hours before this withering blast of concentrated artillery fire, to receive the shock of the rebel army, massed and thrown forward in columns, in those impetuous charges that have so often before proved successful -- the veteran soldiers of MEADE's army were ready for the fierce onsets, and met them, steel to steel, as only the brave can meet a foe. Was it needed to fall back before overwhelming odds, yet not to fly; but to give blow for blow in falling back, and watch for the opportune moment to change retreat into victory and win back the lost ground? This, too, the army of the Potomac was capable of, as it again and again illustrated in the three days' battles around Gettysburgh.

Magazines for July,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/08/archives/the-july-magazines.html,Magazines for July,"-- Harper's New Monthly Magazine, for July, relies for attraction on the old features that have hitherto proved so satisfactory to its readers without venturing on any startling novelty. Mr. LOSSING continues the illustrated narratives of the war of 1812, with a condensed and well written account of Gen. HARRISON's ""Northwest Campaign."" ""An American Family in Germany,"" is the title of a paper by J. Ross BROWNE, containing information that would, in ordinary times, be welcome to many. Some of the details -- as the ""seven small children"" -- seem rather mythical, but the general picture of German home-life, its advantages and disadvantages, is cleverly and amusingly related, and the writer's pencil comes, as usual, in aid of his pen. Dr. OSGOOD's ""Easter Flowers"" is an eloquent plea for the revival and encouragement of the picturesque old ceremonial observances that connect the changing seasons with the home affections and the genial humanities of the Christian Church. ""England in the Good Old Times,"" is one of the most striking chapters from Dr. DRAPER's ""Intellectual Development of Europe."" Mr. TROLLOPE's and Miss EVANS' serial stories are continued. ""Coal and Petroleum"" is an article on the subject now assuming gigantic commercial proportions. The usual variety of short stories and sketches of society, criticism and chit-chat, proves the editor's skill in making up a miscellany that caters to the taste of all.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE JULY MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE JULY MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7309a011-4a6a-5fa7-a2a5-1c798032009f,627,nyt://article/7309a011-4a6a-5fa7-a2a5-1c798032009f,

In 1857 he went to New-Mexico, and became attached to the United States Commissary Department in that distant frontier. Subsequently he visited Utah, and was engaged there in the same capacity. Love of adventure frequently led him to make long journeys through the mountains on horseback, and it was there, doubtless, that he gained such a knowledge and mastery of the horse as subsequently gave him the reputation of being the best rider in the army. News of the rebellion reached him in the Summer of 1861, and he immediately hastened home to join the Eighth Illinois cavalry, which his uncle was then organizing. He was made Battalion Quartermaster, but soon thereafter promoted to the Captaincy of Co. K of that celebrated regiment.

Wheeler >amp; Wilson Patents Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/09/archives/rights-of-patenteesa-singular-case.html,Wheeler >amp; Wilson Patents Case,"We publish in our legal columns this morning a decision by Judge NELSON, in the United States Circuit Court, which presents one of the most curious legal imbroglios that has occurred in our Courts. It arises under the Patent laws, which have been so fruitful in great litigations, and is one of the phases of the sewing-machine controversy. A brief statement of the matter will not be uninteresting. The contest is between the owners of the Singer, the Grover & Baker, and the Wheeler & Wilson sewing-machines, on one side, and one J.G. WILSON, who is the assignee of an old patent issued to AKINS & FELTHOUSEN, on the other. This patent has been before the Courts frequently, in sewing-machine controversies, and Judge NELSON himself, in 1860, decided that as between their patent and that issued to A.B. WILSON, on which the Grover & Baker and Wheeler & Wilson companies rest their claim, the invention of A.B. WILSON was prior. The assignee of AKINS& FELTHOUSEN, however, did not rest satisfied with that decision. He applied to the Commissioner of Patents for a reissue to him of the Akins & Felthousen patent. The owner of the Singer patent thereupon claimed that there was an interference between this patent and his own. The parties had a hearing before the Commissioner, who decided in favor of SINGER, and refused to issue the patent applied for. J.G. WILSON still was not satisfied with this decision against him, but appealed to Judge DUNLOP, sitting in the United States Circuit Court at Washington, and the Judge, after hearing the parties, reversed the decision of the Commissioner, and ordered the reissued patent to be made out to J.G. WILSON. The owners of the A.B. Wilson patent thereupon stepped in, declaring that this proposed reissue at any rate interfered with theirs. These parties were heard before the Commissioner, who again decided against J.G. WILSON, and declined to make the reissue for which he applied. Another appeal was taken by J.G. WILSON to Judge DUNLOP from this decision. The Judge decided -- and this is a curious point in the case -- not that the Commissioner was wrong in his decision on the merits between these parties; not that there was no interference between these two patents, but that on the former hearing in the controversy between J.G. WILSON and SINGER, he had ordered the patent to be reissued to J.G. WILSON, and that that order must be obeyed, whether there was any interference between it and any other patent or not; deciding, in fact, that there could be but one hearing in reference to the interference of a patent with any and all others. He thereupon again directed the Commissioner to make out the reissue to J.G. WILSON, and this order the Commissioner obeyed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rights of Patentees--A Singular Case', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rights of Patentees--A Singular Case', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/460962c3-2093-50e5-ba7f-8d820982ce13,728,nyt://article/460962c3-2093-50e5-ba7f-8d820982ce13,

MEADE battle, as there was apparently no hope of his being able to cross the Potomac with his army without the certainty of an attack. The rise in the Potomac amounts to a freshet, which is likely to continue for at least a week, and even if the rebels had pontoons, it is a question whether they could make them available. Meantime our troops are concentrating from all points against the rebel army, and there is reason to believe that the case of LEE is desperate, if not entirely hopeless. There is no confirmation of the report by way of Harrisburgh, published yesterday, that a battle had already commenced near Williamsport. It probably grew out of the operations of our cavalry, who are continually harassing the enemy, picking up prisoners, and destroying the rebel transportation.

Renews its Advocacy of Foreign Intervention,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/09/archives/foreign-intervention-again.html,Renews its Advocacy of Foreign Intervention,"The Tribune renews its advocacy of Foreign Intervention in our affairs. It sees no reason why we should not accept the good offices of France, if NAPOLEON sees fit to tender them, and welcome his aid in restoring peace with the rebels. It counsels great circumspection as to the terms of such a negotiation, and holds out the idea that Foreign Powers ought to urge the rebels to lay down their arms. If they choose to give such advice, of course we can have no objection. But this does not need our assent. LOUIS NAPOLEON, if he sees fit, can advise the rebels to stop the war at any moment he may choose. He is said to be in constant and close communication with the rebel emissaries in Europe, and cannot lack opportunities to make his wishes known to the rebel Government. He does not need our consent for any such proceeding as this.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Foreign Intervention Again.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Foreign Intervention Again.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6d7bec86-8084-5428-8cc7-d730078b3a63,834,nyt://article/6d7bec86-8084-5428-8cc7-d730078b3a63,

"Paul, Gen. G. R., killed in battle",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/10/archives/the-late-gen-paul.html,"Paul, Gen. G. R., killed in battle","This officer, GABRIEL RENK PAUL, who was killed in the battle near Gettysburgh, on the 2d inst., had been a long time in the service, and was highly esteemed, as well for his personal as his military qualities. He was a native of Missouri, and was appointed from this State a cadet in the Military Academy in the year 1830. He was almost the only one in his class who has received distinction during the present war, though a number of his mates won honor on the fields of Mexico. Graduating in June, 1834, with credit, he entered the military service immediately as Second Lieutenant by brevet, and attained the full rank of that grade six months later. He was promoted First Lieutenant, Oct. 26, 1836, but it was nearly ten years before he rose again, which was to the rank of Captain, April 19, 1846. In the Mexican war he behaved with conspicuous gallantry, and was brevetted Major Sept. 13. 1847, for his meritorious conduct in the battle of Chepultepec, He was also distinguished at Cerro Gordo and Contreras. Just previous to the rebellion, we find him third Captain in the line of the Seventh Infantry. This regiment was some years ago stationed near this city, and many of our readers will remember its fine appearance on the occasion of the funeral of Col. BENTON. On the 22d of April, 1861, Capt. PAUL was promoted full Major, transferred to the Eighth Infantry, and soon after was ordered to New-Mexico. It was here that he became particularly distinguished in the latter part of 1861 and early part of 1862, in assisting in the expulsion of the Texans under SIBLEY from that Territory. Upon the rebels menacing the Territory, Col. CANBY, who was in command of the department, placed Maj. PAUL as commandant at Fort Union, while he, Col. (now General) CANBY, moved down three hundred miles to Fort Craig. About this time the subject of our sketch was promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, and had permission to command the Fourth regiment New-Mexican Volunteers. Col. PAUL received great credit for his promptitude and energy in fitting out and expediting a column to march out and attack the enemy, who had then taken possession of Santa Fe, and threatened to overrun the whole Territory. The column sent out by Col. PAUL was composed of the First Colorado, Capt. RUTTER's and Capt. CLAFLIN's batteries, and a battalion of the Filth Regulars, all under Col. SLOUGH, of the Colorado Volunteers. A short time afterwards, however, Col. SLOUGH resigned, and the expedition returned, somewhat disheartened, to Fort Union. Col. PAUL at once re-organized the troops, and putting himself at their head, moved out on the 6th of April of last year. One of the first things done by Col. PAUL was to send back to Santa Fe quicker than they came, a party sent by Gen. SIBLEY, under a flag of truce, ostensibly to effect the release of some paroled Union prisoners, but in reality to delay the junction of PAUL's forces with those of Col. CANBY. This was at Han Jose, near Bernel Springs. After a fight at Apache Canon, in which the rebels were defeated with considerable loss, Col. PAUL proceeded to the vicinity of Fort Craig, (in May) and successfully effected a junction with Col. CANBY at La Tijera in Carmuel Pass. The rebels had concentrated at Paralta, and PAUL's column moved upon them from the north, and CANBY's from the east. An engagement ensued, which, however, was of short duration, as the enemy fled in a panic, retreating upon El Paso. In recognition of his New-Mexican services, Col. PAUL was promoted a Brigadier-General of Volunteers in September last, and assigned to duty under Gen. CASEY, in Washington City, where his talents for organization were displayed in a manner altogether satisfactory to the military authorities. Invidious tongues have accused him of a lurking sympathy for the secession cause but there probably never was any foundation for the impeachment of his loyalty, and of his fidelity to his Government he has just added all the testimony that could be required of a brave and true soldier. His death will be mourned in St. Louis, where he was born, and where he has many family connections.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATE GEN.

This success compels the speedy fall of Port Hudson -- if, indeed, the two events do not prove cotemporaneous -- and then every rebel cord will be unloosed that has, ever since the rebellion, bound the National aorta -- the Mississippi River. We have taken frequent occasion hitherto to point out in what way the loss of the Mississippi River would embarrass and weaken the rebellion. In the first place, it cuts off utterly all the supplies of beef and bread that the rebel armies long derived in such abundance from Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas. This is of itself an exceedingly heavy disaster. It is well known that during the first two years of the war an immense amount of the rebel subsistence came from the States west of the Mississippi. Texas, it was boasted, could have supplied the entire population of the Confederate States with meat for years. And no one who has ever seen her almost limitless prairies, and the countless herds that lived upon them luxuriantly the year through, doubted the fact. Western Louisiana was similarly rich in animal life. Arkansas and Texas were remarkable for wheat and Indian corn. The Confederate States had reason to be proud of the food-producing and war-sustaining capacity of the vast Secession districts west of the Mississippi River; and it had equal reason to be confident in and feel flattered by the haste, and heartiness, and even passionate enthusiasm with which the population of that trans-Mississippi region embraced the fortunes of the rebellion. The rebel authorities of the States of Arkansas and Texas have boasted that from the records of the Adjutant General's office of the Confederate States they could show that each State had put into the field as many soldiers as there were voters in the respective States, at recent elections.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Arkansas and Texas', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Arkansas and Texas', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6cd9d20-ae08-5706-b69b-2c24bcf08861,517,nyt://article/d6cd9d20-ae08-5706-b69b-2c24bcf08861,

But the charge on national and municipal credit, of keeping up a vast army by bounties, was too great to be long borne.

As the laborious digger and delver among old Dutch manuscripts in search of the first faint traces of the municipal existence of N???ew Amsterdam, or as the recorder of the rising glories and meridian splendors of the New-York of our own day, his name will meet the future investigator as every step. All that honest JOHN STOWE did for Elizabethan London has been effected by him under equal difficulties, and no one among us has wrought so much, to deserve the character which THOMAS HEARNE de-ired to be the sole inscription on his tomb: ""A lover and preserver of Antiquities.""

Independently of the Immense mass of statistical information that renders the work indispensable to all citizens, the new volume is very rich in antiquarian treasures, embracing several documents of great interest, recently disinterred from the collections in the British Museum, by Mr. GEORGE H. MOORE, of the New-York Historical Society. Amongst them is the earliest known survey of Manhattan Island, copied in fac-simile from the original. It was in all probability executed by order of Col NICHOLLS, and transmitted to the Duke of York soon after the English the conquest in 1664. It is so correct and conformable to the natural configuration as to be recognized at a glance, and represents the small ??? at the southern end of the island, and the few scattered dwellings the only evidences of human occu???, as just peeping out from the untrodden ??? which envious them on every side.

It does not appear whether it is intended, but it is evidently implied by the form in which this announcement is made, that balloons have been found of no value in the conduct of military operations, or at least not of sufficient value to justify the expense and trouble of them. This will excite some surprise, for the public has been led to put considerable confidence in balloon reconnoissances from facts heretofore given. And the rare use made by the rebels of similar means of observation has always been attributed to their lack of fit material for the construction of balloons and for the preparation of gas to inflate them. There is not more than one authenticated case of a balloon reconnoissance by the rebels since the war began, and that occurred in its early stages. If they satisfied themselves by one experiment of the inapplicability of balloons to purposes of war in this country they deserve credit for dropping them so soon and avoiding the expense.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Use of Balloons in War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Use of Balloons in War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Maryland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e99baa97-e116-5f9d-abc5-2229dfd3e599,1040,nyt://article/e99baa97-e116-5f9d-abc5-2229dfd3e599,

What It Means,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/12/archives/what-intervention-means.html,What It Means,"In our Havana correspondence, published yesterday, there occurs a somewhat remarkable and instructive document--the decree of confiscation or sequestration issued by the French functionary in Mexico. From it may be gotten an idea of the beneficent workings of French intervention. It provides that sequestration will be imposed upon all the real estate and personal property of such Mexicans as adhere to their own country; and in this category are comprised not merely such as ""carry arms against the French intervention,"" but also such as are in a ""state of hostility against France"" -- whatever that means -- and even such as had fled from their homes for fear of the invader and had not returned to them at the date of the issue of the decree. The political prefect of each State, an appointee and tool of the invaders, with three other persons, appointees and tools of his, are to form a committee to designate the individuals thus subject to confiscation, and to make out lists of their real and personal property. This will doubtless furnish the French Government and its allies, the Mexican traitors, a large amount of plunder; while the method of its execution will furnish room for the practice of a prodigious amount of corruption, and the exercise of a merciless and malignant social persecution.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Intervention Means.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Intervention Means.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ec754e94-46cc-507c-8a5c-d423e4816c5a,416,nyt://article/ec754e94-46cc-507c-8a5c-d423e4816c5a,

SHERMAN, and since ascertained to be a Government detective. After reaching the other side he was conveyed to Jersey City, and it is believed sent on to Washington. The charges against him, if any, have not been divulged. The circumstances of the arrest appear to be these: SHERMAN made frequent visits to the Pierrepont House since Mr. MOORE came there, and became very intimate with him, and it is supposed that he obtained sufficient information by ""pumping"" to warrant his arrest. SHERMAN went by the name of Jones during this time. He not only became intimate with Mr. MOORE but with his family. About 9 o'clock on Thursday night he persuaded Mr. MOORE to accompany him to New-York, and that is the last seen of him. On Friday morning SHERMAN, accompanied by another Government detective, called at the house, and requested the privilege of searching Mr. MOORE's baggage. The proprietor, Mr. BURNS, told him he should allow no one to enter their rooms without the consent of Mrs. MOORE, who was absent at the time, having gone to New-York in search of her husband. SHERMAN then left, and the other detective occupied a room opposite Mr. MOORE's apartments. A short time thereafter SHERMAN returned in company with Mrs. MOORE, who consented that he should examine their baggage. The detectives proceeded to do so in presence of Mrs. MOORE and daughter and the proprietor of the house. They overhauled everything, and took possession of a few scraps of manuscript and several daguerreotypes, with which they left. Mrs. MOORE expressing confidence that there was nothing in the trunks to implicate her husband in any respect, or in any offence, interposed no objections whatever. Mr. MOORE is about 60 years of age, and is a native of Maryland. Col. SHERMAN stated that Mr. MOORE's real name was HYLAND, and that he was an agent of the Southern Confederacy. He also informed Mr. BURNS that he should call again on Monday, (to-day,) and inform him what disposition had been made of Mr. MOORE.

Life and Services of,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/13/archives/majgen-samuel-p-heintzleman.html,Life and Services of,"On the night of May 21, 1861, the writer hereof, returning at a late hour to his hotel in Washington, saw in the shade of some stately buildings on the avenue a regiment of soldiers. For days before that there had been uneasy rumors of actual war to supersede the armed and arming neutrality which had reigned up to that moment. Would the Government ""invade"" Virginia? Would it send its mudsills to the sacred soil? The question was about to be answered, for the regiment we saw was the Michigan First -- since known to fame -- and as we passed along the street other regiments, hushed and silent, debouched from the various crossings. To go to our hotel, lead pistols, change boots and hire a carriage was a brief and easy task. The driver had directions to follow the troops until he was stopped. The ""stop"" happened at the eastern terminus of the Long Bridge where, all our efforts to cross being futile, we stood and witnessed the first grand invasion of Virginia. The scene was beautiful. From out a heaven ???peace looked down a placid moon at its full. On two streets that there converge lay a mass of 8,000 troops, at that time an immense Army. A group of officers on horseback gathered near the head of the bridge, and presently came among them one who, by the light of a lantern, communicated to them their orders. I could hear his voice, since grown familiar to thousand's on many a battle-field. It was that of Maj. EEINTZELMAN. First infantry, U.S.A., at that time; since then became Maj.-Gen. HEINTZELMAN, the the Marshal NEY of the armies of the Union. ""You understand it, gentlemen,"" closed the brief directions which opened the terrible programme of this war. A low whistle scanded, the tramp of a regiment smote the planks of the bridge, the bayonets glistened in the moonlight, and a half-hour later Virginia was ""actually Invaded,"" Arlington Heights were secured, and the next morning was born the phrase, since repeated ???d nauseam, ""Washington is safe.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MAJ.-GEN.

"-- We again urge upon persons who belong to the pell-  mell school of strategy to hold their tongues and rein in their passions for awhile yet. It has been to them a nine-days' wonder that Gen. MEADE, during the last nine days, has not gobbled up Gen. LEE. Had a pell-mell man been in command of the Army of the Potomac, he would have mounted a fast horse, drawn his sword, and rushed out at full gallop after the rebels on the morning of the Fourth of July, with his whole army behind him on the double-quick. It is true that he and his army might have been brought to a sudden halt, and perhaps compelled unexpectedly to take the back track, had they rushed against some strong position where the rebels might be strongly posted, with perhaps a hundred and fifty pieces of rifled ordnance and fifty thousand troops to do battle. But then, wouldn't they have had another big fight, with prodigious heaps of killed and wounded on both sides? Would not this have produced an immense sensation, and illustrated in deeper crimson the beauties of pell-mell strategy? It is impossible to convince this class of people that war consists of anything but simply fighting and killing. They grow very loud-mouthed always after a battle, and immediately want another -- overlooking the fact that in all great wars battles are but the consummation of long and intricate speculations and manoeuvres in strategy. There are few campaigns that can be justly or intelligently criticised while they are in progress -- as has been often illustrated in this war, where we have seen so many campaigns handsomely begun end in disaster. The present campaign of LEE had for its object the capture of Washington, the crushing of our army and the humiliation of the North.

Poltroonery of at Gettysburgh,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/13/archives/inhumanity-and-poltroonery-of-the-rebel-surgeons.html,Poltroonery of at Gettysburgh,"-- The infamy and cowardice of the rebel Surgeons in deserting the men of their army wounded at the battle of Gettysburgh is without parallel in the war. In every battle in which fortune has been adverse to our arms, and our wounded have been temporarily left within the rebel lines, the brave and self-denying Surgeons of the regiments have either remained with the fallen, or have immediately applied for passes within the rebel lines that they might be cared for. But the rebels left lying on the field many thousands of their wounded -- Dr. VELLUM reports the number at ten thousand -- and left with them neither Surgeons, stores nor nurses, but literally abandoned them to their fate. These men complained bitterly of the cruelty of their Surgeons in thus forsaking them, but bore up patiently under their sufferings for many days until they could be attended to by some of our own Surgeons, most of whom had at once to hasten forward with their own regiments to other fields. We published yesterday a thrilling letter from the battle-field, written on Thursday last, six days after the close of the contest, which stated that there were hundreds of the rebel wounded not then reached, -- that hundreds of them it had been found impossible even to cover and that they lay in the woods with broken limbs and torn bodies, drenched in the rain, some having even been drowned in the floods which rose around them. Of course everything possible was being done for them, and doctors, wound-dressers and nurses were arriving. We were not prepared for, and could not have foreseen, the flight of all the rebel Surgeons. It will be long remembered to their disgrace, both by the unfortunate rebels and by the whole country.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INHUMANITY AND POLTROONERY OF THE REBEL SURGEONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INHUMANITY AND POLTROONERY OF THE REBEL SURGEONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db1baa57-e2d0-56e2-b3ec-1cfabe77f98c,299,nyt://article/db1baa57-e2d0-56e2-b3ec-1cfabe77f98c,

Presidential candidates and the command of the army,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/14/archives/presidential-candidates-and-the-command-of-the-army.html,Presidential candidates and the command of the army,"Shortly after Gen. MEADE's accession to the command of the army, we mentioned as a circumstance much in his favor that, having been born in Spain he was not eligible for the Presidency, and added that the campaign was in the eyes of most politicians a political as well as military campaign, and that for this reason it was desirable that the General in command of the Army of the Potomac should not be ""available"" as a candidate. It since appears that Gen. MEADE's father having been resident abroad in an official capacity at the time of his son's birth, the General is legally a native, and consequently might be President if he was nominated and got votes enough. Since his appearance in his present position, too, he has won a battle -- one of the greatest battles of modern times, and the first great battle on open ground in which the Army of the Potomac has driven the enemy fairly off the field. He is consequently, therefore, at this moment, one of the most inviting bones that was ever thrown into the political kennel, and we strongly advise the dogs of faction to go to work at him at once. We believe we gave the animals some pain by our insinuation that when they were barking at the President's heels about the command of the army and the conduct of the war, they were simply hunting for prey; that, in fact, to use the language of the Richmond Enquirer of June 12, about them: ""This whole two years' war, and the two years more war that has yet to be gone through, is itself, in their eye, but a Presidential campaign, only somewhat more vivacious than ordinary."" We are, however, of the same opinion still, but as we do not wish to hurt their feelings more than may be necessary, we urge upon them Gen. MEADE's ""availability"" as a slight atonement for the apparent roughness of our language. But if they wish to profit by our advice, they really must not lose time. There has not been much done by way of puffing him so far, but it is not too late to begin. We beg to supply a few facts for the inauguration of the great movement.

"-- When Winchester was evacuated by the forces under Gen. MILROY there were left behind a number of women and children, relatives of the officers and men stationed there. It had been represented to the women that the place could be held, so well was it forti???ed, no matter what number of the enemy should engage in the attack. This made them indifferent about leaving, and very few of them did so. When the town was taken possession of by the rebels they took these women and children prisoners and conveyed them to Richmond, where they were placed in Castle Thunder. Those of them who had any clothing, except what was necessary for immediate use, were deprived of it, and it was sold at auction. After being kept in confinement until last Thursday, they were sent in a flag of truce boat to Annapolis, and from thence to Washington, where the Government took charge of them and provided for their transportation to their homes. Fifteen of the women, with some eight or ten children, arrived to this city on Wednesday night and were lodged and entertained at the Union Volunteer Refreshment Saloon. They state that their treatment in Richmond was as good as could have been expected; that while in Castle Thunder they were fed on wheat bread and rye coffee, and had the privilege of buying such food as they could afford to do. Occasionally bacon was given to them, but it was in such a state that it could not be eaten. The last three days they had fresh beef. They were not permitted to know anything that was going on outside of Castle Thunder. On the day of their departure they saw a number of soldiers parading about the streets of Richmond. Several of the women were wives and mothers of Ohio Volunteers, others belonged to Pennsylvania.

Excitement about Morgan's Raid,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/14/archives/morgans-raid-and-the-panic-in-cincinnati.html,Excitement about Morgan's Raid,"-- The raid of JOHN MORGAN into the States of Indiana and Ohio, will go far to mitigate the surprise that was felt at the unresisted advance of LEE's cavalry into Pennsylvania. MORGAN's troopers presented themselves, about a week ago, almost unannounced, on the line of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, about thirty miles south of Louisville, where a railway train was stopped and robbed, and a bridge burnt, so as to delay pursuit. The people of Louisville flattered themselves that MORGAN then retreated. But he was next heard from on the banks of the Ohio River, forty miles below Louisville; where he seized two passing steamers, crossed the river into Indiana, burnt one of the boats, and immediately moved northward, aiming apparently for the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad. His course was soon turned easterly, as if he meant to strike at New-Albany, just opposite to the City of Louisville.

Arson, theft and cowardly ferocity seemed to be the animating impulse of a very large portion of the mass that composed it. We have never witnessed a more disgusting or more humiliating sight than was offered in every street which these gangs of outlaws tramped through with their hideous uproar. A large portion of them were mere boys, and their special delight seemed to be to hunt negroes. One would have supposed that every colored man, woman and child must be a wild beast -- to judge from the savage and eager delight with which they were chased and beaten and stoned by these wretched brutes in human form. It seems inconceivable that so much of pure, unadulterated ferocity -- so much of that clear, undiluted cruelty which feels a keen and ecstatic relish in the infliction of torture upon others for its own sake, can dwell in the human heart.

Attack on Tribune Office; Burning of Colored Orphan Asylum,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/14/archives/the-mob-in-newyork-resistance-to-the-draftrioting-and-bloodshed.html,Attack on Tribune Office; Burning of Colored Orphan Asylum,"The initiation of the draft on Saturday in the Ninth Congressional District was characterized by so much order and good feeling as to well-nigh dispel the forebodings of tumult and violence which many entertained in connection with the enforcement of the conscription in this City. Very few, then, were prepared for the riotous demonstrations which yesterday, from 10 in the morning until late at night, prevailed almost unchecked in our streets. The authorities had counted upon more or less resistance to this measure of the Government after the draft was completed, and the conscripts were repaired to take their place in the ranks, and at that time they would have been fully prepared to meet it; but no one anticipated resistance at so early a stage in the execution of the law, and, consequently, both the City and National authorities were totally unprepared to meet it. The abettors of the riot knew this, and in it they saw their opportunity. We say abettors of the riot, for it is abundantly manifest that the whole affair was concocted on Sunday last by a few wire-pullers, who, after they saw the ball fairly in motion yesterday morning prudently kept in the back ground. Proof of this is found in the fact that as early as 9 o'clock, some laborers employed by two or three railroad companies, and in the iron foundries a the eastern side of the City, formed in procession in the Twenty-second Ward, and visited the different workshops in the upper wards, where large numbers were employed, and compelled them, by threats in some instances, to cease their work. As the crowd augmented, their shouts and disorderly demonstrations became more formidable. The number of men who thus started out in their career of violence and blood, did not probably at first exceed threescore. Scarcely had two dozen names been called, when a crowd, numbering perhaps 500, suddenly made an irruption in front of the building, (corner of Third-avenue and Forty-sixth-street,) attacking it with clubs, stones, brickbats and other missiles. The upper part of the building was occupied by families, who were terrified beyond measure at the smashing, of the windows, doors and furniture. Following these missiles, the mob rushed furiously into the office on the first floor, where the draft was going on, seizing the books, papers, records, lists, &c. all of which they destroyed, except those contained in a large iron safe. The drafting officers were set upon with stones and clubs, and, with the reporters for the Press and others, had to make a hasty exit through the rear. They did not escape scatheless, however, as one of the enrolling officers was struck a savage blow with a stone, which will probably result fatally, and several others were injured.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE MOB IN NEW-YORK.; Resistance to the Draft--Rioting and Bloodshed.

Since Friday, however, men have been flocking to the military and naval offices to join the service. All the double battalion regiments recently added to the army are taking advantage of the excitement, and have sent out independent recruiting parties. Commissions are given to outsiders who bring in men. The Marine corps now consists of 3,000 rank and file -- 1,000 having recently been added to the usual force. There are some 35,000 men of all grades and ranks attached to our ships-of-war, but many more are needed in consequence of the number daily receiving their discharges.

The call was signed at about 9 o'clock in the morning, before the riot up town had begun, and the real object o??? the meeting was to authorize the Corporation Counsel to associate such eminent counsel with him as he might choose, and take steps to test the constitutionality of the National Enrollment Act, under which the draft is being made. Alderman FARLEY was the prime mover in the matter. The whole plan failed, however, for want of a quorum. A quorum failed to appear because of the excited state of feeling in the community, consequent upon the riot up town.

Murder of Col. O'Brien,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/15/archives/the-reign-of-the-rabble-continuation-of-the-riotthe-mob-increased.html,Murder of Col. O'Brien,"The reign of the mob which was inaugurated on Monday morning has not yet ceased, although today will probably witness the end of its infamous usurpation. All Monday night the rioters, unchecked, prosecuted their depredations, and yesterday morning found the lawless spirit not a whit abated. On the contrary, the malignant originators of the disturbance grew bolder at the impunity with which they were necessarily permitted to indulge in their first day's career, and at one time more serious consequences than any which have yet occurred were threatened. Happily, however, the military and police authorities early in the day recovered from the partial paralysis into which the sudden demonstrations of the mob had thrown them, and in sufficient force were able to contend with the truly formidable organization of lawless men. A few wholesome but severe lessons were administered to the rioters during the day wherever they showed themselves most turbulent, and toward evening there seemed to be unmistakable indications that the supremacy of law would soon be acknowledged even by the most rabid of the offenders. Perhaps, however, the mere fact that a score or more of the rioters were killed in the various conflicts with the military and the police was not solely the cause of this abatement of the spirit of violence. The proclamation of Gov. HORATIO SEYMOUR, and the announcement, made early in the afternoon, that President LINCOLN had ordered the draft in this City to be suspended, may also have had something to do with restoring the malcontents to reason.

"On Tuesday morning a band of about 70 or 80 coarse-looking men passed along the Harlem Railroad, from Mott Haven to the junction with the New-Haven road, a mile or so above Williams' Bridge, and tore up the track at several points. Going up they passed through the suburbs of Morrissania, and through the village of West Farms, going along with clubs, but with, quite orderly demeanor, offering no one any indignity. It was understood from them that they were bent on obstructing the railroad, fearing that it might be used to bring troops over from the East. The crowd came in part from New-York, it was believed, and in Westchester County they were joined by a considerable number of the railroad laborers and others. At Williams' Bridge they tore up the track three different times, and it was twice relaid by a section of workmen, who twice fled from the rioters. Exasperated at the prompt manner in which the track was relaid, they set to work to burn the passenger depot at Williams' Bridge, but were dissuaded from this purpose on being assured that it was private property, belonging to the man who keeps a refreshment saloon in it. They broke open the ticket office, however, and threw the papers and tickets outdoors, scattering and destroying them by tearing them up. They then destroyed the telegraph apparatus, and afterward broke down the telegraph and cut down three or four of the poles. When they proceeded up the track, news of their progress reached the village of Mount Vernon, three miles distant, on the New-Haven Railroad. It was supposed they were going there to destroy the cartridge factory of Messrs. Dow & JOHNSON, who recently located there. The firm took every precaution to disappoint the rioters. If they came there. The hands were all dismissed for the day. These are chiefly young girls. The stock of powder and other material was then removed to the magazine, which is located some distance off, in an out-of-the way place. The report that rioters were likely to visit the village created much consternation. Some families left their houses, and went to others considered more secure. In consequence of the cars not running, many of the male residents, who mostly come to the City daily, were at home, and steps were taken to defend private property from damage. The rioters did not come near the village, but went on up the Harlem road. Had they visited Mount Vernon they probably would have met with a damaging repulse, the citizens being determined to resist them and to put them down. On Wednesday morning the track was all in good order on both roads, the brakes having been repaired, but no cars were running, in consequence of the disturbed state of affairs in the City. Persons who felt obliged to come to the City came in private conveyances and on foot. In going back all sorts of means were resorted to. Conveyances were scarce, and exorbitant prices were in general asked for them. In many cases even ladies walked from Harlem Bridge out from one to ten miles, rather than pay the excessively high prices charged for wagons. The people living out of town, and doing business in the City, at least those who daily travel over the Harlem and New-Haven Railroads, have suffered great inconvenience this week. One train went out on each road on Monday night, from Mott-Haven, but on Tuesday morning the trains were all running right again. Tuesday afternoon no trains ran, nor did any run yesterday.

"-- A few days since, as the employes in one of our City Banks on Broadway were about leaving for the evening, one of the book-keepers stepped into the vault to put away some papers, and just at that moment the porter, who was fastening up the premises, stepped in from another room, shut to and bolted the inside door of the vault, then slammed to the outside doors and locked it, it being a double vault; it was done so quick the caged book-keeper supposed it was for a joke, but in a moment the confined air and Egyptian darkness caused him to consider it rather too serious a matter to joke long about; he knew the practice of the porter was, as soon as he closed the vault doors, being the last thing he did, to put the keys in his pocket and wend his way home. As the feeling of confined air and horrors of suffocation came over him, he commenced making all the noise he could by voice and pounding; but the reverberating sound came back upon him with such deafening roar it nearly set him crazy. One of the clerks who still lingered in the room fancied he heard a stifled voice, like the intonation of a ventriloquist, from the wall opposite the vault; he listened; ""Let me out. I'm suffocating,"" was faintly heard; it was repeated, but hardly audible, seeming to come from another part of the room; then again, near the vault -- finally traced to the vault; the key was applied, doors soon unlocked and unbolted, when nearly helpless, pale and weak, from fear, exertion and want of air, tottered forth the horror-stricken book-keeper; five minutes' incarceration, tortured with the thought that, by accident, he was left to die a slow and lingering death, had so changed him as to be scarcely recognized. He is now very nervous about vaults, and even after many days shudders at the sight of one. Those short five agonizing minutes, he says, seemed days to him, while the rush of thought is inconceivable and indescribable. As it was, the escape was a narrow one, for if the porter, with the clerks, had left the place soon as the vaults were closed, as was their general habit, no human being outside could have heard the faint cry of ""Let me out, I'm suffocating."" and it is questionable if any person could live over an hour, much less till next day in the forenoon, in such a place.

As will be seen by our Vicksburgh letter, the paroled men not only swea[???] that they will not take up arms until duly exchanged, but that they ""will not serve in any military, police or constabulary force, in any fort, garrison, or field work"" held by the rebels, ""nor as guard of prisoners, depots or stores, nor discharge any duties usually performed by soldiers.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GRANT'S PRISONERS."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""GRANT'S PRISONERS."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0bc8862f-d47c-5e56-b333-246d1b7a999f,174,nyt://article/0bc8862f-d47c-5e56-b333-246d1b7a999f,

Riots; The Unfortunate Blacks,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/17/archives/the-unfartunate-blacksan-appeal.html,Riots; The Unfortunate Blacks,"In the name of a humanity which they enjoy in common with all of us, we make an appeal to Christians, Christian churches and all humane citizens, in behalf of the unfortunate blacks of this City, whose persecutions during the three days of mob rule, have been so heartrending. We have already spread some of the facts and scenes -- only a tithe of what occurred, however -- before our readers. Hundreds of them have been killed in the public streets with atrocities such as we have never before read of in a civilized country, and such as will inflict indelible disgrace upon this Christian City for all time; hundreds of them have had their houses sacked and burned, and their little all forcibly taken from them; thousands of them have fled from the city in abject terror; and nearly all of them have been thrown out of employment. Neither sex, no age was spared; but wherever on this Island, for three days, a black man, woman, or piccaninny showed his or her head, the demon yell arose, and the most dreadful assaults and butcheries followed. It was a sort of St. Bartholomew massacre, more limited in extent, but with incidental horrors greater even than those of that day. There is no doubt that one-half the world will disbelieve that such things could take place in New-York in the Nineteenth Century; but, unfortunately, no one in this City can disbelieve it. No crime was charged upon them but their color, except in one or perhaps two instances, where distracted negroes undertook to defend their own lives. They were mostly inoffensive persons, and a large number of them were members of the various colored Methodist and Baptist Churches of the City. We do not help our case by saying that these atrocities upon our native blacks were not the work of persons of American birth; for, if Americans were incapable of active participation in such crimes, they at least stood passively by while they were being committed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Unfartunate Blacks--An Appeal', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Unfartunate Blacks--An Appeal', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8ec7dcd8-25b1-5292-9cca-9e5248b8c880,517,nyt://article/8ec7dcd8-25b1-5292-9cca-9e5248b8c880,

For reasons that we presented in these columns a short time since, a restoration of active commercial operations in the Mississippi Valley, is impossible until the final establishment of peace. The National Government has had undisputed possession of the Mississippi river as far down as Memphis, for more than twelve months, but yet we well know that no unarmed boat at any time in all that period, or even to-day, dares land within five miles of Memphis, above or below. It is impossible to plant a police thick enough on the two banks of the Mississippi river between Cairo and New-Orleans -- a distance of fully one thousand two hundred miles, or two thousand four hundred miles if we include both sides -- to prevent such guerilla firing on passing boats as will place an effectual bar on general navigation for commercial purposes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mississippi Open--Change of Base for Gen.

From the very first day, the horde has shown a vileness and depravity of spirit scarcely to be paralleled in any civilized land since the French Reign of Terror. Pillage is common enough in such emeutes, and arson, and even hot-blooded murder; but the dashing out the brains of infants, the kicking and torturing of dying men, as in the case of Col. O'BRIEN and scores of others, the mutilating of corpses and subjecting them to every mockery amid the general plaudits of the rabble, exhibit an abandonment of human feeling, that was hardly deemed possible in any portion of American society, even the foreign-born. Few imagined that there was such a race of miscreants extant. It is appalling to think of it! At a time like this we look, as it were, down the very crater of the volcano. The liquid fire and the bitter ashes, which from time to time devastate and pollute the world, roll and toss in that abyss. Other political perils that we have undergone, have been comparatively superficial; here we scan the depths to the very bottom. The spirit we now see, is the very spirit of the French Revolution, surviving still -- sent over the water like some fiend from the pit, to make freedom detestable, to exterminate the laws of God and of society, and to turn the triumphs of civilization into a state of things as insecure as savage existence, and as degraded as that of the vilest brutes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Spirit of the Mob and its Promoters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Spirit of the Mob and its Promoters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d90458d7-3c94-5cdf-97a5-6152271b7910,1104,nyt://article/d90458d7-3c94-5cdf-97a5-6152271b7910,

It is not sufficient to lift from them the nightmare of terror. They have physical wants that must be provided for, or they will perish. Hundreds of women and children have been forever deprived by murderous hands of those whose daily labor was their sole dependence. Hundreds of them have been plundered of their clothing and of every article of their personal property. Thousands of them have been kept by violence from their work, and thus left with their families exposed to starvation. They are all, in the present condition of things, absolutely helpless. They can make no appeal. They can do nothing but hide and crouch, terror-stricken and famishing. The movement for their relief cannot come from them. They can at best only be passive.

It did not seem to us possible that any person holding a position of so much dignity and responsibility could say a word which could be construed to imply that he did not regard as ""rioters"" men who had burned down public buildings, plundered private dwellings, set fire to orphan asylums, assailed with bludgeons and stones the-legal defenders of the public peace, hung innocent and defenceless men, murdered, with every conceivable brutality, the officers of justice, and done everything which men could do to overthrow the law and plunge society into the very depths of anarchy and crime. If the mob had burned the Catholic Orphan Asylum next door to the Bishop's Cathedral, somebody beside ""the papers"" would probably have called them ""rioters:"" -- that Archbishop HUGHES could regard the term as less applicable to the men who burned the Colored Orphan Asylum, seemed to us incredible. Nor did we dream for a moment that in a City convulsed with a bloody and raging riot, Archbishop HUGHES could presume to call a meeting of the rioters, and, of his own authority, say to them, ""you shall not be disturbed by any exhibition of municipal or military presence."" Such an assurance implies the assumption of a power superior to that of the law: and whatever the Archbishop might feel, we did not think he would be unwise enough openly to proclaim the possession of such a personal or official supremacy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Archbishop Hughes and the Rioters.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Archbishop Hughes and the Rioters.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/371185d6-89c8-5bf3-8a8d-69a7c8273c87,420,nyt://article/371185d6-89c8-5bf3-8a8d-69a7c8273c87,

BANKS to come up the river with his command and join him. ""Tell BANKS,"" said GRANT, ""there will no quarrel between us about rank."" It will be remembered that the same noble spirit animated Gen. BANKS when Gen. POPE (a subordinate officer) was ordered to command the Department of Virginia. This order made it necessary for BANKS to report to POPE. While FREMONT declined to obey and was relieved, Gen. BANKS remained with his command like a true soldier and patriot -- and it was well hat he did, for at the head of his gallant corps he gave the enemy a check at Cedar Mountain that cost him a delay in his advance of nine days, which enabled enough of the Peninsula troops to come up and save POPE from total annihilation.

MEADE unfortunately had no reserve. The whole of his force was engaged in the battle. The reason of the inability of troops to pursue after the cessation of a severe battle, is the nervous exhaustion which instantly overtakes them. The beaten army may escape for some distance, by making one more desperate effort to save dear life, but the successful army has no such tremendous impelling motive; and half-an-hour after the question of victory is settled -- after the pressure of the engagement is taken off, an immediate renewal of exertion is next to impossible.

This was owing not merely to the increased and ample preparations of the authorities for crushing out any further riotous demonstrations, but in a still greater degree to the universally expressed determination of the people themselves that this thing had got to stop -- at once and forever. Everybody was occupied throughout the day in discussing the features of the horrid demon when, for four days of the week, had stalked through our streets, and the feeling was unanimous that he must never be permitted to show his front [???]. The conversations which one heard in the streets and places of public resort, betrayed everywhere the most astonishing reaction in the popular mind upon those questions which are alleged by the apologists of the mob to have furnished a pretext for their crimes. Hundreds of men who have heretofore been opposed to the draft, and hoped that it might be avoided, if it could be done in a legal and peaceful manner, are now strongest in favor of the measure, and demand that the law shall be enforced at all hazards. Nor is the change of feeling with regard to the negro question less decided. The preaching of a hundred men like GARRISON and PHILIPS, continued through a life time, could not have wrought such change of sentiment toward the blacks, such expression of sympathy in their behalf, and such utter detestation of the demagogues who, for the last six months, have been doing their utmost to excite the passions and prejudices of the mob against them, as has been produced by the demon-like atrocities that have been perpetrated upon these unoffending people by the rabble of this City since Sunday last. It would be strange, indeed, if the causes which have produced this change in public feeling did not also create in the minds of some a desire for revenge. That such has been the result, any one whose business or curiosity has led him to mingle with the promiscuous gatherings in our streets during the last two days must have been convinced. It is to be hoped that no renewal of the outrages of the mob will give occasion for this spirit to manifest itself. Its peaceful and appropriate vent will be found in the ballot-box and at the polls, and judging from the sentiments expressed by the masses of our law-abiding citizens, there is where it will show its power.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LATE RIOT.; Another Quiet Day in the Metropolis.

"--It is not an easy thing to put Europe in your pocket, but the editor of Harper's Handbook not only enables you to accomplish that feat, but also to bag a good portion of the East into the bargain.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/20/archives/new-publications.html,,"-- It is not an easy thing to put Europe in your pocket, but the editor of Harper's Handbook not only enables you to accomplish that feat, but also to bag a good portion of the East into the bargain. The second edition of Mr. FETRIDGE's useful traveling companion has just been issued by the HARPERS, and should find its way into the hands of all who contemplate a trip across the Atlantic. The information it contains is necessarily of a brief character, but it will suffice for that large class of tourists who regard rapidity of movement as one of the charms of travel, and who hardly require to know more of a town than the name of a good hotel, and one or two pegs of local tradition whereon to hang an occasional reflection. For such there is no work extant of equal value; but they who visit foreign countries with the intention of studying them thoroughly, will not find their Murray or Badeker superseded. In one respect Mr. FETRIDGE might materially enhance the value of his volume. There is a large class that visits Europe in search of health. The members composing it generally resort to the Springs of Germany, France or England. Most of these are briefly referred to in the Handbook, but there are no particulars given of the peculiar qualities of the water, and hence the invalid is in the dark until he has possessed himself of a local guide containing the information he needs. We would suggest to Mr. FETRIDGE, that in future editions he incorporates the analyses of the principal European waters. They will be alike useful to physicians and patients. The practical hints on traveling are not the least valuable portion of the work, and the routes are generally well chosen and adapted to the usual brief periods devoted to travel by Americans. The Handbook is bound in a convenient form, and is illustrated with a general Map of Europe and a route map of Europe and the East.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1cdbe208-6b25-5b87-81a2-9f0a80aa0f8b,798,nyt://article/1cdbe208-6b25-5b87-81a2-9f0a80aa0f8b,

"Mr. J.

Whether their motive has been sympathy with the South or partisan hatred of the Administration, the result is the same: -- they have been stimulating a bloody civil commotion in the North for the purpose of aiding the rebellion in the South, and hostility to the draft has been the main lever which they have employed. A draft for military service must always be obnoxious in any country, although no one can doubt that, properly managed, it is the most equitable mode of securing that service which is absolutely indispensable to every nation. For our Government now to abandon or suspend the draft, in consequence of the violent hostility it has encountered, would be simple abdication of its most essential functions. It would be a surrender of all authority, -- a complete abandonment of the right which every Government has to the services of its citizens. We are glad the Government at Washington does not for a moment entertain the thought of such a step. The laws of the nation must be enforced. The draft must go on, and the official authorities must be supported by adequate military force in carrying it out.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Enforcement of the Draft.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Enforcement of the Draft.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/71c02563-613f-58e8-828c-572a03a5a4b1,1222,nyt://article/71c02563-613f-58e8-828c-572a03a5a4b1,

Mr. FROTHINGHAM preached, yesterday morning, a very admirable discourse on the recent riots in this City. His text was ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;"" and the general drift of the sermon was to apply the same sentiment of charity and of consideration to those who have been concerned in these scenes of tumult which he began by comparing with those in the midst of which the execution of our Saviour took place. After giving a vivid picture of the riots of last week, and the horrible scenes of outrage and persecution which accompanied them, he spoke of the hostility which new measures always encounter from the uninformed masses of the community, and then drew attention to the causes of the recent outbreak. He found them, first, in the Conscription law -- a measure which always conveys to persons of foreign birth and education the tearing of people from their homes to fight the battles of ambition and of tyranny; and second, to the exemption clause, which, however well intended, was calculated to excite the distrust and resentment of the poorer classes, whom it seemed most sharply and severely to touch. He thought we should make great allowances, also, for the ignorance which pervades the community in regard to the character and causes of the war, saying that nothing else could possibly explain the bitter hatred which seems to have been aroused toward the colored race. He deprecated the effect of these excesses upon our reputation abroad, and urged the necessity of sustaining law, order and equity in all our civil and political relations.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SERMONS ON THE RIOT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SERMONS ON THE RIOT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b448c7a4-4f80-50c3-8b92-e9f1c9a764f5,293,nyt://article/b448c7a4-4f80-50c3-8b92-e9f1c9a764f5,

After the failure of the attack on Fort Wagner, which was caused by the hesitation of the supports of the storming party after the parapet was gained, Gen. GILLMORE commenced engineering approaches, and it was expected that it would soon be captured. All the fortifications on James Island, as far as Secession-ville, were also in our possession.

The result was the battle of Bladensburgh and the destruction of the Capitol. At New-Orleans we fared better, because we attempted less. JACKSON's troops intrenched themselves and waited for the enemy under cover, and consequently achieved a signal success. But it is not unfair to conclude that had his followers been as ambitious as the Marylanders, and attempted to exclude the British not simply from New-Orleans, but from American soil, they would have in like manner come to grief. If the war had lasted longer, and had been carried on to a greater degree on land, we should doubtless have learnt a lesson which would have served us in good stead in the present conflicts, of the absolute necessity of discipline and organization, of the absolute uselessness of mere bravery in operations carried on against trained soldiers. We should have been saved from the many blunders and disasters which forgetfulness of this great fact has recently brought upon us, and which, we regret to say, it is still likely to bring upon us.

Duty of American Citizens to Preserve the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/20/archives/the-american-citizens-duty.html,Duty of American Citizens to Preserve the Nation,"There is, at least, one delusion which has heretofore been very wide-spread, which this war and its incidents are rudely dispelling -- the notion that this nation, more than any other, is, to use BURKE'S language, ""nothing better than a partnership in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico and tobacco, and some such other low concerns, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties."" It is this notion, diligently exploited by traitors and demagogues, which, more than aught else, has been working the havoc which has disgraced this City during the last week. Ever since the war began, the men who are bent on pushing their own fortunes at the cost of everything that is respectable or valuable in our institutions and manners, have devoted themselves to inflaming the laboring classes, and particularly those of foreign birth, against the Government, on the avowed ground that it was carrying on the war, and that the war was productive of loss and suffering, and entailed heavy sacrifice on most classes of the community. They have labored to spread the idea that every man who came to the United States and became a citizen, acquired ipso facto a right to lifelong ease, comfort, and prosperity, and that any action on the part of the Government in defence of honor or existence, which curtailed the smallest of the working-man's comforts, was a fraud and imposition. According to this theory of the National organization, the National Government is a sort of swine-herd, whose sole business is to see that its hogs get their meals and their sleep regularly, and are not troubled by anything that impedes or delays the growth of fat. The cares, anxieties, duties and sacrifices of citizens are all very well for the down-trodden serfs of Europe, but once on American soil, the man rises into the full dignity of a swopping, trading, hoarding animal, and any attempt to make him raise an arm or contribute a cent for the defence of the common honor, or dignity, or even safety, is declared to have no counterpart except in the tyrannical and ferocious caprices of the Czar or the Shah.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The American Citizen's Duty."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The American Citizen's Duty."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e463d93e-5121-56df-b27a-c309befcdeb8,961,nyt://article/e463d93e-5121-56df-b27a-c309befcdeb8,

LENT was a resident of this City, and at the opening of the war, was attached to the Seventh Regiment, in which he served as a private during the three months' campaign, making with his comrades the famous thirty miles' march from Annapolis to the railway junction en route to the defence of Washington. When the regiment returned to the City, young LENT was not long in determining to again enter the field, and the organization of the Forty-eighth Regiment in Brooklyn, under the Rev. Mr. PERRY, its first Colonel, (who died at Fort Pulaski, Ga.,) gave him the opportunity that he desired. Although Col. PERRY did not personally know the young man who presented himself with the request for a command, yet he was so favorably impressed with his fine physique and martial air, that he made him Captain of Company A, and to the day of his death he had no occasion to regret this confidence. In the various engagements, in which his regiment has encaged -- at Fort Royal Ferry, Pocotallgo, Bluffton, and in several skirmishes -- Capt. LENT conducted himself in such a way as to merit the commendation of his superior officers. By his company he was idolized, and he died while gallantly leading them.

It plunges a large portion of the community into anxiety and uncertainty before the names are drawn, and after they are drawn it unavoidably inflicts a large amount of hardship upon thousands of worthy men; and what is, if possible, of more importance than these things, is that, owing to the magnitude of the struggle which has called for it, it is, in the eyes of a large portion of the population a novel and it may be a vexatious law. The old militia laws, which it has superseded, were certainly tenfold more vexatious, and would, if carried out, have inflicted tenfold greater hardships.

During Monday and Tuesday they said all that could be said both to inflame the passions of the Thugs who were desecrating our streets by murder and pillage, and to excuse their ferocity, and as soon as the tumult was quelled by the strong hand of the law, they set to work both to predict its renewal and to preach forbearance and gentleness to the Police. It will not do any longer to tell people who have passed four nights in their houses with the hideous uproar of street massacres ringing in their ears, and the flames of their neighbors' houses reddening the sky above their heads, that this havoc was wrought either by �the people,"" or �the laboring population,"" or by �outraged conscripts."" They know well that if these atrocious libels were true, it would be the duty of those who have enough manhood and religion left them to make them refuse to belong to a community of thieves and assassins, either to take their muskets and bring about a reform, or else quit the country. If either �the people"" or �the laboring population� of New-York were fairly represented by the bands of brigands who cut throats and fired houses for four days, it would be an insult to every decent man in the City and the State to suppose that he would live in the same place with such a �people,� or with such �laborers� one minute, after he had found it impossible to get them hanged or banished. These wretched apologists of assassination and, arson evidently came to the conclusion that the troubles of the times had deprived the American people of their moral sense, and that there are men and women amongst us so besotted by party feeling as to have lost their horror of murder and cruelty, and their respect for property, whenever opponents of the Administration choose to sally out and kill, mutilate and rob.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How to Deal with Mobs.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How to Deal with Mobs.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/671f7d52-6e90-59fc-9af7-f007af6cc7a4,1282,nyt://article/671f7d52-6e90-59fc-9af7-f007af6cc7a4,

We will not say that a good deal of it is not deserved, though we wish they had drawn a clearer line between the rioters and the great mass of citizens in the Empire City. New-York is a very large town. By last census it had a population of over eight hundred thousand souls; and though the rioters had free sweep for several days, they never numbered more than two or three thousand. If the city were such a seething mass of corruption, lawlessness and villany as is represented, we should have seen a state of things that could not have been repressed by a few hundred policemen and soldiers. The fact is that the high character of New-York never appeared to better advantage than during the late riots. The mob took the City by surprise, and was carrying on its ravages before people generally were aware of its existence; but no sooner did the citizens see and comprehend the real upshot of the riot than they hastened, almost en masse, not merely to express their disapproval, but to enrol and arm themselves to repress disorder and sustain the laws.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Philadelphia and New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Philadelphia and New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Philadelphia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/700e5760-9877-5257-937d-2e71e2a2ee35,918,nyt://article/700e5760-9877-5257-937d-2e71e2a2ee35,

London Press on the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/22/archives/the-london-press-on-the-war.html,London Press on the War,"The London papers, at our last advices, were in a delightful frame of mind. They looked upon the triumph of the Southern Confederacy as a fixed fact, and were preparing to celebrate it with all the exultation becoming a neutral and a Christian nation. LEE's invasion of Pennsylvania struck them as the climax and consummation of military generalship, and of his complete and speedy success they did not permit themselves for a moment to doubt. The Times expected to ???ear ""within a week"" that JEFFERSON DAVIS was in Washington; the downfall of that Capital was regarded as a foregone conclusion. The Army and Navy Gazette, edited by an old friend, Dr. RUSSELL, pronounced LEE's attempt to be one of the most audacious military movements of modern times, and, while confidently anticipating its success, was candid enough to admit that failure would be ""ruin"" to the Confederate cause. At the same time, it began to speculate on the contingency of being addressed from Washington by ""another Government,"" and on the difficulty -- not to say the impossibility -- of refusing to acknowledge it. Even the Daily News, which has kept its faith in the Union cause more steadfastly than any other London journal, began to fear that the ""Confederate successes in the very neighborhood of Washington"" would compel a speedy termination of the war; and the Times announced, with its usual air of confidence, that gold, which was then selling at about 150, ""must again advance.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LONDON PRESS ON THE WAR.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LONDON PRESS ON THE WAR.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/705a3a90-f43d-5b21-bade-8c27ea31e257,568,nyt://article/705a3a90-f43d-5b21-bade-8c27ea31e257,

SEYMOUR, as the leader of the first class, took early occasion to ""implore"" the crowd to refrain from all further destruction; and he assured it that he ""had sent his Adjutant-General to Washington to ask the Government to stop the draft in this City for the present."" On the other hand, Maj.-Gen. WOOL, at the first stage of the riot, representing the feelings of all who wished to see law vindicated, issued a call for soldiers ""to stay the ravages of the City by men who have lost all sense of obligations to their country;"" and Mayor OPDYKE in the same spirit made a call upon ""all loyal citizens"" to enroll themselves ""as special policemen for the restoration of law and order.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Compromise with the Rioters, and Compromise with the Rebels.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Compromise with the Rioters, and Compromise with the Rebels.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7381c631-6b91-5001-b6ad-072d253d11c4,1153,nyt://article/7381c631-6b91-5001-b6ad-072d253d11c4,

He was serving out a long sentence there; but a few weeks since he advoitly managed to get outside the walls of the prison, and fled to this City. STMMS and his accomplice made a desperate resistance when they were captured by the officer, but, with the aid of a Fifteenth Ward Policeman, they were finally over powered. Each officer then took charge of his man, and marched them toward the Station-house. When nearly there the Ward officer's man broke away from him, and when recaptured, after a short chase, he fought with great desperation, making several attempts to stab the officer in the heart. He was finally overcome by means of the club and secured. Upon being searched, a Colt's revolver and a quantity of burglars' instruments were found upon each of the prisoners. A dispatch to the Warden of the prison has been sent from Police Headquarters, and no doubt SIMMB with this morning leave for his home on the Hudson.

"The European news telegraphed from Halifax conveys information of the death of WILLIAM MULREADY, the celebrated painter. Mr. MULREADY was born at Ennis, in Ireland, in 1786, and very early gave evidence of his talent as an artist. When fourteen years of age he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, and some of his first pieces were of greater pretension than those with which his name is now generally associated.

On the other hand, those who are in favor of the draft (and this class has largely increased within a week) are no less positive that the Government dare enforce the draft, that it can enforce the draft, and that it will must and shall enforce the draft, whether it wants soldiers or not. This is the talk that one hears about the streets, as littered toy the two extremes of popular sentiment. Then there is e large class of citizens more moderate in their views, conservative and law-abiding citizens, who are in favor of the enforcement of all laws that are deemed necessary, bat who thinks that the easiest way is the best way, and would like to see some kind of compromise effected which would avoid the contingency of further collision between the Government and the disaffected.

They claim that New-York has furnished more than her quota under the calls for volunteers, and that this excess should be deducted front the quota to de raised by draft. They also claim theist the services of the State Militia, which has been several limes called out for it short term, should be allowed, and the aggregate time of such service deducted from the draft quota. Pending the settlement of these claims Gov.

The drafting was conducted in the fairest manner, as all who looked on will testify. It is remarkable how few Irishmen happened to be drawn; their names were all in the wheel the same as others. Our authorities, in conjunction with the officers of the U.S. Government, had made the most thorough preparation to have the peace and good order of the town maintained, and during the whole day and late into the night, we did not see a single intoxicated person. The Courier Office is quite fortunate -- six of its force, editorial and mechanical having the high honor awarded to them of serving their country without the animadversions which follow office-seeking. The Post-office, too, is well represented -- not less than seven gentlemen connected with the mail service having been drawn, to wit: three clerks, two letter carriers and two route agents. The Palladium is also greatly favored, and the Register sends one representative, just to keep its memory green in the minds of the loyal. The Board of Enrollment were assisted by citizens selected by the residents of the different wards, who cheerfully volunteered to further the drawing of their own names. Hon. JAMES E. ENGLISH was there; also, HIS Honor Mayor TYLER, the whole Board of Enrollment, with a number of clerks and markers, and a large proportion of the policemen of the city. Sergt. HERMANCE, of the Knight Hospital, had eighty of the Invalid corps present, every man of whom had an honorable scar to show, and they leaned over the falling of the skylight opening on the floor below, while the drawing went on. WILLIE SERGENT, the brave young fellow who lost both arms at the battle of Fair Oaks was with this company, and everybody was glad to see him looking so well. Col. WRIGHT explained that the runaways counted if drawn, and that their cowardice did not increase the liability of those who staid to obey the law, and further said, that no matter how many might pay the $300, each payment would count ""one,"" and would not make the chances any more disadvantageous to the others than if they were to go to the war.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DRAFT.; Proceedings in New-Haven.

An emeute, which is legitimately the product of popular passion, is always preceded by visible ferment and agitation -- as invariably so as an irruption of Vesuvius is preannounced by rumblings and tremors. But it is the notorious fact that, up to the very Monday of the first outburst, the popular temper was apparently just as composed and tranquil as it had been at any time for months previous. The morning papers of that date all agreed in reporting that the draft then in progress was accepted by the people with entire cheerfulness; and in no quarter was expressed the faintest apprehension of trouble. And yet within four hours after those papers were in the hands of their readers, the streets were startled with an irruption of Vandals that could have been hardly less looked for had they sprung from straight beneath the pavements themselves. No new event had occurred that day to stimulate passion. No new light had broken upon the people to kindle opposition. The object of the draft, its scope, its methods, its effects had all been just as perfectly understood for days previous, when the first names were so quietly drawn, as on the day when the mob precipitated itself upon up with such fearful fury.

The name of LIVINGSTON belongs to the history of New-York. It is traceable in all our annals, political, military and judicial, and the brave and gentle youth for whom his kindred are this day mourning, was worthy to wear it in this life as in his death. MANNING LIVINGSTON, the youngest son of MORGAN LIVINGSTON, Esq., of this City, and a grandson of Gen. MORGAN LEWIS, entered the service of the Union soon after the war broke out, as a Lieutenant in the Third regiment of Regular artillery. He was but a boy of twenty, and from his childhood had been remarkable for the charming simplicity of his character, and the intellectual refinement of his tastes. But in his case also, it was to be proved that the ""gentlest are the bravest,"" and Lieut. LIVINGSTON so bore himself through the ordeal of the fierce battles before Richmond, and of the terrible disasters at Fredericksburgh and Chancellorsville, as to command the warmest confidence alike of his men and of his brother officers. Spared through all these darker days it was his fate to die in the hour of victory. He was struck by a rifle ball in the first wild charge made by the Confederates upon the positions of Gen. REYNOLDS, near Gettysburgh, July 3, and dying instantly, was buried on the field by his comrades.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LIEUT.

Watmough, of the United States Navy, commanding, on the 14th of October, 1862, off the southern coast north of Charleston, S.C., in lat, 30° and lon. 77° 26[???] west. At the time of her capture she was some one hundred and fifty miles from land; when first discovered by the Memphis but fifty or sixty miles. The Ouachita was owned by T.S. Begbie, a British subject, claimant, and commanded by T.S. Gilpin, also a British subject. She was a screw steamer of about fifty tons burden. Her voyage was from London to Havana. She left in ballast in August, 1862, and stopped at Bermuda, St. Georges, where she took in a cargo of arms and ammunition for Nassau, consigned to a resident there named Hart. The master had verbal directions from the owner, upon his arrival at Nassau to deliver the vessel to Hart, together with whatever she had on board. Among the papers is a letter from Hart to the master, received by him while at Bermuda, in which the writer says that he has been advised by the owner, Begbie, that the vessel would touch at that place, and pointing out to the master the difficulties of escaping the United States vessels of war in the passage to Nassau, and how to avoid them. When the master left London, some letters were delivered to him by the owner, which on opening he found instructions to report to a person of the name of Bowne, at Bermuda, and he would supply him with whatever was needful.

They do not profess to wish to put a stop to the war. They pretend to rejoice in the triumphs of our arms. They believe in the possibility and in the legality of reducing the South to submission by force.

How She is to be Pacified,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/26/archives/how-poland-is-to-be-pacified.html,How She is to be Pacified,"Earl RUSSELL's propositions for the solution of the Polish difficulty are set forth in his dispatch of the 17th of June to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, which has been recently published. These propositions recommend the adoption of the six points as the bases of negotiation; a provisional suspension of hostilities on the part of the Czar, and a conference of the eight Powers which signed the Treaty of Vienna. If Russia would but assent to these preliminaries, the English Foreign Secretary thinks that the Polish question might be solved. We are of opinion, however, that his Lordship bears rather bard on Russia in this matter. Is it reasonable, for instance, to ask the Czar to grant a general amnesty, a national diet, and a national administration to a people while in open insurrection against his authority? Or is it reasonable to require him to proclaim a suspension of hostilities, while his enemies are waging war on him? How would England have felt had the French Emperor required her, during the Sepoy revolt, to pacify India by withdrawing thence her civil and military officials, and restoring to the Rajahs their old supremacy? Or how would she feel were he to urge her to allay the discontent of Ireland by repealing the act of union and giving back to the Green Island her legislative independence? There are more oppressive nations in the world than Russia, and the British Foreign Secretary should have been among the last to forget this. Had Earl RUSSELL asked these concessions from the Czar on condition that the Poles would lay down their arms, and return to their allegiance, the requisition would be less offensive. But his Lordship was not authorized by the insurgents to make any such offer, and if he had pressed them to compromise on any such ground, they would undoubtedly have refused. Deeply interested as this scion of the House of Bedford is in the case of Poland, and much consideration as he has given to it, he yet does not understand the object of the revolted Poles. While the English diplomat is absorbed with the treaty of 1815, and is seeking to eke out autonomy for the petty realm which the Congress of Vienna created, the Poles are struggling to reconstruct that great kingdom which was dismembered in 1772, and till they are utterly crushed, they will not abandon this object, or accept any terms that ALEXANDER can concede. Neither by the proclamation of an amnesty, nor by the promise of a Constitution, can he lure them back to allegiance, and his assent to the preliminary propositions of the British Minister can have no other effect than to demonstrate the anxiety of Russia to avoid a second war with the Western Powers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How Poland is to be Pacified.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How Poland is to be Pacified.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/054d0f0f-0564-5507-9bd1-8bffaf94cc07,766,nyt://article/054d0f0f-0564-5507-9bd1-8bffaf94cc07,

If such armies as those which fought at Shiloh, Murfreesboro and Edwards' Station, have been completely overthrown -- if such strongholds as those at Donelson, Columbus, Vicksburgh, Tullahoma and New-Orleans, have been torn from them, where shall they find armies to be victorious over the victors? where shall they build strongholds that shall stand against their besiegers ? If LEE, with the great army of the Confederacy intact and at its full strength, was discomfited and driven back by the Army of the Potomac when it was weaker in numbers than it had been for months before, how can he hope to succeed after he has lost a third of his army and has no means of repairing his losses? Failing in the offensive at the East -- failing on the defensive at the West -- with not a single untried resource to fall back upon -- how can the rebels look forward to anything but the ultimate demolition of their short-lived though gigantic power?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Prospects of the Rebellion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Prospects of the Rebellion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b4c5e4c-7432-5e45-8652-f4a105fa5dfb,770,nyt://article/2b4c5e4c-7432-5e45-8652-f4a105fa5dfb,

BURNSIDE for recruiting for the rebel service in his military department. When this fact became known to Capt. SAWYER's friends in Philadelphia, they induced our respected townsman, Capt. WILMON WHILLDIN, long associated with the steamboat interest in this city, to visit Washington to ascertain the policy of the Government in regard to the inhuman threat of JEFFERSON DAVIS. He was kindly received by the President and the Secretary of War, and carried back to Philadelphia, from them, the assurance that the Government will adopt such a course as would possibly prevent the execution of Capts. SAWYER and FLINN, and at all events punish it fearlessly and promptly. When Capt. WHILLDIN reached this city, the wife of Capt. SAWYER received a letter from him, in, which he stated that the rebel Government would permit her and their children to visit him before his execution. In company with Mrs. SAWYER, he immediately started for Washington, and having received the authority of our Government, went to Fortress Monroe, where they are now waiting a flag of truce to go to Richmond.

A report had reached England by the Barbados steamer that the California steamship Moses Taylor has been captured by the Alabama, which thus secured a million dollars in gold. The large amount of treasure given in this statement inclines us to doubt the whole story. No such amount has been shipped for New-York for several months. Our London files by the City of New-York bring us the proceedings of the British House of Commons on the 13th, the occasion when the debate on Mr. ROEBUCK's motion for the recognition of the South was to have been continued. The news expected by that gentleman from America not having arrived, he concluded to withdraw his motion, and after some desultory debate the matter was dropped. In the course of the debate Mr. LINDSAY took occasion to give his promised version of the interview of himself and Mr. ROEBUCK with the French Emperor. Another call was made on the 14th, in the House of Lords, for information regarding the case of the Margaret and Jessie, fired into on the Bermuda coast by the gunboat Rhode Island, but Earl RUSSELL had no further information to give. The news of the battles of Gettysburgh had been received, and caused considerable sensation. There was much anxiety for the details. The English journals generally accord praise to the Union troops. The London Times, however, cannot see the ground for Mr. LINCOLN's hopeful anticipations, and says the principal struggle is to come at Vicksburgh and Port Hudson! The Russian reply to the propositions of England, France and Austria, on the Polish question, had been received, but was not made public. It was believed to assent to the six points, but to propose an amnesty instead of an armistice. The Liverpool cotton market was firm. Breadstuffs and provisions were steady.

It also illustrate the cheerful and buoyant spirit with which these labors were performed, and these hardships and privations were endured, in a righteous cause.

Pu???tam et al. -- By the 16th action of the act of 1857, to reduce the several acts relating to the District Courts in the City of New-York in to one act, defendant in an action commenced in one of those Courts may be arrested by warrant where he has been guilty of a fraud in contracting the de??? or incurring the obligation for which the action is brought and by so??? 50 of the same act, when a judgment is rendered in a case where the defendant is subject to arrest and imprisonment thereon, it must be so stated on the judgment and entered on the docket. In this case the defendant Gardner, was not arrested by warrant, but allegations were made in the complaint that the debt was fraudulently contracted by reason of certain representations made by him, and that the plaintiff was ready to prove the fraud charged. The Justice, having found in favor of the plaintiff, stated in the judgment. ""defendant liable to arrest and imprisonment,"" and upon the docket is entered these words. ""defendant, Gardner, liable to arrest; judgment for plaintiff $70 02 -- $12 57 extra costs against both parties -- defendant, Gardner, liable to arrest."" The defendants were sued, as partners, but the process was served upon the defendant, Gardner, only. Whether the allegations of fraud were proved or not, does not appear. We are to presume, however, that they were proven, inasmuch as the Justice has found them to be true by his finding that the defendant, Gardner, was liable to arrest. If it were otherwise the defendant should have appealed and reversed that judgment. We cannot reverse that judgment in effect by discharging the defendant from arrest under the execution. Whether the allegations of fraud were necessary in the complaint is not a question to be considered on this motion, the Justice having found that the defendant was liable to arrest and imprisonment. It may have been upon the complaint or upon other testimony, but having so adjudged as before stated, we cannot, on motion like this, subvert the judgment. The defendant, not having appealed, has acquiesced in the judgment, and must take the consequences. Such is my view of this question. The same answer must be given to the alleged irregularity in the service of the summons. We cannot set aside such a judgment for irregularity, nor can we do so upon the ground that the Court had not jurisdiction, unless such an objection was taken at the trial, and then only on appeal. The process against the person of the defendant. Gardner, was authorized, therefore, by the record, and cannot be set aside. I think, however, that the questions presented on this motion being novel, no costs should be awarded against the defendant.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Important Decision as to Orders of Arrest in District Courts.; COMMON PLEAS SPECIAL TERM.

The second dispatch, dated the 19th, states that after a furious bombardment of eleven hours, the National forces assaulted the enemy's position ""desperately and repeatedly,"" but were repulsed with great slaughter, the rebel loss being slight but including many valuable officers. The third dispatch, dated the 22d, states that we commenced shelling again on the 21st. The rebel loss on the 18th is put at 150 killed and wounded; ours at about 2,000, including prisoners, nearly 800 having been buried under a flag of truce. Col. PUTNAM, acting Brigadier, and Col. SHAW, commanding the Massachusetts negro regiment, were killed. It is well to receive these dispatcher with all due allowance until we receive our own accounts.

It need hardly be said that this officer is no less a personage than Hon. JOHN H. MCCUNN, City Judge. Indeed, so well known is the propensity of our City Judge to dabble with that famous writ, that he has obtained among his associates and members of the bar, the soubriquet of ""Habeas Corpus MCCUNN."" Does the Government arrest a rebel spy or a traitor in our midst, almost invariably forthwith from the ""chambers"" of Judge MCCUNN issues a writ of habeas corpus, and the man is discharged. Does a soldier who has volunteered in the United States service, and received his bounty from the State and City, wish to get released from such service, he forthwith applies to Judge MCCUNN, and with the aid of a parent or guardian, who swears he is a minor and enlisted without their consent, he gets his discharge, and walks off with the bounty money in his pocket. It is reported, on good authority, that during the last year Judge MCCUNN has discharged from the United States service more than two full regiments of soldiers, on one pretext or another, and that in a large majority of cases the persons discharged had received large bounties for enlisting, while in very few, if any, cases has the bounty money been returned. So accustomed have our citizens become to seeing reports of habeas corpus cases in connection with the name of Judge MCCUNN, that many have been led to suppose that he was the only Judge in the City who was authorized to issue these writs. So far from this being the case, however, it so happens that he is about the only Judge of a Court of Record in the City whose power to issue the writ is questioned.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Judge McCunn and the Habeas Corpus.

The noble Earl said that, according to the statement which had been published in the Press, the Margaret and Jessie left Charleston harbor on the 27th of May, laden with a cargo of cotton, having eluded the United States vessels at the entrance of the harbor. She continued her voyage until she arrived about 25 miles from Nassau, where she was chased by a United States steamer of war. She immediately made for the shore, and was followed by the steamer, which began to fire upon her, and continued to do so, being at a distance of from one thousand to fifteen hundred yards from the shore, while the Margaret and Jessie was sometimes 300 yards distant, and at no time a greater distance than 400 yards from the land. Several of the shot and shell were picked upon the shore and taken into Nassau. At last the Margaret and Jessie was sunk by a shell from the steamer, and when it was seen that she was sinking a boat was sent off to her from the steamer. On being asked the name of the steamer, the answer was, ""The United States ship Savannah."" It was said that it had since been ascertained that it was not the Savannah, but the Rhode Island. It appeared to him that the question was not the position of the Rhode Island at the time, but that of the Margaret and Jessie when she was fired upon. He understood that Mr. SEWARD mentioned the matter to Lord LYONS, and intimated that he would make inquiry into the case, and if the facts were as reported in the American papers he would make full reparation for what was done. He (the Earl of Airlie) thought that he should not only make full reparation, but also take steps to prevent a case of this kind occurring again, because not only had a gross outrage been offered by a United States vessel to a friendly Power, but this act of the Captain of the steamer was at variance with the instructions issued by Mr. SEWARD for the guidance of officers of the American navy. Before he sat down he wished to put a question to the noble Earl, of which he had not given him notice. It was stated some little time ago that the officers of the blockading squadron in the port of Charleston had come to the determination to take no more prizes, but to sink every vessel which attempted to enter the port. He could hardly think that this determination had been arrived at, and he hoped the statement was inaccurate, and founded upon a misconception.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MARGARET AND JESSIE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MARGARET AND JESSIE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe18d26c-0e86-5495-b394-80b24c1497ac,630,nyt://article/fe18d26c-0e86-5495-b394-80b24c1497ac,

It will be interesting to know how the thing was accomplished. Mr. BRAYTON arrived here last evening with his prisoners, and has communicated some of the particulars as to now he made the arrest. He was in town when the ro???bery was committed, and went to the Central depot a few moments after the bag of money had been stolen. He ""spotted"" the men who were concerned in the affair, and told them that he knew all about the theft, and demanded admission to share the plunder. To this they assented to avoid arrest. Meanwhile the fellow who had the bag had disappeared, and his confederates knew not where he had gone. They became uneasy, and feared that he had cheated them. They wanted BRAYTON to help them find him. Meanwhile the chap with the money had passed out of the depot and gone to the neighborhood of Washington-square, where he discovered a house building on South- street. He went into the back yard of this house, found a secluded place, cut open the leather sack and removed the contents, putting the gold and bills into his pockets as best he could. This done he threw the bag away, and started on foot for Fairport. The next morning he took a train for the East.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Thirteen Thousand Dollar Robbery.; HOW THE THIEVES WERE ARRESTED.

"-- A few days ago the foreign news bag of the Associated Press, which was sent from this City to Boston, to go out in one of the Cunard steamers, was, through a blunder committed in the office of the Association at Boston, placed on the train for New-York, instead of the steamer. The blunder was not discovered until the bag had reached Worcester, about an hour before the time of the departure of the steamer. Here was a dilemma, for there was no down train for several hours, while the bag contained most important, exclusive intelligence for the European Associated Press, beside several hundred private commercial dispatches for all parts of Europe. The telegraph, however, was resorted to, through which the Superintendent, at Worcester, of the Railroad, was informed of the difficulty. The result was that a special locomotive was dispatched to Boston with the unlucky bag, which was delivered in Boston within fifty minutes after its arrival in Worcester, and in ample time to be placed on board of the steamer.

Mrs; Lost and Saved","This indignant protest of a woman, highly gifted, energetic, impulsive, against a system, in the midst of which she was suddenly thrown, is destined to be very widely read. Though unquestionably what it professes to be, a Journal, written from day to day -- the outpouring of a full heart under overwrought feelings to the ear of a distant friend -- it conveys a higher idea of Mrs. KEMBLE's talents as a writer, than her more finished and ornate productions. Verse is often very ""blank"" indeed when compared with the burning words extorted by an ever-present sense of cruel injury and irremediable wrong. It can scarcely he said that the Journal throws much absolutely new light on the relations of Southern Slavery to the parties who suffer from its contact. Common repute, and hundreds of sensation stories, have made us familiar with the foul and loathsome incidents necessarily involved in the existence of hereditary servitude. Its chief value is the directness of the testimony it affords on the subject. Neither particulars of time, place or person are wanting to its details, and the effect of one story of suffering thus individualized and localized, is greater than that of a host of vague and flying rumors, or the most elaborate pictures of the novelist. No room exists for doubting the purpose of the publication. There is something solemn in evoking for the destruction of the system which sanctioned them, these memories of buried and forgotten oppression, whose cry has long been silent on earth, whatever record it may elsewhere bear. The authoress informs us that the slaves among whom her experience was unwillingly gained, have long since been sold and dispersed; the islands where the scene of the journal is laid are now in the occupation of the United States troops, and she would fain hope that the condition of things it describes has vanished, never to be renewed. The tints of the work are, however, not entirely sombre. The brilliancy of nature's coloring in Southern scenery, its unspeakable rural solitudes, its wildernesses of uncultivated and ungathered flowers, the softened blending of air, earth and sky in the golden haze of its sunsets, all impressed themselves vividly on the northern lady who saw them for the first time, and they are faithfully mirrored, while the freshness of early feelings was retained, in the pages of the Journal. The instances of gratitude shown by the slaves for the unaccustomed succor and sympathy of a kind and Christian mistress who flings her brave heart into the work, are often unspeakably touching. Even the system of slavery itself can be shorn of much of its horrors by the alleviation of personal influences. Those ""happy accidents,"" amiable despots, occur sometimes in the plantation as on a throne. Mr. BUTLER's slaves had suffered from the long-continued absenteeism of their owners, but other neighboring properties had been more conscientiously administered by the proprietors, and showed better results.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; JOURNAL OF A RESIDENCE ON A GEORGIAN PLANTATION IN 1838-1839.

Watching the craft more closely her movements were seen to be suspicious. She made and shortened sail, altered her course and acted otherwise in a strange way. By 7 1/2 o'clock Capt. GADSDEN had passed as many as 100 bales of the cotton, and the hull of the steamer being now distinctly visible, he was satisfied that she was a blockade-runner. Although his vessel is only a transport, and is not armed for aggressive purposes, Capt. GADSDEN determined to give chase and capture this friend of John Secesh. The superior speed of the Arago in a few hours brought her up to the stranger, who obeyed the somewhat imperative summons to ""heave to,"" which was given by a couple of whizzing rifle- shots from the Arago. The troops on board the transport were now all under arms to act as boarding party, if necessary, and a boat was sent to the stranger, with an armed crew, ordering the Captain to come on board.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Arago Captures a Blockade Runner.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Arago Captures a Blockade Runner.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-07-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e9c1298-88ef-5505-b579-ba4ce02dcaca,495,nyt://article/9e9c1298-88ef-5505-b579-ba4ce02dcaca,

WILDER, whose brigade of mounted infantry in ROSECRANS' army has been frequently noticed recently for its daring exploits and ceaseless activity, was in our city yesterday on a brief visit home to adjust some private business. He left Nashville on Tuesday, and Tuliahoma on Monday morning, bringing news from the advance of the Army of the Cumberland to the 20th inst. He informs us that the latest and safest news from BRAGG's army is that it is concentrated at Chattanooga, with its supplies at Atlanta. Only rations for a week are kept at Chattanooga, so that if compelled to retreat no great amount of stores need be abandoned. One brigade is at Bridgeport. BRAGG evidently intends to make the Tennessee River his base of operations. The desertions from his army, the Colonel says, are far more numerous than has been represented, and are chiefly Tennessee, Kentucky and North Alabama men. The Tennesseans will not leave the State any more, and they, with other deserters, are forming guerrilla bands to resist any force sent to compel them into either army. This movement concerns us but little, as our Government does not propose to force rebel deserters into our ranks, but it may prove a very serious annoyance to the rebels, if the war lasts long enough to give them a chance to feel it. On one occasion a deserter came into Col. WILDER's lines, and inquired what would be done with him if he took the oath of allegiance. On being assured that he would be allowed to go home and stay there, he went out and returned with 46 more, who had been waiting to learn then fate before they ventured too far, and these 47 men were all from one company of ???, the desertions just about annihilating it. The Colonel mentioned the name of the Captain and the regiment of this ""cleaned out"" company, but we have forgotten it. Fully 7,000 Tennesseeans have left the rebel army, and, with the Kentuckians and Alabamians, at least 10,000 have deserted since the retreat from Tuliahoma. The country is full of them. BRAGG's force, the Colonel thinks, cannot exceed 40,000 men, if it is even that strong. ROSECRANS' army is much stronger -- how much it would do no good to tell. But for the tremendous rains and freshets which preceded and accompanied WILPER's last expedition, and blocked his way completely, there is little doubt that BRAGG would have had his retreat cut off, and been compelled to fight, with the certainly of being terribly defeated, if not destroyed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND.; Col.

"Crittenden, Hon. John J., at Frankfort, Ky.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/28/archives/obituary-hon-john-j-crittenden-of-kentucky.html,"Crittenden, Hon. John J., at Frankfort, Ky.","The death of this venerable statesman is announced by telegraph as having occurred on Sunday morning last at his home, Frankfort, Ky., at the advanced age of seventy-seven years. For nearly half a century the name of JOHN JAY CRITTENDEN has been conspicuously before the country in connection with the National Legislature. He was born in Woodford County. Ky., about 1785, and began life as a lawyer in Hopkinsville, but soon removed to Frankfort, where he enjoyed an excellent practice. Before he had attained the age of thirty-one his townsmen elected him to represent them in the State Legislature, and for several years he filled the office of Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. Valuing the high qualities of mind and heart with which he was eminently endowed, his constituents elected him in 1817 to a seat in the United States Senate, his term commencing at the same date with the Presidency of Mr. MONROE, whom he supported. From 1817 to 1819, from 1835 to 1841, from 1842 to 1849, and from 1855 to 1861, he served in the Senate. Twice he was a member of the Cabinet, having accepted the post of Attorney-General in 1841, under President HARRISON, and being again called to that position in 1850 on the accession of Mr. FILLMORE to the Presidential chair, after the death of President TAYLOR. In 1848 he was elected by a large majority on the Whig nomination for Governor of his native State. In early life Mr. CRITTENDEN belonged to the Republican, and subsequently to the Whig party, but later he was identified with the Americans. He was ever a devoted friend of HENRY CLAY, supporting him in most of the measures that he advocated. He always favored the protective policy, voting for the Tariff of 1842, and against that of 1846. The United States Bank project he strenuously favored and opposed the Sub-Treasury system. In 1835 he opposed Mr. CALHOUN's bill empowering Postmasters to abstract from the mails documents hostile to slavery. He was unfavorable to the remission of Gen. JACKSON's fine for contempt of court in declaring martial law at New-Orleans. In 1842 the question of apportionment came up, and he advocated the smallest ratio of representation, arguing that with more representatives the House would become more democratic. The establishment of a preemptive system in favor of actual settlers on the public lands being before the Senate, in 1841, he moved an amendment denying the privileges of the act to aliens who had not made a declaration of their intention to become citizens, and this he supported in several speeches. Mr. CRITTENDEN also spoke often upon the Oregon boundary question, deprecating haste and excitement, favoring peace, though not at the expense of honor, and supporting such measures as seemed calculated to bring it about. The same sentiments characterize his numerous speeches on the annexation of Texas, which he opposed as unconstitutional, unwise and unnecessary, and on the Mexican war, which he strove to bring to a peaceful termination as early as practicable. In 1858, in the debate upon the alleged illegal exercise of the right of search by Great Britain, he manifested the same conciliatory spirit. In 1848 he opposed Mr. HANNEGAN's bill, providing for the military occupation of Yucatan, and, subsequently, in 1858, took ground against interference in the affairs of Central America. In 1856 he opposed the admission of Kansas under the Topeka Constitution; voted against the repeal of the territorial laws, and in favor of Mr. TOOMBS's Kansas bill, on the ground that it was a peace measure, however objectionable it might be in some of its features. In 1858 he opposed the admission of Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution, alleging that that instrument was a fraud upon the people, and did not represent the will of the majority, and afterward offered a substitute for the bill, which somewhat modified, passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate. It provided for the submission of the Lecompton instrument to the vote of the people of Kansas, to be ratified as the Constitution if approved by a majority, and if otherwise, empowering the formation of a new Constitution. Just previous to the close of his last Senatorial term, after the secession of South Carolina, Mr. CRITTENDEN, true to the conciliatory policy which was the marked feature of his public career, laid before the Senate those compromise resolutions generally known as the ""Crittenden propositions,"" hoping thereby to avert the threatened storm of secession. These propositions he advocated with all the art of oratory of which he was master; but his arguments failed to influence the opinions of a majority of members, and the resolutions were defeated. Throughout the trials and unhappiness that have since visited the nation Mr. CRITTENDEN has remained loyal to the Union and consistent to his views, eliciting from all men -- even from those who differed most widely from him in opinion -- the respect which is never withheld from those against whom the breath of slander has never whispered.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.; Hon.

There was no flinching or faltering in any quarter, and to their courageous and unaided efforts from Monday's afternoon until Tuesday's can be attributed the safety of the more valuable portions of the City. The riot broke upon them unexpectedly, and when they were the only force to meet it; rallying on sudden warning, they did meet it, and by their well concerted action, their speedy movements, and their determined assaults upon the mob in the different localities, they gave the rioters no time to correctly estimate their own strength or properly estimate the weakness, at the time, of the authorities. Had it not been for this, there is scarce a doubt but that a concentrated and formidable demonstration would have been made against the lower portion of the City, and a period of destruction, pillage and carnage have ensued to an extent most fearful, and to which what did occur would have been as nothing.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.; THEIR SERVICES DURING THE RIOT WEEK.

On Sunday evening some liquor was brought into the house, and the FARRELLY's and occupants of the same premises named GOODMAN, got to drinking, and all became more or less intoxicated. A quarrel arose between deceased and her husband, and the latter beat his wife. The other parties separated them. She ran into the back yard. FARRELLY pursued her, and picking up a wash-board, struck her on the head and knocked her down. While down, as alleged, he struck her on the neck with the edge of the board, breaking the spinal column and causing almost instant death.

City of London; Trial Trip and Description,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/07/29/archives/pleasure-trip-of-the-steamship-city-of-london.html,City of London; Trial Trip and Description,"Yesterday, about 400 gentlemen assembled on board the new and magnificent steamship City of London, by invitation of the agent of the line, for a pleasure trip down the bay. Among the party were Surveyor ANDREWS, Postmaster WAKEMAN, and numerous officers of the British frigate Challenger, and other vessels lying in the harbor. The guests were conveyed to the steamer by means of a tender which left Pier No. 44, North River, every fifteen minutes until 11 A.M., the hour of the steamer's sailing. The vessel was gaily decked with the English, American, and other national colors, and as she passed down the river attracted considerable attention from the crowds gathered on the piers. As she neared her consort, the City of New-York, that vessel fired a salute and dipped her colors, which compliment was repeated by the Scotia, of the Cunard line, and other steamers which happened to be at anchor at the time. Four frigates -- representing the American, English, French and Spanish navies -- were also passed, the crews of each mounting the yards and giving nine hearty cheers. The City of London replied to the honors with the customary salute, and the guests on board did not fail to do their share of cheering, and otherwise manifest their delight. GRAFFULA's Seventh regiment band was in attendance, and opened the musical entertainment with the stirring air, ""God Save the Queen."" This was followed by American national and patriotic airs, and before the steamer returned to her pier a variety of most delightful music was discoursed, to the unfeigned gratification of the guests. When about ten miles beyond Sandy Hook, the company were invited to enter the spacious cabin and partake of a banquet, which had been prepared under the skilled management of DELMONICO. It is supposed, of course, that almost every one has heard of that famous co???erer, and it may be said with truth, that on this occasion he surpassed himself in the arrangement of the tables and the variety of delicacy of the viands placed thereon. Before the party separated, the healths of Queen VICTORIA and President LINCOLM were drank, and ???ousts complimentary to the City of London, to the Captain, P.C. PETRIE, and to the agent of the line, Mr. JOHN DALE, were given and responded to. The whole affair was a complete success, everyone on hand receiving all the attention he could possibly desire, both from the officers and the assistants. The steamer returned to Pier 44 at about 7 P.M.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Pleasure Trip of the Steamship City of London.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Pleasure Trip of the Steamship City of London.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-07-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/20354d43-ecbb-50df-9fe9-1b6d1ccd11e2,1030,nyt://article/20354d43-ecbb-50df-9fe9-1b6d1ccd11e2,

Later in the day the situation was changed; the irrepressible Yankees were found in uncomfortable numbers in Tennessee, and ISHAM G. HARRIS, the vagabond rebel Governor of that State, and all the military spouters of the Confederacy, fell to haranguing the Southern heart frantically, and the one great lesson taught was, the duty of rising en masse and driving ""the Yankee invaders"" from the soil of Tennessee. Later still the situation was changed again, and the State of Mississippi was reached -- long secure in its interior position, and an asylum to which the itinerant Governors of Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas had escaped. It was the turn of Gov. PETTUS now to flagellate the dormant chivalry of the South and especially of Mississippi, and urge it to rally in dozens, scores and hundreds, until a mighty army was raised and ""the Yankee invaders"" expelled from the sacred soil of Mississippi.

The guns flags and earthworks were captured by them, and to the Michiganders alone, with Gen. KILPATRICK's body guard, (First Ohio, Capt. JONES,) belongs the honor of that day. Gen. BUFORD's cavalry command aided after the earthworks had been captured. The charge made upon the earthworks was one of the most gallant on record -- a squadron of fifty-seven men charging upon three or four brigades behind earthworks, killing one Major-General, (PETTIGREW,) capturing more than 1,000 prisoners, and strewing the field with the killed and wounded of the enemy. Eighteen of this gallant band of Michiganders there died nobly for their country.

"ROBBERY AND ATTEMPTED MURDER. -- Tuesday afternoon a German, recently arrived in this country, named CHARLES STOCKLEIN, architect and topographical engineer, accompanied by several friends, appeared before Recorder MARTINDALE, of Jersey City, and entered a complaint against a man named FRANCIS VINCENTZ, keeper of a lager-bier shop, and dealer in dogs, charging him with robbery, and attempting to take his life. It appears that on Monday the complainant, who is in the employ of Mr. HOOVER, architect, at Newark, attended a pic-nic at Tivoli, remaining there until midnight. Upon returning to Newark, he found that he had been locked out, when VINCENTZ, who had also attended the pic-nic, and had represented himself as a friend of Mr. HOOVER's, invited STOECKLEIN to go to East Newark and stop at his house over night. The latter, supposing, of course, that if he was a friend of Mr. HOOVER's it was all right, went over to East Newark, where the two arrived between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning. Upon entering the bar-room, VINCENTZ requested STOECKLEIN to sit down while he went into the back room for a light. In a few minutes after VINCENTZ returned, and STOECKLEIN was immediately set upon by two ferocious dogs, one of them said to be a blood-hound, and he was bitten and lacerated on his arms and legs in about twenty different places. While grappling with one of the animals, VINCENTZ rushed up and dealt him a heavy blow over the forehead with a sword which laid him insensible on the floor, inflicting a gash three inches in length. When STOECKLIN came to consciousness about daylight he found his money missing, and himself a prisoner locked in the room. Although very much exhausted from loss of blood, the injured man succeeded in making his escape through a window, and with his clothes torn to rags and covered with blood, made his way to the house of Mr. STEPHENSON, and the latter gentleman kindly conveyed him to Newark, where his wounds were properly dressed. A warrant was placed in the hands of Chief of Police REILY, and Detective KILCAULEY, of Jersey City, and the officers, assisted by Chief WAMBOLD, of Newark, arrested the accused at the latter named place.

Witte. -- The defendant, in February, 1861, through a broker, purchased of the plaintiffs fifteen casks of cream of tartar at a stipulated price, to arrive by a certain vessel from Marseilles. At the time of the purchase the duty on the article was fixed at $12 per cask, and this rate of duty continued up to April 1 following, when cream of tartar was permitted, by a change of the tariff law to be entered free of duty. The vessel arived about March 15, and some days after, the plaintiffs, instead of delivering the article sold, entered it in bond at the Custom-house, and sent it to the public stores of the United States Government, from whence, about the 17th of April, it was taken by them, duty free, and delivered to and accepted by the defendant under his contract of purchase. In accordance with the terms of the same contract, he has paid the plaintiffs the price agreed, less $12 per cask, which was the duty chargeable at the time of the purchase, and also at the time the vessel arrived, and which he refuses to pay upon the ground that the charge of the tariff inured to his benefit and not to that of the plaintiffs.

Exactly what this novel specimen of naval architecture might be, the curious in such matters had no opportunity of discovering, as all the work has been done and the vessel made ready for launching, under an immense shed, which effectually concealed operations from inquisitive but uninvited people. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, under these circumstances, that an unusually large number of spectators were drawn together, yesterday morning, by the announcement that the mysterious vessel was to be set afloat. Tide neither waits for ships nor men, consequently the managers of the launch were compelled to accommodate themselves to the full flood-time of this even-tenored despot, and fix the somewhat early hour of 8 for the event.

Long before the time fixed upon, every available point of observation had its occupant. The piers were packed, vessels in the vicinity were crowded, and the river was lively with tugboats and smaller craft.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAUNCHES.; The Quintard Iron Battery Onondaga Melancholy Incident and Accident.
