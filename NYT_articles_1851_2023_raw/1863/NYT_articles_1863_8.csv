Caesarism in America,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/01/archives/caesarism-in-america.html,Caesarism in America,"The performances of the Copperhead politicians during the last year will furnish a curious and instructive chapter to the history of this war. Being most of them born and bred in Free States, with every possible reason in blood, training and association, to love Liberty and hate Slavery, they have set themselves with a bitterness of which there are but few examples, even in the story of intestine strife, to aid a band of unscrupulous conspirators, who loathe and revile them while accepting their help, in their nefarious attempts to make the Slave Code a part of our common law, and place slaveholding on the footing in every part of the Union with properly and family. Being Americans, too, and most of them unblest with a single claim to anybody's respect, except their possession of American citizenship, they have endeavored by all means legal and illegal to promote the dismemberment of the Republic, for the purpose of establishing on its ruins two new States, one of them an armed oligarchy, avowedly based on ""Slavery, subordination and government."" in lieu of ""liberty, equality and fraternity,"" and the other a shattered, broken-down Democracy, betrayed by its own citizens, and scorned and reviled by foreigners. They have, moreover, come out in the face of day and informed the world in set terms that twenty millions of Americans engaged in a war with five millions of rebels, have, after two campaigns, been ""whipped"" so thoroughly, as to make peace and submission not simply expedient but necessary. We believe that modern history does not contain any record of similar degradation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Caesarism in America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Caesarism in America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'America', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/09a5c267-fc2b-5ea6-9444-55ad9f59e029,1440,nyt://article/09a5c267-fc2b-5ea6-9444-55ad9f59e029,

Motives of his Visit to Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/01/archives/peace-and-reconstruction.html,Motives of his Visit to Washington,"We are having a great many revolations of the secret motives of Vice-President STEPHENS' attempted visit to Washington. Three or four of our cotemporaries know all about it, and are not in the least unwilling to tell all they know. One curious feature of their disclosures is that no two of them agree in a single particular; and another is that each paper ascribes precisely such a motive to the Vice-President's mission as suits its own views of public policy. The Herald, for example, announces that Mr. STEPHENS wanted to go to Washington to inform Mr. LINCOLN that, if he would turn the ""Radicals"" out of the Cabinet, the Confederates would consent to peace. The Daily News has discovered, through the State Department at Washington, that Mr. STEPHENS wanted to inform the President that, unless he speedily stopped the war, the Confederates intended to call in the aid of LOUIS NAPOLEON; and the Tribune, which for a time swallowed and magnified the story of the News, has now received a special revelation from Richmond, to the effect that the Vice-President desired to announce to the National Government that, if the Union men persisted in arming negroes, the rebels would do the same.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Peace and Reconstruction.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Peace and Reconstruction.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7ec5ddfb-5198-5585-9c76-8275c2185779,758,nyt://article/7ec5ddfb-5198-5585-9c76-8275c2185779,

"SHORT's KNAPSACK SLINGING. -- The question of alleviating a soldier's hardships is one that in these days come home to every able-bodied man in the community, and one that has been anxiously canvassed in hundreds of thousands of families during the many months of war. Many schemes are projected by the kind-hearted and philanthropic, some of which are practically useful, while others serve rather to encumber the soldier than lighten his burdens. But on Saturday we were shown an improved knapsack -- the improvement having especial reference to the mode of slinging -- that deserves to take the first place among modern inventions for the comfort of the marching soldier. The material of the knapsack is water-proof duck, and by a simple adjustment of the straps the burden is poised upon the centre of gravity, without bringing any pressure upon the heart or breathing organs. The relief that this arrangement brings can be appreciated to its fullest extent only by those who have borne the old Government knapsacks during a match of wearisome miles, until tempted to throw it by the wayside with all its indispensable contents. Thirty thousand of these improved knapsacks have already been brought into use, and the testimony in their favor is unanimous and overwhelming. It is not too much to say that no new regiments should be sent into the field without them, and that they should be substituted for those already in use as speedily as possible.

Another Maori War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/02/archives/england-and-newzealand-another-maori-war.html,Another Maori War,"England, ere this, has been dragged into another Maori war -- a war which will prove still more formidable, and redound still less to her credit, than all former ones with the New-Zealanders. For now the whole aboriginal race have been roused to hostility, and seem determined to make a desperate struggle to preserve what remains to them of the heritage of their ancestors. To the indiscretion of the Colonial Government must be ascribed the beginning of the present trouble. During the last war, the British settlers had been expelled from the Fataraimaka district, and at the conclusion of peace, the right of the natives who had taken possession of it was not called in question. Hence the Maori came to regard their new acquisition as a trophy of their valor, and continued undisputed masters of it till the Spring of the current year. Then it suddenly occurred to Sir GEORGE GREY that he ought to compel the Maori to disgorge Fataraimaka, in order that it might be restored to the emigrant settlers. Had the restoration of the territory to the Europeans been made one of the conditions of the peace it would have been fair enough; but after suffering the natives to hold it for three years, and to look on it as their own property, it was imprudent for the Governor to capriciously revive an obsolete claim, and require the de facto owners to abandon possession; may, to send a military force to drive them from the soil.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and New-Zealand Another Maori War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and New-Zealand Another Maori War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6688b52c-4fd9-5d6a-b6f1-dca415639e93,765,nyt://article/6688b52c-4fd9-5d6a-b6f1-dca415639e93,

"Vernon, Lord, and the Countess Della Seta Case",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/02/archives/lord-vernon-and-the-countess-della-seta-from-the-manchester.html,"Vernon, Lord, and the Countess Della Seta Case","This case, which has been several times mentioned in our columns, came on again before Vice-Chancellor STUART, on Monday. It was stated that in the year 1842 Lord VERNON became acquainted with the Countess DELLA SETA, of Florence. An intimacy soon arose between that lady and his lordship, and the result was that the Countess had four daughters, of which his lordship was the reputed father. In 1852 Lord VERNON discontinued the connection, and by a deed dated the 30th August in that year, he entered into a covenant with trustees to pay them during his life £1,000 per annum, upon trust that they should pay the same to the Countess for her life for her separate use, with a restrict on in anticipation in case of her marriage; and after her death, upon further trust, that they should pay £200 annually out of the said sum of $1,000, to each of his four daughters by the Countess, and the remaining £200, being the residue of the sum of £1,000, to himself; and in case any of the young lad???es should, during the joint lives of the Countess and Lord VERNON, attain the age of twenty-one, or marry under that age, then that each of the daughters who should so attain that age, or marry, should, during the life of Lord VERNON, be paid the sum of £100 out of the annuity of £1,000. Lord VERNON also by the same deed assigned to the trustees thereof a policy of assurance on his own life for £5,000, and covenanted to pay to them at his decease a further sum of £15,000, and directed that they should stand possessed of the moneys to arise from the policy and the sum of £15,000 upon trust for the countess for her life for her separate use, with a restriction in anticipation in case of her marriage, and after her death, for the four young ladies before-named. The deed declared that the provision thereby made for the countess was so made upon the express condition that she should thereout, when received, maintain and educate the young ladies respectively during their minorities to the satisfaction of the trustees, unless and until such conditions should be dispensed with by Lord VERNON; and that, in case of any breach by the Countess of the condition without the licence or consent in writing of Lord VERNON, it should be lawful for the trustees, with the approbation of Lord VERNON, to withhold from the countess such portion as they should think fit of her annual income, and to apply the same toward the maintenance and education of the young ??? The countess married the Count DELLA SETA on the 26th of November, 1853, and one of the ??? ladies died in July, 1858. Lord VERNON, hearing that the surviving children, who were now severally of the ages of 20, 17 and 15, were not happy with their mother, and, further, that they had left her h??? at Cairo, whither she had gone for her health, caused a suit to be instituted on the 20th of June last in behalf of the young ???es by one of his sons, as their next friend, for the purpose of carrying into effect the ??? of August, 1852, and making them wards of court, and for a scheme for their maintenance and education. On the 23d June, 1862, a second ??? was filed, the bill in the first suit having been served on the so???or of the plaintiff in the second suit on the 22d of June. The bill in the cause of the ""Countess DELLA SETA vs. Lord VERNON"" was originally filed on behalf of the Countess and her three surviving daughters, and it prayed that the trusts of the deed of the 30th of August, 1852, might be carried into execution. An order was made on the 2??? instant directing an annual sum of £100 to be paid to the Countess by monthly instalments, and two sums in s??? port of that allowance had been accordingly paid to her for the months of June last and July inst., the payments for these months being the only sums in arrear on the 2d inst., and on the deed of August, 1852. The object of the present application in the second suit was to raise the allowance of £400 to £700, and also to obtain an order directing that the Countess might have access to her daughters, one of whom had been dangerously ??? at Turin, but was now better. The Countess had started for Turin, but it was said that her daughter did not desire to see her, and that the medical attendant of the young lady that was ill did not think it advisable the Countess should see her. Under these circumstances the Countess had not seen any of her daughters at Turin. Mr. BACON, for Lord VERNON, said that his lordship had no other desire for privacy in the discussion of this case than that, which any man would naturally feel who had formed such a connection as that which had existed between him and the Countess. Beyond this, he personally had no ???ear of publicity. He had always, until within the last few weeks, when he had reason to believe that the Countess was failing in her duty to her children, punctually made the payments he had, by the deed of August, 1852, contracted to make. In the early part of the present year he heard that the young ladies had fled from their mother's house a Cairo to that of a stranger to him there, and that their mother had left for England. He immediately sent a trust worthy person to Cairo to take charge of his daughters, and had them taken to Turin and placed at a boarding-school there, where they now were. His next step was to cause the suit of ""Lavoignat vs. White"" to be instituted, because If what he had heard respecting the Countess were true, she was not fit to have the custody of the young ladies. Lord VERNON desired only to carry out to the letter the deed of August, 1852. He did not desire to shrink from one ???ota of the liabilities he had thereby laid himself under, and the statements which had been circulated to the contrary were false, and they were, moreover, known to be false by those who had put them abroad.

During the past season he appeared on almost every night, and it was generally remarked that his various impersonations were characterized by more than ordinary spirit and intelligence. His powers had ripened beneath the genial influence of public favor, and his career on the nobler altitude of art had fairly commenced. The apothegm to the Latin poet -- Ars longa vita brevis -- applies sadly to his case. The road had been long and dreary, but the goal was in sight when death stepped between him and the object of his ambition. There are but few retails of the calamity. It was purely accidental, Mr. REYNOLDS, it seems, went out batting at Keyport, N.J., Thursday last. He was alone, having separated from some friends for the express purpose of enjoying the water. Some time after ward these friends returned to the spot where Mr. REYNOLDS had entered. They found his clothes, but the unfortunate owner was not to be seen. From that time to the present nothing has been heard of the unhappy gentleman. He was an expert swimmer, and it is conjectured, therefore, that he must have been seized with cramp, or been carried out beyond the possibility of return by a treacherous undertow. His death will be lamented by a large circle of personal friends, and the professional loss to Mr. WALLACE will not be easily replaced. Mr. REYNOLDS was a native of Pennsylvania, and about 35 years of age.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Mr. Reynolds, the Comedian.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Mr. Reynolds, the Comedian.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8c709031-11eb-5a9d-ad89-75e0529b4284,301,nyt://article/8c709031-11eb-5a9d-ad89-75e0529b4284,

He was wounded on the Blackwater, and in May was allowed his discharge, then being Orderly Sergeant, returning to his family in Putnam County. On Monday evening, hearing of the riot here, he hurried down, repaired to Headquarters, and volunteered his services in any capacity in which he could be useful. He was sworn in as special Policeman and at once, with others, was sent on active duty against the mob, his part being bravely performed throughout. On Thursday, at 4 o'clock in the morning, he was sent with a squad of Police to Twenty-seventh-street and Seventh-avenue, to recover the body of the colored man hung there. A wagon was taken along, which had to be drawn by hand, and while on return with the body the wheels became fastened in the railroad track; in endeavoring to release them FOLSOM had his right hand and wrist badly broken.

For a very long period these islands have been mainly dependent upon the North, and especially upon New-York, for whatever commercial prosperity they enjoy. Here the products of their soil have found a ready and profitable market, in return for which we have sent them supplies of cattle, breadstuffs and assorted merchandise, which, with singular lack of energy and thrift, their people have failed to produce for themselves. Here, too, large numbers of their aspiring young men have found honorable and lucrative employment, that was denied them in the islands of their nativity. It might reasonably have been supposed, therefore, that where the interests of these islanders were so closely allied their sympathies in the contest would have been placed. But these bonds have proved weaker than a spider's web. In the very beginning of the war, abundant evidence was given of Bermudian readiness to affiliate with the rebels of the South, between whom and themselves there had been previously not one thing in common. With eager avarice the merchants at once shamelessly engaged in furnishing material to rebel purchasers; the facilities of the fine harbor of St. George have been steadily extended to the fleet of blockade runners; the dingy newspapers have teemed with malignant diatribes upon the ""Yankees;"" Union victories have been deplored and rebel successes made the occasion of public exultation. But all these methods of dispensing aid to the enemy, under the guise of neutrality, although assisting to prolong the war, we have endured and can continue to endure with some degree of complaisancy. The base ingratitude they evince we do not take into account, and their moral sympathy we do not yearn after.

"-- Mr. JOHN WERNER, a native of Russia, arrived in New-York on the 12th inst., having come to this country for the benefit of his health.

the City Inspector,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/03/archives/all-honor-to-inspector-boole.html,the City Inspector,"The mythology of the ancients teems with legends of the destruction of lions, hydras, and all sorts of monsters. Theseus made himself conspicuous by killing a bull. Hercules, in the course of his twelve labors, polished off a lion, a stag, and a cow-stable; and another individual, whose name we forget, earned immortality by demolishing a pig. Later ages, less credulous or less partial, found out that all these stories were only allegories commemorating the progress of civilization. The myths were rationalized into a series of social improvements. The stag of Erymanthus became a swift-footed robber, who used a horn for his crest. The lions of Nemea were a savage nation who slept under trees, and never brushed their hair. The wild boar was interpreted to mean the vice of gluttony, and the person who slew him a man of refined turn of mind, who introduced knives and forks, and left off eating before he burst. The cleaning of the Augean stables was treated as a mere poetical fiction, and Hercules appeared in a new light as the inventor of sewers, and as the first person who taught his countrymen not to throw their slops into the street. In this view there is no telling what future ages may make of our present City Inspector. He will certainly figure among the heroes and demi-gods. Poets will sing his exploits, sculptors will carve him in marble, and astronomers will plant his broom among the stars, as they have the sword of Perseus and the club of Hercules.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'All Honor to Inspector Boole.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'All Honor to Inspector Boole.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/028fba04-6872-57a1-b640-4a0af2d02cf7,1286,nyt://article/028fba04-6872-57a1-b640-4a0af2d02cf7,

Exemption Money; The Use it Should be Put To,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/03/archives/the-exemption-money.html,Exemption Money; The Use it Should be Put To,"It is very evident that the Conscription law, if it does little else, will yield a very large sum to the National Treasury. From the interior towns of this State, as well as from the New-England States, we hear that although the draft meets no opposition, yet more than half those drafted pay the exemption fee of $300. In the principal cities of the State, beginning with New-York, the legislative authorities have undertaken to pay for all who may be drafted and who are unable to pay for themselves. This is beyond all comparison the most flagrant violation of every sound principle of justice and patriotism, which our records of misgovernment can show. But if it is carried into execution, it will largely swell the receipts of the Treasury, although it will correspondingly diminish the accession to the ranks of the array which the draft was expected to yield. The whole number of men called for under the draft is 450,000. Judging from the results thus far experienced, at least one-third of this whole number, and probably more, will secure exemption by payment of $300 each. This will yield not far from fifty millions of dollars.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Exemption Money.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Exemption Money.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29a20069-96bf-57d5-be01-ec498398c663,606,nyt://article/29a20069-96bf-57d5-be01-ec498398c663,

The slave element bore a larger proportion to the whole population there than in any other State, with the single exception of South Carolina. In fact, those two States are the only two in which the slave population outnumbers -- largely outnumbers -- the freemen. A Mississippi fire-eater was supposed to devour the very hottest article of that element -- to devour more of it, and to devour it faster than any other man -- the South Carolinian not excepted. Into the war its people seemed to rush en masse, and the ferocity and bloodthirstiness of its troops were unexampled. It was from the soil of Mississippi from Vicksburgh -- not from South Carolina of the harbor of Charleston -- that the first hostile shot was fired in this war. JEFF.

F.; The War in the United States; Report to Swiss Military Department","Although we have had in our hands the original of this little book -- it is a simple brochure in its French garb -- we do not remember whether the principal title is as written above, or whether ""The War in the United States"" is not a bit of a flourish for the advertising columns. Be it as it may, the caption is a misnomer. The book is in no sense a history, treatise or review of the war in the United States. It is simply a report of the military service in the United Stales -- of our armies -- their organization, arms, equipment, dress, discipline, &c. The author, Lieut.-Col. FERDINAND LECOMPTE, appears to have spent some months as a volunteer Aid on the Staff of Gen. MCCLELLAN during the campaign of the Peninsula, and his pamphlet is a report addressed to the Chief of the Swiss Military Department, embodying the results of his observations. These are not profound, and the book bears no comparison with such philosophical survey as we owe to the Prince of JOINVILLE. If, without being profound, it had been a careful and accurate study of what we may call the anatomy and physiology of our army, it would still have had a professional value; and would have served the purpose of giving European soldiers a view of the condition and organization of the military service in the United States. But ii is not even that. The book is full of blunders, misstatements and misapprehensions. It would, in fact, have been difficult to have crowded a greater mass of blunders into the same space. The best we can say of it -- though that does not concern the book, but the author -- is that our Swiss friend is obviously well intentioned, and means to be as laudatory as he knows how.

ALNIA thought differently, and told HUNT if he would walk into the rear yard an opportunity would be presented for him to test his fighting qualities. HUNT accepted the proposition, and in a few moments a collision ensued between the belligerents, during which HUNT was stabbed in the left side near the heart, and staggering through the hallway to the street door, fell on the pavement, and never spoke afterwards.

"Perhaps it is not generally known that the office of Inspector of Ordnance is one of the most important and responsible of any connected with the service. According to the regulations, before a single weapon can be accepted by the Government, it must have undergone a thorough inspection, both in its complete and disjointed state. Every portion of the ordnance, even the smallest screw which is used in its formation, must be submitted to a Government standard. At the beginning of the war, numerous parties applied to the authorities at Washington for contracts to furnish arms to the Government. Some of those parties were small manufacturers, having neither the requisite machinery for carrying on the business, nor the means to provide more, others, although having a large capital invested in machinery, could not, until after a long lapse of time, make practical use of that machinery in the manufacture of fire-arms. Then, again, there were comparatively a very few workmen to be found who understood the business at all. Hence, during the first year of the rebellion, it was with considerable difficulty that the War Department was enabled to secure even a small quantity of arms. Parties to whom had been awarded contracts found it quite impossible to fill them within the specified time, and were compelled to ask for an extension of period, which was usually granted, as it was the aim of the Government to encourage and foster the manufactories. At present, however, the business is so systematized, that there are very few delays. For bringing about that result, much credit is due to Col. P.V. HAGNER, who is the Inspector-in-Chief of all ordinance manufactured for the Government. Forty-five establishments are engaged in the business. These establishments are located in different parts of the country, and each one has a certain number of local inspectors. As a general thing, only a single portion of the ordnance is made in one manufactory. For instance, one is engaged in making the stocks, another the barrels, another the screws, and so on, so that perhaps the work of a dozen or twenty establishments will be represented in the finished musket. Every portion of this work must be made by standard rule, and for that purpose each establishment is furnished with a regulation pattern. Under that arrangement, a barrel made in Ohio, or any other place, can be exactly fitted to a stock made in New-York, and the same with all other parts, no matter where made, they fit each other exactly. A first-class establishment can turn out 1,000 muskets a week, and some have turned out 4,500 per month. It takes from five to seven days for one man to inspect 100 muskets, and from three to four days to inspect cither 100 carbines or pistols. The number of pieces condemned vary according to the class of the manufactories. In some, only three out of a thousand muskets are placed aside, while in others the number is augmented to twenty. In view of that fact it has become necessary to separate the pieces into four ranks. For the first or best rank of musket, the original Government price ($20) is paid. For the inferior ranks a deduction is made, bringing the price of the fourth rank musket down to $16. Nothing inferior to the last rank is accepted.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/03/archives/the-inspection-of-government-arms.html,,"Perhaps it is not generally known that the office of Inspector of Ordnance is one of the most important and responsible of any connected with the service.

The old method of popularizing science was simply to emasculate it -- to deal with its superficies while making readers to believe they were mastering its whole scope and substance. The new method reaches its purpose not by looking away from what seems difficult, but by looking through it. In fact what was once formerly given up to the sciolist is now taken up by the savant, Science has a grand function to perform, aside from its direct teachings, in its indirect influence on the culture. Prof. TYNDALL, in a profound passage in his preface touches this key-note. ""As a means of intellectual education its claims are still disputed, though, once properly organized, greater and more beneficent revolutions await its employment here, than those which have already marked its applications in the material world. Surely, the men whose noble vocation it is to symtematize the culture of England, can never allow this giant power to grow up in their midst without endeavoring to turn it to practical account. Science does not need their protection, but it desires their friendship on honorable terms; it wishes to work with them toward the great end of all education -- the bettering of man's estate.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; HEAT CONSIDERED AS A MODE OF MORTION.

One great difficulty of revolutionists in other lands always is the necessity they are under of improvising a government as soon as they have delivered their first blow. They are seldom able to do this on the spur of the occasion, except in a manner so imperfect as to work great confusion. All the detail of administration is lacking; and so, too, are all the prestige and moral influence that attend regular authority. It takes the revolution a long while to acquire consistency and organization, and in the mean time a rude, self-constituted, irresponsible, ""provisional Government,"" has to rough-hew matters as it can -- at best but the miserable makeshift of the day. But in the case of our Southern rebellion, all this disadvantage was escaped. Government, in its full perfection, was at hand to direct the movement from the start. Nay, in most of the States it positively initiated the movement, not only determining its course in advance, but overcoming all the first inertia. It was, in fact, the State Governments that engineered the States into secession. Without them, in all earthly probability, the movement would have never been possible.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Secession by States and Restoration by States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Secession by States and Restoration by States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SECESSION', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76daaee8-100d-519c-a224-452f96540844,1167,nyt://article/76daaee8-100d-519c-a224-452f96540844,

She left Liverpool on the 25th, and Queenstown on the 26th ult. It is announced that the Galway line of steamers is to go into operation again on the 19th of August. The marine insurance companies had been heavy losers by the capture of the ship B.F. Hoxie by the Alabama -- some £150,000 having been sunk by the operation. The owners of the Alexandra had applied for the release of their vessel, and for compensation for her detention, but the application could not be entertained until certain proceedings before the Courts were gone through with. An Anti-Southern Association had been formed at Manchester. On the 23d, in the House of Commons, Mr. COBDEN called up the subject of the Foreign Enlistment act, and advocated its amendment. He referred to the Alabama, Florida and Virginia, and said it was well known that two iron-clads were now being built at Liverpool for the rebels. He called upon the British Government to prevent the departure of these iron-clads, and thus prevent a declaration of war on the part of the American Government. Mr. LAYARD, in behalf of the Government, insisted that everything had been done which could be done to prevent the equipment of vessels for the rebels in English ports. He further insisted that the Americans had built ships of war for Russia during the Crimean war, and had recruited their armies in Ireland during the present war, both of which statements Mr. LAYARD doubtless knew to be untrue when he uttered them. Lord PALMERSTON also defended the course of the Government, and said he could see no distinction in principle between ""selling arms to the Federals and selling ships to the Confederates."" Mr. COBDEN offered to read a letter from Secretary WELLES, denying the truth of the statement made by Mr. LAIRD in the House of Commons some time ago, that his firm had been approached by agents of the United States Government relative to building war vessels for the North. The Polish question remains much as represented by the previous steamer. There is much dissatisfaction, both in France and England, at the tenor of the Russian note, and the Cabinet of Vienna is also said to be much excited.

ROSECRANS, published in another column, addressed to his army from headquarters at Winchester, Tenn., under date of 28th July, shows that while addressing himself to the work of clearing the armed force of the rebellion from before him, he fully appreciates the other duties that circumstances impose. There is an army to destroy, but there is also a State to regenerate. The war breaks up all bonds -- it leaves the region it has passed over in a condition of simple anarchy or no-government, and the people are literally what our Saxon forefathers called ""waifs."" Gen. ROSECRANS tells his army that they are now called upon to aid their unfortunate fellow-citizens of Tennessee ""in restoring law, and securing its protection to persons and property -- the right of every free citizen."" With this view he calls upon them, first of all, to do their part in the restoration of law, by putting them upon their honor that no acts of lawlessness, no pillaging, no marauding, shall be committed by them. Such acts have been too common in all our armies, and cannot but produce the worst effects. Gen. ROSECRANS then invites all citizens to unite in restoring law and order, and promises all privileges and protections to such as will conduct themselves peaceably and do no injury to the Government.

One hospital chaplain, located in Virginia says: ""We have now 1,500 patients and 17 Bibles all told. There are 21 wards, each 25 feet wide and 150 feet long, each containing as man; as they can hold, and some 70 or 80 tents full beside. My object is to place in each building or ward four or five Bibles to be kept in them for the use of the patients. I have almost daily calls for the Bible. The Bible it for active service and I can employ all that you can send, I hope, with God's blessing, for good. Send certainly not less than 200 copies."" Large numbers of Scriptures were applied for from Michigan to supply the 10,000 French residents in one of the cities of that State. Application was also made from the Territory of Arizona for Scriptures, mostly in Spanish, to be circulated in that far off but most interesting field. Requests from the navy-merchant service and destitute localities were presented, all of which were promptly and most cheerfully granted. In connection with the work in this country, the Managers directed that the sum of $500 should be immediately forwarded to Burmah, India, to aid in publishing and circulating the Scriptures in the Karen language: also, $500 to Rev.

M. DE MENNENAL spoke of this correspondence to Queen CAROLINE, Who expressed a wish to see me, and made inquiries respecting the letters. I had the honor of several interviews with her on the subject. The Princess asked me to dispose of the letters to her, to which she said she attached a great value.

I certainly was not disposed to part with them, nevertheless I take a pleasure in offering them to you if you will give me in exchange a letter of year brother NAPOLEON I.' 'I have something better than that to give you,' she said. 'My brother's letters are at Milan, but here are eight small volumes of great value, which I beg you to accept.'

Two days after I took the documents to Queen CAROLINE to make the exchange agreed upon, and she now offered me only the four first volumes of the work.

But there are yet some who imagine that France is probably about to recognize us by herself. This, also, we gravely doubt. France certainly is more friendly to us than England; has much less interest than England in the breaking down of American commerce, and no interest at all in the overthrow of American democracy, seeing that she is quite as democratic herself. It is true, also, that by temperament and by the traditions of their race, the French are much more likely to feel a generous and disinterested sympathy with a brave people struggling for its rights against heavy odds. Yet Lord FALMERSTON is right in saying that the Emperor has his own impediments, which have hither to kept him back from all action in our favor. Perhaps the chief of these is the formidable ""Liberal,"" or ""Republican"" party in his empire, which is stupidly Abolitionist, which avails itself of every pretext for assailing the Emperor's acts, and which would be quite sure to cry out against, his recognition of the Confederacy, as a sanction of Slavery and a disgrace to the banner of France. And these wretched ""liberals"" are growing stronger, the defeats or Government candidates in the late elections being all in their favor.

"Neutrality; Foreign Enlistment Act, Debate on in Parliament",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/06/archives/parliamentary-proceedings-the-debate-on-the-foreign-enlistment-law.html,"Neutrality; Foreign Enlistment Act, Debate on in Parliament","Mr. COBDEN, in rising to call attention to a memorial signed by thirty of the most respectable shipowners of Liverpool respecting the evasion of our Foreign Enlishment law, said that the Government professed its inability to detect and punish the breaches of the law committed by British subjects in building and sending to sea vessels-of-war to be employed against a friendly Power. It appeared to him, however, in reading the correspondence on this subject, that the Foreign-office assumed a passive position, and thought they could only be called upon to interfere when some foreign Government complained that the provisions of the law were impugned. But the Foreign Enlistment act was passed not for the benefit of foreign Powers, but for our own protection. It was, therefore, the duty of the Executive to see that the law was obeyed, and he could not conceive that the Home-office and all its machinery of magistrates and, policemen could be better employed than in inforcing the observance of the act of Parliament. There were three vessels specifically Known which were now preying upon the commerce of a friendly Power -- the Orelo, alias the Florida, the Alabama, alias the ""290,"" and the Japan, alias the Virginia. All these were built in England, were armed and chiefly manned from England. One of these ships managed to get into Mobile and get back again, but the others had never yet entered a Confederate port. He wished the House to consider how this state of things would effect our interests if we were at war and the Americans were at peace. If the law as it now stood were not sufficient, the memorialists suggested some amendments that would give greater power to the Government to seize in British ports vessel? that were destined for the use of the belligerents. He believed that the addition of a single word would be sufficient -- the word ""building"" in addition to the words "" furnishing out and arming""' ships. This would prevent vessels leaving our ports in a partially unfinished state, and afterward being converted into a vessel-of-war. He was informed that were at this moment two ironclads now being built in this country, and that the Government had received a reclamation from the United States Minister in this country that these vessels were intended for the Confederate Government. From all he observed of the slate of public opinion in America, he was convinced that if these vessels went out and began to prey upon the United States shipping it would lead to a war with that country. Tin se ships now building at Liver pool were lion rams. They were a match for any vessel of war that America now had, or that we ourselves possessed and if they were allowed to sail it would probably lead to a rupture between this country and the United States. The fact was, we had rendered the mercantile marine of America practically valueless. The American ship-owners found the rate of insurance so raised that they could no longer compete with the ships of England and other maritime Powers. They had consequently been selling their ships to English shipowners, and he asked the House to consider the effect of such a state of thin is on the minds of the shipowners of New-York and Boston, who had always been favorable to peace with Great Britain. During the recess. Her Majesty's Government might take precautions against these ships leaving the ports of this country for service against a friendly Power. In the case of every vessel captured by the Florida, the Alabama and the Virginia, the American Government took depositions on oath as to the value of the ship and cargo, and claims for this amount were made upon the English Government- Every vessel seized and burnt was thus debited to the account of England, and a, formal claim made for the amount. Her Majesty's Government had refused to acknowledge these claims, but some day, when the demand could be made most inconveniently for the Government, the result would probably be either humiliation or war. i\o doubt many persons in this country would prefer war; but was it desirable that the interest of the whole community should be affected by the conduct of two or three firms in this country? The hon. member for Birkenhead, on a former- occasion, spoke of the greater export of arms and ammunition to the Federal States. There was, however, a great difference between the export of ships and the export of arms and ammunition Gunpowder was a constant article or commerce, and was extensively used in the operations of mining, blasting. &c. To prohibit the export of ammunition would, therefore, be injurious to a large and regular industry. There was, moreover, no law against this export. But the law undertook to prevent the people of this country from supplying ships-of-war to be used against a friendly Power, and the manning of such ships. The honorable gentleman (Mr. LAIRD) had told the House that he had been applied to to build ships for the Federal Government. If that were so, the honorable member was quite right to refuse the applications, but he held in his hand an official contradiction to the statement of the honorable member for Birkenhead.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.; The Debate on the Foreign Enlistment Law, Rebel Privateers, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.; The Debate on the Foreign Enlistment Law, Rebel Privateers, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/47c7acf1-adf4-5104-b075-36cfca41c541,4250,nyt://article/47c7acf1-adf4-5104-b075-36cfca41c541,

It appears that on the 19th of March, six days after the arrival of the vessel at Liverpool from Gibraltar, the Board of Customs instructed Mr. EDWARDS, the Collector at that port, to watch her, and report any information he might be enabled to obtain with respect to her and the bona fide character of her ownership. Mr. EDWARDS reported, on the following day, that the vessel had been watched since her arrival in the Mersey, and that nothing of a suspicious character bad taken place. On the 25th of May, a second order was sent down to Mr. EDWARDS, to inquire and report, in consequence of Mr. ADAMS having notified the British Government that the Gibraltar was being prepared for sea. Mr. EDWARDS, on the following day, forwarded to the Board of Customs a letter from Mr. KLINGENDER, the owner, to himself, stating that the vessel was chartered to convey 250 tons of cargo, and that he was landing all spare water-tanks, destroying her magazine, and cutting hatches in her main-deck, for the purpose of receiving cargo; and a report from Mr. MORGAN, Surveyor of Customs, stating that the vessel had been lying quietly in the great float at Birkenhead since her arrival, until Friday last, when she removed to the Clarence Dock, where she now lies, refitting for sea. Callao is said to be her destination. All fittings for warlike purposes have been removed from her since she obtained British registry at Gibraltar, and it appears, from pricate information received, that it is not intended to refit her for warlike purposes, perhaps because she is not well adapted to compete with modern vessels of war.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The British Government and the Sumter, alias Gibraltar.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The British Government and the Sumter, alias Gibraltar.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2a71ff24-8571-5aa3-88be-6003dd926566,791,nyt://article/2a71ff24-8571-5aa3-88be-6003dd926566,

In New-England, in the Middle States, in the Valley of the Mississippi, in the Far West, and on the coast of the Pacific, the people were of one mind. In our Armies, stationed on the Potomac, on the Tennessee, on the Upper and Lower Mississippi, and on the headwaters of the Arkansas -- in our Navy, stationed all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and on all the rivers of the South -- our soldiers and our sailors kept holiday, and acknowledged that not alone their own valor and endurance, but a higher Power had led them on to victory. In the City of San Francisco, as we learn by telegraph, there were national salutes and ringing of bells morning, noon and night, and in the evening there was a grand assemblage of the people, and a general illumination of the city; and from the farthest East we have reports of a like character. In New-York, we have seldom known a holiday to be so generally kept.

It turned but that there was a woman in the river in danger of such a fate, but she was rescued. The woman was a disorderly character, known as ""Crazy Mag,"" who has wandered about the streets for years, a public nuisance, using foul language and insulting respectable people. Her name is MARGARET O'KERRON, Several complaints were made to the Police, and on Saturday she was arrested, to be sent to the Asylum. This morning, soon after the Magistrate had disposed of her case, a policeman undertook to escort her to a cell. While going along the balcony beside the river, the girl sprang away and leaped the railing, throwing herself into the swift water, twelve feet below. The policeman caught her dress, which he tore off, but did not save the prisoner. The girl struck out into the swift water, and was rapidly drifting toward the High Falls. Ex-Policeman MCANNALLY leaped in to rescue her, but she had too much the start of him. An alarm was sounded and heard by JAMES WHITE, employed at the Gas Works, and he plunged into the river below the woman, and soon rescued her, though at considerable risk, for the water was high. The girl was taken into the yard of the Gas Company, and after considerable delay, physicians were found to attend her. For some time she showed no animation, but at length began to revive.

MCDORY and his wife CATHARINE, who died within an hour and thirty minutes of each other, under peculiar circumstances. It appears that the man had been subject to fits, and that he passed into one of them yesterday morning. His wife, thinking him to be in a dying condition, ran out and so informed another woman. Upon returning, she found her husband lifeless. In one hour and a half she also became a corpse. A post-mortem examination of the bodies has failed to elicit any prominent cause of death in the parties, except fits in the one case and possibly excess of grief in the other....The same Coroner held inquests on the bodies of Patrick Bride, a native of Ireland. 63 years of age, and residing at No. 183 Tenth-avenue; Alex. Burns, 44 years of age, a native of Ireland, residing at No. 83 West Twenty-eighth-street; Carl Kl???, a German baker, of Delancy and Broome; John Cain, of Stanton-street and Bowery; Christy Stevenson, a lad eight years of age, residing at No. 216 East Eleventh-street; Thomas Garren, No. 133 Mulberry; George Higby, of No. 151 Ludlow -- all of these were from effects of the heat.

Without disparagement to Twenty-seventh-street we may say, briefly and boldly, that it is the best ""Ghost"" we have ever had in New-York. The ""Ghost"" was introduced in a drama called ""True to the Last,"" a word of quaint and curious design, and singular inferiorily of workmanship. It serves its purpose, however, and whilst the public appetite is ravenous for ""Ghosts"" it will be bolted with avidity, notwithstanding its crudenes. Abler hands will in time supply more suitable media for the spirit players. An imaginative writer could hardly desire a more powerful ally than Prof. PEPPER. There cannot be a doubt that the spectral drama, thanks to that gentleman's Ghost, will sweep over the land with more than the violence that characterised the sensational or contemporaneous dramas in their palmiest day. The breathless anxiety of the public last evening, and the tremor of surprise at the first appalling aspect of the spectre were the best proofs of the success of the initial experiment. The first ""appearance,"" however, was the least effective part of the entertainment. It was not a Ghost in the correct sense of the word, but a hard and angular reflection of a skeleton. Subsequently, the shades of the Bride of a Night and of the Old Miser completely electrified the audience, notwithstanding that they appeared somewhat abruptly.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/08/archives/article-1-no-title.html,,"A new dodge to swindle the Corporation out of moneys belonging to the Volunteer Family Aid Fund, has been developed before Justice CONNOLLY at the Tombs. Mr. MICHAEL J. RYAN, of No. 46 Centre- street, is Assistant Treasurer for the Fund for the ???rth Senatorial District. On and prior to the 8th on July, one FRANK FLEET was employed as ""visitor,"" to make inquiries and report on the genuineness of applicants??? claims living in the Eighth Ward. JOHN GAVIN was also employed as ""assistant visitor"" for the same Ward. Of the certificates issued by these men, the claims of applicants for relief were honored and paid. Facts have recently come to the knowledge of Mr. RYAN that on or about the 8th ultimo, FLEET and GAVIN did wickedly and corruptly conspire together to utter false tokens to obtain moneys from the relief fund, with intent to cheat and defraud the Corporation of New-York, and that they subsequent??? did obtain divers sums of money, amounting, in the aggregate, ???o $36. As charged, FLEET & GAVIN had filled out certificates containing the assumed names of JOHN CAMPBELL and JOHN DUNN, and purporting to be the names of soldiers whose families were entitled to relief. Mr. RYAN avers that these names were knowingly and designedly written upon the tokens by FLEET & GAVIN, for the so???e purpose of cheating and raising money for their own personal benefit. Again it is set forth that the parties complained of issued a certificate to CHARLOTTE CAMPBELL, and prevailed upon her to present it to the Treasurer, and demand payment; to falsely represent that her husband, JOHN CAMPBELL, was in the army.

The idea under which the nations had been governed for a thousand years before the French Revolution, and which that revolution overthrew, was that the earth was made for the inheritance of men born high. For forty years, or thereabouts afterwards, it was the fashion to acknowledge that, at least in theory, neither birth nor anything else furnished an excuse for throwing artificial obstacles in men's way, in their pursuit of happiness. ""Equality before the law,"" was then the watchword, and reformers directed all their efforts to the removal of all legal impediments to everybody's having a fair start in life.

CURTIN, of Pennsylvania, for reelection, by the Union Convention that has just assembled at Pittsburgh, is a deserved tribute to one of the truest and ablest men that has filled the Executive chair of any State, in these eventful times. Gov. CURTIN had his first election just on the eve of the Presidential election, and was not chosen especially because of his supposed fitness to control the affairs of a State during a period of revolution and war. But he quickly developed a capacity equal to the exigencies that met him in office. On the uncovering of the plot of treason and war in 1861, he was one of the first Governors to present himself in Washington, and pledge to the incoming Administration the full support of the great commonwealth he presided over in upholding the Constitution and enforcing the laws of the land. And from that day to this, he has never ceased to work, in season and out of season, to make good his promise. He has not only been zealous to meet demands on Pennsylvania, but has sometimes outrun higher military authority in schemes to ward off the attacks of invaders. And events have proved his sagacity, as they also tried his patience and courage. But it is chiefly because of his devoted care and attention to Pennsylvania soldiers after they got into the field, and when they fell away into hospitals from battle or disease, that Gov. CURTIN obtained the confidence and affection of his people. His conduct has been a model in this respect. No Governor of any State has exceeded, if equaled, him in persistent thoughtfulness and care of sick and wounded soldiers, and his popularity on this ground is deserved and very great.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RENOMINATION OF GOV.

It appears that FREDERICK MUNTER, a German, employed as clerk in the store of NICHOLAS HELLMER, brother of the deceased, doing business at the above number, had fallen desperately in love with Mrs. HEISTERBURGH. Some weeks ago he proposed marriage to the fair widow and received a response which led him to press his suit with much earnestness. He seemed sanguine of winning the hand and heart of Mrs. H., but it appears that on further acquaintance her regard for him diminished, and she determined not to marry him, although she did not make known her decision. MUNTER observed that she had treated him with a certain degree of coo???ess for two or three weeks past, which fact aroused his jealousy. He imagined that Mrs. H. had another lover, and that all his hopes of winning her heart were lost; this made him desperate, and he determined to take her life. Accordingly, yesterday morning, MUNTER, armed with a butcher's knife and a hatchet, proceeded to her room, and after knocking her senseless to the floor, str???ck her two powerful blows in the face with the hatchet, and then cut her throat from ear to ear with the knife.

While there, they were detected in the act of purloining some perfumes, and dropping their plunder, attempted to escape. Officer CUDDELL, of the Sixth Ward, arrested them. On being questioned at the Station-house by Capt. JOURDAN the prisoners stated they had been shoplifting for the last six??? months. MARIA JANE KELERHAN said that she was taught to steal by her mother, and that all the plunder secured by the trio they either pawned or sold. The prisoners were searched, and on the person of JULIA KELERHAN were found three pieces of Balmoral skirting, which she confessed had been stolen from the store of Mr. MCCABE. No. 19 Catharine-street. This plunder was secured to her underclothing by means of hooks used by shoplifters. The girl FERGUSON had a pair of ladles shoes hooked to her nether garments, and said she bad taken them from the store of Mr. MCGUIRE. No. 84 Catharine-street. This girl also confessed that, on the 5th Inst., they made a raid on some stores in Brooklyn, and ""gobbled up"" seven or eight pairs of shoes, which they subsequently pawned. She still further confesses that on the same day they purloined a quantity of costly ribbons from a store in Sixth-avenue and sold them. The mother of the KELERHAN girls (so say the Police) practices the same kind of stealing. The prisoners were held for further examination.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e7853ef2-45b7-52e1-8dfb-2da227157a53,1050,nyt://article/e7853ef2-45b7-52e1-8dfb-2da227157a53,

The Conscripts in the Field,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/08/archives/the-conscripts-in-the-field.html,The Conscripts in the Field,"The first of our conscript soldiers -- the first fruits of the Conscription law -- have begun to arrive in the Army of the Potomac. On their arrival they are at once put into the ranks of the old, war-worn and badly-thinned regiments. It will take but a very short time to make out of them soldiers almost equal to veterans. Say that a regiment, three hundred and fifty strong, obtains a recruitment of one hundred and fifty freshly-raised conscripts, the latter will not only at once assimilate in character and in feeling, but will obtain the benefit of the experience in camp and field duties, in style of living and in discipline, which has been acquired by their comrades. In the first year of the war, our soldiers suffered greatly because of the lack of the military habit. They had it not themselves, and they had no way of learning it, except through the hard and slow teachings of experience. But our new conscript soldiers will have a great advantage in this respect; and the mortality among them will doubtless be much less than it has been among our previous raw recruits. They have but to copy the daily habits of life (we refer to the good habits, the military habits) of the old volunteer troops, to attain at once to comparative freedom in the routine of camp existence. As regards the National aspect of the case, the forming of an army now, under our new system, is a very different matter from what it was at first and under the old plan. The army can be increased imperceptibly and regularly until it reaches the maximum strength needed, and then, without trouble, without disintegration, without having perpetually to go over the process of reorganization, it can be kept up to that maximum.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Conscripts in the Field.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Conscripts in the Field.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f591580b-345d-50bb-aa24-00d497567124,729,nyt://article/f591580b-345d-50bb-aa24-00d497567124,
"""Yeoman"" on Mrs. Kemble's Revelations of Slavery; Kemble, Frances; Revelations of Slavery; ""Yeoman,"" Correspondent TIMES on",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/08/archives/mrs-kembles-revelations-of-slavery-note-from-yeoman.html,"""Yeoman"" on Mrs. Kemble's Revelations of Slavery; Kemble, Frances; Revelations of Slavery; ""Yeoman,"" Correspondent TIMES on","A few years ago, a series of letters appeared in the TIMES, signed as the present, chiefly descriptive of matters of personal observation in the Slave States. The series really consisted of two parts, of which the first contained observations made during a Winter's journey, in which I had followed ordinary routes of travel, (until near its close,) having been guided chiefly by the addresses of the letters of introduction with which I had been furnished by friends, these friends being mostly New-York merchants. Before I concluded this journey, I satisfied myself that what I had become most familiar with in the South was of a superficial and unusual, if not exceptional, character. My interest having been excited to penetrate the real South, I undertook a second journey, in which I discarded letters of introduction and public conveyances as much as practicable, and took pains to see, not merely that which was recommended to me as best worth seeing, but that which was common, and not supposed by my friends to be worth seeing by a stranger at all. In respect to the social condition of the Southerners, and the economic character of Slavery, my observations thus became of some positive value, and this was all the value that I claimed or intended to present in my letters. They were received, however, by many readers of the TIMES, as revelations of the wicked cruelty of Slavery, and this was made evident to me at the time both by public comments upon them and by many letters addressed to me personally by strangers upon this subject. This fact led me to give, late in the series, more information bearing upon this topic than I otherwise should have done, simply because I saw this was expected of me, and if I neglected it, my reason for doing so would be misunderstood. It was neither my purpose in writing nor in traveling to study the humanity of Slavery, and I have always considered that such observations as I recorded bearing upon such a study, were incidental to other purposes, and necessarily superficial and unimportant, except negatively, perhaps, in establishing the error of some commonly received opinions. It was not for want of interest in the question of humanity that they were so. It was not from want of sympathy with the human nature of the negro that I did not pursue it, and obtain some positive knowledge of the interior life of the plantation out or the economic field; nor was it because my life was threatened if I undertook a third journey that I did not subsequently follow up my two journeys with a third, in which special reference should be had to the condition of the slaves, otherwise than as it affected their value as laborers, and thus the whole economic condition of the South. I was satisfied that it would not be possible for me to make such a study. It could be made only, I concluded, by some one with duties which would carry him into the cabins of the slaves, at all times, and in such a manner that he would be regarded by them as a friend. No stranger could do this, not even a missionary or clergyman especially charged with pastoral duties toward the slaves. Of this I had been assured by facts in the experience of clergymen related by themselves. To them the slaves were habitually the most consummate hypocrites and deceivers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mrs. Kemble\'s Revelations of Slavery Note from ""Yeoman.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mrs. Kemble\'s Revelations of Slavery Note from ""Yeoman.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f872e1d2-2192-5134-89b8-4b94b022fe83,1394,nyt://article/f872e1d2-2192-5134-89b8-4b94b022fe83,

Mr. ANDREW HANSER, of No. 326 West Twenty-second-street, is the complainant against the prisoners, and charges that they robbed him of a horse and wagon worth $100. He makes oath that while passing through Twenty-eighth-street on Monday, July 13, he was attacked by a gang of men and boys, brutally beaten, and robbed of $70, in Treasury notes. His stable was subsequently forced open and his horse and wagon stolen; the doors and windows of his residence were crushed in by the mob and his house plundered. MARY CONLAN, MARY E. COON and MARGARET BLACK, all young women living in the neighborhood, witnessed the assault on Mr. HANSER and his house, and deposed to seeing the prisoners leading the mob in the attack, FITZHERBERT having a pistol in his hand at the time. After Mr. HANSER had been rescued by the mob they entered his house and searched it all over, but did not succeed in finding him. Maddened at not finding him, the witnesses saw O'BRIEN and FITZHERBERT, with other rioters, break open Mr. HANSER's stable and steal the horse and wagon. One of the witnesses also swears that during the attack on the house of Mr. H., FITZHERBERT proposed three cheers for JEFF. DVVIS, which were given by the mob and some of the neighbors. Another witness swears that the mob led by the prisoner, FITZHERBERT, inarched down Ninth-avenue bearing the American flag, and that the flag-bearer threw the colors down, trampled on them, fore them in pieces, and exclaimed in a loud voice, ""D -- n that flag."" Justice QUACKENBUSH committed the prisoners for trial without bail.

ANDRE CAILLOUX, a member of the First regiment of Louisiana Native (colored) Guards, who fell at the head of his company while gallantly leading it on to the charge in the celebrated assault made upon the enemy's works at Port Hudson on the 17th of May last. Capt. CAILLOUX was a fine-looking mulatto, and, as an officer, was said to be a striking and marked personage even among the large body of officers assembled at Gen. BANKS' headquarters. His funeral was the most remarkable affair of the kind that ever took place in New-Orleans or in the South. He was buried with all the pompous rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, the officiating priest delivering a glowing eulogy on the virtues of the deceased. No less than thirty-seven benevolent, charitable, religious and patriotic societies took part in the pageant. The coffin was draped in the American flag, and around it flowers were strewn in the greatest profusion, while the band of one of our white volunteer regiments performed the dirges and other customary solemn music. It was not because he was a negro, but because he was a brave man -- a man who had fallen fighting for our flag, and had sealed with his blood his devotion to liberty -- that these honors were conferred upon Capt.

The Southern Confederacy or the Southern rebellion is almost forgotten in France in the midst of the new excitement which has arisen. There is no proof, however, that the shrewd and far-seeing LOUIS NAPOLEON has turned his thoughts or his eyes altogether away from the map of Mexico, or that he is less anxious for the establishment of an ally in the Southern Confederacy, or for the cooperation of Great Britain in his schemes of aggrandizement on this continent. In fact, in a far-reaching view, LOUIS NAPOLEON has more to gain on this continent than he could possibly gain by a war for Poland.

Our people are not acquainted with the necessity of shedding blood in streets to maintain social order; and so far from being hardened to such scenes as were witnessed recently in the upper Wards of this City, when soldiers fired upon crowds of citizens, and slew by scores, the spectacle was one to shock and appal an American community.

The Recorder told MARSHALL that, although the District-Attorney did not see fit to press his case before the jury for any higher offence than attempt at robbery, owing to the peculiar character of the evidence, yet the jury had seen fit to convict him of the full crime of robbery in the first degree. He should therefore sentence him to the State prison for ten years. The prisoner is about 21 years of age, and is a hard-looking rowdy. PATRICK SWEENEY, who was convicted on Friday of riot in Thompson-street, was next brought up for sentence. The character of SWEENEY for industry and general good behavior was shown to have been good, and as the evidence against him did not prove any very serious offence, the Recorder said he would discriminate in his favor.

It is commonly supposed that the power of England arises chiefly from the vastness of her colonial possessions; but this is a fallacy. The wealth, the power, which England boasts, would be hers in a still greater degree, were every one of her forty-five colonies cut off. Why, those colonies, in their present state, are a source of weakness, not of strength, to the mother country. In time of peace they are continually drawing grants from her treasury; in time of war they render her everywhere vulnerable, prevent her from concentrating her forces, which must be frittered away for their defence, and involve her in fivefold greater expenses than she need otherwise incur. No individual, or section of a nation, has a right to claim exemption from military service in defence of the State; but the colonies of England claim this privilege. In behalf of their institutions, in behalf of the position which they respectively occupy in the empire of which they are members, they refuse to strike a blow. If England is ready to shield them from enemies in war, it is well; if not, they are resigned to abjure connection with her, and to submit to the yoke of the victor, be he who he may.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and Her Colonies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and Her Colonies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bd737210-1f81-54c6-9637-0eb384877822,693,nyt://article/bd737210-1f81-54c6-9637-0eb384877822,

The subject was spoken of in a conversational manner. The financial gentlemen, it appeared, had no authority to make any proposition before submitting the matter to the Boards of Directors of the different Banks. The principal point they wished to ascertain, however, was whether there was not such a division of public opinion as to the justice or policy of the action of the Common Council as might deter the Legislature from legalizing the measure -- whether, in fact, the security for the payment of money was beyond doubt. The Mayor expressed the opinion that there was no doubt but the Legislature would legalize the act, and that he believed it met with the approval of a great majority of the people. The opinion was expressed by several gentlemen that our full quota could be raised without the draft by offering from $250 to $300 bounty for each man.

Her Majesty has seen, with deep regret, the present condition of Poland. Her Majesty has been engaged, in concert with the Emperors of France and Austria in negotiation on the subject which has been opened to obtain the fulfilment of the stipulation of the treaty of Vienna of 1815 in behalf of the Poles. Her Majesty trusts that those stipulations will be carried into execution, and that thus a conflict distressing to Her Majesty, and dangerous to the tranquillity of Europe, may be brought to a close. The civil war between the Northern and Southern States of the American Union still unfortunately continues, and is necessarily attended with much evil, not only to the contending parties, but also to nations which have taken no part in the conflict. Her Majesty, however, has seen no reason to depart from the strict neutrality which Her Majesty has observed from the beginning of the contest. The Greek nation having chosen Prince WILLIAM of Denmark for the King, Her Majesty is taking steps with a view to the union of the London Islands to the Kingdom of Greece. For this purpose Her Majesty is in communication with the Powers who were parties to the treaty of 1815, by which these Islands were placed under the protectorate of the British Crown, and the wishes of the Ionians on the subject of the union will be ascertained. Several barbarous outrages committed in Japan upon British subjects have rendered it necessary for Her Majesty to demand reparation, and Her Majesty hopes Her demands will be conceded by the Japanese Government without its being necessary to enforce them. The Emperor of Brazil has thought fit to break off his diplomatic relations with Her Majesty, in consequence of Her Majesty not having complied with demands which she did not deem proper to accede to. Her Majesty has no wish that this estrangement should continue, and would be glad to see her relations with Brazil reestablished.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE CLOSE OF PARLIAMENT.; The Queen's Speech."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE CLOSE OF PARLIAMENT.; The Queen's Speech."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e57e9ca7-5eb6-5b51-8b65-246eb6b865b6,948,nyt://article/e57e9ca7-5eb6-5b51-8b65-246eb6b865b6,

The Political and Social Status of the Southern Negro,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/11/archives/the-social-and-political-status-of-the-southern-negro.html,The Political and Social Status of the Southern Negro,"The great argument on which the apologists of Slavery, both at the North and the South, used to rely, before the war, was that the amalgamation of the two races would be the inevitable consequence of emancipation, and amalgamation, of course, involved the degradation and debasement of the superior race. The way in which this alarming conclusion was reached was by taking it for granted that as soon as the negroes were free, intermarriages between them and the whites would inevitably follow; and this theory was so firmly held by the more ignorant portion of the Southern population, that they looked on an Anti-Slavery man with a sort of not unreasonable disgust, as a gentleman who, if he had a daughter, was longing eagerly to see her united in the bonds of wedlock with a full-blooded African. The idea that amalgamation could go on without marriage, strange as it may appear to those who know the condition of Southern society, never seems to have occurred to the majority of Pro-Slavery writers, and nothing was more common than to hear a Slavery propagandist, fresh from plantation life -- and perfectly well aware that the pure negro has almost entire y disappeared from the South, and has been replaced by mulattos of every shade of color -- talk of the physical consequences of the success of the Abolitionists as the most horrible feature in their crusade against ""the peculiar institution.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Social and Political Status of the Southern Negro.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Social and Political Status of the Southern Negro.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'NEGROES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01a3bea9-185d-5266-9eb0-60cdf2f96425,1154,nyt://article/01a3bea9-185d-5266-9eb0-60cdf2f96425,

Life of,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/11/archives/the-naval-hero-of-the-lower-mississippi.html,Life of,"Rear-Admiral DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT is now a veteran officer. He was born about sixty years since in East Tennessee, twelve miles from Knoxville. His father at that time was in the service of the United States as a Major in a cavalry regiment, and was an intimate and honored friend of Gen. JACKSON, who throughout his life lost no opportunity of showing the high regard he felt for the FARRAGUT family. Young DAVID's early years were passed among the thrilling and dangerous scenes of border life. He remembers vividly an encounter that his mother had with the Indians when he could not have been more than five years age, Seeing a number of the savages approaching the house, she required the children to hide themselves in the loft of a barn, while she and her servants secured the house in such a manner that the assailants could not enter without breaking open the doors or setting the house in flames. They threatened to do both, but Mrs. FARRAGUT, with great determination, refused to admit them, and, in order to gain time, parleyed with them through a partially barricaded door, which, however, was not so tightly closed as to prevent the entrance of a tomahawk that came very nearly taking off the heroic woman's head. Fortunately at this critical moment the hoofs of Major FARRAGUT's squadron of horse were heard upon the road, and the Indians scampered off, but being pursued, were overtaken and almost annihilated. From that time the family were no more troubled by the red-skins.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NAVAL HERO OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NAVAL HERO OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12d79c25-4242-53bf-ae8d-790c44a24208,3360,nyt://article/12d79c25-4242-53bf-ae8d-790c44a24208,

Shortly afterward the rest of the train was also captured, and was taken also into the same locality, where were about thirty of MOSEBY's gang, who commenced at once to secure the horses attached to the wagons, and to compel the drivers, and those connected with them, to shell out all they had about them, even to pocket combs and jackknives.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE GUERRILLAS IN VIRGINIA.; ATTACKS UPON SUTLERS' TRAINS THE TRAINS RECAPTURED.

SEYMOUR's first letter to the President, there is one bit of information given which the Government ought at once to adopt the most active measures to prevent any future mob taking advantage of. The Governor, in descanting upon the late riots, says that the National authorities were so badly prepared for the emergency that they ""could not even man their own forts,"" and for a time ""these very fortifications were the chief danger to the harbor of New-York."" ""One thousand men,"" he adds, ""could have seized them all, and have used their armaments for the destruction of its shipping, and of the City itself."" We are really thankful that the Governor did not inform the rioters of this fact when he addressed them from the steps of the City Hall. For, if he had done so, who can doubt, after what we saw in this City, that the ""thousand men"" would have been forthcoming instanter, and before that night's sun had set, we should have seen the guns of the harbor-forts turned upon our City and our shipping? Who can doubt that ten thousand from the riotous classes of this City would have rushed to the aid of the first thousand? And who can tell what would have been the upshot of all this? We know very well what would have been the final upshot of it. We know that the rioters would have been ground to powder by the power of the people and the Government. But who can say what bloodshed there might have been in our streets, what destruction of property, what fights in our harbor, when all the riotous elements of New-York, stimulated by blood, and fired by passion and whisky, would have ravaged the City, under the protection of the fortifications in the harbor, held by their allies?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Perils We Have Escaped.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Perils We Have Escaped.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/748f936c-c2c7-5371-b12a-6d357ae4be25,804,nyt://article/748f936c-c2c7-5371-b12a-6d357ae4be25,

From the United Kingdom; Emigration from the United Kingdom,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/11/archives/emigration-from-the-united-kingdom.html,From the United Kingdom; Emigration from the United Kingdom,"A blue book of 216 pages, containing the twenty-third general report of the Emigration Commissioners, has been published. The emigration from the United Kingdom, in 1862, amounted to 121,214 souls, of whom 58,706 or upward of 48 per cent. Went to the United States. 15,522 or a little more than 12 per cent. To British North America. 41,843 or nearly 34 per cent. To Australia and New-Zealand, and 5,143 or more than 4 per cent. To other places The emigration of 1862 exceeded the emigration of 1861 by upward of 20,000 souls, and was larger than the average of the tour previous years -- but fell much short of the emigration of 18[???], 1856 and 18[???]7, and was less than two-fifths of the emigration of the eight years from 1817 to 18[???]5. The greatest decrease, both in 1861 and 1862 was, as might we expected, in the emigration to the United States. In 1861 this emigration had fallen to 49,764 [???] to 5[???]1,22 per cent, of the whole emigration of that year. In 1862 it rose to 5[???],766, but its proportion to the whole emigration was even less than in 1861, being only 1843 per cent in fact, its proportion to the whole emigration was smaller in 1862 than in any year since 1811. In the 21 years which have elapsed since 1811, the proportion of the emigration to the United States to the whole emigration, has varied From 7[???] per cent to 48,[???] the average being 61[???]93. The decease in the last two years was of course the result of the civil war. The same cause increased the proportion of the emigration to British North America. Between 1849 and 1862 the proportion of that emigration to the whole emigration varied from 3[???] per cent in 185[???] to 18[???] per cent. in 1861. In 1862 it amounted to 12[???] Per cent. Nevertheless, the emigration to British North America, though proportionally large, was absolutely small. With the exception of the four preceding years ([???] to 1861 inclusive,) it was the smallest since 1839. Of the whole number of emigrants, 40,680, or 40[???] per cent., were Irish. This proportion is larger than in 1861, and in some recent years and indicates an increase of pressure upon the laboring class in Ireland. Whenever that is the case the ample remittances so nobly sent home to their friends in Ireland by those who have preceded them, afford a ready means of extending the emigration. The amount returned as sent home in 1862 was [???]463,024 making in the sixteen years for which there are returns, a total of [???]12,642,000. It is necessary to repeat that these returns are very imperfect, as they contain none of the remittances through the post or through private hands, or [???]ough any bank of [???] houses, which de[???] to furnish us with information. It would s[???]ely be unreasonable to estimate the amount of which there are no returns as half as much again as that of which there are returns. During the first four months of the year, the emigration is for obvious reasons generally small. The numbers who emigrated in those months during the five years preceding the present year were -- 1858. 31,423; 1859, 33,767: 1860, 38,285; 1861, 34,740; 1862, 30,016. In 1863, they have amounted to 68,571. Of this emigration, there proceeded to the United States, 46,904, which, though numerically large, is larger in proportion to the whole than the average of former years. But the proportion of Irish in the emigration was considerably larger than in previous years, Thus the proportion of Irish was in 1858, 54.61 per cent: 1859, 63.17; 1860, 64.06; 1861, 63.71; 1[???]2, 58.95. In 1863 it was 70.59 per cent. The proportion [???] single men to the whole emigration to the United States was in 1858, 37.20; 1859, 38.57; 1860, 33.74; 1861, 32.85; 1862, 32.64. In 1863 it was 36.16. The Commissioners believe that the great increase in the Irish emigration of the present year is to be attributed rather to the distress caused in Ireland by an unfortunate succession of bad seasons and to the high wages now prevailing in the United States, than to any preconceived intention on the part of the emigrants to take service with either party in the civil war now raging.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EMIGRATION FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EMIGRATION FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d332be11-8b00-54d9-bd9f-bd2010f3481e,715,nyt://article/d332be11-8b00-54d9-bd9f-bd2010f3481e,

"Gen.

Your manufacturers ought to know that they will get no large supply of cotton from this country for some time to come, if ever again, that they may arrange their affairs accordingly. The slave system of this country is already completely overthrown by the rebellion and the war, and for all industrial purposes is dead. The planters have always declared that the cotton culture is impossible with any other than slave labor; and while we do not believe this to be true, yet the planters are sincere in that opinion, and will not only be disinclined to try a system of free labor but will be, from temper and prejudice, determined against it. They will not try it. To do so they would seem to acquiesce in the policy and principles of the hated Anti-Slavery men, to which, as a body, they will not yield for many years to come, nor at all, indeed, in the present generation. The planters, as a body, are ruined by the rebellion. While a few of them were very rich, and are yet so to a considerable degree, the great majority of them were otherwise, and were living every year upon the credit of the ensuing crop. That was the general system. They had no floating capital, but all they had was invested in [???] and negroes; mostly in the latter, to the extent in all, for negroes alone, of four hundred mill [???] of pounds sterling. And now this vast amount of capital is sunk by the rebellion and vanished, as completely as if it had been destroyed by fire or flood. For a great deal of this capital the planters were indebted to merchants and slave traders, by whom the negroes were sold on one, two, three and four years, with interest, the purchaser giving as security a mortgage on part or all of his property. The large profits of the cotton planters were not permanently invested in any way outside his business, nor indeed at all, but were put into more negroes and more land, and thus the cotton culture was stimulated, and extended to the utmost limits of the ability of the planters to obtain more land and more negroes. This question enhanced the price of slaves to almost a fabulous extentt; so that the reopening of the African Slave-trade was generally discussed in the cotton and sugar States, and its expediency and necessity were insisted on is of vital importance to the South. It was said that the inter-state Slave-trade had about it all the cruelties of the African Slave-trade, except the crowding in slave ships, which would not be if the trade were legalized. They said the slaves from Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee, sold South, were torn away from home, kindred, and friends, inflicting far more suffering upon them than savage Africans endured from the same causes. That if Slavery was right, the supply of slaves was also right, and that if the trade was properly regulated, its cruel features would disappear; and that slaves from Africa could be had for $100, where as they were now compelled to pay to the American slave-breeding States from one thousand to twenty-five hundred dollars for each slave; and in accordance with this reasoning, some cargoes of slaves were actually imported into the Gulf States in defiance of the law, and the results of the adventure greatly stimulated the zeal of the planting States in favor of reopening the African Slave-trade, and prepared the way for the rebellion, because the planting States perfectly well knew that the reopening of the Slave-trade within the Union was impossible. A gentleman of New-Orleans, well acqu[???]nted with the business of the State of Louisiana, said that if the debts of all the planter were paid, not three hundred of them would have money enough left to pay for a dinner at a hotel! The peace, when it comes, will find the planters, as a body, entirely ruined, and burdened with a large amount of debt beyond their ability ever to pay, their slaves converted into freemen, instead of cash, and their lands of small value apart from the labor which had given them a price in the market. The merchants and traders to whom they are largely indebted for supplies and for negroes, and who furnished them with their needful floating capital, will find their means largely or entirely absorbed by these debts, and will be unable or unw[???]ing to lend capital to aid in inaugurating a free labor system.

I think, by new men who will succeed to the estates of the ruined cotton planters, who will have neither the means, the inclination, nor the knowledge necessary to carry on the business with a kind of labor they are unacquainted with, and which they cannot pay for a year in advance of the crop. It will require a very long time, as any one can see, for a new set of men with sufficient capital to take up the cotton lands and bring up the culture of that article to its former extent.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/11/archives/personal.html,,"-- Within the last few weaks, says the Louisville Journal, scandal, involving the character of a military officer of rank in Edinburgh, and that of a young unmarried lady of highly respectable connection, has been matter of public comment. It appears that the wife of the military officer concerned was suspicious of her husband's fidelity to herself and conduct toward the young lady in question, and that, a watch having been set, certain proofs, assumed to be undoubted, were obtained. The matter, however, did not rest here. The brother-in-law of the young lady, who holds an official position in the Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers, having got possession of a letter in which certain arrangements were proposed in the event of the officer being divorced from his present wife, came in contact with him in the New Club, and on his acknowledging the authenticity of the document, produced a horsewhip and soundly castigated him.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f41034c5-1c10-57b1-bf98-6acd0b6f34b4,674,nyt://article/f41034c5-1c10-57b1-bf98-6acd0b6f34b4,

This was done under various disguises. The ""Commercial Convention,"" became the most usual, because it was the safest cloak under which the treasonable work could proceed. At the so-called ""Commercial Convention,"" which marked the latter history of the South, some advance was made every year toward separation. Speeches were there made setting forth the superior resources of the South over any other country for supporting a powerful nation. The Free States were decried, and represented as being absolutely dependent on the South. And in this connection the revenue laws of the United States were denounced as being oppressive to the South, and devised with the sole view of enriching Northern merchants and manufacturers at the expense of Southern industry. The peculiar social and political theories of the Southern rebels, were shrewdly and constantly mixed in with these disquisitions on agriculture and commerce, and the South shown to be alien, not only in interest and feeling, from the North, but absolutely antagonistic and irreconciliable in the very framework and body of society. We were two totally distinct peoples, of incompatible temper, of widely diverse interests; and yet the Union bound the two together, and compelled the superior race, (the South,) to work, in order to support and enrich the inferior race, (the North.)",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The South Never for Disunion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The South Never for Disunion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff6e358b-841d-5ba9-9cfa-abd1beff1641,1041,nyt://article/ff6e358b-841d-5ba9-9cfa-abd1beff1641,

Early on Monday morning the Captain, with his force, reported to Capt. PORTER, at Forty-sixth-street and Third-avenue. When reaching there the crowd was not large, but soon the rioters assembled in force, coming in fifties and hundreds from different sections, until swelled to thousands of excited men armed with clubs and other weapons. The first overt act was the stoppage of the Third-avenue care, the taking off of the driver and horses, and compelling the passengers to get out. The force attempted to prevent this, but were driven back. Then ensued an attack on the Marshal's Office, a shower of stones breaking doors and windows, and finally the mob rushed into the building beating back the small force who valiantly opposed them, until flight or death were the alternatives. The force retreated to Forty-sixth-street, where they were engaged in Saving the occupants of the building and their property -- the premises having been fired -- until they were again beaten back by overwhelming numbers. Sergeant FINCH arrived about this time and took command, Capt. BROWER going to the Station-house. The Sergeant made, with his force a charge upon the mob, but failed to disperse them, and received a severe gash from a blow on the forehead, which subsequently laid him up, and his [???] was compelled to retreat. The mob was a huge one, thousands composing it, and the opposing force, bravely as they did, were entirely inadequate. After the discomfiture here they reported to headquarters, and in the evening, under Capt. BROWER, were at the Park with Inspector CARPENTER, where they made havoc upon the mob in the grand charge heretofore detailed, thence through Fourth Ward and to Central office for the night. On Tuesday this Precinct joined Capt. PETTY's command in the visit to the soap-factory in Sixteenth-street, and aided in restoring order in that section. They were also with Capt. HELMS' hazardous expedition in the second-avenue, and took a liberal hand in the severe fight there; they charged the building in which the stolen guns were stored, taking it after a savage fight, and recovering a large number of arms. At night Sergt. SLOTE and ten men were detailed for duty to Gen. WOOL, so remaining unlit quiet was restored. At midnight Capt. BROWER took command of 150 men, marching through the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Seventeenth Precincts, returning to headquarters Wednesday morning. At 9 A.M., in command of his own and the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Precine; forces, he proceeded to the scene of riot and murder in Thirty-second-street, between Sixth and Seventh avenues, dispersing the crowd and recovering the body of the colored man hung there, bringing it to headquarters.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.

London Times on Archbishop Hughes' Speech to New-York Rioters,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/12/archives/the-london-times-on-archbishop-hughes-special-to-the-newyork.html,London Times on Archbishop Hughes' Speech to New-York Rioters,"It is really worth while to study the speech of Archbishop HUGHES to the rioters of New-York, if only to learn how little Irish character is modified by residence in America. When an Archbishop comes forward in the capacity of the [???]r pietate gravis to still the passions of an angry mob, we must not look for logic, or even for any very high flight of common sense, but we may assume that he will use the gravest arguments that are likely to tell upon his audience. We should naturally expert a forcible and serious appeal to the motives of patriotism, of humanity, and of religion, and a careful abstinence from every topic calculated to awaken dangerous prejudices and fierce antipathies. A Bishop is a peace maker by profession, and though our own spiritual peers have not, always been the most backward to draw the sword in a national quarrel, we cannot fancy them flattering an English crowd into obedience to the law by vulgar tirades against France or America. They would be restrained from doing so by a sense of their own dignity, but they would also feel the hopelessness of carrying their hearers with them. Englishmen in a state of excitement cannot, indeed, argue, but they know what argument is, and they will not cheer claptrap, if it be not only incoherent but irrevelent. Irishmen, it we may just by what their demagogues, both lay and spiritual, address to them by way of paternal warning, prefer this Kind or oratory to the semblance of reasoning, and are more easily dissuaded from committing crimes in one quarter by receiving a plenary indulgence for the future gratincation or their wengeance in another. At all events, hatred of England was the key-note of Archbishop HUGHES's specific harangue, the report of which sounds too familiar to a Saxon ear for us to doubt that it was pitched in the strain which an Irish populace loves best whether at home or abroad, and delivered with a rich Milesian brogue.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The London Times on Archbishop Hughes' Special to the New-York Rioters."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The London Times on Archbishop Hughes' Special to the New-York Rioters."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c011fee3-95ad-5144-ae36-f0798a7b34d9,1413,nyt://article/c011fee3-95ad-5144-ae36-f0798a7b34d9,

The riots commenced in this Precinct, an excited crowd collecting about 9 o'clock A.M. at the Provost-Marshal's office, corner of Forty-sixth-street and Third-avenue. This was soon swelled by arrivals from all directions,until thousands had assembled, many of them armed with clubs and other weapons and all demonstrative of mischief. Capt. PORTER repaired to the office, stationing a portion of his force -- in all sixty men -- in front and the balance inside of the building. The drafting commenced at 10 1/4 A.M., and was uninterrupted for some twenty minutes. Meantime the mob outside increased to huge proportions, were feeding their excitement with threats and execrations, and suddenly turned their attention to the Third-avenue cars, one of which was passing down. The cry ""Stop the cars!"" was raised, a rush was made, the drivers taken off, horses detached and the passengers compelled to abdicate, two of them relieved of their watches; a section of the Police went to the rescue, and were assailed with clubs and stones, overpowered and driven back. Having committed the first overt act the mob became frenzied, and at once made a rush on to the Marshal's office, assailing the force on the street, driving them into the building, and showering into the windows stones and all kinds of missiles. To fight or to keep at bay the thousands was an impossibility. The Marshal and his clerks, with the Police, were driven back with clubs through the building and escaped from the rear. In a few moments the furniture was destroyed, piled up and fired, and the building was in flames so speedily that two families living up stairs barely escaped with their lives. The Police repaired to the adjoining buildings and attempted to save the property in them. They were fiercely attacked and driven away. The firemen reached the scene, but were prevented from doing anything. The Chief Engineer was present and addressed the mob, urging them to allow the firemen to go to work. Meantime the fire had spread rapidly, and three of a row of brick buildings wore in flames; the mob yielded to Chief DECKER's appeal, the companies went to work and the fourth house was saved. It was about this time that the rioters made the first serious demonstrations against the Police. Hitherto in the progress to arson and pillage, they had driven them away, but had not concentrated against them; now they massed on the Third-avenue and made a furious attack on the force, with pistols, clubs and stones. Very soon Officer COOK was knocked down and seriously injured, and several others badly hurt. The aid sent to Capt. PORTER from below could not reach him and were themselves engaged with another portion of the mob; resistance against the over whelming numbers was madness, and after a brief but severe fight the force broke and fled, the mob masters of the situation. The men recollected at the Station-house, and, in citizen's dress, revisited the section where they were defeated, and succeeded in bringing off those of the injured who had remained there. In the evening the entire force were ordered to headquarters, and were with Sergeant COPELAND's command, to Clarkson-street, for the recovery of the body of a colored man murdered there.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.; THEIR SERVICES DURING THE RIOT WEEK.

"-- The announcement the appointment of Brig.-Gen. G.K. WARREN, Chief of Topographical Engineers, to a Major-Generalship of Volunteers, will be received with unusual gratification by his brother officers, and by all who have had the opportunity to know the high soldierly qualities of Gen. WARREN. Though yet very young, (not exceeding thirty, we think,) he has still by pure merit reached in the army the very highest rounds of fame. He is a West Pointer, having, we believe, been an instructor at the Academy. At the outbreak of the war, he raised a regiment -- the Warren Zouaves -- which soon rose to be regarded as the finest Volunteer regiment in the service, and enjoyed the distinction of being brigaded with the Regulars. He then commanded what was regarded as the finest Volunteer brigade in the service, and at its head displayed the highest military talent throughout the Peninsular campaign. At Chancellorsville as a Staff officer (Chief of Engineers) he showed himself on a larger field, and took even his friends by surprise by his brilliant gallantry, his fertility of resources and general military ability. His conduct at Gettysburg, where he acted as Gen. MEADE's Chief of Staff, added still further to his fame. It is within our personal knowledge that Gen. WARREN is looked upon by his fellow academicians, (who have a high and severe standard of judgment of their own,) as displaying more of that faculty, or combination of faculties, for which genius is the only name, than any of his compeers in the army. His appointment to the Major-Generalship is the fitting reward of pure merit.

It is alleged also that he was one of the dastardly assailants of Superintendent KENNEDY. After the riots he was dead and buried -- killed by the Police. That is, by himself and friends, the report was widely circulated that he had been fatally injured in the invaded Districts, by the Police, had crawled into a stone yard and dissolved his connection with the mob, and the world generally, by laying down and soon after dying; that he was gathered up, conveyed to his family, waked over and decently buried thereafter. All this was of course a lie, manufactured to divert the search for him. Despite it, however, he has been arrested, and was brought into Headquarters, and placed under lock and key, in disgrace and with ignominy, and also with the prospects of State Prison before him, about the time that a member of the force with which he had been connected -- Officer McINTYRE, of the Twenty-ninth Precinct -- was being taken from the building and escorted with all Metropolitan honors to the tomb. This officer had lost his life in the preservation of the law which the other and his kind had violated. The one was loved and honored -- these expressions are not stereotyped ones in speaking of McINTYRE -- by every officer and comrade in his Precinct; the other, a recreant, and despised and contemned by all men as a ruffian, rioter and arsonist.

Much remains yet to be done before the military power of the rebel Confederacy will be so far broken as to make the question of peace and reconstruction one of practical politics. The rebels have strong armies still in the field; they have strong positions and important seaports still in their possession; they have the active and effective support of England and France to stimulate their hopes and prolong their efforts, -- and they have the still more effective and important support of a powerful allied party in the Northern States. All these difficulties stand in the way of peace, and must be removed before peace can be restored. Until they are out of the way, we have but one practical question -- but one important and imperative duty; we must bend all our efforts to their removal. We must aid the Government in the prosecution of the war. We must aid it in strengthening our armies, in defeating the designs of its foes, in quelling all open or disguised hostility wherever it may exist. And until this result has been accomplished, and the military and political power of the rebellion has been broken, we regard as premature and as mischievous any sharp and angry controversy concerning the terms of peace or the basis of the political reconstruction by which peace is to be followed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Question of Reconstruction.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Question of Reconstruction.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7cf36e55-4710-5b58-ace9-36daacf24b64,1709,nyt://article/7cf36e55-4710-5b58-ace9-36daacf24b64,

The Mayor stated that he had received replies from the Banks, some verbal and some written, but all to the same effect, respectfully declining to take any portion of the loan. No reason was given, but the general impression is, that the refusal of the Banks is based upon the fact that the Common Council have no legal authority to authorize the loan; and if authorized and taken, it will depend upon contingencies whether or not the next Legislature will legalize it. It was suggested, in Committee, that a special meeting of the Aldermen be called, and the resolutions so modified as to offer bounties to volunteers instead of paying for exempting men from the draft; but after consultation, it was decided to adopt the Mayor's proposition to advertise for a loan from the public.

The Court has been mainly occupied during the present Term in the trial of cases growing out of the late riots. There are many indictments yet pending against participators in the riots, and many complaints are on file in the District Attorney's office, on Which no indictments have yet been found; but owing to the extreme heat of the weather, and to the fact that in many of the riot cases the prosecuting authorities desire time to perfect the chain of evidence against the parties under arrest, the Recorder concluded not to continue the August Term of the Court any longer than two weeks. Enough cases have been tried, however, during these two weeks to give the rioters a foretaste of the doom that awaits them, and to serve as an example to such as may be disposed to renew the scenes which were witnessed in this City last month. In all the cases tried during this Term, of persons charged with crime committed during the riots, there has been only one acquittal, and that was in the case of a man who was proved to have been forced to join the mob against his will, and also escaped from the rioters as soon as he got a chance. In one case the jury did not agree, and in all the other cases tried the jury promptly found a verdict of guilty. The cases which remained pending at the adjournment of the Court were, on motion of the District-Attorney, transferred to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which holds its next regular session in October. More important cases than any that have been tried during the last week will be brought on at that term -- cases of murder and arson committed during the riots -- the details of which, when brought out by the testimony, will cause the community to stand aghast with horror. It is to be hoped that a Judge will occupy the bench of the Oyer and Terminer who will perform his duty to the public with the same fearlessness, impartiality and justice that have characterized the course of Recorder HOFFMAN during the recent trials.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Doom of the Rioters.

Seizing their guns they both fired at it, and were still more amazed when they heard broken words and cries which could only proceed from human organs. They at once steered for the spot where the supposed bird had fallen, and were struck with stupefaction on finding that what they had taken for a volatile was a man with an immense pair of mechanical wings. They took him into their boat, and were not a little relieved on finding that he had only received a few small shot in the legs. This new Icarus was flying from Antigone to Plati to visit a young person whom he wished to marry, but whose parents were opposed to the match. To visit his lady love he had invented and made the wings he wore, and had already twice crossed the strait between the islands. On his third journey his flight was cut short by this untoward accident. He is now at Plati.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b5acd7b4-bca8-5f81-9abe-7fbc86031256,1067,nyt://article/b5acd7b4-bca8-5f81-9abe-7fbc86031256,

We understood also that, although by the rules of the Park absence for two entire days from work without permission or lawful excuse entails dismissal, that these ruffians came back red-handed from their crimes, and resumed their labor on the third day, without remark or apology, and in all respects as if nothing had happened, and were suffered to do so. We understand, moreover, that to this hour no inquiry has been made, no reproof administered, and nobody selected for punishment; and that the men who are at this moment working on the Park and drawing the money of the people of this City in wages, are men who notoriously, and in open daylight, and without any attempt at concealment, spent nearly half a week, a month ago, in pillaging and burning our houses and in polluting our streets by assassination.

"Carlyle, Thomas, Ilias (Americana) in Nuce",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/14/archives/article-1-no-title.html,"Carlyle, Thomas, Ilias (Americana) in Nuce","pher is now growing very old -- verging on his seventieth year; but the years which make him more gray and grizzly do not add to the brightness of his vision or the sweep of his genius. He is descending from the ""empyrean immensities"" in which erstwhile he loved to disport, into the ""abysses"" to which he has damned so many men and humbugs. Like the blind, though not ""purblind"" old man of Scio's rocky isle, he has written an ""Iliad,"" and as it is neither long nor poetry, we present it in mass to our readers. It is the Ilias (Americana) in Nuce, -- ""The American Iliad in a Nutshell."" The plot is simple; the characters few; the dialogue brief and brisk; the denouement quickly reached, but dubious and smoky when found. It opens with a quarrel and ends with a scrimmage -- in the midst of which the curtain falls, and the hapless author plunges into the mud. Like Gen. MCCLELLAN's prospective battles, it is ""short and sharp,"" but unlike them, is not ""decisive."" It is brevity without wit. The style and spirit of the dialogue show that ""T.C."" is not at all acquainted with the character of the interlocutors or the cause of the woes unnumbered which have befallen America. Peter of the North never addressed Paul of the South in any such terms or fashion as is represented. Paul never responded to Peter's never-administered upbraidings with any such pacific phrase as is put into his mouth; and the rejoinder of Peter, which preceded his attempt upon Paul's brains, might better have been attributed to Paul as the address-precedent to his attempt upon Peter's brains. The author's note which follows the termination of the epic and the commencement of the row is fortunately succeeded by the date of May, 1863, for by August it certainly required considerable modification; and had the new Homer, who is his own annotator, delayed the publication of his piece for a few months longer, he might have had occasion to completely reverse the character of his observation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 1 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c14e609e-b4ec-55a9-8155-d422d3d8188b,413,nyt://article/c14e609e-b4ec-55a9-8155-d422d3d8188b,

The force were kept in reserve in the Precinct, portions being constantly on valuable scouting and picket duty. All that night and all Thursday were gangs around, armed with clubs and other weapons, threatening dwellings, howling, hooting and terrifying citizens; the stores were all closed and terror reigned, Sergeant BRACKETT's well arranged plans of operating in detail, boldly seconded by his men, prevented any concentration or more serious demonstration during this period.

He had been attacked at Thirty-fourth-Street and Second-avenue by a gang, against which he made manful fight, but uselessly.

Mobile Register on Stephens' Mission,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/15/archives/vice-president-stephens-mission.html,Mobile Register on Stephens' Mission,"We thank God from the depths of our heart that, the authorities at Washington snubbed Vice-President STEPHENS, in his late attempt to confer with them on international affairs, without form or ceremony. It has long been Known here that this gentleman thought, if he could get to whisper into the ears of some men about Washington, the result might be terms of peace on some sort of union or reconstruction. He seemed to forget that DOUGLAS, with whom he used to serve, is dead, and notwithstanding his mantle has fallen, by dividing it into four pieces, upon RICHARDSON and VOORHEES, VALLANDIGHAM and PUGH, still the Democratic party is not in power now, and we may thank God for it. The prospect looked gloomy to the Vice-President, whose infirmity of body no doubt casts a shadow over his spirits, and he said that one of two things must be done -- either some terms must be made, or the whole militia of the Confederacy must be called out and an immediate alliance proposed with foreign Powers. President DAVIS gave him full powers to treat on honorable terms, and started him off to the Kingdom of Abraham. But Father Abraham told him there was an impassable gulf between them and the Vice-President had to steam back to Richmond, a little top-fallen. We hope this will put a stop forever to some coakers about here who intimate that there are people enough friendly to the South, in the North, to restore the Union as it was. And we also hope the Government at Richmond will not humiliate itself any more, but from this time will look only to the one end of final and substantial independence. The North is not less set on a purpose of final separation than we are. The Republican party are not fighting to restore this Union, any more than the old Romans fought to establish the independence of the countries they invaded. The Republicans are fighting for conquest and dominion, we for liberty and independence.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""VICE PRESIDENT STEPHEN'S MISSION."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""VICE PRESIDENT STEPHEN'S MISSION."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Mobile Register', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/192a7341-b3ec-5faf-a062-3e7e3be941f5,687,nyt://article/192a7341-b3ec-5faf-a062-3e7e3be941f5,

New-York to Washington,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/15/archives/from-newyork-to-washington.html,New-York to Washington,"Our Washington correspondent intimated yesterday that the conference of the delegates of the various railroad lines between New-York and the National Capital had determined upon various improvements in the through line, so as to respond to the urgent and very reasonable demands of the public for better accommodations and higher speed. The mismanagement of the through business has justly excited popular disgust. A line disjointed at Philadelphia, Perryville and Baltimore, and only welded by a tedious passage with horse power through the streets, or by boat over the river; perpetual irregularity of time; frequent accidents, and consequent detentions, with constant liability to accident, a single track for the most of the distance; unnecessary and dangerous curves; uncomfortable, ill-ventilated cars; these are but a portion of the elements of dissatisfaction which have irritated the traveling community. In the extremity of the general desire to escape from the necessity of thus imperiling life and limb and time, various projects were resorted to for opening other routes. One traversing a wide segment of Pennsylvania on the westward of the existing line, was planned. Another styled an ""Air Line"" was projected to the eastward of the present route; but which, traversing large expanses of water, might more properly be called a ""Water Line;"" and which was really longer, in fact, and would have been greatly longer in time than the road via Philadelphia. In the meanwhile, a glance at the map showed that no nearer approach to an ""Air Line"" between New-York and Washington than the road via Philadelphia is possible, a straight-edge laid over Jersey City and Washington, passing almost exactly through Philadelphia and Baltimore. To rectify this straight line in all its arrangements, was what the public demanded of the several proprietary companies; and to that demand the companies -- some of them cheerfully and the others under compulsion -- have decided to yield.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'From New-York to Washington.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'From New-York to Washington.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2e212dbb-ccdc-5320-b2ff-77eeeb2ab34f,833,nyt://article/2e212dbb-ccdc-5320-b2ff-77eeeb2ab34f,

Every one of the rioters who is now in custody would be content to lie another month in jail untried, for the chance of being brought up before MCCUNN, instead of having to face Recorder HOFFMAN. There has, of course, never been any question that MCCUNN's object in parading himself before the rioters at the meeting called by Archbishop HUGHES was to assure the mob in advance that they had at least one friend among the judges; and the run on him for writs of habeas corpus which followed was the legitimate consequence of the demonstration. The decision of the General Term of the Supreme Court, touching his power to issue them, was, of course, a severe blow to the hopes of those who counted on him for impunity, and they were still further dashed by the admirable attitude taken by Recorder HOFFMAN. But they have nevertheless not ceased entirely to count on him. There was the chance that if their counsel could stave their trials off into September they would come before Judge MCCUNN alone, and then, although he could not order their summany discharge as if they were brought up on a habeas corpus, he could render their escape easy and certain in the thousand ways -- the charges to the juries, the rulings, on points of law and on points of evidence -- with which we are already unhappily too familiar; and if the worst came to the worst, he could ""suspend sentence,"" or make it light.

"At Albany, on Tuesday of this week, Deputy United States Marshal LOWELL arrested a man aged about twenty-five years, known there as R.H. WEB  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/15/archives/an-important-arrest-a-dealer-in-counterfeit-united-states-notes.html,,"At Albany, on Tuesday of this week, Deputy United States Marshal LOWELL arrested a man aged about twenty-five years, known there as R.H. WEBSTER, who professed to be engaged in ""the study of the law,"" on the charge of manufacturing United states Treasury Notes. The accused was brought to this city, and gave bail to appear before Commissioner RUGER for examination on Monday next. The Marshal found on WEBSTER's person, when he made the arrest, a quantity of letters, which are from persons in all parts of the Northern States, and contain the fullest evidence of extensive swinding operations in which he has been engaged for some time, and with excellent success. He has been sending circulars to postmasters, and other local officers, at small towns throughout the country, covering a proposition to furnish the means of successful speculation, and offering for sale, at 30 cents on the dollar, imitations of United States Treasury Notes, which he promised should be so perfect as to defy detection. If the person addressed responded favorably, further correspondence ensued, a sample of the ""imitation notes"" (of the denomination of $1, genuine issue,) would be sent, which in most cases would call out an order for a larger quantity of the notes, inclosing bank bills to pay for them at the rate of 30 cents on the dollar. It is evident from the tenor of some of the accused's correspondence that he never furnished the ""imitation notes"" spoken of in his circulars; that the genuine $1 note was employed as a bail to call out an order for a quantity of them, accompanied by a remittance in advance payment, which he would pocket. In this manner WEBSTER has done a large business, and his correspondence shows that he has received hundreds of dollars from dupes in all parts of the Northern States. He denies that he has manufactured or dealt in counterfeits, and claims that his proposition to furnish ""imitation notes"" is innocent at least so far as the Government is concerned. His operations are of the sharpest character, and it is probable that the only advantage to be gained from his arrest will be an exposition of his swindling operations, which may serve to put the public on the lookout for frauds of like character.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'An Important Arrest.; A DEALER IN COUNTERFEIT UNITED STATES NOTES ARRESTED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'An Important Arrest.; A DEALER IN COUNTERFEIT UNITED STATES NOTES ARRESTED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Syracuse Journal, Aug. 13', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Aug', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/91095d16-eacc-54a0-bcc5-88c941006a63,814,nyt://article/91095d16-eacc-54a0-bcc5-88c941006a63,

The Comptroller sent in a communication saying that he is determined to commence a suit against the Houston-street (Brooklyn) Ferry Company for $18,100, for the rent accrued up to the commencement of this quarter, and if they oppose, he will take immediate measures to dispossess them. The Comptroller reported the balance in the City Treasury on Aug. 8, to be $1,375,133 42, and that the expenditures on City account for the year, to July 31, were $4,374,080, 58, leaving an unexpended balance of appropriations of $4,052,621 58. The President, MORGAN JONES, presented a new conscript exemption ordinance appropriating $3,000,000 for the purpose of commuting the draft of all persons who are unable to pay the commutation fee. This ordinance is the same in effect as the one laid over in the Board of Aldermen on Thursday. It differs from that in the sum of $500,000 increase of appropriation, and in more stringent provisions, and exempts the active firemen, that is, by providing the commutation fee for each. It is understood that this ordinance was drawn by Mr. JONES after consultation with eminent legal and official gentleman, and also Judge-Advocate-General. NELSON J. WATERBURY, and meets the approval of a majority of the Aldermen and Mayor O[???]DYKE. After its adoption, on suggestion of Mr. JONES, a resolution was adopted, c[???]l Gov.

He hastened forward, and attempted to drive the animal away, when it turned upon him. BURNS had a double-barreled shot-gun with him, which he is in the habit of carrying for the purpose of killing stray dogs that infest the Park. This weapon he now raised for the purpose of firing upon the rabid animal, when his foot slipped and the contents of the gun, instead of entering the dog, went wide of the mark. One of the buckshot struck a woman named Mrs. JANE HENRY, who was standing in the door of her residence on the opposite side of the street. It entered her shoulder, inflicting a serious, though probably not a mortal wound.

Goodell, of the Twenty-fifth Connecticut regiment, a son of Rev. Dr. Goodell, the veteran missionary of Constantinople, Turkey, and a graduate in 1862 at Amherst, according to the Spring-field Republican, has had some interesting experience during his nine months in Louisiana. The Twenty-fifth has suffered severely in several battles, and Lieut. Goodell has seen many narrow escapes. At Irish Bend, a wounded man whom he was carrying from the field, was shot a second time in his very arms. When Gen. Banks called for 1,000 men, with officers, to storm the works at Port Hudson, after the unsuccesslul assault of the 14th of June, he was one of the first to offer his services, although the early capitulation of the place made the attack unnecessary. During the siege, in one of the charges made by his regiment, his life was saved in the most singular manner. A rebel soldier not more than twelve yards in front, turned upon him, aiming a loaded rifle full at his breast. At the moment he fired a soldier of the One Hundred and Tenth New-York stepped in front of Lieut. Goodell, and, receiving the discharge, was instantly killed. It is not certainly known, but it is thought, that the act was intentional. The Union troops were at the time driving the rebels up the steep side of a ravine, and as the soldier fell backward, being on higher ground, he struck Lieut. Goodell, knocking him over, and rendering him unconscious for some time. When he regained his senses, bis regiment had retired, and although in close proximity to his ""Southern brethren,"" he preferred not to remain. Rolling himself slowly and quietly down into the ravine, he crept off, and at last found his comrades, who hailed him as one from the dead, for they had seen him fall and thought him killed. Lieut. Goodell was promoted from Second to First Lieutenant after the battle of Irish Bend, was for some time Acting Adjutant, and is now on the Staff of Col. Bissell, Acting Brigadier in Grover's division.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8c4542f-ac1f-56dd-836f-ec26fe518195,652,nyt://article/e8c4542f-ac1f-56dd-836f-ec26fe518195,

Between Vicksburgh and this city 15 deaths occurred; and to judge from the emaciated forms of the poor fellows stretched out on their cots, a great many more than that number will reach a soldier's grave before they arrive in St. Louis, the place of their destination.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ITEMS FROM VICKSBURGH.; The Memphis correspondent of the St. Louis Republican writes:', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ITEMS FROM VICKSBURGH.; The Memphis correspondent of the St. Louis Republican writes:', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f48d1e0-932e-5a2d-99b3-1be726fc844a,451,nyt://article/0f48d1e0-932e-5a2d-99b3-1be726fc844a,

There are three of us, you know, in company, the LL.D., the Preacher, and myself the Editor. The Doctor is dignified, deliberate, and slightly sensitive to inaccuracies.

Sometimes he would (like a bird that has not quite made up its mind whether to sing or not, and throws a note or two) very deliberately ejaculate one or two good French words, and while the polite shopman, or woman rather, waited for the rest, he relapsed into silence and meditations on that mysterious providence that debarred so large a part of mankind from the privilege of understanding English!",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""REV.

The ordinance is so framed as to place it upon the same legal footing as the previous ordinances to raise money for the relief of families of volunteers, and there is no doubt that the $3,000,000 will be raised without any difficulty. Indeed numerous capitalists have already signified their willingness to take stock in the loan, and there appears to be no doubt of its legality. Although the money is to be raised ostensibly for the support of the families of drafted men: yet its provisions are such that it amounts practically to a payment by the City of the $300 commutation money for every drafted man who is poor, and has a family dependent on him for support. He is allowed to take the $300 for his family and go himself, or to procure a substitute who will receive the $300, or in case be declines to do either, the $300 is paid over to the Government for his commutation. This applies to all poor men with families who may be drafted, and to all members of regular organized fire companies. The passage of this ordinance takes away from the secession demagogues the entire capital with which they have operated to work upon the passions and sympathies of the laboring men. Meantime every good citizen will rejoice that a legal and peaceable way has been devised by which the law may be enforced in this City as in other parts of the country, without working injustice or hardship to any one. All apprehensions of further disturbance in connection with the draft may be set at rest. Any future riot in that connection will be evidently what many believed the last riot was actually, the work of rebel sympathisers in our midst, and designed to assist the traitors of the South in their efforts to overthrow the Government.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Draft.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Draft.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6fd097ea-08cd-5163-9f42-c54e0d715b55,355,nyt://article/6fd097ea-08cd-5163-9f42-c54e0d715b55,

The defiant tone of the Russian dispatches would seem to indicate that the Czar had chosen war rather than concession. But when those dispatches were written, the impression at St. Petersburgh was that Austria could be seduced from the coalition, and that, without her, the Western Powers would not venture to have recourse to arms. The reply of Count RECHBERG to GORTSCHAKOFF's proposition, in favor of a Conference of the Partitioning States, has, however, dissipated the illusion touching the possibility of winning over Austria. The Kaiser, so far from being flattered by the invitation, is even highly offended with ALEXANDER for presuming to institute a parallel between Galicia and the Kingdom of Poland, and will be no party to a Conference from which France and England may be excluded. Austria's prompt and peremptory rejection of the Russian Conference scheme, proves that the coalition is not altogether of so hollow a nature as the Czar imagined, and may induce him to adopt a more cautious and conciliatory tone in his future rejoinders.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The European Crisis and the Action of Austria.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The European Crisis and the Action of Austria.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Austria', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a4896241-cc13-5883-a67c-eeb192c1cb37,975,nyt://article/a4896241-cc13-5883-a67c-eeb192c1cb37,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/16/archives/launch-of-the-first-navybuilt-ironclad-the-miantonoma-afloatthe.html,,"This is the first launch of an iron-clad built in the country by the Government. At the time the iron-clad mania took possession of the country, the stocks of our Navy-yards were all occupied with wooden vessels of war. Armored salps were wanted in ninety days, as the Merrimac was menacing Washington. The Monitor was built in that time, being a contracted vessel, and of course successful. Others were immediately contracted for, and the batch of nine Monitors, of which the Passaic is one -- the second nine which are about to be launched, and the third fifteen light draught ships, which were in course of construction -- were all put upon the stocks in rapid succession. Government employes not being so hurried as those outside, have, as a matter of course, made better work of their ships than the latter. It is probably true that no vessel was ever launched from any Navy-yard in this country so perfectly finished in every way, so strong and sound, as the Miantonomah. Considerable interest is therefore manifested concerning her, and yesterday morning it was hoped she would first touch her native element ""all right."" The affair came off at the Brooklyn Navy-yard. From every flagstaff in the yard and on the shipping United States bunting was flung to the breeze in honor of the occasion. Under a cloudless sky and rather warm atmosphere about three thousand ladies and gentleman and officers of the United States Navy assembled in the immediate vicinity of the Miantonomah. The celebrated band of the North Carolina, lying near by, discoursed sweet music. All the vessels and boats in the offing were filled with spectators. The shiphouse itself was filled with a select party, accommodations having been erected -- three galleries tastefully decorated with the colors of all nations. The noble vessel as she lay upon the stocks was the object of universal admiration. She looks like an ordinary ship cut down to the deck -- the logging and armor are to be placed on the outside of the plank as soon as possible. Her extreme length is 259 feet, extreme breadth 52 feet 10 inches, and depth of hold 14 feet 9 inches. Some anxiety was felt on the score that being so broad and flat-bottomed she would not make a good launch. Her tonnage is 1,800 tons. She has two decks and two revolving turrets, one tore and one aft.; two guns in each. A 15-inch gun and a 20d-pounder will probably be the armament of each turret. The internal diameter of the turrets is 21 feet. The accommodations for the crew take up the whole forward part of the deck. The Captain's cabin is in the extreme aft.; the other officers wardrooms are also in the aft. She is a propellor, worked by four engines, which are smaller than usual for such a large vessel. The machinery is being constructed at the Novelty Iron Works. The cylinders are 32 inches in diameter; the diameter of the propeller is 11 feet 6 inches, and 24 feet pitch. Unlike the other Monitors they are on each side and not in a ""well."" She has four bollers. The iron armor is composed of inch plates of iron five thicknesses. She is the strongest vessel of wood that could be built. Mr. B.F. DELANO is the Naval Constructor, and R.W. STEELE the Master Carpenter.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Launch of the First Navy-built Iron-Clad.; THE MIANTONOMA AFLOAT--THE BEST OF OUR IRONCLAD FLEET.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Launch of the First Navy-built Iron-Clad.; THE MIANTONOMA AFLOAT--THE BEST OF OUR IRONCLAD FLEET.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b656489f-d727-51fe-8aad-33e1af2f8cb0,807,nyt://article/b656489f-d727-51fe-8aad-33e1af2f8cb0,

BLACK, of Worthing, Washington County, Georgia, and a member of the Forty-eighth regiment from that State, who was captured near Strasburgh a few days since. He says that in his district only five votes were cast for secession and upward of 100 against it. His part of the State was considered the Union or disaffected part of Georgia. The sympathies of the people were largely against secession up to the last moment. In his regiment are many men like himself -- unwilling soldiers in the cause of rebellion. He says that when he left home he prayed God to keep him from ever shooting a Union soldier, and he is happy in the belief that he has never killed one, although he was in the battles of Fredericksburgh and Chancellorsville. He was wounded in the latter battle. He says that in Georgia, as elsewhere in the extreme South, a poor man who has to work at day's work for a living has a very hard chance in the world. Fifty cents a day was considered a big price for a laborer. They worked at the same work as negroes, and were held in the light of ""poor white trash"" by those who owned negroes, He thinks that those who owned negroes and who started the secession business ought to have been the men to right it out. Such men as him, having no ownership or interest in negroes, felt that they had no rights that were being injured, and only desired to be left at home with their families. He first heard the news of Vicksburgh and Port Hudson at Guiness Station, and he says that it fell like a shower of bombs in the rebel ranks. The Union men among the soldiers secretly rejoiced, while the others cursed and talked very despondently, saying that the cause of the South had gone up, and that there was no chance. BLACK was not in the battle of Gettysburgh, being sick with the fever-ague. He, however, had been sent forward to Winchester to reinforce LEE, and met his regiment on its return from Pennsylvania. It had suffered terribly in the battle. One of his brothers had been badly wounded, and his Captain had lost an arm. He says that the Captain told him that their men had been badly used, and that it was the severest and, to them, the most disastrous fight of the war. Their own estimate of their loss in killed and wounded was about twelve thousand. He never heare how many prisoners they lost. The men were very dejected, wearied, foot-sore, sick and hungry. They made no concealment of their belief that everything was going against the South, and that the Union armies would speedily triumph. The rations of the rebel soldiers in camp were a tin of flour and a half a pound of meat per day to the man. Their rations had to be cooked op every man for himself. They had no such thing as sugar, coffee or any vegetables. They rarely had even salt. He had simply one meal per day of the food named. On the march, BLACK says he has been three days without food. Such a thing as tents for the private soldiers had been unknown for a long time past. He says that at Fredericksburgh last winter he slept every night by a log-fire with nothing over him or under him except snow, sleet, rain and mud. He and all the private soldiers suffered terribly and many were ruined for life. Desertions were very frequent and in large numbers, especially within the last few months. The men had begun better than ever to appreciate the fact that they were fighting against their best hopes and interests, and they were determined to do so no longer. He thinks there will be a terrible reaction in the South against the leaders once the rebel armies are overthrown. Georgia will be too hot to hold them.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Affairs in the South.; STORY OF A GEORGIA DESERTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Affairs in the South.; STORY OF A GEORGIA DESERTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c5c771bd-6d57-569a-9cd1-af70d8fa6be3,783,nyt://article/c5c771bd-6d57-569a-9cd1-af70d8fa6be3,

Certainly, if any of the writers had thought that his letter would ever be shown up in this way, he would have been most earnest to have it destroyed; or, rather, if he had a grain of common sense, he would never have written at all, ""for there is nothing concealed that shall not be made known.""

"-- A CITIZEN KILLED BY A COLORED CITIZEN. -- WM. Fox, a gardener to Mrs. BUTLER, was shot on Friday night at Camp Wm. Penn, Chelton Hills, by a colored sentry named CHARLES REILLY, and died in an hour from the effects of his injuries. Deceased, who was in company with several men and boys, stopped at a fence near the post of REILLY, and was ordered away. The others started off, but FOX remained and denied the right of the sentry to compel him to go. The Corporal of the Guard was called for by REILLY, and to the question what was the matter, the sentry replied that some men were at the fence and refused to leave. A voice cried out. ""Shoot them, then."" At this REILLY raised his gun and said. ""Are you going to leave? If you don't I'll shoot."" ""I guess not,"" replied FOX, who seemed to look upon the matter as a joke. In another moment the sentry fired his gun, and the shot took effect in the right wrist, and then passed through the body. The report of the musket brought the officers of the camp to the scene of the shooting, and the ball was extracted by the regimental surgeon, Dr. J.F. HOLT. Mr. FOX was then removed to his residence, and died in about an hour. Lieut-Col. WAGNER made an investigation of the affair, and ascertained that the Corporal of the Guard did not use the words ""shoot them,"" but they were used by one of the privates off duty. The Corporal of the Guard did not arrive until the shooting was over. REILEY gave as an excuse for the shooting that he thought the man was getting over the fence. Coroner CONRAD will investigate the matter to-day, and the investigation should be a thorough one. The shooting, as it now appears, was wholly unjustifiable. There was no attempt to get within the camp ground, nor was anything done to call for interference on the part of the sentry. The deceased was there a mere spectator, and it is not pretended that he did not conduct himself properly. -- Philadelphia Ledger, Aug. 10.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/16/archives/shooting-at-camp-penn-philadelphia.html,,"-- A CITIZEN KILLED BY A COLORED CITIZEN. -- WM.

D.; Intellectual Development of Europe","If there be any truth, in the Greek proverb that ""a great book is a great evil,"" Mr. BUCKLE has much to answer for. The success he achieved in his attempt to introduce the forms of scientific induction into the phenomena of human affairs, has given rise to a score of pretenders in the same field, both in Europe and America; and. for our own part, we have come to regard the Philosophy of History as a good deal of a humbug -- not to say a good deal of a bore. By this we hope it will not be understood that we fail to appreciate the value of the tendency of this class of investigation. The guiding principle that human affairs obey the same governance of cause and effect operative in nature -- that the multifarious and complex outgivings of the mind of man in politics, society and life, that constitute history, are the work of reason, consequently rational, that is, logical, and hence subject to scientific treatment, is a thought destined to be in many ways, and in the largest sense, what BACON called ""fruitful."" But this principle, so far from being a new discovery, (as our modern charlatanism claims,) was really never absent from the minds of the great philosophers, poets and statesmen. The belief in the moral order of the universe indeed was, with the Greeks, an article of aesthetic faith; and DANTE, SHAKESPEARE, ST. AUGUSTINE, SPINOSA, MACHIAVELLI, PASCAL, BACON, are full of the same sublime thought, whether developed in aphorisms or running unconsciously, as the animating soul, through their work. It is true that, toward the close of last century, for the first time, this principle was seized upon as a conscious instrument of historical investigation, and applied with great success by MONTESQUIEU and CONDORCET, in France; HERDER, in Germany, and by HUME and ADAM SMITH, in England. Since that time this tendency has been favored by the great development given to history in general, both through the vast accession of historical material and by the importation of new methods of historical treatment and criticism. All our best modern historical works, as for example GROTE, NIEBUHR. MOMMSEN, BUNSEN, GUIZOT, MACAULAY, THIERS, THIERRY, SISMONDI, HALLAM, CARLYLE, show profoundly the impress of the new manner of dealing with history, That history shall deal with the broad humanities, instead of circling around Kings and Courts, that political and social growths are traceable to necessary causes, that ""through the ages one increasing purpose runs,"" are acquired truths whose light and guidance we hope never to lose.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""DRAPER'S PHILOSOPHY OF EUROPEAN HISTORY.; A HISTORY OF THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPE.

"The Hibernian brought the news that the great rebel cotton loan had declined on the London market to 35 per cent, discount, in spite of all the efforts of rebel sympathizers to sustain it. One effort of this kind was a letter from a Mr. MCRAE, agent for the loan, who states that the cotton purchased by the Confederate Government is some 500,000 bales, mainly in Georgia and Alabama, but some also in Eastern Mississippi, Northwestern Louisiana and Texas, and is stored on the plantations of planters from whom it was purchased, in warehouses 300 feet from other buildings.

And lest they should console themselves with the thought that this applies only to what is in Mississippi and Louisiana, this letter of Mr. MEMMINGER is accompanied by one from Mr. DEBOW, in Alabama, to the Mobile Advertiser, informing the public in that State that this is the policy of the rebel Government, and that he had ceased to purchase cotton in Mississippi, whether Eastern or Western.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/18/archives/the-security-for-the-rebel-loan.html,,"The Hibernian brought the news that the great rebel cotton loan had declined on the London market to 35 per cent, discount, in spite of all the efforts of rebel sympathizers to sustain it.

"A good deal of interest is associated with the battle in the Indian Territory, which has been imminent for some weeks past, and which has probably been fought by this time. We publish this morning an interesting account of the prospects of the battle, of the forces arrayed on either side, and of the respective officers in command. The commander of the rebels is one STEELE, a renegade New-Yorker, and the Union commander is Gen. BLUNT, well known for his battles, marches and victories in the Far West. The troops on either side will consist of the most notable mixture of colors and races that have yet fought during the war. There will be negroes, Indians, half-breeds, mulattoes and white men. The rebels are said to have about 10,000 men, of whom three-fourths are Indians, under command of Acting Brigadiers SANDY WALKER, STAND WAITIE, and CHILI MCINTOSH. The remainder of their troops are Texans and nondescripts from Western Arkansas. The Union force consists of a Kansas regiment, a Colorado regiment, a negro regiment, and three Indian regiments, with artillery and cavalry -- or less than 5,000 men. The Choctaws and Creeks are the principal rebel tribes, and the Cherokee is the principal loyal tribe; but it is believed the two Creek regiments will desert in mass to our side as soon as the battle commences.

While we know nothing positively of the views of His Honor, we understand from reliable sources that in his interview with those framing the ordinance he suggested amendments, making it more consistent with the interests of the Government, and at the same time not a whit less liberal to those drafted whom it is intended to benefit. When His Honor was consulted in regard to the ordinance -- and that he was consulted is a matter of publicity -- he suggested that in the second section should be incorporated a provision to the effect that the parties drafted, and to whom the $300 were to be paid, should not receive the money until they had been mustered into the service of the United States, and were sent to a rendezvous. That this provision is eminently proper and absolutely necessary, is proven by the suggestive fact that the late Comptroller estimated of the half million appropriated for bounties by the City, four-fifths or four hundred thousand dollars were paid to parties who evaded service after receipt, either by skedaddling or skulkage! His Honor the Mayor requested that the provision referred to should be incorporated in the second section. The consultation of His Honor with those drawing the ordinance, and his concurrence in its general provisions, has created the impression that, as it exists, he approves of it. But this essential provision, on which he was most tenacious, has, from a misapprehension of his views, been omitted from the second section, where it should most apply, and been incorporated in the fifth, where it is only applicable to volunteers. A caucus of the Common Council will be held this morning, whereat, it is supposed, this and other suggestions of His Honor will be semi-officially considered. That, characterized as they are by sagacity and prudence, and sustained as they will be by the public, they will receive courteous and approving attention, we have no doubt.

SEYMOUR's language, as well as that of his supporters in the Press, that his section of the Democratic party are about to incorporate in their political creed a new article, making it the duty of the Government to delay the execution of all new laws until the Courts have pronounced them constitutional, whenever anybody expresses any doubt about it, we wish respectfully to suggest that they should at the same time define the precise amount of doubt which they will consider sufficient. Nothing could be more inconvenient than to leave this point in uncertainty. The whole doctrine is novel. The honor of inventing it belongs to that great political luminary, FERNANDO WOOD, when Mayor of this City six years ago. Up to that time the nation had got along tolerably well with the time-honored presumption, sanctioned not only by judicial decisions but by common sense, that a law not only might be but was constitutional until the Courts had, on the application of a private individual, who felt himself aggrieved by it, pronounced it the contrary. FERANANDO in one of those happy fits of inspiration to which he owes all the glories of his career, discovered that this was a mistake, and that if anybody affected by the operation of an act expressed doubts of its validity, this at once raised the presumption that it was invalid, and deprived it of all force and authority until the question was decided. Moreover, what rendered this contrivance still more curious and valuable was, that, under it, the doubter was not under any sort of obligation to submit his doubts to any test whatever. He was not to be obliged to go to Court to have them either confirmed or set aside. His part was simply to doubt and refuse obedience, and upon those who approved of the law fell the burden of trying the question of its constitutionality.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Novel Political Dogma.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Novel Political Dogma.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5f749aaf-7337-56d9-83f1-79768d34c068,1152,nyt://article/5f749aaf-7337-56d9-83f1-79768d34c068,

The ""Thirty-second"" were active and gallant in this affair, and seemed to relish infantry duty after their uninterrupted duty as mounted Police. Returning to headquarters, there was but a brief respite ere again under inspector DILKS they marched to same v[???]nity, engaged in another conflict, where their command was again conspicuous, and were parties to another victory. It was at this time that Capt. HELME's command was being hemmed in from all quarters, and the rescue, bravely as his men would have fought, was the result of the opportune arrival of Inspector DILKS. The hazardous return march, and the stubborn persistence of the mob in their assaults, have already been fully described. On reaching headquarters, Capt. WILSON and his command were sent through the infected districts of the Eleventh and Seventeenth Wards, and on return reported to Inspector LEONARD at the City Hall; from here, aside of the day duties, were sent at night to the Western Hotel, and had a hand in the dispersion of the mob which had threatened it, several of the parties being cracked on the head some what severely; thence to Cedar-Street, to the Government Stores to the Twenty-seventh Precinct, and a march through it, and 4 A.M. Wednesday, after nearly twenty hours of continuous march, interrupted only to give battle, returned to the City Hall and stretching out on the marble floor the members were allowed a brief rest.

It appears that the draw of the bridge was open for the purpose of passing a boat through the canal, and this being unperceived by the driver of car No. 119, which was coming from Greenwood to the city, the horses were driver overboard, dragging the car with them into the creek. The passengers in the car were Rev. WM.C. SHANNON, a blind Clergyman, who was on his return from Fort Hamilton, where he had conducted religious exercises during the early part of the evening. He was accompanied by a lad named THOMAS STEWART, aged 14 years. They were in the rear of the car, and both were drowned. Mr. SHANNON's family, consisting of wife and sister, reside at No. 119 Degraw-street; he has no children. The other passenger was Mr. HENRY C. HUDSON, residing in Ninth-street, near Third-avenue; he was standing near the driver, on the front platform; both were precipitated into the creek. Mr. HUDSON wag severely injured about the head and face, and sustained a dangerous cut on the arm, by which an artery was severed. The conductor was inside the car, and as it went over the bridge he was thrown with great force through one of the windows, by which means he was enabled to escape, although badly cut about the hands and face. The driver, JOHN FERRIL, was slightly injured by falling head-long into the creek, but succeeded in making his way to shore una[???]ded. One of the horses attached to the car was drowned -- the other was saved; the car was shattered to pieces. The creek, at the place where the accident occurred, is about 150 feet wide, and the water about 20 feet deep at high tide. The water at the spot where the car fell is a out 7 feet in depth. The bodies of the unfortunate victims were recovered and given in charge of their friend.

Why We Want,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/21/archives/why-we-want-cavalry.html,Why We Want,"The time is approaching when the Union armies will no longer be called on to confront great armies in the field. With the defeat of LEE and the breaking up of his army as the armies of JOHNSTON and BRAGG have been broken up, the only foes we shall have to settle accounts with will be minor bodies of rebels and bands of guerrillas, varying in number from one to ten thousand, and seldom mounted, from the simple fact, that even with unrestrained impressment, they will not be able to get horses. To meet and hunt out these bands our men will not march in large armies, but will sweep from point to point in flying columns. This mode of warfare will bring forth the real fighting talent of subordinate officers, and it will be in such warfare that mounted men will have immense advantage, whether they be regular cavalry or mounted infantry, and whether it be upon the pursuit or in actual meeting. The history of this arm of the service shows that when properly wielded, infantry bodies are powerless before it. For all purposes of scouting, reconnoissance, or passing through an enemy's country, its value is computed by military authorities as three to one. In battle, it is not that cavalry are expected to come to an actual crossing of swords, any more than infantry are to mingle bayonets -- a thing which has seldom occurred -- but they carry a moral force that cannot be equaled by any unmounted men. ROEMER, in his History of Cavalry, gives, in a few words, an admirable description of the use of cavalry in battle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Why We Want Cavalry.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Why We Want Cavalry.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f28eb612-9454-5144-a3f6-6afaf5fcc66e,858,nyt://article/f28eb612-9454-5144-a3f6-6afaf5fcc66e,

"Slaves command  a higher price in Kentucky, taking gold as the standard of value, than in any other of the Southern States.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/22/archives/market-price-of-slaves.html,,"-- Slaves command a higher price in Kentucky, taking gold as the standard of value, than in any other of the Southern States. In Missouri they are sold at from forty dollars to four hundred, according to age, quality, and especially according to place. In Tennessee they cannot be said to be sold at all. In Maryland the negroes upon an estate were lately sold, and fetched an average price of $18 a head. In the farther States of the Southern Confederacy we frequently see reports of negro sales, and we occasionally see boasts from rebel newspapers as to the high prices the slaves bring, notwithstanding the war and the collapse of Southern industry. We notice in the Savannah Republican of the 5th, a report of a negro sale in that city, at which, we are told, high prices prevailed, and at which two girls of 18 years of age were sold for about $2,500 apiece, two matured boys for about the same price, a man of 45 for $1,850, and at woman of 23, with her child of 5, for $3,950. Twenty-five hundred dollars, then, may be taken as the standard price of first-class slaves in the Confederacy; but when it is remembered that this is in Confederate money, which is worth less than one-twelfth its face in gold, it will be seen that the real price, by this standard, is only about $200. In Kentucky, on the other hand, though there is but little buying or selling of slave stock going on, we understand that negroes are still held at from seven to twelve hundred dollars apiece.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MARKET PRICE OF SLAVES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MARKET PRICE OF SLAVES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f7dfefa-0106-501f-9006-728e600ac372,269,nyt://article/2f7dfefa-0106-501f-9006-728e600ac372,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/22/archives/local-intelligence-the-metropolitan-police-their-services-during.html,,"Sergt. Y.S. COPELAND, whose services as Drill Officer to the force have been of the utmost value, was one of the most efficient of the Officers during riot week. His first duty was organizing the command of Inspector CARPENTER, which on Monday afternoon met the mob at Broadway and Amity-street, and he had the second blow in what was a gallant fight, and a quick and complete victory. It was here that the Police by their bravery extorted from the citizens gathered at the spot cheer on cheer of approval -- something unusual for the force to hear given them, but which will be nothing novel hereafter. This mob was the one which had been doing so much damage in the upper part of the City, and they came down ladened with plunder. In the evening Sergt. COPELAND formed another command of 250 men, which, under Inspector CARPENTER, marched to the Park, and gave the rioters fleeing from the Tribune Building a reception with clubs such as they little expected, and largely suffered from. The Sergeant was here also amongst the most conspicuous and foremost. Thence he was on the march through the Fourth Ward. Here were witnessed shocking scenes; the sacking of houses occupied by negroes, the piling up and burning of their furniture, the forcing of their dwellings, and in some cases the actual burning alive of the inmates. In one instance a dwelling was fired where seven negroes had taken refuge; they escaped by jumping from the windows, a distance of twenty feet; one broke his leg, another his arm, and it was only by the prompt and decisive action of the Police that any of them escaped death, the mob standing ready, like so many wolves, to jump upon them the moment they reached the ground. In this march, the various mobs were met and dispersed, the greater portion fleeing back into their dens. At midnight the force returned to the Park in time to receive the large mob coming down Broadway to finish the interrupted work at the Tribune Building. It was here that Inspector CARPENTER exhibited strategy and generalship, massing his force to the east side of the Park, and, covered by the darkness, coolly awaiting the mob, which came on, singing ""We'll hang old GREELEY to a sour apple tree,"" and rushed into the grasp of the force ere their presence was suspected. Exemplary, sudden, thorough was their punishment after the force sprang upon them. ""Up, Guards, and at them,"" was the word; the songs ceased, and the ringing of the locusts and cries for mercy of the renegades supplied their place. Here, too, was Sergt. COPELAND brave and efficient. Returning to Headquarters, but a brief respite was had, for at 2 A.M., Tuesday, Sergt. C. formed a battalion of 100 men, and proceeded to Clarkson-street, to recover the body of the negro hung there. It was recovered and brought to the Central office. On Tuesday the Sergeant formed a battalion of some two hundred men, which, under Inspector CARPENTER, visited Second-avenue and Thirty-fourth-street, where the severe battle, heretofore described, was held. The force used their revolvers to clear the tops of the houses of their assailants, but ultimately had to charge the houses, take and ""clean"" them. The rioters most of them boldly met the assault, others were found secreted in beds, boxes, closets, &c., &c., but were hunted out, receiving lessons which those of them who can remember anything, are not likely to forget. The force returned to Headquarters at noon, and during the balance of the day the military knowledge of the Sergeant was in constant requisition in the organizing of the different commands constantly being required and sent off. In the evening he was with the command which, under Inspector CARPENTER, marched to BROOKS BROS.' clothing-store, and subsequently through the infected districts thereabouts, dispersing all mobs and administering, on several occasions, severe punishment; thence to the Fifth Ward, where valuable service was done and quiet restored, and thence to Headquarters. During the balance of the week, until Saturday, Sergt. COPELAND was occupied in organizing companies, as they were required, for special service.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.

According to Mr. DONNELL, who had personal cognizance of most of the steps taken ""to precipitate the South into revolution,"" the secession movement was due to a determination of certain Southern leaders that the South should be independent at any cost, grievance or no grievance; that they tried to convert the tariff into a pretext for separation, and, failing, fixed on Slavery as ""the only question on which the South is likely to unite;"" that they then agitated and intrigued in such manner as to make Mr. LINCOLN's election a certainty; and as soon as he was elected, dragged the Southern people into a revolution upon a series of pretences, which the progress of events have all proved false, and foremost among them was the depreciation of Northern courage and tenacity.

In these few and formal words the death of a Princess has been chronicled whose words once shook kingdoms and made war or peace. CHUNDA KOUR, although the wife of the Maharajah of the Punjrb, was not, if report speaks true, very nobly born. One version of her birth makes her father a dog-keeper in the service of RUNJEET; but at any rate she was selected as one of his harem, and came to be its mistress. From that time, if she could have written the history of her marvelous life, blood, and not ink, would have been the fitting medium to have used. KURRUCK SINGH succeeded RUNJEET, and he was dispatched with acetate of lead and corrosive sublimate mingled in a curry. NAO MEHAL SINGH followed KURRUCK on the throne; but as he passed upon his elephant under an arch, after his corronation, it was contrived that the masonry should fall and crush him. The widow of KURRUCK still stood in the way, and her chamber-women were bribed to beat her brains out with a stone as they stood behind her, braiding and perfuming her hair. SHERE SINGH, a son of the murdered Princess, yet blocked the path to the throne against CHUNDA KOUR's child, and he, too, was dispatched by an adroit treachery. An English rifle was shown to him as be safe upon the ""gadi,"" and when its muzzle was turned to his breast in the course of examining it, the trigger was pressed, and four slugs were discharged into his heart. Thus at last the crown of the Punjaub was won, and placed upon the infant head of DHULEEP SINGH; his mother, the Princess now dead, employing the influence thus obtained to revel in license. Sometimes, however, she was obliged to be the spectatress of murder, and not its accomplice, as when the troops at Lahore bayoneted her brother, the Prince JEWAHIR, as he reviewed them, sprinkling her robe and that of her son with his blood. But she replaced her brother with a lover, LALL SINGH, and in conjunction with him, declared war upon the British by matching her Sikhs across the Sutlej, Moodker, Aliwal, and Ferozeshah ended the first Sikh war, and reduced her to the mere guardianship of a protected Prince. Then she commenced the net-work of intrigue with MOOLRAJ, of Mooltan. GOLAB SINGH, of Cashmere, and DOST MAHOMED. of Affghanistan, which led to the murder of the English officers at the first-named place, and to the second Sikh war. Her emissaries, under pretence of fetching drugs from various cities, carried on correspondence for her with all the discontented in India. Confined to fortresses, she bribed the guards with costly necklaces of pearl and gold; her money and messages circulated in every Sikh barrack and village. So well was she served, too, that when one of her messengers was executed at Lahore, his wife begged his armlet as a relic of love at the scaffold, and instantly took out of it one of the Maharanee's letters, tore it into a hundred pieces, and swallowed them to save detection. She was removed to Benares too late to avert the war which she had fomented. Far away from the Punjab, pacing her prison in the ""holy city"" liked a caged tigress, she heard the echoes of the cannon of GOOGERAT, which deposed RUNJEET SINGH's dynasty forever, and made the Five Waters a province of the victorious English. Thenceforward she passed from the eyes of men, a pensioner of the British Power -- her hundred lovers dead or degraded -- her influence gone with her beauty and her youth -- the son, for whom she had sinned and plotted, dethroned, an exile and a renegade from the grand and conquering creed of Khalsa. Before her swimming eyes, as she lately sank in death in the country whither she had followed her son, these scenes, and a thousand as full of Eastern splendor and crime, must have passed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTRACTS FROM OUR FOREIGN FILES.; AN EASTERN ROMANCE.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/23/archives/article-3-no-title-general-city-news.html,,"FATAL RESULT OF A SHOOTING AFFRAY IN THE SIXTH WARD. -- Coroner WILDEY held an inquest yesterday on the body of BRIDGET GILROY, a girl aged about 13 years, who died at the New-York Hospital from the effects of injuries received at the hands of FRANCIS FITZPATRICK, on the 30th of July last, at No. 100 Worth-street. The building in which the trouble took place is a large tenement-house, occupied by a great number of families and single persons, among whom were the deceased and FITZPATRICK. The latter was engaged in using all manner of vile and offensive epithets toward the girls, and they, becoming provoked by his conduct, retorted in somewhat the same style. This had the effect to exasperate FITZPATRICK, who was much the worse for liquor, and he drew a pistol and fired. The shot took effect in the head of BRIDGET, from the effects of which she died. The offender way arrested the same night by Officer WILKINSON, of the Sixth Precinct, and confined in the Tombs. Upon the rendition of the verdict the prisoner was arraigned, and in answer to the usual questions put to him by the Coroner, he stated that he was 58 years of age, a native of Ireland, resided at No. 100 Worth-street, and was a laborer. He further stated that he had never fired a gun or a pistol in his life, but that a man by the name of FITZGIBBONS fired it. The testimony in the case, however, is very conclusive as to the identity of the prisoner. There were a large number of witnesses examined, and the case has been thoroughly investigated by Coroner WILDEY.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 3 -- No Title; GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 3 -- No Title; GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-08-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/588e652f-79a5-5a38-91ec-a8b5d3c6a127,1102,nyt://article/588e652f-79a5-5a38-91ec-a8b5d3c6a127,

London Times on Our Bravery in a Bad Cause,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/23/archives/the-cause-and-its-supporters.html,London Times on Our Bravery in a Bad Cause,"-- We saw, with great surprise, in reading a discourse of the London Times upon our affairs, that we had carried on the war with ""dogged perseverance."" We were disposed at first to grieve that we had received praise from such a quarter, but on reading further we found that even that sweet drop was not without its atrabilious accompaniment, for it was said to be a ""dogged perseverance, worthy of a better cause,"" and, on reflection, the bitter entirely overpowered the sweet. We cannot accept a compliment to our perseverance, at the expense of the cause for which we have fought. A better cause! where will one be found?

G. W., of the Monitor Catskill; the Massacre at by Quantrell; the Victims; Quantrell's Massacres at Lawrence","The steamers Arkansas, which arrived at Philadelphia, and the Star of the South, which arrived here yesterday, put us in possession of our own advices from Charleston to the 20th instant as late as the rebel advices published by us on Saturday. The rebel accounts of the damage done to Fort Sumter are of course more than confirmed. It appears that the attack upon the Fort by Gen. GILLMORE's batteries and by the naval battery on shore, commenced at daybreak on Monday morning, and that at 6 o'clock Admiral DAHLGREN attacked batteries Wagner and Gregg (the Cummings Point battery) with the Ironsides and the Monitors. The wooden gunboats also joined effectively in the assault. Wagner was soon completely silenced, and Battery Gregg nearly so -- thus enabling Gen. GILLMORE to prosecute his attack upon Sumter almost without annoyance from the enemy's guns. At 10 o'clock, the Admiral, with two Monitors, joined in the attack on Sumter at a distance of 1,400 yards, and rendered effective service for about an hour without damage to the vessels. During the attack on Wagner, Fieet-Capt. RODGERS took command of his old vessel, Monitor Catskill, and went within 150 yards of the beach point. Then, after firing a number of shots, the Catskill turret was struck by a shot which detached a piece of the interior lining, which, striking Capt. RODGERS in the head, killed him instantly. The same piece also killed Paymaster WOODBURY, who was standing at his side. No other persons were injured on land or water during the engagement, which lasted six hours. The damage done by Gen. GILLMORE's batteries to the works of Sumter was quite visible to the naked eye. The false wall, ten feet thick, built by the rebels outside the main wall, was reduced to a heap of ruins, and the main wall was bored full of deep holes, the parapet crushed, and the northwest corner cracked almost to the Water's edge. And all this the result of only one day's work! On Tuesday the batteries were kept steadily engaged, while two of the Monitors kept batteries Wagner and Gregg silent. This course was continued, with slight variation, through Wednesday and Thursday, when Sumter was so far silenced as to throw only an occasional shot. When the Star of the South left, on the 20th, Gen. GILLMORE was mounting his 300-pound parrott, with which Charleston itself was to be shelled. No doubt was entertained that the efforts of our land and naval forces would be crowned with triumphant success.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION. GENERAL NEWS.

The rebels replied, but generally with small guns, which did very little damage. The works were found to be very strong. Two steamers were moored at the wharf, one of which was sunk and the other disabled by our fire. There was also a pontoon bridge across the river, protected by rebel sharpshooters. It was ascertained that there were two divisions of rebel troops at Chattanooga, while HILL's corps (late HARDEE's) were disposed along the railroad in the direction of Bridgeport -- Gen. JOE JOHNSTON being in command of the whole, he having superseded BRAGG. On the night of the 22d, Gen. WILDER crossed the Tennessee River, and burned a small railroad bridge near Shellmound, thus severing communication between the right and left wings of the rebel army, and recrossed the river in safety.

Yet men rejoice. And well may they. Not for revenge. Revenge is a passion fit for savages only. But because there is a deep instinct in the human breast that finds pleasure in righteous retribution. This visitation upon the chief city of South Carolina causes peculiar satisfaction, for the reason that South Carolina is the guiltiest of all the rebel States. It gave birth to the master-traitor, CALHOUN -- idolized him living and canonized him when dead. It plotted disunion for thirty years; twice made a desperate effort to compass it by open resistance, and was the head and front of the present, yet more formidable, movement. It was South Carolina that first began the war; that first shut up the Federal Courts; that first withdrew her members from Congress; that first passed an ordinance of secession; that first laid hands upon the Federal property; that first fired upon the National flag, and opened the war. Had it not been for South Carolina, in all earthly probability, this impious rebellion would not have existed at all.

On Friday last the advance of Gen. ROSECRANS' army appeared before Chattanooga, and on the morning of the same day our guns opened fire upon the stronghold. The rebels replied to our bombardment, but the report is that we disabled every one of their batteries which opened upon us. The works were found to be very strong. It has long been known that they were so. The rebel force holding Chattanooga is said to consist of two army corps; and it is further reported that Gen. JOHNSTON had arrived on the ground with two trains filled with reinforcements, and also that this ill-starred general had superseded the worse-starred Gen. BRAGG.

Nothing of note occurred until Aug. 6, when, in lat. 41&#176; 10', lon. 44&#176; 20', a strange and suspicious-looking sail appeared to windward, it then blowing strong from the north-northwest, with a rough sea. This sail soon bore down for us, fired a shot across our bow, and hoisted the American ensign at the mizzen peak; at this time she was very near us, and we saw that she was an armed steamer, bark-rigged. We then showed our colors, and prepared to heave to; while doing so he fired a second shot, which passed between our fore and mainmasts. We then hove to: he also hove to, (distance then one quarter of a mile to windward,) and sent an armed boat's crew alongside, containing two Lieutenants and eight men. As soon as the Lieutenant in command came on board he asked for the Captain, then pointing to the vessel to windward said: ""That ship to windward of vou, Sir, is the Confederate sloop-of-war Florida. Your ship is a prize. I will put one of my men at your wheel, if you please, Sir,"" and ordered one of his armed men to haul down my flag. All this time the vessel to windward was flying the American flag. He then asked to see my papers, which I showed him. He examined all my bills of lading, and also broke open the package of certified British invoices, asking particularly for boiler iron, and how many passengers I had on board. I told him 230. He asked for my signal-book and code of signals, which I gave him. He then had a long conversation with his ship by telegraph. He asked me if I would like to have my ship burned. I replied I would not. He then said I would have to go on board the Florida with him. I declined doing so. I would not leave my ship, as my passengers were British subjects, and I would not trust their lives in another person's bands.

After a consultation of two or three hours, he agreed to take $40,000, for which I signed a bond, under the conditions of Capt. MAFFIT's approval, and sent my chief mate on board with them to witness my signature. He then telegraphed to me that the bond was accepted, and returned the mate. After detaining us five hours, we proceeded on our course. The Florida immediately gave chase to a large ship to windward, which I took to be an American.

Soon afterward made another steamer to the eastward, which came along and passed us; soon after she bore up for us, and came alongside, with the stars and stripes flying; hailed us to heave to, as they wished to send a boat aboard, and as the boat boarded us they ran up the Confederate flag on the steamer, and the officer of the boat pronounced us a prize to the Confederate flag; ordered myself and part of my crew to take part of our clothes and my papers and go on board the steamer, which proved to be the Florida. My charts and instruments were confiscated, the brig sacked and then set on fire. They then steered for a schooner in sight, which they found abandoned; she was a whaling schooner, bailed from Provincetown, and was set on fire. They then steered off the coast as fast as possible, under steam and canvas, and landed myself and crew in Bermuda on the 16th of July. The Florida is armed with six broadside guns and two pivots; is not as fast as has been represented, and her machinery is getting out of repair; she does not steam over 8 1/2 knots; the discipline on board is bad.

"There is now lying at the shipbuilding yard of the Cork Steamship Company, a curious looking craft. She is named the Alliance, and was originally designed for a pleasure steamer to ply on the Mersey, between Liverpool and a place called Eastham. When plying on the Mersey she had a division along the centre from stem to stern, as completely as if her two parts were two separate ships lying side by side. In this space she had a single paddle-wheel, by which alone she was propelled, and this had so much power, added to the lightness of her build, that she had a speed of 20 knots an hour. She had been purchased by a Liverpool firm for the purpose of running the blockade of the Southern ports of America, and to fit her out for this purpose considerable alterations have been made, both in her structure and machinery. The paddle-wheel which was in the centre has been removed; in the space occupied by it a hold has been made, thus filling up the division, and she has been furnished with a pair of paddles, making her appear like the ordinary paddle steamers. She has three funnels placed in the line across between the paddle-boxes. With the view of resisting the rough salutations which are generally dealt out to blockade-runners by the Yankee squadrons, she has been fitted with an outer shell, or coat of timber below the waterline. The space between this and the vessel herself can be filled with cotton which, it is considered, will effectually resist the Yankee missiles. To obviate the danger of ignition, this space can be filled with water immediately without in the least disturbing the crew or injuring the cargo. The upper portion of the vessel is unprotected; but although this may endanger the lives of the crew and admit of injury to the interior of the vessel, yet there can be very little danger of her going down. The Alliance was on her way to Nassau, but had to put in here on Thursday evening to get some repairs to her machinery.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/27/archives/blockade-runners-the-alliance.html,,"There is now lying at the shipbuilding yard of the Cork Steamship Company, a curious looking craft.

Rebel Chances of Hopeless,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/28/archives/foreign-deliverance-of-the-rebel-government.html,Rebel Chances of Hopeless,"It is fast becoming an accepted fact that there is no possible chance for the so-called ""Confederacy"" but in foreign succor, secured at any price. The crushing force of the National Government has now proceeded so far that it is senseless to doubt what the end must be, unless something outside is interposed. The rebel Government cannot help feeling that its power of resistance and endurance is fast giving way, and that its last extremity is approaching. One of the papers in their Capital, the Richmond Whig, has just said, “We want the aid of France. We are able to pay for it. Let us do it.” But we need no such outgivings to substantiate that this last alternative is now daily and nightly occupying the thoughts of the rebel leaders. The same supreme selfishness which impelled them to precipitate this rebellion against the will of the Southern people, must also impel them to save themselves if possible, at whatever cost to that people. If once taken by the National Government, they may be tried for treason and lose their lives, or be sent into perpetual exile. At all events, the overthrow of their rule would cast them forever into the dust, politically and socially. The Southern people would turn upon them with fiercest hate for all of their false promises and high-handed tyranny, while the people of the North, with all their magnanimity, never could and never would have any other feeling toward them than detestation and contempt. They would be the pariahs of the land. To save themselves from this fate, there is nothing these men would hesitate to do. And the “aid of France” being the only possible resource left, we may count it certain that they will do their best to obtain it at any sacrifice.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Foreign Deliverance of the Rebel Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Foreign Deliverance of the Rebel Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/adbc0df1-b975-5357-84ac-71b144b181d0,1203,nyt://article/adbc0df1-b975-5357-84ac-71b144b181d0,

The; The People and The Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/29/archives/the-people-and-the-laws.html,The; The People and The Laws,"When Mr. LINCOLN announced that he would enforce the draft without waiting to have the constitutionality of the act tested in the Courts, the Copperheads of this City lifted up their hands in holy horror, and their organ broadly hinted that the supreme moment was at hand, and that Democrats would probably have to count up their strength and -- see what they had better do within a few days. By the time Gen. DIX issued his proclamation, however, they had apparently passed through the agonies of deliberation and reached the high and holy resolve of doing nothing whatever. But the organ nevertheless ""improved the occasion"" by severely reprimanding Major-Gen. DIX for having ventured, in his address to his fellow-citizens, to express his solemn conviction of the justice and expediency of the law which he had undertaken to carry out, if need were, at the point of the bayonet. He ought, it appears, to have preached obedience to the law, but not to have hurt the feelings of ""the people"" of Mackerelville, by saying that he thought it a good law. After a man has solemnly testified his disapproval of it as FLYNN, who is now in jail awaiting his trial, has done, by publicly dashing out a negro's brains and crushing in his ribs with a big stone, it certainly does seem a little indelicate to tell him to his face that the enrollment act is worthy of obedience on higher grounds than mere constitutional ones. But then Gen. DIX is a soldier, and we think he ought to be excused if, coming fresh from the camp, his language displayed a little of a soldier's bluntness. Gentlemen like the July rioters, who have themselves, in the exercise of their calling, frequently to express their feelings in homely and energetic phrases, and without much attention to the possible shocks which they may inflict on the nerves of their hearers, will not be so ready to condemn Gen. DIX on this point as their newspapers are.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The People and the Laws.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The People and the Laws.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f031c06-bbd2-5fa2-abd1-9003d32b68ea,930,nyt://article/2f031c06-bbd2-5fa2-abd1-9003d32b68ea,

The proof being conclusive against the Lord, he sent for his friend HARRIS, and after asking forgiveness and promising to make the matter satisfactory, the parties appeared before Recorder MARTINDALE, and the complaint was withdrawn. They both occupied the same stateroom on the passage to this port, and appeared to be on the most intimate terms until HARRIS discovered his loss, when he ordered the accused to procure another berth.

Luiqi di Portogallo Launched at New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/30/archives/exemption-claims-in-the-sixth-district-launch-of-an-italian-frigate.html,Luiqi di Portogallo Launched at New-York,"The Enrollmentt Board of the Sixth District, continued their session on Friday for hearing claims of exemption from drafted men. The Board sits from 9 A.M. to 12 M., and from 2 to 4 P.M. Yesterday was the fourth day of the session, and the number of persons who thronged the office to present their various claims for exemption was larger than on either of the previous days. The claims for exemption on account of alienage are very numerous, and the probabilities of fraud in these cases are so great that the Board have decided to postpone giving certificates until each case can be inquired into, and the proof of alienage clearly established. Thus far only one certificate of exemption on this ground has been granted. The applicant for exemption on account of alienage is obliged to swear that he is a subject of a foreign Government, that he has never declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and that he has never exercised the right of suffrage in this country. It is the opinion of Commissioner LAMONT and Surgeon POWELL, a majority of the Enrolling Board, that an examination of the records of naturalization and of the poll-lists would disprove the affidavits of many who have applied for exemption on the above grounds, and they insist that these should be examined. Provost-Marshall FARR, it is understood, does not agree in this view. In the case of the alien to whom a certificate of exemption was given, it was noticed that within an hour thereafter four other applicants made their appearance with papers prepared by the same person who made out the first papers. On Thursday a man presented his affidavits of alienage properly vouched and sworn to, and was told, as all of them are, to call again on a certain day for his certificate. Thinking his case was all right, he went outside the office, where he met another alien friend, to whom he boasted that he had voted often in this City, but said that made no difference, and offered to procure the exemption of his friend for $2. The name of this foreigner is withheld for the present, but when he applies for his certificate of exemption, his case will be attended to.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Exemption Claims in the Sixth District.; Launch of an Italian Frigate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Exemption Claims in the Sixth District.; Launch of an Italian Frigate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-08-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f5751d6-ec30-53ef-9232-3df7238e201f,1553,nyt://article/2f5751d6-ec30-53ef-9232-3df7238e201f,

What Napoleon wants in Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/30/archives/work-for-the-new-bureauit-has-al-what-napoleon-wants-in-mexico.html,What Napoleon wants in Mexico,"ready been announced that among the reforms inaugurated by the Cavalry Bureau, the system of buying horses without contract is prominent; in other words, no more especial contracts will be made, but every person having twenty-five or more horses to offer, can take them to a designated spot, where they will be examined, and if found good, bought. This is an important point reached, as by the contract system the treasury has already been swindled out of hundreds of thousands of dollars for horseflesh, the refuse of the whole country -- nags that could not have been thrust on any farmer for drudge work. Instances have been known in mounting our Western cavalry, where the entire horses of the regiment have been condemned and sent away, and when the new mount came, they were actually worse than those just condemned. A case of this kind occurred with the Ninth Kentucky cavalry, where they were forced by circumstances to accept these hacks, and with scarce time to fit saddles, they rode into action. Horses have been taken fresh from the plow, or the cart, sometimes even unshodden, and sent instantly upon forced marches, or into battle. Is it to be wondered at that, in many instances, our cavalry has not met with the success that should attend well-mounted men and well-trained horses? The Press has continually been disposed to exalt the rebel cavalry; but this praise is only deserved by comparison, and the comparison is instituted against an arm of the service which up to this time has struggled against enormous odds.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WORK FOR THE NEW BUREAU.--It has al- ...; What Napoleon Wants in Mexico.

The bombardment of Chattanooga, of which we had intelligence a week ago, turns out to have been no more than a few shell thrown across the river by Col. WILDER, whose light-moving column of mounted infantry and battery of horse-artillery had made a flying visit to the neighborhood of Chattanooga. But the movements of the adventurous leader of the flying brigade, who has no heed for supplies, roads, trains or communications, are no criterion for the movements of the main body of the army which is strictly dependent on these conditions. Gen. ROSECRANS is now operating in a region of country the difficulties of which are almost inconceivable. The front of operations which he gained in his last advance, when he turned the rebel position at Tullahoma, and compelled BRAGG's retreat to Chattanooga, brought him just to the base of the mountains. Thence to Chattanooga, eighty or a hundred miles, is through an Alpine region, which presents every imaginable obstacle to military operations or military movements, where there are few or no roads, while such as there are are scarcely passable. To those who glibly talk of ""throwing"" troops here, or ""throwing"" troops there, a fortnight or three weeks will doubtless seem an unpardonably long period to occupy in a journey of three or four score miles; but should they go to ROSECRANS' field of operations and find that roads had to be made before they could ""throw"" even themselves, they would probably acquire and beget a little of that ""temperance"" that would give them ""patience."" It is in this arduous but indispensable work that Gen. ROSECRANS has been engaged for the past fifteen or twenty days. Details of whole divisions have been out road-making, hauling trains, &c.; and the result is that he has at length succeeded in transferring his whole army across the Tennessee River.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Progress of Gen.

There has not been much in the way of novelty to notice, but the country people do not object to a well-tried and well-kept play. If it has been talked about for a season or two so much the better. It takes, indeed, several months for the ever-widening circles of fame to reach the outside leiges of the Union. The sensation play of the ""Duke's Motto"" has, during the entire Summer, enjoyed the advantages of its wide-spread reputation. Every one has felt the necessity of seeing it, and so Mr. WHEATLEY has reaped his reward. And the reward should be a large one, for the physical and mental powers are sorely taxed in such a character as that which was for so many months impersonated by Mr. WHEATLEY in this piece. We doubt if there is another part on the stage so wearing as Capt. Lagardere. In the mere matter of lines it is of inordinate length, demanding great powers of voice, memory and mimicry. The action is ceaseless and for much of the time the Captain has to impersonate a deformed hunchback -- doubling himself up in an exceedingly inconvenient position for speech. It is not remarkable under these circumstances that Mr. WHEATLEY has twice succumbed to the strain on his system, having suspended the performances in July and August, owing to a throat complaint. There were no performances at NIBLO's from Monday until Saturday, when Mr. BANDMAN opened the Fall season with his clever impersonation, of SHAKESPEARE's Shylock. To-night Mr. FORREST commences his regular engagement, and will play Richelieu in BULWER's play of that name.
