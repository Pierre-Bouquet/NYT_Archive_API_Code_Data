The charge, from whatever motive it is made, reveals an utter lack of appreciation of the military situation. An advance beyond Chattanooga was, for Gen. ROSECRANS, an absolute necessity for securing his position at Chattanooga. The possession of Chattanooga secured the salient of the upper line of railway communication between the East and West, but it left a secondary line running from Richmond, by way of Charleston and Atlanta. To have left this line, with its salient at Home, Ga., leading up to within immediate striking distance of Chattanooga, in rebel possession, was simply to invite concentration against him by the enemy. To seize this was the object of Gen. ROSECRANS' advance. Indeed, we know positively that, at the very outset of the campaign, when the Army of the Cumberland was set in motion from Murfreesboro, the ultimate objective which Gen. ROSECRANS had in his mind's eye was not Chattanooga, but, through it, to seize Dalton, Rome or Atlanta, any one of which points would plant him on this line and enable him to make himself secure at Chattanooga. The misfortune was that he was not able to push on with such celerity as to seize one of these points before the rebels were able to make the line available for reinforcements to BRAGG. Given after this, it was an error to have left ROSECRANS with a force inadequate for the object in view, and the Government's failure to reinforce him doubtless subjects it to blame; but an advance beyond Chattanooga was an absolute military necessity, and to blame the Washington authorities for this, displays the sheerest ignorance, to say the least.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RIGHT AND WRONG IN THE CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE RIGHT AND WRONG IN THE CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/591e4411-8da4-5dd6-8f24-6141b177b15e,314,nyt://article/591e4411-8da4-5dd6-8f24-6141b177b15e,

He came to this country some eight years ago and engaged in mercantile business. When the war broke out he raised a company, but, in consequence of some difficulty, abandoned it, and subsequently raised another for the One Hundred and Sixty-fourth regiment, with which he marched to Suffolk, Va., where he was appointed an aid to Gen. [???]ORAN. The cause of his death was typhoid fever. The deceased leaves a wife, but no children. He was in the thirty-third year of his age. Rev. Father FREEL delivered the funeral discourse.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; Williamsburgh.

Nearly all the French official and semi-official writers (which means all the writers in France) who urge recognition, urge it on the ground that the Emperor will be able to make the abolition or modification of Slavery a consequent, concomitant or condition of the favor of recognition. Even Monsieur CHEVALIER, who has taken the boldest stand of any man in France in favor of recognizing JEFF, DAVIS, declares that ""France will use her influence to bring about the gradual emancipation of the slaves;"" that ""the emancipation of the blackamoors, the complete abolition of slavery, will be the work of peace and time,"" and that ""the European Power which shall be the first to recognize the Confederate States will have the right to obtain on behalf of the blacks far more than would the Federal Slates;"" and one of his strongest points against the North is that ""the men of the North, if victorious, would not cut into the quick of the Slavery question,"" for they would value too highly the cotton culture.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ""EVERLASTING NEGRO"" QUESTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ""EVERLASTING NEGRO"" QUESTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3b5652eb-98fb-5fd4-a559-acfb8f927a83,669,nyt://article/3b5652eb-98fb-5fd4-a559-acfb8f927a83,

GRUND, which was mentioned in the TIMES of yesterday, is an event of considerable political as well as personal interest. He was a man of very great ability, and for many years exerted through the newspaper Press a very marked influence on the course of current events. He was a man of learning -- not only speaking several languages with facility, but familiar with their literature and master of their philosophy. He was an able mathematician, having filled for some years the Professorship in that Department in one of our leading classical schools, and having punished text books on several of its branches. Many years ago, however, he left science and letters for the more congenial field of political discussion, and although his labors were mainly exerted through the unconspicuous channels of anonymous journalism, they were always zealous, persevering and effective. He was always connected with the Democratic party, though not unfrequently, as at the very last, he had left its service in disgust at some flagrant departure from its principles or some suicidal surrender of the patriotic sentiments which have always animated the mass of its members. By his political opponents, whether of his own party or not, he has always been denounced as unreliable and as serving the side that would pay him best; but we know nothing in his character or his public conduct which should separate him, for special censure in this respect, from the class of journalists to which he belonged. He always wrote with great clearness and force, and his access to the best sources of information gave special value and interest to his political correspondence. His knowledge of European politics was full, precise and comprehensive, and his judgment of current events abroad as well as at home was marked by a just and impartial appreciation of men and measures. During the Italian war in 1859, he wrote a view of European Politics as related to that event and to the policy of the French Emperor, which was by far the ablest and most instructive treatise on that subject published on either side the Atlantic. He was a genial companion, excellent and interesting in conversation in spite of a slight tendency to dogmatism, and full of fresh and valuable knowledge upon almost every subject. As one of the ablest and most vigorous and influential of the contributors to the newspaper Press, his death is a substantial loss to the profession of journalism.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Francis J.

Forty-one grape growers from different parts of the country have contributed to this handsome and interesting exhibition, and the result of the comparison of the several kinds will prove of great value in the culture and improvement of vines. The exhibition is under the auspices of the Fruit Growers' Association of New-York. Those who find interest and pleasure in such matters will be more than compensated by witnessing the collection. The judges on grapes have made the following report, awarding prizes to the exhibitors: Best native Seedling, which has never before taken a prize, $10, to PETER B. MEAD, of New-York, for ""Iona."" Best collection of native grapes, $10, to A.S. FULLER, of Brooklyn. Second best collection of native grapes, $5, to M. OLM, Flushing, gardener to ORANGE JUDD, No. 41 Park-row, N.Y. Best six varieties of native grapes, $4, to F.F. MERCERON, Catawissa, Pa. Second best six varieties of native grapes, $2, to GEORGE W. MARTIN, Brooklyn, E.D., N.Y. Best four varieties native grapes, $4 to W. BROCKSBANE, Hudson, N.Y. Second best four varieties native grapes, $2, to FRED, BAUMEISTER, East Newark, N.J. Best five bunches native grapes of any kind, quality to rule, $2, to J.W. BAILEY, Platisburgh, N.Y., for ""Adirondac."" Best five bunches Delaware, $2, to E.O. EATON, Troy, N.Y.

Best five bunches Allen's Hybrid, $2, to JOHN HOAG, Newburgh, N.Y. Discretionary prize of $1, to GEORGE W. MARTIN, Brooklyn, N.Y., for Brinkley, grown out of doors. Discretionary prize of $1, to PETER RAABS, Philadelphia, Pa., for Loomis' Honey, in point of flavor. Discretionary prize of $3, to N. ARMSTRONG, Bergen, N.J., for collection of hot-house grapes. None of the prizes were awarded for foreign grapes, there being no competition under the schedule. For the only lot (containing one bunch of each kind) the Committee have recommended a discretionary prize. With regard to native grapes, the Committee are much gratified, particularly with the quality of the fruit, considering the present unfavorable season, and are disposed to commend not only the design of the New-York Fruit Growers' Society, in arranging for this display, so interesting and instructive, but also the public spirit and enterprise of Mr. ORANGE JUDD, Editor of the American Agriculturist, who placed his rooms at the disposal of the Society, and contributed the prize money and entire expenses of the exhibition.

The ""Abolitionists ""would have a long way to travel before they got there, and, whether they attempted it from the east or the north, they would find the task equally hopeless. When Fort Sumter was surrendered, it was thought that, as it was the first, so it would be the last battle in South Carolina, during the war for secession. When Virginia had passed her ordinance of secession -- almost, in fact, before she had passed it -- South Carolina hastened to send a regiment of troops to the Old Dominion, mainly that the war might be opened upon Virginia soil, and kept there, far away from her territory, if it were to be fought in the South at all; and it must be confessed that in this selfish purpose South Carolina has thus far pretty well succeeded. She has been horribly insulted and harassed, it is true, for two years, by the operations on her Southern coast; but she has taken comfort in the thought that the nature of her soil and defences made it unlikely that the Yankees would ever penetrate any further than the coast.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Flanking of South Carolina The Progress of the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Flanking of South Carolina The Progress of the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'South Carolina', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/006ec510-cdf9-5069-8716-c9210665450f,753,nyt://article/006ec510-cdf9-5069-8716-c9210665450f,

Instead of directing hostilities solely against the English, the Daimios have proscribed all outside barbarians, not excepting even the Dutch, who for over two centuries had been privileged to sojourn in and trade with Japan. Nor have these aristocrats been content with ordering all foreigners out of their country; they have been so rash as to assail all, and they have forced them all to espouse the cause of the British. Hence, it is no longer with one European nation that Japan is at war, but with all the Christian Powers which have at any time made treaties with her.

"An inquest was held on Friday, by Coroner RANNEY, at Bellevue Hospital, on the body of a Polish exile, named GEORGE GROSKE. The deceased was seized with an apoplectic fit on Thursday while in a restaurant in Leonard-street. No one knew him, and he not being able to give his name or residence, the Police conveyed him to the Hospital, where he died soon after. He was dressed very poorly and slovenly, and every one who saw him supposed him to be a pauper of the lowest class. At the time of the inquest, inquiry was made at the saloon where he was taken ill, but no satisfactory information could be obtained there. The proprietor stated that for the last three years the deceased had been in the habit of taking his meals with him, but he knew nothing about him -- not even his name. After much questioning it was at length ascertained that the supposed pauper had occupied a garret-room in White-street. A search was made of these premises, and the result was the discovery of a trunk. The contents not only revealed the name of the deceased, but the further fact that he was worth at the least $8,000. Four bank books were found, -- one which showed that he had $378 56 to his credit, in the Bank of Commerce, and three Savings' bank books which indicated that he had sums ranging from $500 to $800 in each of them. In addition to this, fifty certificates of stock in the Bank of Commerce, for $100 each, were found among his papers. Other personal property of considerable value was also discovered. The deceased was about 60 years of age, and is believed to have been a resident of this City for about seven years. There was abundant evidence, among the letters and papers found in the trunk, to show that he was a Polish exile. Notwithstanding his means, it was his uniform custom to go around apprently in a state of the most abject poverty. What his business was, or how he spent his time no one seems to know. That he has no relatives in this country is doubtless true. For this reason all his effects have been placed in the hands of the Public Administrator, to be disposed of according to law. The jury rendered a verdict in accordance with the facts. The deceased was buried yesterday in Greenwood Cemetery.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/04/archives/local-intelligence-sudden-death-of-a-polish-exile-large-amounts-of.html,,"An inquest was held on Friday, by Coroner RANNEY, at Bellevue Hospital, on the body of a Polish exile, named GEORGE GROSKE.

To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the Source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign States, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theatre of military conflict, while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. The needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence have not arrested the plow, the shuttle or the ship. The ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a continuance of years with large increase of freedom.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A PROCLAMATION.; BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A PROCLAMATION.; BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3fdfca4e-de50-51ef-8dfa-7d45d35dca6a,530,nyt://article/3fdfca4e-de50-51ef-8dfa-7d45d35dca6a,

These vessels are not to be supposed to have been condemned according to the powers conferred by the Foreign Entistment act. They are retained for further inquiry. Every one acquainted with the law, knows full well that it is only upon evidence produced by the complaining parties, that is to say, sufficient evidence, that the authorities are empowered to act in subjecting an an armed ship to the chances of condemnation before a competent tribunal. The Alexandra was subjected to this ordeal. Chief Baron POLLOCK decided that the evidence upon which the Custom-house authorities had proceeded in the case of the Alexandra was not sufficient, according to law, for her condemnation. This decision has been appealed against, and until this appeal shall be decided in the next term, it would be a serious matter to proceed against any other vessel or vessels without some more legal and conclusive evidence than that produced in the case that is pending for adjudication. But the mere detention of a vessel -- to await further inquiry -- is quite another question. Without waiting for complete evidence, or without any official intimation whether such evidence has or has not been obtained, there seems to be enough of mystery about the two suspected steamers at Birkenhead to call for the suspension of any permission for them to put to sea previous to any doubts being cleared up. It is to be observed that the builders have not been anxious to give any very precise information as to the future of the steamers in question. In the absence of such information, and in the presence of the fact that other vessels have left the same ship-building yard to prey upon the commerce of the Untied States, it is not too much stress of authority on the part of the Government to delay the departure from the Mersey of those suspected vessels until such time as a full and fair inquiry shall be made as to their purpose and destination.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ANGLO-REBEL RAMS.; THE CAUSE AND OBJECT OF THEIR DETENTION.

The Political Feelings in America,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/04/archives/the-german-the-german-governments-the-german-character-the-german.html,The Political Feelings in America,"Allow me to bring to your memory the following facts of similarity and dissimilarity of political confederation between the United States of America and the Confederate States of Germany. The socalled Germanic Confederation includes about forty States, counting four free cities, all under the control of a Germanic Diet or Congress, the Emperor of Austria being its President, and meeting at Frankforton-the-Main. Each State has its own King or Grand Duke, who reigns over it in almost absolute monarchy, with all the paraphernalia of the throne and sceptre, supported by taxing the common people, who have no influence in making the laws. Even in the democratic free cities, no one can vote until he has a certain fixed amount of property. These German States vary in size and population from 18,912 to only 53 square miles in area, with population from about 12,000,000 down to 6,000. Many of these States, in extent and revenue, are inferior to the estate of even a second-class English nobleman. Yet the petty Prince by which it is ruled maintains all the forms of empty pomp and state of Imperial Sovereigns. They have Ministers, an exchequer, a public debt, an array, all in miniature, each petty Prince thinking only of promoting his own separate interests. The nobles retain much of the old feudal habits, and the masses of the Germans are rigidly excluded from Court or titled intercourse, and are taxed to support the Royal Court, and when the State is a very little one, with a diminutive population, it is particularly oppressive to the poor. A liberally educated German relates, that in cherry season, a certain weight of cherries only was allowed him every morning for his breakfast before going to school; at the same time, the garden vegetables and dried sausages, &c., &c., were packed off to go to support Court pomp, as they had no money to pay the tax bill. All must work for that. Their States consist of, as it were, little military monarchies, aiming to suppress popular influences and limiting certain liberties of the Press, &c. In some of the States, the peasants are in a condition approaching personal bondage.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GERMAN.; The German Governments The German Character The German in America His Aims, Prospects and Sentiments, and His Influence in the United States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE GERMAN.; The German Governments The German Character The German in America His Aims, Prospects and Sentiments, and His Influence in the United States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'GERMANS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e5a397e3-dabf-5558-a5a8-5032e7438db7,1953,nyt://article/e5a397e3-dabf-5558-a5a8-5032e7438db7,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/05/archives/amusements.html,,"The regular Fall season of Italian Opera commences to-night, under the able direction of Mr. MAX MARETZEK. A comparatively unknown opera will be revived for the occasion -- ""Roberto Devereux"" -- receiving from the management the full honors of new scenery and costumes and a distribution which we are certain cannot be greatly exceeded in any opera house of the world. It would be difficult to find two roles that are more admirably adapted to the great powers of Mme. MEDORI and Signor MAZZOLENI than those of Elizabeth and Roberto Devereux. Not only does the music suit their voices, but the dramatic opportunities are very great, and will afford ample scope for good acting. The mezzo-soprano and baritone parts are also admirable. Indeed, there are not many operas in the Italian repertoire where the vocal quartette is better provided for. As the argument of the opera may not be remembered by our readers, we condense it for their use. The scene is laid in England during the reign of Queen ELIZABETH, and the story is based on a love episode of the Virgin Queen. Roberto Devereux, Earl of Essex, is her favorite. She has bestowed on him many marks of favor, and given him a ring which is to rescue him from peril, should he ever be overtaken by his enemies. The Earl unhappily does not reciprocate the Queen's tender emotions; he having in early life been fondly attached to the Lady Sara, who afterward, to avoid the royal displeasure, became the wife of Devereux's friend, the Duke of Nottingham. A cabal has attempted the destruction of the Queen's favorite. He is accused of high treason, and summoned from Ireland to be tried by his peers. In an interview with his sovereign, he is charged with coldness and inconstancy, but at the same time is assured of protection. The ring will be his safeguard. Instead of resting satisfied with this state of affairs, the Earl has a scene with his old sweetheart, the Duchess of Nottingham, who advises him to seek safety in flight. This the Earl consents to do, and as a pledge of affection, gives her the ring, confiding to her at the same time the promise attached to it. He receives from the Duchess a scarf, embroidered with her own hands. The Earl does not make good his escape. He is tried, found guilty and sentenced to death. This is not the worst. The fatal scarf has been found in his possession, and conveyed to the Queen, who at once recognizes it as a gage d'amour. The Duke, too, remembers the scarf, and becomes horribly jealous, so that when Elizabeth, in a fit of rage, has signed the Earl's death-warrant, he hurries off revengefully to put it into immediate execution. In this emergency, the Duchess resolves to see the Queen. She produces the ring for the purpose of imploring the royal clemency, and the Queen is overwhelmed with remorse at having signed the fatal warrant. She is eager to remit the sentence, but it is too late. The Duke has hurried up the arrangements for disposing of his rival, and the signal gun from Tower Hill announces that the Earl is no more. The Queen is frantic with despair, declares that the Duke and the Duchess shall lose their heads, and that she will abdicate the throne.

The one, led by FERNANDO WOOD, clamors for ""peace"" with the rebel States. ""Peace at any price"" is practically their motto. To this end, they would proclaim an armistice -- not knowing whether the rebels would regard it or not -- recall our armies from their advanced positions in the Southern States -- yield all territory we have conquered -- send back all slaves that have left their masters, and then ask the rebels to meet us in ""National Convention,"" and name what modifications of the Constitution of the United States they would accept, as the condition of living again in the Union! It is in vain that we point to the fact that the rebel Government scorn and spit upon all this talk of peace and reunion, and declare that no terms of peace except such as recognize the final and absolute independence of the South will ever be entertained. Our Peace Democrats reply that war has not restored and cannot restore the Union -- and that if negotiations fail to do it, the work must be given up as impossible.

We were, we believe, the first, a year ago, to call attention to this fact, at a time when the public mind was so intent upon the capture of Richmond that there was a very general impression afloat that the fall of that place would terminate the war. The exaggerated importance which was ascribed, at the begining of the struggle, to the possession of certain places, was due to a very natural tendency to apply to our operations rules deduced from European military history, in which the capture of a city or fall of a fortress very frequently has determined the fate of a whole province or kingdom. To occupy Paris, or Vienna and Berlin, is, in European warfare, to obtain complete mastery of France, or Austria and Prussia, and we hence not unreasonably concluded that in this, as in other things, ""haute strategie"" in America resembled ""haute strategie"" in the Old World.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Strategic Points and Political Capitals Their Relation to the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Strategic Points and Political Capitals Their Relation to the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'STRATEGY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/123f7e7d-7633-50b4-8364-439255c16090,887,nyt://article/123f7e7d-7633-50b4-8364-439255c16090,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/06/archives/journalism-at-the-south.html,,"-- The New-Orleans Times is the name of a new Union journal just started in the Crescent City. It comes to us elegantly printed, on fine paper, with full and clear reports of local matters, and sharp, sensible editorials on all the topics of the day. It is thoroughly and heartily loyal, is written in good English, and does not mistake coarse vulgarity and rhetorical clap-trap for strength of argument or earnestness of purpose. It understands apparently how to discuss questions of grave public concern with dignity and candor, and can also differ from an opponent without branding him as a felon, or denouncing him as an idiot. So far as we can judge from the few numbers thus far issued, its editor seems capable of being firm in principle without being violent in temper, and he does not deem it necessary to go into paroxysms of wrath in order to convince the public of his own sincerity, or of his opponent's errors. Perhaps, if we had thought of it in season, we might have saved ourselves the trouble of this analysis by copying the statement of the New-Orleans correspondent of the Tribune, that in style and tone, as well as in its typographical appearance, the New-Orleans Times is a very accurate reproduction of its New-York namesake. That, we presume, tells the whole story: but it may not be amiss to add that it is edited by J.R.

The unfairness of her Government and of her ruling classes, toward our country in its day of adversity, has made it impossible for any true American to speak well of her. The injury was too flagrant, the motive too palpable. Yet our indignation has always been mingled with sorrow. There has been no getting rid of the feeling that England ought to have stood by our people closer than ever in their resistance of this monstrous attempt of Slavery against their national life. England was bound to this by every moral obligation, every sentiment of honor, every line of her Anti-Slavery record. Had she thus kept true, it would have cemented a moral alliance between the two nations, such as the world has never yet seen. Their affinity in blood, in language, in religion,would have been deepened into an infinitely warmer and worthier brotherhood. They would thenceforth have stood forth as the paired pioneers of the world's march, twin champions of all that is free and grand, the very Castor and Pollux of the nations. It is a calamity to the race that England has so greatly failed in the part so plainly imposed upon her by Providence. The material embarrassments and mischiefs occasioned by her neutral policy, falsely so called, are of small consequence compared with the moral rupture that has resulted. The material harm is but limited. It has hindered us, but it has not thwarted us. Inspite of it, we are now close upon final and glorious success. But though the physical effects of what England has done, and has failed to do, are passing away, the moral effects remain. The waters of the Atlantic have closed over the Harvey Birch and the Jacob Bell; and so might we wish that the waters of oblivion could close over the British faithlessness that caused it.

It is now positively asserted that MAXIMILIAN has accepted the Mexican Crown at all risks and perils, renouncing his rights and prerogatives as the nearest collateral Prince to the throne of Austria. The Times assumes that Great Britain will acknowledge and favor the new regime in Mexico. The reply of Prince GORTSCHAKOFF to the French and Austrian notes on the Polish question has been published, together with accompanying memoranda. These replies manifest the same firm tone as that addressed to England. Relative to the allusion made M. DROUYN DE LHUYS to the Western Provinces of Russia, as participating in the international stipulations which settled in 1815 the destiny of Warsaw. Prince GORTSCHAKOFF maintains that the Imperial Cabinet cannot admit that point of view, even in the most restricted manner. Russia will not admit the right of Europe to interfere in her internal affairs. It is said that Count RECHBERG, the Austrian minister, has advised that no response be made to Prince GORTSCHAKOFF's dispatch, but that the three great Powers now await further action on the part of the Russian Government toward the Poles. The Paris Moniteur has reproduced the letter from Warsaw of Aug. 15, addressed by the Polish National Government to Prince CZARTOVISKY, claiming belligerent rights, and its publication in the French official organ is considered by English and continental journals as equivalent to an unofficial recognition by NAPOLEON of the Polish National Government. Russia was actively engaged in warlike preparations. American topics were still greatly discussed in England, but there was a general admission, even by those journals which have been most strongly pro-Southern, that the rebel cause showed signs of utter ruin.

Upon one point, however, Mr. LINCOLN has certainly been consistent; he has never earned the praise or escaped the denunciation of the Times.

It was thought by some that the gigantic army of the rebels, whose numbers were accurately stated by a reliable City cotemporary at 190,375, meant nothing less than the capture of Washington and Baltimore, the capture of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, the capture of New-York and Boston, and, for that matter, the capture of Cincinnati and Rouse's Point. With Panic preceding them, Death accompanying them, and Desolation following in their wake, there seemed no reason why they should not work their will and wreak their vengeance upon the North; and those who remember the history of that time will recall how the Tribune proposed to placate them in advance, and to ""bow to destiny,"" as impersonated in JEFF.

Detective SLOWEY was at once dispatched in search of the guilty parties, and after much effort he succeeded in taking into custody Mrs. LAURA, (who gave her name as CAROLINE BUCKMAN,) ROSA WELSH and the housekeeper of the establishment, whose name is LEWIS SEYMOUR. They were all taken to Police Headquarters, and subsequently ROSA WELSH was arraigned before Justice STEERS at the Essex Market Police Court. Mr. TERRELL there made an affidavit in which he claimed that he had lost only $5,450. The money consisted, he said, of a $1,000 Treasury note, one $50 Treasury note, two United States notes of $20 each; also, bank bills on various State banks for $200, four drafts of $1,000 each on the Pahquoe Bank, of Danbury, Conn., and one diamond ring, worth $160. Mr. TERRELL swears that on Sunday last he took a carriage at the Northern Hotel, in this City, where he was temporarily stopping, went up to Greene-street, where he secured a companion -- ROSA WELSH -- and with her he rode to Luff's Hotel, in Harlem-lane.

Judge HARVARD refused to suspend sentence, but in consideration of the fact that the prisoner had pleaded guilty, and thereby saved the Court the trouble of trying him, and also of the fact that he had previously sustained a good character, he would sentence him to only six months in the Penitentiary. The Judge remarked to the prisoner that he had been engaged in the riots of July last, which were the most outrageous and disgraceful that had ever occurred in this country. Had there been any loss of life or great destruction of property attending his offence, he would not have escaped a long term in the State Prison; and he would here take occasion to remark, that all offenders who had been engaged in the commission of those higher crimes, if they were convicted before him, might expect to have meted out to them the full penalty of the law.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Trial of the Rioters.; COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER.

When she first made her appearance there, she came flushed with the recent success of burning an American merchantman almost within sight of England; and the tongues and pens of the rebels and their friends in France and England were loud in glorification of her, her commander and her crew, and in congratulations upon her and their success. It was a picture of intense couleur de rose. Excited Englishmen visited her at Brest, and wrote to the London Times marine tales which were narrated to them by her Captain, who was described as ""a merry-looking man, with a ready, determined air,"" ""equally ready for a fight or a jollification,"" and whose corsair career was depicted as very much of a jollification, though without much fighting. Those of her crew who came on shore were reported to have their pockets filled with prize money, and their bags bursting with bonds given by captured merchantmen. The Opinion Nationale stated that every sailor was entitled to 45,000 francs as his share. Then followed the announcement that a part of her crew had been detached from her to join another vessel, thus leaving openings on board her for other jolly tars whose imaginations might have been fired by these golden tales, and who would be only too happy to jump at the chance of making thousands of dollars in this easy, speedy and safe way.

"ARREST OF THE OFFENDER. -- An inquest was held yesterday on the body of JOHN E. MCKENZIE, who died at the New-York Hospital, from injuries received at the hands of JAMES CROSS. The facts of the case, as they appeared on the inquest, are as follows: On Sunday afternoon last, CROSS and the deceased met in the grocery-store of CONRAD HALSBERG, NO. 685 Water-street, where they had an altercation. After quarreling some time, the parties adjourned to the dock to have a fight. There the deceased struck CROSS a blow on the breast with his fist, whereupon the two clenched, and a severe struggle ensued, during which CROSS was seen to give deceased a heavy push in the side, but no knife was seen in his hand at the time. The deceased then threw up his hands, opened his vest, and exclaimed, ""That man has stabbed me,"" and immediately fell to the ground. He was taken to the New-York Hospital, where he died yesterday morning. The wound inflicted was in the lower part of the abdomen. Immediately after committing the deed, CROSS held up the knife, which was dripping with the blond of his victim, and then suddenly started to run away. Officer BOYD, of the Thirteenth Precinct, started in pursuit, and after much effort, succeeded in arresting him. The knife with which the wound was inflicted was found on the person of the prisoner. When arrested, CROSS said: ""I cut the man, but I did it in self-defence."" Dr. FOSTER, House Surgeon of the Hospital, made a post-mortem examination of the body. He found two stab wounds in the lower part of the abdomen, either one of which were, in his judgment, sufficient to cause death. The jury rendered a verdict ""that the deceased, JOHN E. MCKENZIE, came to his death from a stab wound at the hands of JAMES CROSS, on the 4th day of October inst."" The deceased was 33 years of age, and a native of Connecticut. The prisoner is 34 years of age, a machinist by occupation, and resided at No. 683 Water-street.

The most important item of news relates to the alarming depredations of the rebel steamers Alabama and Georgia and the sailing pirate Conrad in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope. The first-named vessel had captured the American ships Sea Bride and Nela, and the second had taken the ship Prince of Wales in the vicinity of the Cape. The rebels were graciously received and feted by the British colonists, and the American Consul having protested against the capture of the Sea Bride, as achieved within British waters, was snubbed by the local Governor. The aggregate number of vessels captured or destroyed by the Alabama is stated to be fifty-six and by the Georgia fifteen. The Vanderbilt, of whose safety great fear has been entertained, is reported to have been at St. Helena on the 20th of August, leaving on that date in pursuit of the pirates. In our French exchanges we find the official report of the decision of the Bordeaux Tribunal of Commerce declaring the Alabama a belligerent vessel proper, and quashing the suit of the French merchants who had endeavored to obtain compensation for their property destroyed in the Olive Jane by the rebel vessel. Viewing the Polish question in its present aspect, the London Times is of opinion that further negotiations between Russia and the three Western Powers are virtually concluded, and if there is to be an appeal from the existing state of the controversy, it must be an appeal to the arbitrament of brute force. In the meantime and for six months to come Poland is handed over without a possibility of relief to the Power against which she is so vainly but bravely struggling. The withdrawal of Mr. MASON from England was still discussed by all the journals, and various reasons for the step are assigned. The London Globe, the official organ, says that the question of courtesy has not at all entered in the treatment of Mr. MASON, but simply policy. There had been little change in the Cotton, Provision and Breadstuffs markets. Consols had declined 1/8 cent., closing at 93 1/4@3/8.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a2e6ccd5-63ad-5cf5-a76e-da2e77d9d589,378,nyt://article/a2e6ccd5-63ad-5cf5-a76e-da2e77d9d589,

ROSECRANS' line of communications at McMinnville, is one of a series of annoyances which may be expected, so long as the two armies face each other without great operations to absorb the attention. The temptation to these expeditions is very great, for the line connecting the Army of the Cumberland with its base -- the line over which supplies for man and beast as well as ammunition and reinforcements have to pass -- has the prodigious extension of three hundred miles, and is, by consequence, exceedingly exposed to this sort of attack. Along this route the rebels can, of course, always expect pickings -- they can cut the railroad line, gobble up wagon trains and attack isolated posts.

He was born Jan. 4, 1785, and had therefore reached his 79th year. Although he sought comparative retirement after the death of his brother, he was indefatigable up to his last moments in carrying out the objects to which he had devoted his long and useful life; and with patriotic self-devotion his last hours were spent, not in earning new fame by the continuation of those works which were so peculiarly his own, but in the preparation of his great German dictionary. Jacob Grimm, like many others, had difficulties to contend with in the outset of his career. When he commenced the profession of authorship, Augustus William Schlegel looked upon ancient German literature as in some degree his own domain, and did not treat the young beginner with any degree of friendship, regarding him almost us a usurper, and finding terrible fault with his etymology. But a change soon came over the feelings of Schlegel as to his country man, for afterward he never spoke or wrote of him without expressing the highest opinion of his talents; and he once said: ""I cannot name him without expressing my admiration of his greatness."" His loss will be irreparable in more than one sense, for he was honored and esteemed in Germany not less as a man than as a scholar, and the tranquil spirit by which he was actuated manifested itself in the kindly nature of his writings. In politics he took the Liberal side, and his loss will be felt by many German journals, with the conductors of which he was on terms of valued amity. It is to be regretted that the great national German dictionary on which he was engaged, has not reached beyond the word ""Fromm;"" but, from the ample materials left by the deceased, there is every hope that the work will be concluded in as satisfactory a manner as that in which it was commenced.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; DEATH OF JACOB GRIMM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.; DEATH OF JACOB GRIMM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times, Sept. 25', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Sept', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ef4c627-002a-51d2-85f7-7523f9aaf6d6,357,nyt://article/2ef4c627-002a-51d2-85f7-7523f9aaf6d6,

The fact that in England the Government is so completely in the hands of a class, that the waves of popular feeling only reach it after roaring a very long time in vain on the shore; and that an adverse vote, either in the House of Commons or at the polls, generally expresses a sentiment which it has taken years to form, was by our would-be reformers entirely overlooked. Our Executive was made independent of the people for the time it holds office, by the founders of Government, intentionally, and not through inadvertence; and for the very strong reason, that ours being a pure democracy, and not, as in England, a democracy with a strong aristocracy to act as a buffer between it and the Administration, it was felt that an Executive which was forced to reflect not only the calm and mature judgment, but every fleeting passion of a community as excitable and as restive and nervous as ours, would be the worst Executive that was ever seen, and would, in fact, be little better than a Government carried on by Committees appointed by mass-meetings.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The President and Popular Factions.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The President and Popular Factions.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3918fcfe-95ce-5d12-99c3-dc883b9e8af3,816,nyt://article/3918fcfe-95ce-5d12-99c3-dc883b9e8af3,

CAMERON, of the Eighteenth Precinct, with a platoon of men, made a descent on a gambling-house situated at No. 818 Broadway. The proprietor, R. HAMILTON DIEDERICH, the cue-keeper, and nine others who were found engaged in gambling, were arrested. This house has for a long time been well known to the Police, and the officers have been on the watch to detect the proprietor. Many persons were in the habit of spending their time and money at this establishment. Among the victims was Mr. EMIL SICK, of No. 70 Ludlow-street, who appeared before Justice DOWLING at the Tombs yesterday afternoon, and made an affidavit to the effect that, between the 1st day of January last and the 15th of May ensuing he had lost the sum of $20,000 at the gambling-house above-named. He further testified that the money which he had lost did not belong to him, but to some merchants doing business in Broad-street. He also stated that at the times he lost the money a man named MARCUS C. LITTELL was the proprietor of the gambling saloon at the place above-named. Upon this statement Justice DOWLING issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. LITTELL. Superintendent KENNEDY is entitled to great credit for the part he has taken in trying to break up this gambling-house. It has been well known to the Police for many months past; but until recently the authorities could get hold of no evidence which would warrant them in taking any action. Two citizens who had suffered in the establishment were at length found, and they made affidavits of their losses, which were submitted to Superintendent KENNEDY. Capt. CAMERON selected Officers O'DONNELL and DAVIS, who, dressed in plain clothes, at about 2 o'clock A.M., entered the saloon, where they found gambling of all descriptions going on. The duty of these officers was merely to survey the premises. They retired, and reported what they had discovered. Capt. CAMERON then selected ten of his most efficient and trustworthy men, all dressed in full uniform, and with them he marched to the gamblers' den, and surrounded it. When everything was in readiness for the capture, Capt. CAMERON passed through the front door, seized the colored servant in attendance, and with two or three of his most trusty men, entered the saloon and took prisoners all whom he found engaged in gambling. The arrested persons were taken before Justice DOWLING, where they gave their names as follows. R. Hamilton Diederich, proprietor; Owen Johnson, cue keeper; Chester Roberts, Thomas Yeiden, C.P. Williams, L.W. Wesley, R.S. Thomas, R. Alexander, J.B. Schenck, James Diament and another who refused to give his name. Two colored waiters, named James and John Cooper, were also arrested and held as witnesses.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE; THE POLICE AMONG THE GAMBLERS.

But it is ascertained that the following Lion and Lamb were the presiding officers of the Committees: FERNANDO WOOD, Mozart; CHAS. G. CORNELL, Tammany. The question first considered was that of a platform. Tammany argued that it was necessary, as a matter of policy, to lay down a war platform. Mozart replied with the argument that it had never been customary for a Democratic County Convention to pass any platform resolutions. Tammany responded with the assertion that just now it was a necessity to have a platform, and finally it was left to one of each Committee to fix up a series of planks for the Democracy to stand upon. The probabilities are that the platform of the State Convention at Albany, will be re-presented and adopted. Hon. FERNANDO WOOD was one of the principal mechanics in constructing that, and all the ""jours"" acknowledged his exceeding skill in arranging it on the ""little joker,"" principle of ""now you see it, and now you don't; five to one, gentlemen, that you can't tell which cup it's under.""

There can be no doubt who this California representative is. It is undoubtedly Mr. GWIN, lately United States Senator from California. The movements of this individual have been rather erratic during the past two years; and it was not until our Paris correspondent announced through our columns on Monday last that the Ex-Senator had arrived at the French capital, that we could definitely settle his whereabouts. He remained for a twelve-month in the loyal States after the outbreak of the rebellion; and it was in the Spring of last year that he was arrested by a naval officer on the Isthmus of Panama, as he was on his way, it was supposed, to this City. After being conveyed here, and remaining under surveillance for some time, he went to Washington, but from there, after a short residence, suddenly disappeared, and about a year ago turned up in Richmond. There or thereabouts he remained until August last, when he went to Wilmington, from which he sailed for Europe in a blockade-running steamer, and made the passage from Wilmington to Paris in the remarkably short space of twenty days. From the beginning, GWIN was an arrant rebel in fact, but while in the North his treason assumed the somewhat modified garb of the Copperhead. His purpose was to be on both sides, or rather to be on the winning side, whichever it might be. He stayed a long while in the North after the rebellion broke out, to see what might be the upshot of affairs; and when the Southern arms were widely successful last year, he went over to the Confederacy. Now, again, when the Southern cause is declining, and its only hope is from Europe, he wends his way there, to secure his own safety, and to aid the Confederacy after his own style. He will doubtless prove an efficient coadjutor of the great Louisiana intriguer, Mr. SLIDELL.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Triad of Traitors in Paris Rebel Intrigues in California.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Triad of Traitors in Paris Rebel Intrigues in California.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7eab52fb-1399-55ab-ba8e-4c8392616b3e,850,nyt://article/7eab52fb-1399-55ab-ba8e-4c8392616b3e,

Notwithstanding the ""fat negro's"" impudence, we transfer to our columns all that part of the article that has any meaning to it at all. He wishes the Emperor of the French to be ""duly informed of the general and extreme gratification with which the Confederates have looked upon the establishment of so good a neighbor upon their southern border; and that, instead of being anxious to join LINCOLN and his Generals in a war upon His Majesty, nothing would please them so well as a league with His Majesty, to make war upon LINCOLN, and thus make a speedy end of the braggadocio Yankee nation forever."" This is really all MITCHELL wishes to say, except to further inform his French Majesty ""that we (MITCHELL) take no interest at all in the 'Anglo-Saxon race,' and rather incline to believe that we belong to the 'Latin races' ourselves,"" which must be decidedly rich to those who know MITCHELL'S pedigree -- which we do not.

Commendable Action on New-York Riot Trials; as Affected by the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/09/archives/justice-barnard-and-the-riot-trials.html,Commendable Action on New-York Riot Trials; as Affected by the War,"As we most heartily commended the charge of Recorder HOFFMAN to the Grand Jury, at the time of the opening of the trial of the rioters in August last, so with equal heartiness do we now commend the charge of Justice BARNARD, delivered to the Grand Jury on Wednesday, on occasion of the reopening of a term of Court which will, in good part, be devoted to the trial of the same class of culprits. We published Justice BARNARD's charge yesterday; and though no one had previously doubted his purpose to pursue an honorable course, uphold the authority of law and vindicate its action against its violators, yet the appearance of the charge gave a feeling of satisfaction and security to all good citizens. Justice BARNARD, like Recorder HOFFMAN, administered a severe condemnation upon all who violate the laws, to whatever party they may belong, or under whatever pretext they may act. ""Evil disposed men of all political parties, ""he say, ""have within the last few, years called in question the constitutionality of every law which in any way affected them or their interests;"" and the terrible fruits of this teaching are at last apparent. He further argues that ""if a large number of men claiming that a law is unconstitutional can disregard it and resist by violence its enforecement, so can a smaller number on the same ground resist another law, and so can each individual resist a law which does not happen to suit him; and thus all government would end. It will thus be perceived that the fact that the acts of violence committed in this City were so committed under the plea of resisting an unconstitutional law, not only affords no excuse, but enhances the criminality of the act. If this be so, in case of resistance to any law claimed to be unconstitutional, is not such resistance the more reprehensible when made to a law such as the one in question?""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JUSTICE BARNARD AND THE RIOT TRIALS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'JUSTICE BARNARD AND THE RIOT TRIALS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e558c166-e182-578d-b239-4f8ac6ff65f8,451,nyt://article/e558c166-e182-578d-b239-4f8ac6ff65f8,

On the 5th inst. the Common Councils of Baltimore, in both branches, passed resolutions and appointed delegations of their members to convey to the Russian commanding officer of the fleet now at anchor in the Hudson, a formal and special invitation to visit the Monumental City and receive the attentions of its authorities and people. The deputation, which arrived here on Friday night, consisted of the Committees of both branches of the Councils, and another composed of six citizens appointed by the Mayor of that place. It comprised Hon. JOHN L. CHAPMAN, Mayor; JAMES YOUNG, Esq., President of the first branch; S.F. STREETER, Chairman, and Messrs. JOHN F. TOWNER and E.S. LAMBDIN, of the Committee; Messrs. SAMUEL DUER, President of the second branch, and JOHN G. WILMOT, Chairman, with WM. MOODY and JOHN BARRON, Esqs., members of the Committee. The Citizens' Committee was as follows: Ex-Mayor THOMAS SWANN, Hon. HENRY W. HOFFMANN, Collector of the Port; JOHN H.B. LATROBE, Col. WM. CHESNUT, and Capt. JACOB W. HUGG. In addition to these were several Baltimoreans of note, who accompanied the Committees and joined in the demonstration, viz.: Messrs. VALENTINE FURMAN, WM.

The Diet and M. Bismarck,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/11/archives/prussian-politics.html,The Diet and M. Bismarck,"The Prussian atmosphere is full of political rumors. It is said that the dissolution of the Diet was not the work of VON BISMARK, but the tale is that it was brought about in this way. One of the artifices employed by him to maintain his position consists in isolating the King, and preventing all intercourse between him and those who would be likely to enlighten his ignorance. Now, though WILLIAM may be conscious of the surveillance exercised over him, he does not wish others to be cognizant of it. It happened, while he was at Gastein, that he unexpectedly met Baron AUERSWALD, one of his oldest friends, on the promenade. ""What,"" exclaimed the King, ""you here, and don't come to see me!"" ""I called twice, your Majesty, but was twice refused admission."" WILLIAM made no reply, yet hardly was he back to Carlsbad when he ordered the decree dissolving the Chambers to be drawn up, without consultation with his Premier. His Majesty seems in fact to be growing somewhat weary of the ministerial fetters. Putting aside altogether the necessity which inclines him to conciliate his people, he has recently experienced certain slights at their hands that have annoyed him considerably. During his homeward journey to Berlin, the Corporations of several of the towns through which he passed refused him a public reception, and even had the boldness to adopt resolutions to that effect. This evidence of his waning popularity not all the vigilance of VON BISMARK could conceal from the King, who doubtless was not mistaken as to the real cause of it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prussian Politics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prussian Politics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17e9bb82-07f7-5eed-9e54-696e31ff0d05,768,nyt://article/17e9bb82-07f7-5eed-9e54-696e31ff0d05,

It is entitled, ""The National Force,"" and discusses the power of a nation to raise armies, the mode of obtaining troops adopted in various European countries, but particularly in England, together with other collateral questions, in their historical and legal aspects. It disperses much of the fog which has been thrown around the draft, and disposes of many objections to it, so far as those objections are founded on English authorities and precedents. It is astonishing how many errors have beem spread abroad on this subject by speakers and newspapers, and how many misconceptions concerning it pervade the public mind. It is all-important, in a practical point of view, that these errors and misconceptions be removed; and this can only be done by bringing before the people such searching investigations as that referred to.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NATIONAL FORCE AND THE MODE OF RAISING IT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NATIONAL FORCE AND THE MODE OF RAISING IT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NATIONAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/264f02d5-88a5-5c9f-944a-914398ece14d,179,nyt://article/264f02d5-88a5-5c9f-944a-914398ece14d,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/11/archives/yellow-fever.html,,"-- We have New-Orleans advices to the 4th instant, but there is no confirmation of the existence of yellow fever, which was lately reported from Washington to be prevailing on the Lower Mississippi, and of which a number of our naval officers were said to have died. Yellow fever is a subject on which New-Orleans papers have always been rather reticent, until such time as its ravages assumed an extent in which silence was impossible; but it could not easily exist without our having indications of the fact from the mortality returns or the local columns of the journals. Beside, it would be a very extraordinary thing for the yellow fever to break out at the close of September. If that month comes in with the absence of the disease, the city and vicinity is usually considered safe for the year. We suspect that our special dispatch, which characterized the fever of which our officers died at New-Orleans, as ""pernicious"" fever, or malignant intermittent, is the correct statement of the case. This view is confirmed by a letter which we have just received from our special correspondent at New-Orleans, who says that there have been whisperings of ""Yellow Jack"" being in that city, but that they are all positively false.""

In the earliest times in the far East, and now throughout the vine-producing districts of Germany the gathering of the grapes and their consignment to the wine press, ever was among the most striking and popular of the rustic festivals. The joyous season of the ripeness and fulness of the year teems with incentives to hearty jollity, and the whole-souled Teutonic race have always made it a period of unbounded wassail. The russet hues of the landscape; the hazy atmosphere; the smell of the fallen leaves; the lingering, half-languid warmth tempered still by bracing breezes; the clustering fruit upon the laden trees and vines, and all the evidence of the fulfillment of the season's labor and its rich reward, endow Autumn with indescribable charms as peculiar to it as to Spring its fresh verdue and bloom, and to Summer its golden glow of garden and field. The brilliant, pleasant outside life, indeed, is ceasing, but the prospect of the cosy ingle-side at home, the solid good cheer and the purply, brimming wine-cup by the ruddy hearth are thoughts agreeable alike to youth or age, and all join in for wholesale pleasure.

Russia's Final Reply to the European Powers; Ultimatum of on the Polish Insurrection,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/11/archives/the-russian-ultimatum-the-polish-insurrection.html,Russia's Final Reply to the European Powers; Ultimatum of on the Polish Insurrection,"The Government of the Czar has at length condescended to reply to the ""identical notes"" of the intervening Powers. The tone of these Gortschakoff replies is most courteous; they accept, without qualification or reservation, every one of Earl RUSSELL'S six points, and promise that the Czar ""will do all in his power to solve the question which is a source of misunderstanding between the Cabinets."" But what does all this amount to when it is also asserted that none of these points can be carried out, that the solution of the said question is impracticable, until the insurgents are crushed and Poland is pacified? The fact is, let the Allies attempt to disguise it an they may, that the importunate remonstrances of their diplomatists, have not caused Russia to recede a single hair's breadth from her original position. So far in truth have the interventionists been from effecting any good for the Poles, that they have rendered their case rather worse than otherwise. That intelligence which La France recently published about it being the intention of the Czar to grant a constitution to Poland in common with the rest of his empire, was certainly not without foundation. The benevolence of ALEXANDER undoubtedly contemplated some such philanthropic scheme; and the correctness of this view is rendered more than plausible by the late remarkable speech of the Czar to the Diet of the Grand Duchy of Finland; but the tone of the Anglo-Gallic dispatches had roused the pride of the war party in the Cabinet, who would not hear of any concession being made to the insurgents at the dictation of the Western Powers, and so the Czar had to shelve his Constitution project for the present. If Russia, then, will concede no terms to the Poles, but requires unconditional submission, it is to the indiscretion of their French and English friends that they must ascribe the severity of their fate. The interventionists thrust themselves into this Slavonic imbroglio most inconsiderately, and while in utter ignorance of the real nature of the question.

The rioters are evidently assure of justice at the hands of one as those of the other, and justice is all that those who most abhor them could desire for them. Judge BARNARD's emphatic condemnation of the atrocities of last July is all the more valuable from the fact that he cannot be accused of sympathy with the Administration or its policy. It relieves the decenter portion of the community from the doubt -- and it was a very horrible one -- which many of us had begun to feel, whether political partisanship was not getting a little too tigerish for endurance. Every respectable citizen who recalls the sensations with which he read or heard of the expressions of sympathy uttered in the World and Herald, of the 14th of July, for the bands of cutthroats who had been following their devilish trade on the previous day, will readily understand that if these two journals had expressed the feelings of any considerable portion even of the Democratic party, there would have been in six months a general and overwhelming demand for protection by a strong hand, whatever sacrifices of public franchises or public liberties such protection might exact. The main end of government is, after all, the protection of life and property, and there are no men of any race who would not hold liberty in detestation, if its possession made this object unattainable.

For some days past the apparent concentration of a strong rebel force in the vicinity of Madison Court House has been looked on with suspicion, and on Saturday morning one of Gen. KILPATRICK's cavalry brigades was dispatched to reconnoitre in that direction. When near Robertson's River our troopers met a large body of STUART's cavalry, and a fight was the result. The battle raged an hour, when KILPATRICK was compelled to fall back upon his infantry supports. Another severe contest ensued, and, after a considerable number had been captured, the infantry also gave way. This illfortune, however, was quickly retrieved by a detachment of cavalry, who retook nearly all the prisoners, when our whole force, stubbornly contesting every foot of the way, fell back toward Culpepper. It is generally believed that the rebel movements signify an intention on the part of A.P. HILL's corps to change from our left front to the rear of our right, in order to cut our railroad communication, and measures are in progress to frustrate the scheme. Guerrilla parties are becoming more and more audacious. On Friday night, they were as close to our lines as Bailey's Cross Roads, Fall's Church and Munson's Hill, at each of which places they committed depredations.

The Virginia Convention contained a decided majority of members elected expressly as Union men, and yet by bribery, intimidation, cheating and every political trick which desperate and unscrupulous traitors could possibly devise, a majority of the Convention was induced to pass a secession ordinance, and the people of the State were thus betrayed into the rebel Confederacy. Similar devices were used in other Southern States. It is notorious that in the Fall of 1861 the rebels intended to get possession of Maryland in the same manner -- the secession members of the Legislature that was to meet in September being relied on to take the necessary preliminary steps. Fortunately for the people of Maryland, as well as for the country at large, the Government became aware of these treasonable schemes, and took prompt and effectual measures to defeat them. How it was done may be seen in part from the following letters and orders issued at the time by the Secretary of War, by Gen. MCCLELLAN, by Gen. BANKS and other officers of the Government.

Both will be of the utmost interest and importance, as embodying the verdict of two of the largest and most powerful States in the Union upon the question of prosecuting the war until the military power of the rebel Confederacy is completely broken. The canvas in both States has been conducted with vigor and energy, and it is scarcely possible that the issue should not be distinctly and generally understood. No intelligent man can doubt that if the rebellion is to be quelled at all, it must be by force of arms. No peace can possibly be had except by giving up the Union or by beating the rebel armies.

""Roberto Devereux"" was not a success, and the second performance was received as tamely as the first. This result is attributable mainly to Signor BELLINI, who has the misfortune to be always sick when any special effort is expected at his hands. The role which he had to abandon on Wednesday night is one of the strong features of the opera, and would have displayed his grand voice to the greatest perfection. As it was the public yawned, felt disappointed, and went home grumbling about DONIZETTI, forgetting hat it was the singer, and not the composer, who was at fault. On Wednesday the ""house"" was neither so full nor so brilliant as on the opening night. Both occasions were eclipsed on Friday, when Miss KELLOGG returned to our stage, and achieved what she is always entitled to, a genuine artistic success. Her performance of the difficult role of the heroine was characterized by the most graceful perception of its dramatic opportunities, and by a complete and thorough interpretation of the music. We were glad to remark that the lady's voice was stronger and more manageable than we ever remember to have heard it. The protracted bronchial trouble which prevented her singing last season has happily terminated without ill consequences, and the long rest which it has necessitated seems indeed to have been of positive benefit to her. The opera was excellently rendered by the company. Signor MAZZOLENT sang superbly, and brought down a torrent of applause in an introduced romanza from ""I Lomdardi,"" (La mia Letizia.) Signor BARILI sustained the part of the Jester with a great deal of dramatic ability, and Mile. SULZER, although her voice lacks color, sang the contralto part very well. The orchestra and chorus were thoroughly good; indeed the performance was all that could be desired or expected of the forces now at the Academy, and will, we hope, be repeated. To-night VERDI's ""Ernami"" will be produced. This opera was given, it will be remembered, with immense effect last season.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e84c3ebe-5289-5aa6-ba3f-36cfd6b643ce,1048,nyt://article/e84c3ebe-5289-5aa6-ba3f-36cfd6b643ce,

High Mass was celebrated at St. Teresa's Roman Catholic Church, corner of Rutger and Henry streets, at 10 o'clock in the morning. Rev. Father BOYCE, pastor of the church. Rev. Father INMAGHAU, of Pennsylvania, and Rev. Father MCLAUGHLIN, of New-Rochelle, officiated at the mass. The latter gentleman delivered an excellent and impressive funeral sermon.

"THE LATE ATTEMPT TO BREAK JAIL. -- The attempt to break jail on Monday night, as has since transpired, was a regular plot laid by some of the worst characters now imprisoned and awaiting trial for various offences. A man named SPENCER, who is charged with counterfeiting, is supposed to be the leader. Preparations had long since been made to overpower the keeper on the first opportunity that presented itself, break off the lock, or take the key and open the gate leading to the corridor, and when once in the yard to scale the fence and escape. Some fifty prisoners are confined on the corridor where the outbreak occurred, many of them desperate characters. All were in the secret, having communicated with such other through the sewer pipes which run from one cell to the other. POWERS, MCGARVY and SPENCER made the assault on the keeper as soon as he opened the cell door to admit another prisoner. It was their intention to disable, if not to kill him. One of the party struck him with a bar of iron, and another attempted to choke him, by drawing a handkerchief across his neck. The handkerchief not being strong enough for the purpose, broke, and the keeper, although nearly senseless, managed to seek safety in the cell his assailants had just vacated. MAY had taken the key of the outer gate from him, and also the keys of the cells. MAY then locked him in, and proceeded to release the other prisoners. A few colored men and boys refused to come out of their cells or to take any part in the master IGNAUZ RYTZKY, condemned for the murder of SIGISMUND FELLNER, the diamond merchant, also remained in his quarters, declining to aid the mutineers, but instead, succeeded in saving the keeper's life, and preventing the prisoners from escaping, by informing them that the jail was surrounded by policemen -- that every passage outside was guarded, -- and that it would be useless for them to get beyond the walls. One policeman having accidentally made his appearance at the gate, rendered RATZKY's statement plausible, and the prisoners at once desisted. Had they known that there was no person there except that solitary policeman, they might have easily accomplished their purpose. After some delay several officers arrived, and the door being opened with a duplicate key, the imprisoned jailor was released, and the prisoners were continued in closer and more secure quarters. Mr. ISAAC MESSERGIE, the keeper, was found to be seriously injured. Dr. VAN ZANDT was called to his aid, and bound up his wounds. He will doubtless recover, although he will necessarily be continued to his house for some time.

By uniting with Brother BEN WOOD against FERNANDO, on the nomination of JOHN MCCOOL for Register, he has incurred the enmity of Sheriff LYNCH, Mr. MAT. GOODERSON, Mr. BEN.

Mr. JOHN DECKER, Chief Engineer of the Fire Department, is thus thrown out of the two regularly accredited organizations; and must run for Register as the candidate of the ""New-York,"" ""Jeffersonian,"" and all the allied sore-heads of the Democratic party.

"This vessel, which was commenced some weeks ago at Mr. ROWLAND's yard at Greenpoint, is progressing rapidly. She was designed by Chief Engineer STIMERS, U.S.N., and is intended for river and harbor navigation. She is 225 feet long, 45 feet wide, and 9 feet depth of hold. The Cohoes is of peculiar construction. There is an immense hull, outside of which there is another hull, the space between them forming water-tight compartments; outside of the outer hull is the wooden bulwarks and iron armor. The compartments are capable of being flooded and pumped out if necessary, so as to lighten her. The inner vessel is able to float without the aid of the outer hull, if it should be damaged by a ram or projectile. The internal sides are square with the bottom, which is perfectly flat the whole length and width of the vessel. The sides will be 6 1/2 feet thick, including the compartments, timber and 3 inches of iron plating. The frame and inner hall are already completed. The revolving turret will be 20 feet in diameter and 8 inches thick of solid iron. The accomodations for the officers are forward, and those for the sailors are placed in juxtaposition. She will be driven by two propellers. Her armament will consist of two 150-pounders. Her speed is expected to be 6 knots; it is probable that she may make 8 knots, which is very good speed for this class of vessels.

its advantages and dangers,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/14/archives/our-political-system-its-advantages-and-dangers.html,its advantages and dangers,"DE TOCQUEVILLE was the first to call attention to the enormous gain to humanity that would result from the success of the political experiment which we were making on this continent, from the single fact that it would accustom great and powerful communities to submit their differences to judicial arbitrament, and would make it a point of honor with them to abide by legal precedents, instead of resorting to the sword. To know what this Federal system of ours, if it can only be perpetuated, will save the inhabitants of this continent in money and bloodshed, we have only to study the history of Europe during the last six centuries. We do not mean to say that it is probable that, without the Union, we should have here a faithful repetition of all the horrors through which Europe has passed since the Crusades, because the advance of civilization and the stronger hold of the precepts of Christianity on men of all classes, would give our wars a tinge of gentleness and humanity by which those of the Old World were not marked until our day. But we should have among us in full activity the very cause which has led to all European wars since the close of the Fourteenth century -- the fears of the smaller States of the predominance of the larger ones, expressed in the struggles on behalf of what is so well known as ""the balance of power."" Once cut the States loose from each other, or cut the Union up into several Confederacies, and you call into play the very passions to which the world owed the Thirty Years' War, the wars between LOUIS XIV, and WILLIAM III., the war of MARLBOROUGH, the war of 1756, and the wars of the French Empire. You rouse between each political community the spirit of hostile rivalry; the love of domination among the strong, and the fear of conquest and oppression among the weak. The larger States would find in their strength and resources a justification for seeking to extend their territory; the smaller ones would find in their weakness a fair excuse for entering into combinations for self-defence, and even in seeking safety in foreign alliances. There would be incessant intrigue, jealousy, and recrimination, and, as a general consequence, incessant hostilities, or -- what is almost as fatal to prosperity -- incessant fears of hostilities. Any arrangement which saves all this, let its imperfections be what they may, is certainly worth all the sacrifices which any one generation can make for it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Political System Its Advantages and Dangers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Political System Its Advantages and Dangers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f2334747-0ffc-5578-968a-53d487e772d3,961,nyt://article/f2334747-0ffc-5578-968a-53d487e772d3,

Indeed we know definitely that a corps of the rebel army attempted at the close of last week, by a rapid northern march along a line near the eastern base of the Blue Ridge, to get on the right flank of our army, which was then stationed at Culpepper Court-House; and we know that this movement was only prevented by a skillful manoeuvre on the part of Gen. MEADE, who quickly flung two corps forward from Culpepper to the Rapidan, and threatened, in turn, to get in the rebel rear, cut their communications, and otherwise embarrass them.

The expedition of the infernal machine against the Ironsides, whereof we give full accounts from our special correspondent, was certainly a very bold affair, and a little of the spirit that brought that daring party out in their little cigar-shaped craft would have carried our iron fleet into Charleston long ago. It is difficult to estimate the precise bearing which this single experiment has on the general question of the capacity of the iron-clads to withstand the explosion of torpedoes. We are told that the torpedo in question held a charge of sixty pounds of powder, and being exploded directly amidships of the Ironsides, left her wholly uninjured. This is a test whose exact value the professional men will best appreciate; but we suppose it will hardly be claimed that sixty pounds of powder might not be exploded in contact with an iron vessel, which would produce a very different effect. Besides, the condition of floating torpedoes, such as this, and fixed torpedoes, such as those with which Charleston harbor is said to be sown, (and which would explode directly under the vessel,) are widely different. In the meantime, we cannot but hope that the naval chief of the expedition will quickly get ready to experiment, as well as to be experimented upon.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL TORPEDOES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL TORPEDOES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/755b8535-9c66-5f9c-a329-ab84a96ff4b5,264,nyt://article/755b8535-9c66-5f9c-a329-ab84a96ff4b5,

Their knowledge of the capacity and resources of their own people has been proved by events to have been exceedingly accurate and profound, but their ignorance of every other people seems to have been, for men of as much ability and shrewdness as they have undoubtedly shown themselves to possess, and for men who have, to an extent unknown amongst us, made politics and political history a lifelong study, curious in the last degree. Their principal errors, too, are of a kind that we should expect from what are commonly called ""practical men"" -- men of little education, to whom self-interest in its lowest sense is the key to all political problems, and by no means from persons who have studied politics in books. The notion, for instance, that the North, being a commercial community, devoted to the pursuit of gain, was for that reason sure not to fight, is rather the conclusion of a backwoodsman than of a student.

"WINTER GARDEN. -- The play of ""Ruy Blas"" produced at this establishment Wednesday night, belongs to a period of VICTOR HUGO's career, when flushed with his victories over the formalists of the schools he had determined to carry the romantic drama to its greatest extent. Sentimentalism can hardly go further than in the character of the hero, unless we except the love-lorn flunkey of the more recent yellow-covered literature -- the Jeames who married his young mistress -- as a type of a high emotional nature. There are points of resemblance, indeed, between Ruy Blas and the last named character. When we become acquainted with him, he is in the guise of a serving-man. A noble by association he becomes a menial in order that he may be near the lady whom he is not at liberty to approach in any other way. This is none other than the Princess, shortly to become Queen of Spain by marriage with the monarch. One of Ruy's old associates. Don Caesar, recognizes him, and the recognition is witnessed by the evil genius of the play. Don Salluste, who also overhears the domestic's declaration of love. Don Salluste has recently been degraded, mainly through the Princess' means. He determines to be revenged, and uses Ruy Blas to effect his object. Assuming the title of Don Caesar, who in the meantime has been sent out of the way, he (Ruy) makes love to the Princess, and in the last scene has an interview with her which is sufficient to compromise her with her future husband. Don Salluste is, of course, a witness, but he is not permitted to enjoy his triumph. The despised menial turns upon him; a struggle ensues, and both are killed.

They not only do not facilitate but they actually obstruct the dispatch of criminal business. Take the present term for example. On Monday last the October Term of the Oyer and Terminer commenced simultaneously with the October Term of the General Sessions. Thus far three cases have been disposed of by both courts. If the Sessions had been sitting alone, twice that number would have been tried, and the useless attendance of a score o jurors and witnesses, would have been avoided. It is a well known fact -- a fact not at all creditable to the legal profession -- that nine-tenths of the criminal practice of this City is confined to some half dozen lawyers. If two Courts are in session, it almost invariably happens that when a criminal is placed at the bar in one Court, the lawyer retained in the case is engaged, or expects to be engaged, in the other, and vice versa. The result is a hindrance to the prosecution of business in both Courts. The Court of General Sessions is the criminal Court of the City, and, with its two Judges, is abundantly capable of transacting all the criminal business of the county. The Supreme Court has more civil business than it can attend to without holding sessions of the Oyer and Terminer, and it rarely happens that a case is transferred to this Court from the General Sessions for any reason that would not be equally operative for a change of venue to some other county. There is, therefore, no occasion for sittings of the Oyer and Terminer in this county, and experience has shown that they can be dispensed with.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Criminal Courts Uselessness of the Oyer and Terminer.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Criminal Courts Uselessness of the Oyer and Terminer.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4a97c1a1-f219-5113-83b9-1cfe5fe04be3,299,nyt://article/4a97c1a1-f219-5113-83b9-1cfe5fe04be3,

Free Labor in the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/17/archives/free-black-labor-in-the-south-the-negro-in-his-transition-state.html,Free Labor in the South,"We have now within our army lines, or within control of our military posts, a million of the slaves of the so-called Confederate States. We do not refer to the negroes of Missouri, Kentucky and Maryland, but mainly to those of the four great Slave States bordering on the Lower Mississippi -- Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. The events and incidents of the war have broken up the long-established social and industrial systems of these States; and we find this vast mass of negro humanity unloosed, unfixed, helpless unless helped, and demanding supervision, guidance, attention and care in its transition from a state of absolute Slavery to the improved condition that we hope fortune has in store for it. We cannot help taking cognizance of its existence, for it is forced upon us; we cannot avoid directing it unless we would have it ruin the country. As yet but too little attention has been paid to the subject, either practically or speculatively; and the authorities, seeing and feeling the gigantic embarrassments and difficulties of the subject -- knowing that it is a problem so stupendous and profound, so far-reaching in its bearings, and demanding so imperatively an intelligent solution, have rather held back their hands and permitted matters to drift, in hope that time and clearer skies would somehow or other come to our relief. This, if not the best thing that could be done, is, we believe, really the only thing that could wisely be done, under the circumstances. But the consequence is that masses of negroes and great tracts of country are now ""at loose ends,"" and it is only at one or two points that the subject has been grappled with at all. The principal of these are Louisiana (some of its parishes) and the South Carlina sea-islands. As a matter of the deepest interest, we present to the readers of the TIMES this morning some of the observations on the new free-labor system made by intelligent persons in each of these localities. After studying them, we think our readers will agree with us that the experiment is an essential success, though it would appear that in Louisiana at least it is not carried on in all respects as might be desired.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Free Black Labor in the South The Negro in his Transition State.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Free Black Labor in the South The Negro in his Transition State.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'NEGROES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2c9a76e5-105d-5306-8ac0-0cb431ba3e24,918,nyt://article/2c9a76e5-105d-5306-8ac0-0cb431ba3e24,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/17/archives/the-powers-of-the-board-of-commissioners-of-health.html,,"A report has been made to the Board of Commissioners of Health by WILLIAM H. ARMSTRONG, Esq., the Clerk of such Board, which sets forth concisely and clearly the powers of the Board as to nuisances and the authorities therefor. It is a compilation which has long been needed, and bears the evidence of a latorious, thorough and intelligent examination. Heretofore the Board of Health and the Commissioners have been groping in the dark. Until this valuable compilation by Mr. ARMSTRONG they have had to roam over the wide fields of State laws and municipal ordinance, and made tiresome search for anything definite or satisfactory as to their powerr to abate nuisances. The report was based on a complaint against a ""fat boiling"" establishment in the City limits, and shows that no power does exist in this Board to cause the removal from the City of any business which may be deemed detrimental to the public health, that power being conferred expressly on the ""Board of Health."" But the Common Council can meet this difficulty by passing an ordinance under the statute giving the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty power to pass all such by-laws and ordinances as may be needed for preservation of the public health, removal and abatement of nuisances. This would be preferable to anything the Board of Health may do, as they can act only on special cases after notice to parties against whom action is to be taken. An ordinance of the Common Council would be general, and would cure all cases of nuisances without the trouble and delay caused by the present mode of procedure. The ordinance in regard to boiling offal, bones, &c., does this so far as these businesses are concerned, but does not include what was the source of complaint on which the report was made, ""fat boiling;"" an amendment to the ordinance embracing this would protect the City from an abomination. It is claimed, however, that in the absence of an ordinance by the Common Council, that almost absolute power is vested in the Board in connection with the City inspector, by the section of the Statute which directed the Inspector to do, or cause to be done, everything in relation to cleansing and purifying of building lots, &c., which, in the opinion of the Mayor and the Commissioners of Health, shall be deemed necessary. This power, however, is not sufficiently defined, and could be fairly contested. A memorial and draft of an ordinance, embodying the views in the report, have been submitted to the Common Council, and laid over for consideration.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Powers of the Board of Commissioners of Health.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Powers of the Board of Commissioners of Health.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8674e600-2385-595c-96de-bc65a6b8c917,431,nyt://article/8674e600-2385-595c-96de-bc65a6b8c917,

The large number of these professional gentlemen who are in durance makes the matter one requiring immediate attention. The whole difficulty lies in the case of Dr. RUCKER, who is a prisoner in Richmond, and against whom the rebels allege a deed, committed in Virginia, in violation of law. They are willing to exchange the other Surgeons, but refuse to give him up, insisting that he shall first be tried in Virginia for his alleged offence. This, as a principle, cannot be conceded by us, for by the local laws of every Southern State, every one of our soldiers has incurred the penalty of death, for stirring up insurrection among the slaves, for circulating incendiary documents, (such as the TIMES,) and for numerous similar things; and we have, of course, steadily refused to give them the privilege of general execution of our prisoners. The correspondence upon the subject between the exchange officers was dropped as long ago as two months, and in the meantime these surgeons (who should not be regarded as prisoners of war at all) are incarcerated, without prospect of release. We hope that negotiations will at once be renewed, and the rebels brought to terms; and, as we hold in our hands three times the number of surgeons held by the enemy, we should think it were possible to do this.

L.; Class Book of Chemistry","Dr. YOUMAN's work on Chemistry has for many years held its own as, perhaps, the very best classbook on the Subject, and in the present edition he brings it up abreast of the latest discoveries in this expansive and expanding branch of science. New views of the nature and connection of the forces have been accepted in the scientific world, which compel a new treatment of this branch of the subject. The old notion that the forces are separate and peculiar forms of imponderable matter, has given way to the idea that they are closely allied and mutually convertible forms of activity or motion in ordinary matter. The older views are held to be self-contradictory, and as they do not explain and cannot represent the present facts of science, they are abandoned by the body of advanced scientific thinkers of the present time. The newer doctrines may be still incomplete, and are not without their difficulties, but they are more simple and rational -- they harmonize with the later facts of discovery, and open many new paths of investigation of the highest interest and promise. Among the latest chemical and physicochemical discoveries embodied by Dr. YOUMANS, in the new edition of the Text Book, are the Spectrum Analysis and the elements discovered by it; Prof. GRAHAM's interesting views of Dialysis and the colloidal condition of matter, and BERTHELOT's remarkable researches in organic synthesis, or the artificial production of organic substances.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; A CLASS BOOK OF CHEMISTRY, in which the Latest Facts and Principles of the science are Explained and Applied to the Arts of life and the Phenomena of Nature.

Friday evening, about 10 o'clock, a man was run over by a stage driven at top-speed, on Broadway, in the vicinity of Barnum's Museum. He was dashed to the ground, badly cut and bruised, and covered from head to foot with mire, his clothing being completely destroyed of course. The stage drove right on, in spite of shouts and cries directed at the driver.

English Interference With,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/18/archives/england-in-dahomey.html,English Interference With,"There is a little spot on the west coast of Africa, the geographical extent of which does not exceed two hundred miles in length, and one hundred and fifty in breadth, and the population of which comes within two hundred thousand, and yet this morsel of territory should possess more interest in the eyes of Americans than all the crest of that great continent together. It is the kingdom of Dahomey, the dominion of the great BAD-JA-HUNG, the ""King of Kings,"" as he is styled by his loving lieges, and the seat of the slave trade. The kingdom of Dahomey boasts but one principal city, that of Abomey, a place of fifty thousand inhabitants, and the residence of the King. To this city but few white men have ever penetrated, the first of whom was Mr. LAMB, an Englishman, about seventy-five years ago, who has been followed by about half-a-dozen more of the same nation at different periods, and by one American. To this little corner of the earth the loving attention of England has of late been directed in a remarkable way. We know, of course, that enterprising John Bull has been thrusting his commercial proboscis into every part of the world for the last score of years, doing his best to smell out cotton, and especially putting it into Africa, but we cannot believe that any such motive controls his desire to look into the affairs of King BAD-JA-HUNG, because he knows well that only a very small quantity of that article is cultivated in his sable majesty's dominions, and that of a very bad quality, and Bull never yet did undertake to teach those whom he loves anything, rather preferring to find them producing what he wants ready to his hand. Therefore it cannot be cotton. That point being settled, we will take his own account for it, which is philanthropy. Looking around the world for some eligible spot whereon to bestow the overboiling of this virtue, John Bull spies the kingdom of his brother of Dahomey, the spot whereon is cultivated, not cotton, but a business in wool, or rather in human bones; and surely to crush out this business would be a sublime ambition, and would save the expense of a fleet upon that coast. To achieve this end we hear occasionally of the battering down of a coast factory or barracoon, and in the next breath of the sending an Envoy to BAD-JA-HUNG, in full toggery of gold lace, and loaded with presents, who stays a week or two with the King, hob-nobs and smokes the calumet, compliments his wives, and admires the five thousand Amazons of his body-guard; looks into his finances, counts up his profits in the Slave-trade, makes him an offer in shillings, pence, et cetera, to abandon it, which offer is invariably refused with a high order of diplomacy, and comes away brimming with wonderful stories of this really most wonderful nation of Africa. Of course it is not to be supposed that the labors of England will stop here, and, as a consequence, she is at this moment quietly looking around to see how to hammer a little common sense and morality into the thick skull of her brother of Dahomey; and this she is preparing to do by her agents upon the coast, who are looking into the best methods of attack and defence, for it will be no small job to invade a warlike people who keep a standing army of twelve thousand men and women, which can at any time be increased to forty thousand, and who are skilled in the use of the musket, and somewhat in the arts of war. It is therefore doubtful if England will attempt to land men enough on the seaboard to make an attack from the south; a plan that would require at least ten thousand troops. Her mode will rather be to send light draft steamers to the Lagos, a river to the eastward of Dahomey, and navigable one hundred miles from its mouth, to carry a couple of thousand or more men to Abe-ku-e-tah, and following out the traditional policy of England in wars with savages, enlist that people under her banners to destroy the Dahomiens, after which she can at her leisure destroy the Abe-ku-e-tahs, who are themselves slave-traders, and are governed by a King, placed on the throne by the Portuguese traders, whose barracoons lie principally to the eastward of the Lagos. This is the only mode by which England can with safety advance into Dahomey, and break up the Slave-trade in that part of Africa, or rather drive it to another locality; for so long as the demand exists, so long will there be found negro Kings to supply it, either upon the west or east coast, or from some part of the world where the human cargoes can be had.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England in Dahomey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England in Dahomey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5ee4a3f4-1c4b-5378-89ae-631d5f9a8331,957,nyt://article/5ee4a3f4-1c4b-5378-89ae-631d5f9a8331,

We earnestly hope that this call will be immediately and heartily responded to by the people, though it is not based on the immediate necessity for the service of these troops because of any special emergency. The first and indeed the only special reason set forth by the President for the new demand is, that ""the terms of service of part of the volunteer forces will expire during the coming year."" This of itself is reason enough. The lines of the rebellion are contracted, many of its strongholds have fallen, and its forces and power are greatly diminished from what they were; but it still controls a vast section, still possesses great armies, and is still tenacious of life and determined upon success. It would be a critical thing for the country to permit its armies to dwindle down at this time, and would certainly imperil all our gains. Even though ROSECRANS had defeated BRAGG at Chattanooga -- even though MEADE had met and discomfited LEE on the Rapidan -- even though Charleston, Savannah, Mobile and Wilmington were in our hands -- it would not be safe to permit our armies to lose their strength. We should still have heavy bodies of rebels posted through the rebel States, at points from the James River to the Mississippi, and even beyond it.

""The conditions,"" said he, ""which are contained in the treaty of Vienna, and by which Russia obtained the kingdom of Poland, have not been complied with, and without the conditions of the tenure, the title itself can hardly be upheld."" The British Foreign Secretary uttered many excellent things on the occasion alluded to, but this is not of them. There are in fact almost as many fallacies as words in that extract. A person not acquainted with modern European history, would be apt to infer, from Earl RUSSELL's statement, that the Grand Duchy of Warsaw was a fief which the munificence of the Congress of 1815 bestowed on the First ALEXANDER; and that the Treaty of Vienna was an instrument of extraordinary sanctity, for contemning which Russia should be held criminal. But whoever would draw any such inference from his Lordship's language would be far from the truth. Why, two hundred thousand Russian troops occupied the Duchy at the time, and Europe merely confirmed to the Czar what she had no power to withhold; while, as for the Treaty of Vienna, it is at this day of no more validity than an old almanac.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Phase of the Polish Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Phase of the Polish Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4c8c457-cd31-506e-baf3-7b01c927e2d6,991,nyt://article/c4c8c457-cd31-506e-baf3-7b01c927e2d6,

"Some additional particulars have been received with reference to the stoppage of the ship Hahneman, on her way to Bombay, by a Confederate privateer, already mentioned. On the 1st of July, in lat. 25&#176; 25&#8242; S., and lon. 32&#176; 48&#8242; W., while in company with two Dutch barks -- one named the Bulgerstyn, the other name unknown -- they perceived a large brig bearing down upon them with all sail. She passed the two Dutch ships, exchanged signals with them, and then shaped her course for the Hahneman, which was then on the port tack, and heading to S.S.W., with the wind S.E. The brig then fired a blank gun, and the British colors were immediately hoisted on the Hahneman, but she still kept on her course. The American now fired a shotted gun, which, fortunately, fell astern; afterwards, another shot dropped just ahead. The Hahneman then lay to, and the bark rapidly gained upon her, and while she was hauling up her mainsail, the privateer again fired -- this time, two shotted guns -- and one of which very nearly reached the Hahneman, falling in a line with the foremast, and the other passed over the poop, close by the Captain and Mate. The Hahneman was immediately brought to, and waited the approach of the unwelcome stranger. When she was within about 400 yards, a boat was lowered, manned by an officer and four men, heavily armed, three of whom boarded the Hahneman, and demanded her papers.

On the 1st of July, in lat. 25° 25′ S., and lon. 32° 48′ W., while in company with two Dutch barks -- one named the Bulgerstyn, the other name unknown -- they perceived a large brig bearing down upon them with all sail. She passed the two Dutch ships, exchanged signals with them, and then shaped her course for the Hahneman, which was then on the port tack, and heading to S.S.W., with the wind S.E. The brig then fired a blank gun, and the British colors were immediately hoisted on the Hahneman, but she still kept on her course. The American now fired a shotted gun, which, fortunately, fell astern; afterwards, another shot dropped just ahead. The Hahneman then lay to, and the bark rapidly gained upon her, and while she was hauling up her mainsail, the privateer again fired -- this time, two shotted guns -- and one of which very nearly reached the Hahneman, falling in a line with the foremast, and the other passed over the poop, close by the Captain and Mate. The Hahneman was immediately brought to, and waited the approach of the unwelcome stranger. When she was within about 400 yards, a boat was lowered, manned by an officer and four men, heavily armed, three of whom boarded the Hahneman, and demanded her papers. The officer was remonstrated with by the Captain as to his mode of procedure, who replied that if he was sure she was a Federal ship, they would have sunk her rather than let her escape. The ship's papers were strictly scrutinized, with which the officer expressed himself satisfied. The officer, upon inquiry, said his ship was the Tuscaloosa, Capt.

"The Galway Packet Company have been again unfortunate. The Adriatic was detained forty hours when only 800 miles from Galway, in consequence of ""a tender spot"" in her steam-pipe, which gave way. She left New-York on the 22d, and reached St. John's on the 25th, having had a pleasant passage so far. She brought 69 passengers, of whom 20 were first-class.

"This reverend gentleman, whose name is so widely familiar as that of an American politician and pulpit orator, preached on Sunday morning in Elgin-place Church -- Mr. BATCHELOR's. Though the notice given of his intention was very brief, the spacious edifice was densely crowded. He went through the preliminary service in a very devout and impressive manner, his reading being particularly distinguished by a clear enunciation and just emphasis that rendered the sound an effective aid to the comprehension of the sense.

"Last evening, at 5 o'clock, as the steamer Commonwealth, Capt. WILLIAMS, one of the Boston line of packets, was leaving her pier at the foot of Cortlandt-street, she came in collision with the English propeller Salidan, bound for Jamaica, and was considerably damaged. The Commonwealth, at the time of the accident, had just rounded her pier, and was stopped to permit the Flora, a Staten Island ferryboat, to pass, which was not done without the vessels striking each other.

"The United States steamer Idaho is being constructed by Mr. HENRY STEERS, at his yard in Greenpoint. Her chief characteristic is speed. Her general dimensions are as follows: Length, 300 feet; width, 42 feet, and depth of hold, 24 feet. Her capacity is about 3,200 tons burden. The model of the Idaho is narrow, running out, both forward and aft, very sharp, and not unlike that of the famous Niagara, built by the lamented GEORGE STEERS. In a vessel designed to carry freight, as a merchantman, the model is very full and wide, while the reverse is the case with the Idaho. The model is so faultlessly rounded that a straight-edge could not rest on any part of the external surface of the vessel. She is strongly put together as a bridge, and a truss-frame go through the upper deck down to the keelson, and extend the whole length of the vessel. When afloat, her sides will present a surface twelve feet above the waterline, giving her a rather long and rakish appearance. She will he very buoyant, and will certainly be an excellent seaboat. The faster she is propelled the higher will her bows be forced up from the water. The cabin and wardrooms will be fitted up according to the latest style. They will be more than usually roomy for a vessel of her class, owing, in a great measure, to the comparatively small space the engines occupy. The cabin is 30 feet long, 18 feet wide, and 6 1/2 feet high. The wardroom is 30 feet long, very spacious and nicely filled up. The ventilation of the vessel will be accomplished according to the best method -- by means of two blowers, driven by engines, with air-tubes communicating with the wardrooms and other parts of the vessel. The magazines are placed one forward and the other aft of the vessel. The gun-deck is 4 1/2 inches thick of yellow pine. The frames of the decks are white and live oak. There are three decks 6 1/2 feet between them -- the gun deck, the berth deck and the orlop deck. The battery is on the gun deck; the berth deck is occupied by the sailors, where hammocks are swung on each side of the whole length of the craft, sufficient to accommodate the full complement of men, which will be 300 souls. Under canvas alone, she could lake the palm over any other vessel of her class that floats on the ocean. She will carry 20,000 feet of canvas, and this will make her go in a good breeze 12 knots an hour. She will be bark rigged. The mainmast and foremast are 90 feet high, and the mizzenmast 80 feet high; the topmast and gallantmast are all in one. The fore and main yards are 85 feet. There will be no yards on the mizzenmast, being bark rigged. She will have the improved wire rigging. Her armament will be very heavy, consisting of 14 broadside puns, the ports being situated at regular intervals along the whole length of the vessel; their calibre is nine inches, PARROTT's design. She will also carry one 200-pounder gun forward and one aft. The engines fur this splendid vessel are being constructed at the Morgan Iron Works in this City, and will be completed in about 2 1/2 months. They are of peculiar construction, direct-acting and have a creator speed of piston than was ever thought could be obtained -- the piston traveling 11,000 feet a minute. An important objection among naval people for the construction of vessels in which almost everything is sacrificed for speed, is the fact that their engines being so powerful and large take up an immense amount of room in the ship. In the Idaho this objection is removed, as the engines take up less room than is usual in vessels of her class, and weigh only 450 tons. On the other hand, Government has ordered engines for the Wambanoga and another vessel whose chief characteristic will be speed, whose engines will weigh 1,200 tons. The cylinders of the Idaho will be four in number, each thirty-six inches in diameter, and eight feet stroke of piston. The dimensions of the cylinders of the iron-clad Puritan, will be 100 inches in diameter, and are indicative of the expected speed of that vessel. The Idaho it will be seen surpasses that amount. Another new feature is the situation of the propellers -- one on each side of the stern-post. Each propeller will be worked by a small and a large screw, for the reason that there is a light draft of water and it is necessary to have more surface than usual to develop the power.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/21/archives/naval-movements-the-us-steamer-idaho-speed-in-vesselsofwar-trial.html,,"The United States steamer Idaho is being constructed by Mr. HENRY STEERS, at his yard in Greenpoint.

Mr. JONES, the Ex-Minister to Bogota, was arrested and sent to Fort Lafayette, and now sues the Secretary of State for false imprisonment in having caused such arrest. And the motion was made on behalf of the defendant to remove the cause to the United States Circuit Court, under that act of Congress, on the ground that the alleged arrest and imprisonment was ""under authority derived by him from the President of the United States,"" thus bringing his case exactly within the language as well as the intent of the Act of Congress.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jones Against Seward.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Jones Against Seward.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/06ecf0bb-4f29-5e8b-af1f-f4a423260586,635,nyt://article/06ecf0bb-4f29-5e8b-af1f-f4a423260586,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/22/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- The revival of VERDI's opera of ""Macbeth"" last night must be recorded as the best success, so far, of Mr. MARETZER's season, Intrinsically there is no interest attached to any Haliar, version of SHAKESPEARE's plays and least of all to those that have been prepared for the operatic stage. A fine soliloquy has not yet been superseded by a grand scena; indeed, the mere touching on the original situations of the great dramatist is attended -- In the minds of the Anglo-Saxons -- with a certain sense of the ridiculous. For reasons such as these the Shakesperian repertoire of the opera has never been a favorite with the public of America or of England. ""Othello,"" ""Macbeth,"" ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""The Merry Wives of Windsor,"" are all works of undoubted merit, yet how rarely do we find them on our bills? In the selection of ""Macbeth"" as a subject, VERDI has been more fortunate than any of his predecessors. The characters in it are easily reduced to the required number for the musical stage, white the strength of the plot and the superb directness of the action can hardly be spoilt even by a librettist. The composer has seized his opportunity with avidity, and has accomplished a work of very great emotional interest and still greater musical merit. What situations are retained of the original work are manipulated with all the dramatic skill for which VERDI is remarkable, and are presented by the artists of Mr. MARETZEK's troupe with great gusto. We are disposed to agree with the manager that if the creations of the poet are ever to be interpreted in lyric form, it is probable that VERDI is the composer who will accomplish the task in the most powerful way. There are combinations in ""Macbeth"" and flashes of feeling that are really worthy of the theme. Greater praise can hardly be bestowed, but it is no exaggeration to say that the work contains some of the happiest ideas that have ever come from the prolific brain of the composer. There is a youthful freshness and vigor in many of the numbers that we shall look for in vain in more recent and better known works. Even in the treatment of the orchestra and chorus there is striking originality. The Witches' music throughout is singularly fitful and weird; whilst the instrumentation in the last act is almost exceptional in its suggestiveness and propriety.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/17da849a-de41-57e1-8deb-66b5239b3e1c,910,nyt://article/17da849a-de41-57e1-8deb-66b5239b3e1c,

He was confined there awaiting his trial on two charges of burglary. Since his escape he has concealed himself until a few nights ago. On Monday a store in Avenue D was broken open and robbed of about $500 worth of silk goods. The entrance was effected by forcing off one of the window shutters. The thieves were disturbed in their operation, and in making their escape they dropped a portion of their plunder on the street. Capt. MOUNT immediately instituted an investigation, and finally found a piece of figured silk and a cloak, which was stolen on Monday night, in the possession of a German woman to whom SCHMIDT was about to be married.

Everybody in the country remembers the feeling of horror that spread among the people in the Spring of 1861, in prospect of war; and no one outside of the country could conceive the feeling of exultant joy that would now spread over the land on the arrival of the day of peace.

The following Churches are represented at the fair, each having stands filed with the most tempting luxuries, both artistic, ornamental and useful: St. Peter's, St. Joseph's, St. Patrick's, St. James', St. Andrew's, the Nativity, the Transfiguration and the Holy Cross. The attendance during the last two clays has been very large, both day and evening, and the prospects are that this year's fair will be quite as successful as any of the previous ones. There is no place on Broadway where one can spend an evening more pleasantly than here, and certainly none more deserving of the liberal patronage of our citizens. No charitable association in the City accomplishes a greater amount of good during the year than the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

His Proclamation for Volunteers,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/22/archives/gov-seymours-proclamation-for-volunteers.html,His Proclamation for Volunteers,"We are heartily glad to see the indication which this Proclamation affords, that the Governor will in good faith cooperate in supplying the quota of this State, in response to the last call of the President. It is true that it would be hard -- in fact, in the present temper of the State toward him, almost morally impossible -- for him to do otherwise. The fact is now put beyond all question that it is politically ruinous for any State functionary to refuse or neglect to work with the Government in such objects. The elections of the year have demonstrated that completely. Gov. SEYMOUR would have been infatuated not to heed it. It is also true that some parts of his Proclamation are not free from a bad spirit. The old factious bent shows itself in the odious use of the word ""conscription,"" and the harsh terms connected with it. Whatever may be Gov. SEYMOUR's private opinions of the Enrollment bill, and however fitly he might express those opinions in his own personal capacity, it does not become him in such an official appeal as this, thus to obtrude them upon the public notice. It was wholly unnecessary, not at all dignified, and directly provocative of ill feeling. The National Enrollment act was passed by Congress and sanctioned by the President, as a wise, and just, and needful measure. The great majority of the people so believe it to have been; and that it may yet prove a very potent, if not decisive, instrumentality, in securing the final success of the war. Though Gov. SEYMOUR may honestly think otherwise, this is no reason for his ""injecting a stump speech"" against the Government measure into a proclamation, ostensibly intended to rally soldiers to the defence of the Government. It is neither good grace, nor good policy, to try to embitter and alienate the people in their relations to the President, and at the same time invoke them to respond to his appeal. The public spirit which stimulates volunteering is largely dependent on trust and faith, and yet these are the very qualities which the harsh language of Gov. SEYMOUR tends to break down.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gov. Seymour's Proclamation for Volunteers."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Gov.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/22/archives/from-europe.html,,"The news brought to this port yesterday by the steamship Scotia, two days later, contains one item of vast interest, which will give great satisfaction to the people of this country. The Government of Great Britain has at last come to the decision, dictated no less by its own interests than by the principles of common justice, of detaining the steam rams built at Liverpaol for the rebels. The formal act of seizure was performed on the 9th inst., at least in the case of one of the vessels, and report says that the ""broad arrow"" was on that data put upon both. A telegram from Constantinople states that the Sublime Porte has offered to purchase the rams, and Earl RUSSELL favors such a disposition of them. The rebel organ in London, the Index, asserts that the Jeff. Davis Government will in future grant no clearances to blockade runners, unless one-third of the outward cargo is taken on Government account. It is urged, moreover, by business men that this measure is not sufficient to remedy the abnormal price of foreign exchange in the Confederate States, and that the Government should take the purchase of supplies exclusively into its own hands, prohibiting the exportation of cotton on private account, except such as is pledged to holders of the Confederate loan. Rev. HENRY WARD BEECHER was publicly welcomed at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, on the 9th inst., by the Union and Emancipation Society. An opinion prevailed to some extent in France that the Archduke MAXIMILIAN had civilly refused to wear the Mexican Crown, by asking conditions of acceptance that will be difficult to satisfy. A sanguinary engagement is reported to have taken place between the Russians and Poles at Roczanow, but neither results nor particulars are given. The aspect of the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty grows more warlike. Earl RUSSELL had written a conciliatory note to the German Diet, proposing an arbitrament by Powers not concerned in the dispute, and saying that England could not look with indifference upon the military occupation of Holstein. The proposition, thus far, has not been heeded. The latest Liverpool commercial advices announced a buoyant Cotton market, at on advance of 1/4d.@1/2d. per pound.

Mr. BOOLE takes occasion to recommend the building of public markets on the Gansevoort and Lowber grounds.

The rumors about the King's sudden conversion to liberalism were all fictions. Despite the warnings he has received of his waning popularity, and of the consequences of persisting in his career of despotism, he has taken his stand by VON BISMARK, and indorsed all the unprincipled devices of that reckless statesman. It now appears that the dissolution of the last Diet was, in a great measure, the effect of terror. Both Monarch and Minister shrank from the ordeal of having to give an account to the Lower Chamber of their evil deeds, and so they decided to get rid of it. But what if the obnoxious and dreaded Deputies should be returned at the coming election? What if the popular party should present themselves in still greater force, and with still more determined aspect in the new Diet? To prevent this, every means, right or wrong, is being employed by the Court. A circular has been addressed to all the provincial Presidents by the Minister of the Interior, instructing them to warn all persons holding office under Government that they must give their unqualified support to the Crown candidates, if they would not incur the royal displeasure. For ""whoever has sworn as an official,"" adds the Minister, ""to be submissive, faithful, and obedient to the King, his most gracious sovereign, is not relieved from this oath, either as elector or elected.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Situation in Prussia Tactics of Parties.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Situation in Prussia Tactics of Parties.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2c3a6a0c-a4cc-5751-81d5-e8ffd38a2252,768,nyt://article/2c3a6a0c-a4cc-5751-81d5-e8ffd38a2252,

On the 30th of September last, the deceased, with his wife and two children, one aged 11 years and the other 4, were riding down town, on their return from Jones' Wood, in a Third-avenue car. A dispute arose between BURKE and the conductor in reference to the fare. BURKE insisted that he should be charged nothing for the ride of his youngest child; the conductor on the contrary was steadfast in his purpose to charge half fare for this child, in pursuance, as he said of the established rules of the Company. BURKE became very excited upon the subject, and in his zeal to defend his rights, he blocked up the platform so that passengers could not get on or off. The Conductor finally became impatient, and told BURKE he must either get off me car or take a seat inside, at the same time making a movement to compel him to do one or the other. BURKE then caught the Conductor by the beard and the coat collar, and in the struggle they both fell from the platform to the ground. BURKE had one of his legs fractured and he was otherwise so much injured, that he died at Bellvue Hospital, yesterday, from the effects. Coroner COLLIN held an inquest on the body, when the above facts were elicited. The jury rendered the following verdict. ""We find that deceased, MAURICE BURKE, came to his death from a fracture of the leg received while being removed from a Third-avenue car, and we exonerate the Conductor from all blame in the matter."" The number of the car upon which this accident occurred did not transpire.

"It can do possible harm to say that Gen. MEADE and Staff reached this place last night, and pitched tents on the Culpepper road, near where headquarter were located in the latter part of July last. This is the third time the headquarters of the army have been located in Warrenton within a year.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/26/archives/from-our-special-correspondent-speculationsthe-whereabouts-of-the.html,,"It can do possible harm to say that Gen. MEADE and Staff reached this place last night, and pitched tents on the Culpepper road, near where headquarter were located in the latter part of July last. This is the third time the headquarters of the army have been located in Warrenton within a year. Where the army is to go next I do not know, and would not tell if I did. Supplies for the army are now received via Gainsville, which involves a land carriage of ten miles, and the probabilities are that no advance will be made, at least, until such time as a more convenient point for receiving supplies can be hit upon. Whether that will be Culpepper -- which will involve the reconstruction of that portion of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, recently destroyed by the enemy -- or some other point, I do not believe has yet been decided upon. The opinion advanced by me in a letter during the early part of the recent movement, to the effect that LEE did not mean fight unless he could secure some great advantage of position, or find an opportunity to whip this army in detail, is now generally coincided with. That the enemy had some ulterior motive other than anything immediately connected with a northern campaign, is now also quite apparent. Whether or not it was from sheer desperation produced by the failing fortunes of the affairs of the so-called Southern Confederacy, which rendered apparent offensive operations necessary, and an effort to prevent an advance upon Richmond or a cover, as some profess to believe, for a further reinforcement of BRAGG, are among the questions to be answered in the future. The evidence is constantly accumulating that Richmond has been at the merey of this army for the last two months, and is so now. Why the opportunity has not been improved, is one of the mysteries that puzzles all those who have nothing else with which to occupy their attention, and who do not profess to know the line of policy adopted for this army. Whatever might have been LEE's object in advancing as far as Warrenton, he was completely foiled and out-generaled by MEADE, so far as the actual movements were concerned. Twice LEE was offered battle: once on Monday of last week, on the right bank of the Rappahannock; and again on the following Wednesday, at Manassas, where the Second corps was attacked. These offers of battle were both declined, and the bulk of LEE's army was employed in destroying the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. Aside from the attack on the Second corps, the attack upon Gen. BUFORD's command, near Brentsville, the following day, while guarding the rear of the army-train -- when quite a severe fight occurred, in which the division fully sustained its character as an efficient organization -- and the one on KILPATRICK's cavalry, at and near Buckland's Mills, no others of consequence have been made by the enemy.

These in turn seem to have fallen back, as the rebel force pressed forward seven or eight miles and attacked the cavalry under Gen. DIVEN, near Bealton Station.

It is quite natural that both the presses and leaders of the Opposition should feel very sensitive with respect to this exhibition of Copperheadism in our City. There were circumstances connected with it which the public -- especially the rural public -- will not easily forget. For months, the Copperhead Press of this City had been stigmatizing a National act of legislation, which was indispensable to the very preservation of the Government, as a proceeding of measureless tyranny. A provision which was designed to cut off all competition in purchasing substitutes, and which was thus, in fact, the protection of the poor man, was denounced as favoring the rich and crushing the laboring class. All the arts of sophistry and eloquence were exhausted to depict the draft as a means for relieving the upper classes of their burdens and throwing them on the lower. The Union and Republican leaders were pictured as rich and fortunate men, gorged with contracts, who were seeking to make the laborer and foreigner do the fighting while they carried off the profits. The orators in the ""Democratic"" meetings, with the skillful touch of unprincipled demagogues, played on this dangerous class-prejudice before their ignorant and passionate audiences. They were boldly called on ""to resist despotism;"" to submit no longer to this atrocious tyranny of wealth and office, and ""to strike for their liberties."" Prophecies were cunningly made in those base organs which are read in rum-shops, and at corner ""groceries,"" where ""the people"" congregate, that the execution of these odious acts of oppression by the rich would call forth a second French Revolution of blood and carnage. Exciting pictures were drawn of the revenge which the poor and honest laboring people might wreak, in return for these wrongs inflicted on them by the powerful. It was assumed that the lowest classes of New-York -- ""the people"" -- were all-powerful, and that any law attempted to be executed against their will would utterly fail; that no force in the Government could possibly control them. Bold and straightforward men like ANDREWS, and more cunning and dangerous men who go yet ""unwhipt of justice,"" thus for months before the draft, in bar-rooms, caucuses, political meetings and newspapers, busied themselves in doing the devil's work of firing the passions of ""the people"" against the better classes. And what was this ""people?""

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/27/archives/the-road-to-richmond.html,,"Two of our cotemporaries yesterday published articles aiming to show -- first that the route by the Peninsula is the only one by which we can ever hope to reach Richmond, and, secondly, that it is impossible the Administration should adopt this route, for the reason that it was the one chosen by the General of whom these journals have constituted themselves the especial champion -- MCCLELLAN. Now we were not aware that Gen. MCCLELLAN had taken out a patent for the Peninsular line of operations against Richmond, though we had supposed that the lamentable failure he made in his attempt to reach the rebel capital by this route, would not prove a very powerful temptation to infringe any right he may have to its exclusive possession. We rather fancy, however, that it will be found that the chief obstacle to our gaining Richmond by any of the half-a-dozen attempts we have made against it, by both the overland and the Peninsular lines, has been the rebel army that has obstructed our path, rather than anything in the path itself. If we could only discover a method of eliminating LEE's army we imagine ""On to Richmond"" would be an easy task. Until that is done there will be a very serious obstacle to our getting there by any route. On the face of the map there is certainly nothing in either the overland or the Peninsular line to Richmond that need much embarrass an advance. They are both good enough, and we do not know that there is much to choose between them. From the line of the Rappahannock, now held by our advance cavalry, the distance to Richmond is but sixty miles, with the advantage of a railroad and several rivers by which to supply an army -- a task which, put into comparison with ROSECRANS' great march from Murfreesboro to Chattanooga is but child's play. In the mere matter of the territorial march the Peninsular line is, undoubtedly, the shorter, but this route has the counterbalancing disadvantages which always attach to military operations dependent on a water-line for connection with the base of supplies. We take it that the question of an advance to Richmond is one which will be decided purely by military contingencies. If LEE ventures on the further subtraction of another corps from the army of Northern Virginia for reinforcement to the army fronting Chattanooga it will open to Gen. MEADE an opportunity which he will quickly seize.

It is always so when the company feels confident of success, and knows that it is directly contributing to it. Mme. MEDORI sang and acted with great dramatic power and skill. In a work like this there is scope for the varied abilities of this veritable prima donna. Her large voice is amply provided for by the composer, and there are opportunities for rolling it out in a highly impressive way. Mme. MEDORI was received with enthusiasm, and had to repeat her principal morceaux. Signor BELLINI was again in excellent voice. We have no recollection of ever having heard him to greater advantage. The entire performance was much above the average.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c3fcc8a4-ff57-59ec-b96e-adf047a7cd82,1145,nyt://article/c3fcc8a4-ff57-59ec-b96e-adf047a7cd82,

The following are the circumstances as testified to yesterday upon the inquest held by Coroner NAUMANN on the body of Mrs. S.: About a week since SCHMIDT loaned his revolver to a friend, and on Sunday last he went for it and took it home with him in the evening. Mr. HARK, the friend, had been threatened on Saturday night by some rowdies, and loaded the revolver, but having no occasion to use it, he left it in that condition. The latter was not at home when SCHMIDT called for it on Sunday, and a servant handed it to him. The husband took the pistol out of his pocket in his wife's room, and was about to hang it up, when it was by some means discharged. One ball entered the back of his wife, passed entirely through her body, and lodged in the groin just under the skin. From the effects of this wound she died soon after.

"-- The second lecture of Dr. LIEBER's course was delivered last evening at the Columbia College Law School, to a very large and fine body of students of law.

"Some of the Richmond papers are attempting to gloss over LEE's failure, in his last campaign to achieve the annihilation of the ""Yankee army,"" on the ground that he could not get a fight out of MEADE.

That the rebel commander, under certain favorable circumstances -- as for example if he had been able to plant his army on MEADE's communications and secure possession of the fortified heights of Centreville -- would have been willing to stand an attack, is not beyond the bounds of belief; but that, in the language of the Richmond Sentinel, ""Gen. LEE, after diligently pursuing battle, was unable to obtain it because his fugacious adversary was too fleet,"" is drawing the long bow to a length which even a Richmond rebel ought to be ashamed of. Gen. MEADE invited battle at every point along the line of march that admitted of battle. He sought it at Sperryville, at Warrenton, and at Bull Run.

Now that it is none we see that it was exactly the thing to do, and almost wonder that it never occurred before to the astute politicians of St. Petersburg. The resemblances between the United States and the Russian Empire have not only been remarked by every one who has thought on the present and probable future state of the world, but they have created a sympathy between the two Powers which is becoming stronger under the influence of calamity, disappointed ambition, and the rebukes of the civilized world. Both in their arrogance and petulance of a few years since and in their present tone of more limited pretensions the Americans and Russians have shown an accord which indicates the gravitation of the two Powers to a permanent alliance. In the palmy days when NICHOLAS affected to be the arbiter of the Old World, and the American Presidents were conquering provinces in the New, the constant theme of congratulation between the Republic and the Despotism was the decadence of all Powers but themselves, and the certainly that they would subject all the countries about them, one after the other, to their dominion. They both had enormous territory, and regions still more immense, which they could make their own when they would. They were both new Powers, unincumbered with the debts, the traditions and the inferior social organization of their older rivals. They had a manifest destiny, and were to fulfill the designs of Providence by plundering and subjugating all who were not strong enough to resist. And who should resist fifty years hence, when the populations of the two aggressive empires should have doubled and tripled in a fashion impossible to the crowded inhabitants of Western Europe? From these dreams Russia was roused by a war which showed how unable she was to face the Western Powers, which forced her to dismantle a fortress and cede a portion of her territory, and which, if it had continued another year, would certainly have deprived her of valuable provinces. The pride of the United States has still more lately met its fall. The disruption of the Republic, the proof that a large part of the people had ceased to care for the Union -- nay, had imbibed a strong hatred against the rest of their countrymen -- the gloomy prospect of lingering warfare, to be ended at the very best only by the extirpation of the Southeners and the ruin of their country, -- these things are weighing on the spirits of the Federal patriots, whose Fourth of July orations used once to paint such a transcendent future.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RUSSO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE.; From the London Times, Oct. 15.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE RUSSO-AMERICAN ALLIANCE.; From the London Times, Oct. 15.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7a07015-12f6-5cfa-9900-61e770d59752,997,nyt://article/b7a07015-12f6-5cfa-9900-61e770d59752,

The success of this enterprise is regarded by our Hebrow population as marking an epoch in the progress of Judaism in America and hence awakens their deepest interest. The edifice has been constructed under the auspices of the Hebrew Benevolent Society, into which the German Hebrew Benevolent Society was merged in 1859. Ground was broken in August, 1862, and on the 30th September, in that year, the corner-stone was laid with imposing ceremonies in the presence of Rabbi RAPHALL and the Jewish clergy, a large concourse of the Hebrews resident in this vicinity, and very many noted citizens of all denominations. The building is about finished, and within as well as without is one of the best appointed Asylums, and most beautiful structures in the country. Set back 125 feet from the avenue, it has a principal frontage of 120 feet on Seventy-seventh-street by 60 feet in depth and 90 in height to the top of the ornamental cupola. It consists within or cellars, basement, three stories and an attic. There are wings and projecting gables to the main building, the whole being in the Romanesque style of architecture, after the plans of H. FERNBACH the architect, the mason-work by Wm. LAMBEER, Jr., and the carpenter-work by HENNESSY & GIBSON. The cellars are built in the most substantial manner, of the best quarried bluestone, with hammered facings; the basement front is of Connecticut brown-stone, with rustic joints, and the remaining upper frontage of the best Philadelphia pressed brick, with brown-stone trimmings. The principal entrance, on Seventy-seventh-street, is reached by a handsome flight of brown-stone steps, with railings of the same material, and pedestals representing at the top the globe and bands, typical of charity spanning the earth. Over the doorway is an arched slab bearing the inscription, ""Hebrew Orphan Asylum;"" and in the centres of each of the projecting gables is a Mogen David, or David's shield, of double triangles, with the date ""1862"" on the main projection. The interior is arranged in vast halls for school-rooms, play-rooms, dormitories, hospital apartments, with a library, grand reception saloon, chapel, and the apartments of the superintendent and his family. The arrangements for the laundry, bakery, kitchen, bathing, heat, light and ventilation are of the most improved kind. The accommodation is ample for 200 orphans. The edifice and its fittings are now nearly complete, at a cost of about $50,000, and reflect great credit, not only upon the architect and contractors, but also upon the Building Committee -- Messrs. M. Rossman, Philip Frankenheimer, Samuel Hackes, Jacob Goldsmith, Henry Lewis, H.B. Herts, Jr., S.M. Cohen, M. Cooper, W.

The London Times, for instance, thus sketches the experiences of a gentleman, all connection with whom it disclaims: ""It seems that a Mr. Apel or Appel -- for the heroic syllables are ambiguously spelt -- has been accepted on the scene of the Polish insurrection as the correspondent of this journal, and has found himself not a little indebted to the importance with which this imaginary capacity invested him. Whoever he may be, or on whatever errand he may be bound, he did actually join one of the insurgent bands on Polish territory, and in that company he went into battle. We may hope that he conducted himself becomingly, but it appears that at the end of an engagement he was found, not metaphorically, but actually, 'up a tree.' In that proverbially awkward Position he was descried by a Cossack, who endeavored to bring him down by a bullet, but who missed his mark. Judiciously declining to risk a second shot, Mr. Appel descended from his eyrie, made terms with the Cossacks below, and surrendered at discretion. The predicament might have been an exceedingly unpleasant one but for his official reputation. It is painful to think what might have become of plain Mr. Appel, taken with arms in his hands, but 'our correspondent' was reserved for a different treatment. The distinguished captive was escorted with especial ceremony to the town of Lublin, and there brought into the presence of the Russian Commander, by whom, instead of being handed over to a file of soldiers, he was invited to dinner. That he should drink the health of the Emperor Alexander was, under such circumstances, perhaps, a pardonable proceeding, but we trust it is untrue that his politeness induced him to abuse and malign the cause of his late comrades.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN MISCELLANY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN MISCELLANY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-10-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6178f793-b5e1-5e4a-b172-41113c9f8596,1491,nyt://article/6178f793-b5e1-5e4a-b172-41113c9f8596,

The exercises were opened with an invocation by Rev. DR. MATTHEWS, who subsequently made a brief address. Then a historical sketch of the enterprise was read by the pastor, Rev. E.W. HITCHCOCK, who laid the stone, and the exercises were concluded with an address by Rev. A.R. THOMPSON, Rev. WM. TAYLOR and Rev. MR. STYKER also officiated. Among the articles placed in the corner stone were copies of the Orthodox religious publications of the day, a copy of the Fulton-st.

In an autograph letter written by Napoleon III, to the Archduke, after the memorable vote of the Mexican nobles, his Majesty dwelt upon the necessity of having the wish of the capital ratified by the Mexican nation. It is to this wish and far-seeing suggestion of NAPOLEON that the Archduke wished to openly allude, as may be seen on reading the reply of the Archduke, which reveals the perfect accord existing on this point between the Emperor of France and himself. After having given his reply to the allocution of M. GUTIERREZ DE ESTRADA, the Prince entered into a long and intimate conversation with the members of the deputation. I have very attentively followed (said his Imperial Highness) the monarchial movements now proceeding in your country. Through the official reports which the Emperor of France has been kind enough to communicate to me, and in the information contained in the English journals, I have been enabled to clearly observe its progress. Here is a map of Mexico, upon which are exactly marked the points which nave adhered to the vote of the nobles. You see that only comprises a fourth part of Mexico, although I am convinced that the French army will very soon deliver the other portion from the pressure put upon them, and that then (as you assure me) an immense majority will sanction the vote af the 12th of July. Inform me that the majority has really adhered to my election, and in less than twenty-four hours I shall be ready to depart. Consider me as a soldier determined to respond to the call of Providence; for I recognize in an infallible manner the finger of God in the mission which has just fallen to me. I must have the National will manifest itself in terms permitting no legitimate doubt upon the unanimity of my election. The deputation could not have been impressed in a greater degree than it was by the justice of this sound reasoning, and, respecting the elevated character of the Archduke's sentiments, unanimously declared that the Mexican people only desired for the present to obtain the acquiesence of his Imperial Highness.

The removal of a commanding General is strictly an executive act. We can seldom know the reason prompting it, and it would generally be neither wise nor politic that we should know it. At the same time, it is important that the conduct of those in authority should be such as to inspire public confidence that, in changing the command of an army, only the highest sense of duty prompts the action. Aside from the special reasons governing the removal of individual commanders, there is a general policy of the matter, and this should be large, discreet and well considered. It should not be hard to find a just mean between the wild policy of the rulers of revolutionary France, who (literally as well as metaphorically) cut off the head of a General the moment he was unsuccessful, and the Austrian inertia which kept hoary-headed imbecility and proved incapacity, systematically in command.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Removal of Generals.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Removal of Generals.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-10-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b85eb32e-f788-5361-9694-5bc36d1019e1,927,nyt://article/b85eb32e-f788-5361-9694-5bc36d1019e1,
