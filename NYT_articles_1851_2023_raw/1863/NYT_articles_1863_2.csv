POPE's campaign in Virginia in August last. The public interest in the facts of this campaign is still nearly as lively as ever, and we doubt not that this expose of its history by the General in command will be read universally. It was quite impossible either to get or give the facts about POPE's Virginia operations while in progress, as both the telegraph and the Press were then under the most rigid censorship, and almost everything that the War Department furnished for publication was unreliable, and had to be corrected in the light of subsequent revelations. Gen. POPE's report clears up many points that were then dark, and unravels many intricacies then beyond the skill of the sharpest. There are also in the report many facts which could not safely be published at the time, nor for some time after, such as the strength and location of various military columns, and the work assigned them to do.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""POPE'S VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""POPE'S VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73aebee9-ff48-5530-9750-3f7794288520,235,nyt://article/73aebee9-ff48-5530-9750-3f7794288520,

Virginia Extortion Prevention Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/03/archives/extortion-in-dixie.html,Virginia Extortion Prevention Bill,"- There is a bill, designated the ""Extortion Bill"" now before the Virginia Legislature, in session in Richmond, the object of which is to limit and define the profits of merchants, traders and dealers generally. The fifth section provides that all articles must be sold at prices not exceeding 200 per cent. over the prices of May. 1861; and one of the speakers, in an elaborate argument upon the bill, submitted a schedule showing the benefit which would be derived from the establishment of this rate, and how vastly present prices would be lessened. The same number of the Richmond paper which contains this debate, has an advertisement in an adjoining column, headed, ""No Extortion -- Superior black tea at $8 per pound."" This would seem to indicate the truth of the speaker's remarks, just quoted, that the enforcement of the provisions of the Extortion bill would vastly reduce prices. If eight dollars a pound for tea is the ""no extortion"" prices, how much must the extortioners charge? Probably double that, or a dollar an ounce. If the Extortion bill becomes law, however, and the price of tea be reduced to say three dollars a pound, and other imported articles in proportion, we fear that the motive which induces our English relatives to make such desperate efforts to run the blockade with their cargoes, will be taken away.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTORTION IN DIXIE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EXTORTION IN DIXIE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Virginia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23d6b67d-a67f-5434-b9a4-795238f5e4df,228,nyt://article/23d6b67d-a67f-5434-b9a4-795238f5e4df,

The Frequent Executions,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/03/archives/discipline-in-the-rebel-army.html,The Frequent Executions,"-- One would think, on looking over the newspapers from different sections of the Confederacy, that the rebel army would get considerably thinned out by the military executions that are continually taking place. Hardly a paper but contains in its local columns accounts of soldiers being shot to death -- generally for desertion. There seems to be no sensation over these executions, either among the people or in the newspapers. The facts are quietly chronicled in three or four lines of small type, as minor incidents of the day. The Richmond Dispatch of Saturday last, for example, says that, ""Another military execution took place yesterday at Camp Lee, near Richmond, the party being JOHN MULLIGAN, Fifth Virginia Cavalry, convicted of deserting;"" and it adds that ""MICHAEL KIERNANS and JAMES BRODERICK, of the Letcher Artillery, will be shot to death with musketry"" on Friday of this week for desertion, ""The spectacle,"" coolly adds the Dispatch, ""is for the sake of the example."" It is a dangerous thing to desert from the rebel army, as military law is there relentlessly enforced.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DISCIPLINE IN THE REBEL ARMY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DISCIPLINE IN THE REBEL ARMY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5696e145-5611-52d6-b223-01a7a21cde0c,179,nyt://article/5696e145-5611-52d6-b223-01a7a21cde0c,

"Last evening the Tweny-fifth Annual Ball of the Brooklyn Fire Department was given in the Academy of Music, as usual in aid of the Widows' and Orphans' Fund of the Fire Department. These annuals of the Department are always looked forward to with yearnings for the arrival of the evening announced as that on which the occasion will take place, and when the time arrives the occasion is enjoyed to the fullest by every fireman who can be there, and by all his family. It differs from the great majority of balls in its genuine sociality. Every one seems to attend with a determination to spend an agreeable evening; and as the proceeds from the sale of tickets ($5 each) all goes to the support of the poor and needy, benevolence, which beams out from the jolly faces of the exempts and past officials, and fills with a charming light the eyes of the ladies and children, wells up the heart of the mere spectator with joy and gladness. Prior to last evening, the trustees and managers had some unpleasant forebodings that the Annual this year would, as compared with others, be less successful. These fears were based on the fact that there is not in the City an organized body of men from which so many soldiers have volunteered for the war as the Fire Department. But their fears, though apparently well founded, were not realized -in fact, the attendance last evening was the largest and best that has ever been seen at an Animal. At 10 o'clock there was not less than two thousand present. The arrangements were perfect; the decoration calculated to attract and please both eyes and ears. At the rear of the stage Engine No. 22 and Hose No. 8 were placed -both splendid specimens of fire apparatus. Over them, and somewhat nearer the front, was, in letters of light, ""Voluntary Aid."" The front of the stage was ornamented by the appropriate coat of arms, hung from the drop roll, and descending about midway to the stage. The side of the stage and the front of the several circles were hung with American flags, and from every gas pendant there hung a tiny cage, containing a singing canary bird. The dancing music was furnished by the Brooklyn Band, and the promenade music by DODWOTH's, and both were excellent. The floor was covered with gay dancers, and every available seat in the building was filled with those, who though friendly to the object of the occasion, preferred being spectators to taking part in the more active festivities.

Besides this there was a law that the first born, (male,) both of man and beast, should be offered to the Lord, and in the former case the child was to be redeemed with a lamb, of the first year, and if the parents were too poor to bring a lamb, then they brought ""a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons,"" one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering, and the priest then made an atonement for the mother, and she was pronounced clean.

The speech of Senator MCDOUGALL, of California, on his Mexican resolutions, was highly unjustifiable. He accused France not only of a design of taking possession of the Mexican States, but of an intention of pushing her conquests further -- of going through Lower California and seizing California, and then of seizing Texas and the more Southern States, and gaining control of the Mississippi River. It is, perhaps, no more improper in Mr. MCDOUGALL to make such charges against France than it was for the French Emperor to make the charge against our Government of a desire to seize Mexico, and dominate the Antilles and South America.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/05/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"A flaming rebel account comes to us from Charleston, of an attach by two gunboats -- the Chicora and Palmetto State -- accompanied by three small steamers, upon our blockading fleet outside, in which -- if we may believe the story as told by the rebels -- two National gunboats were sunk, another crippled, and the whole blockading fleet dispersed. All this occurred on the 31st ult., about 4 o'clock in the morning. The rebel fleet was commanded by Commodore INGRAHAM, who was on board the Palmetto Slate. He attacked the Mercedita and sunk her, and all on board are supposed to have perished, with the exception of Capt. STELLWAGEN and a boat's crew. There is a vague report of another gunboat having been sunk, and a number set on fire; but it appears to have very little foundation. All this accomplished the rebel fleet returned to Charleston, and reported the entire blockading fleet destroyed or driven off, and a joint proclamation was issued by BEAUREGARD and INGRAHAM, as commanders respectively of the land and naval forces, declaring the blockade raised.

The deceased was a member of Lafayette Engine Company No. 19, and a brother of Detective SLOWEY, of Police Headquarters. At the time of the accident, he was standing on the corner of Pike-slip and South-street, with Mr. CHAMBERS, foreman of Hose Company No. 22. The latter observed that the chimney -- which was a very high one -- was trembling and tottering for a fall, and at once started across the street, at the same time shouting to the deceased to look out for himself, as there was imminent danger from the falling mass of bricks. The latter started after him, but whereabout half-way across the street, he was buried beneath the brick and mortar which composed the chimney, and almost instantly killed. Mr. CHAMBERS reached the opposite side of the street, just at the moment his friend was buried under the ruins. The jury -- which was composed mostly of firemen -- rendered a verdict of ""accidental death."" The deceased was a native of this State, about 35 years of age, and resided at No. 75 Rivington-street. He held the position of Superintendent of Lands and Places, to which office, he was appointed soon after the death of his predecessor in office, THOMAS BYRNES, who, it will be remembered, came to an untimely death in the First Ward a few weeks since. The deceased kept a public house in Centre-street and was well known among the politicians of this City.

Gen. Grant Before; Battle for the Mississippi,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/05/archives/the-battle-for-the-mississippi.html,Gen. Grant Before; Battle for the Mississippi,"Gen. GRANT, with nearly the entire Army of the Mississippi, is now opposite Vicksburgh, on the Louisiana shore. It is a vastly greater army than was engaged in the last attack on Vicksburgh. It comprises all the latter force, together with the much larger force that GRANT, in the closing days of the year, was marching down the Mississippi Central Railroad to attack Vicksburgh in the rear -- which movement, it is now known, was baulked by the cowardly surrender of Col. MURPHY at Holly Springs and the imbecility of Gen. DAVIES at Island No. Ten. The Richmond Whig puts the strength of GRANT's army at 80,000 men, accompanied by fourteen gunboats and over two hundred steamers and transports. It is quite likely that this estimate is not far from the truth. So far as appears from facts which have been telegraphed from Cairo, Gen. GRANT's plan of operations is to consist of a simultaneous land attack on the rebel works from above and below, while the gunboats may be able to render important aid both on the Mississippi and the Yazoo. The famous ""cut-off"" canal seems to be still progressing, and the water is reported running through it at a depth of from two to four feet. Even if the channel is not widened so as to turn the course of the Mississippi River, the canal may subserve the vital purpose of permitting our gunboats and transports to pass through, after the fashion in which Gen. POPE's canal higher up the same river enabled him to circumvent the rebels at Island No. Ten. The rebels have planted a battery on the left bank of the river which commands the lower end of the canal; but, on the other hand, a considerable Union force -- undoubtedly accompanied with artillery -- has crossed the bend, and is stationed about a dozen miles below Vicksburgh, on the opposite side of the river. We suppose, also, that our gunboats could run the gauntlet of this rebel battery -- a sort of action which has been frequently accomplished on the Western rivers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Battle for the Mississippi.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Battle for the Mississippi.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fba1f622-7e33-5e07-8dec-4394c00dd53b,817,nyt://article/fba1f622-7e33-5e07-8dec-4394c00dd53b,

Everywhere throughout the North we find supple demagogues echoing the popular sentiment with a vigor and boldness which, a year ago, would have consigned them to a dungeon; and even the fearless and consistent VALLANDIGHAM takes a step farther than he ever dared before, and unfurls the white flag in the very halls of the Yankee Congress.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PEACE MOVEMENT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PEACE MOVEMENT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Charleston Mercury', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1d6b51f5-9a44-54b8-ac88-c756829a4849,254,nyt://article/1d6b51f5-9a44-54b8-ac88-c756829a4849,

But we hope that the statement we get from Washington is not true, that the War Department has decided to add tobacco to the army ration, and that a resolution to that effect will soon be introduced into Congress. The effect of it will simply be to make a bad habit universal in the army. We have not heard that the soldiers asked or desired any such favor from the War Department. Doubtless some of them smoke, others chew, and not a few like snuff. A few cents a week will procure supplies for such, if they purchase themselves; but if the Government undertake the business if will cost at least a quarter of a dollar a week for each man; and this, with our present force in the field, will add nearly a million dollars a month to the already enormous expenses of our military establishment. We would not begrudge this or ten times as much, if it would benefit our army, or add to its efficiency, health or morale in any way. But it will not. It will be a foolish waste, without equivalent, and will tend only to the benefit of speculators.

It appears that on Wednesday afternoon, a Sergeant and four privates belonging to the provost-guard and quartered at West Hoboken, proceeded to Hudson City where they took into custody a young man named WM. KETCHUM, on a charge of being a deserter from the United States service. The accused protested against the arrest on the ground that he was not a deserter, did not belong to the service and never had with the exception of serving with the first three months volunteers, at the close of which he received an honorable discharge. The provost-guard paid no attention to KETCHUM's protestations but compelled him to accompany them to the camp. A friend of the prisoner, named PATRICK COLEMAN, went along with them, and upon arriving at the camp was questioned by Col. LEICHLERKOST, who caused him also to be detained on suspicion of being a deserter. The circumstances of the affair becoming known caused considerable excitement in Hudson City, and about twenty citizens started for the camp for the purpose of procuring, if possible, the release of the prisoners. Meantime Squire MARTIN being applied to, issued a warrant which was placed in the hands of Constable HANLEY. The latter accompanied by two citizens proceeded to the camp and arrested the Sergeant and one private, who were taken to the jail and locked up to await further action. Col. LEICHLERKOST at once released KETCHUM and COLEMAN, and it is said immediately took his departure, apparently fearing that he too might receive a summons from the Squire and a night's quarters at the county lock-up.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f5502d79-e36e-55c1-95b8-8510195d63a9,569,nyt://article/f5502d79-e36e-55c1-95b8-8510195d63a9,

"Whatever may  be the effect of the war upon the prosperity of the country at large, we are very glad to know that it has improved the condition of the poorer classes, especially in this City. There is much less suffering among them than usual.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/07/archives/the-poor-and-the-war.html,,"Whatever may be the effect of the war upon the prosperity of the country at large, we are very glad to know that it has improved the condition of the poorer classes, especially in this City. There is much less suffering among them than usual. The mild weather, which we have had thus far, has something to do with it, but other causes contribute to it also. A very large number of men now in the army from this City were persons who, when at home, earned very little or gave very little of what they did earn, toward the support of their families. But they now receive very good pay, have no chance to spend it for liquor, and as a matter of necessity send a large part of it to their families at home. Very many have thus fallen into good habits, and dropped bad ones, through their service. Others who were always industrious and thrifty continue to be so, and remit nearly all their earnings to their homes.

"-- There was a year, less ten days, between the first and second battles of Fort Donelson -- if the affair of last Tuesday may be called a battle. Last year we attacked the rebels and took the fort -- this year the rebels attacked the fort but did not take it. The investing force last February was twenty thousand, and the defensive force nearly as great. The assaulting force, on the 3d inst., was four or five thousand of the style of troops which the rebels call ""horse marines;"" and we believe our garrison consisted of two or three infantry regiments.

Last year we attacked the rebels and took the fort -- this year the rebels attacked the fort but did not take it. The investing force last February was twenty thousand, and the defensive force nearly as great. The assaulting force, on the 3d inst., was four or five thousand of the style of troops which the rebels call ""horse marines;"" and we believe our garrison consisted of two or three infantry regiments.

Believing the girl's statement, Dr. WELCH gave her the laudanum, which she took home and drank in the presence of several persons. The doctor who sold the narcotic was at once called, and administered antidotes which eventually had the desired effect. After being sufficiently recovered, she was taken before Justice DOWLING, and by him transferred to the care of the Commissioners of Charities and Correction.

A book upon geometry or any of what are termed the fixed sciences, is true forever; a play of SHAKESPEARE never grows old, and his delineations of character will be as apt for the last generation of men as they would have been for the first, had the plays then existed; the epics of the Homeridae and the philosophies of new and old schools have an abiding value, as food to the imaginative and speculative intellect; even old sermons, if they are good ones, have an eternal freshness, and, if orthodox, might be preached to a hundred generations of men and carry them all to Paradise. But with doctor's books it is different. For the reason that there are very few articles in the creed or philosophy of doctors that endure through a single generation, much less through successive centuries. The popular physiology of the ancients and of the mediaeval ages, when dissections were forbidden, is now ridiculous; pathology, up to the days of JOHN HUNTER, had no scientific existence at all; while our present therapeutics and chemistry are both products of the most modern research. And we need not go back centuries or generations to find the most fundamental changes in every department of practical and scientific medicine, and their collateral branches. The pathology of 1863 is not that of 1853; nay, in many important points, it is not that of 1860. What in physiology has not been elucidated within the last twenty years, or since the practice of vivisection, the use of the modern microscope, and the discovery of anaesthesia? As to therapeutics and the use of drugs, every decade produces such radical changes that a Dispensatory a few years old, or a doctor who does not perpetually increase his knowledge from current medical literature, is worthless.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; THE INSTITUTES OF MEDICINE.

Considering the present enormous prices of cotton goods in this country, this is not at all wonderful.

the Pope and his Patrons,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/08/archives/the-pope-and-his-patrons.html,the Pope and his Patrons,"Wonders never cease; and not the least astounding one of this thaumaturgic age is, that England has recently offered to take the Pope under her protection in event of his being obliged to leave Rome. The offer was made through Mr. ODO RUSSELL, British Charge at the Vatican, and, considering England's anti-papal prejudices, must be regarded as an extraordinary instance of liberality and condescension on her part. Whenever His Holiness is compelled or disposed to exchange his position as a sovereign prince for that of an exiled sovereign, England will be ready to accommodate him with a palace in the island of Malta, and to treat him with all due respect -- nay, she will even go so far as to place her Mediterranean fleet at his service to convey him thither. The Pope, it seems, has not the slightest intention of availing himself of England's generosity; but, nevertheless, as soon as M. DROUYN DE L'HUYS became aware of such a proposition having been made to PIO NONO by Mr. RUSSELL, he grew quite alarmed. This was evidently an attempt of perfide Albion to get inside of France with the Pontiff, and to put the ""Eldest Son of the Church"" at a discount with the heretic; and, accordingly, the French Minister, as in duty bound, set about countermining the British functionary, by informing the Papal Nuncio accredited to the Tuileries that France expected, should His Holiness be unfortunately impelled to quit Italy, that he would prefer her protection to that of England.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pope and His Patrons.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pope and His Patrons.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8a77fd9-1155-5ecf-9846-cafbdd38a8f4,1000,nyt://article/d8a77fd9-1155-5ecf-9846-cafbdd38a8f4,

Indeed, Government Boards have been recently directed to inquire into the defects of our new sloops-of-war. The leading official mistakes charged upon the Department are briefly these: The construction, not of one ship, but of an entire navy, in accordance with the ridiculous hypothesis, contrary to the whole successful practice of a century, that the expansion of steam in the usual way, is not economical; so arranging the valves of the naval engines against the specific protest of builders, that they cut their seats to a degree that will allow long runs and tolerable speed only by reconstruction; proportioning the reciprocating parts of the engines -- parts which for high speed and durability require extreme lightness -- about 250 per cent. heavier than those of successful outside examples, and the other parts, 75 to 100 per cent. heavier; depriving the ships of power adequate to catch any tolerable sailer, and by the means just named, hampering what power they have, introducing the most expensive and complex, but not the most effective details and accessories -- condensers, for instance -- especially where the patents are held inside the ""ring;"" failing to calculate within two hundred tons, the displacement of twenty-three gunboats, thus making them slow and of deep draft; unnecessarily placing the boilers and engines of these boats above the water-line and in short range; attempting to saddle upon the people the excessive cost of several iron-clads -- two-and-a-quarter millions apiece -- with a kind of armor which the best experimental and service ordnance smashes through with ease; delaying provision for predicted exigencies, until great damage was done and prestige gained by the enemy -- for instance, the construction of iron-clads and fast vessels; adhering to patented cast-iron shell guns competent only to low charges and velocities, for a kind of warfare which foreigners and rebels have prepared to engage in, only by the use of wrought-iron and steel guns, and high charges; and persistently refusing to adopt many of the promising improvements offered and urged by outside inventors and practitioners.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Government Engineering Whitewashing Documents Wanted.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Government Engineering Whitewashing Documents Wanted.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e5e902aa-4f22-5e2d-8863-12cb1000f30f,1274,nyt://article/e5e902aa-4f22-5e2d-8863-12cb1000f30f,

WARD & GOVE, keepers of the Union Stores, Brooklyn, have lately presented a bill of $11,191 for storage, cooperage, labor, &c., on nine cargoes of resin. United States Marshal MURRAY refused to pay the bill, and yesterday they applied to Judge BETTS to sanction the bill as rendered, but the Judge very properly refused the application. As a sample of the extortion practiced by this firm, the case of the schooner Alfred H. Partridge may be cited, when the bill presented to the Marshal for cooperage amounted to $307, while the amount paid the cooper for doing the work was $39 55. Marshal MURRAY has consulted some of the prominent merchants of the City with regard to the charges customary and proper in such cases, and he refuses to pay on behalf of the Government more than is usually paid by individuals. He has offered to Messrs. WARD & GOVE on their bill of $11,191 one-fifth of the amount claimed. It has long been a subject of complaint among captors of prizes that the expenses attending the storage and sale of prize property sent to this port are so exorbitant that nothing is left to be divided among the prize men. So notorious is this fact that Commanders of our blockading vessels refuse to send prizes to New-York if they can possibly avoid it, but prefer sending them to Boston or Philadelphia. There is no good reason why the expenses should be greater here than in other cities, and it is to be hoped that hereafter all extortions like the above will be exposed.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f12ddede-81dc-567a-81ee-72d429e222e0,723,nyt://article/f12ddede-81dc-567a-81ee-72d429e222e0,

It was crowded to the greatest capacity of the house, and with the three previous performances must have netted a very handsome profit to the impresario. Mr. GRAU's plan of operations, if it leads to no result in an art point of view, possesses, at least, the merit of being thoroughly safe to himself. Two or three nights of opera in a city so fond of the entertainment must be successful, although it does not at all follow that artistically the performances will be good. It would be difficult, except on the ground of necessity, to account for the success of the last week. With the exception of Friday night, when ""Don Giovanni"" was given, the performances outside of the more or less successful efforts of the vocal quartette were extremely mediocre. It could hardly be otherwise, for a long and steady season can alone support a respectable orchestra and chorus, and completeness rests on these auxiliaries. It is but just to Mr. GRAU to say that his intentions were somewhat more ambitious than heretofore, but they were frustrated by the accident of Signor BRIGNOLI's indisposition. With a vocal company of unusual strength, he had, but for this contretemps, the opportunity of making his management memorable. Reduced to the briefest proportions, the most that can be said of the season is that it was successful in a pecuniary point of view, and that the prime donne under his direction, distinguished themselves in their few interpretations -- especially Miss KELLOGG, who, as Lady Henriette in ""Martha,"" and Zerlina in ""Don Giovanni,"" gave evidence of improved style and lightsome appreciation of seriocomic character. In parting with Miss KELLOGG the public loses the best native prima donna the country has yet produced.

It is not merely British medical literature and medical discovery the[???] are epitomized, but the present number contains articles by French, German, Italian and American, as well as English doctors. We always like to take up a book that is well indexed, and has a good table of contents, as is the case with the Retrospect; but the Messrs. BRAITHWAITE furnish a distinct feature to this magazine which is equally valuable with either of these. We refer to the ""Synopsis,"" which, as is put forth in the headline, ""contains a short abstract of the most practical articles in the preceding page, showing at a glance the most important indications of treatment published within the half year."" Thus the body of the present issue consists of nearly 300 pages, while in the 20 pages of ""Synopsis"" at the close, the reader is furnished with the seed-kernel of each article in a few lines For example, to give the reader at once an instance of neat abbreviation and a valuable medical fact, we find on page 126 a short article on the treatment of earache, which in the synopsis is epitomized thus:",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERIODICALS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERIODICALS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7728273d-d1d2-5561-bc9b-b16673cf9945,974,nyt://article/7728273d-d1d2-5561-bc9b-b16673cf9945,

His ""lock umbrella stand,"" in itself an ornamental piece of furniture, has the advantage of giving the proprietor the same certainty of possession as if the handle were within his grasp. The moment the umbrella drops to its place in the rack, the handle is by a single movement grasped and held firmly in the clutch of a lock which nothing but the key specially manufactured for the particular depositary can loose. The key, which is practically a pawn-ticket for the article, is of less weight and no greater size than a nickle cent, and adds no perceptible weight to the vest pocket.

The Journal of Commerce, in the leading article of its Saturday's issue, came squarely up to the no-allegiance doctrine, so boldly set forth by MASON, of Virginia, during his best days in the Senate. Said MASON, ""I owe no allegiance to this Government -- none whatever; although Virginia is a constituent of this Government, and I am one of her representatives. I owe allegiance to Virginia, and to no one else. The old feudal idea of allegiance was the relation between the subject and sovereign -- between vassal and lord. I know of no sovereign except the State. I take it for granted that Connecticut is the Senator's sovereign, and that if he yields allegiance to this Government he is faithless."" The Journal now takes exactly the same ground -- the occasion being a staunch, high-toned, thoroughly patriotic article in the last Princeton Review, on ""The War,"" which was well calculated to disturb the nerves of the Peace Reactionists.

Good Conduct in Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/10/archives/the-blacks-in-battle.html,Good Conduct in Battle,"-- Col. HIGGINSON, of the First South Carolina Volunteers, furnishes an entertaining official report of the exploits of his black regiment in Florida. He seems to think it necessary to put his case strongly, and in rather exalted language, as well as in such a way as to convince the public that negroes will fight. On the expedition, his battalion was repeatedly under fire -- had rebel cavalry, infantry, and, says he, ""even artillery,"" arranged against them; yet in every instance came off with unblemished honor and undisputed triumph. His men made the most urgent appeals to him to be allowed to press the flying enemy. They exhibited the most fiery energy, beyond anything of which Col. HIGGINSON ever read, unless it was in the case of the French Zouaves. He even says that ""it would have been madness, to attempt with the bravest white troops what he successfully accomplished with black ones."" No wanton destruction was permitted, no personal outrage desired, during the expedition. The regiment, beside the victories which it achieved, and the large amount of valuable property which it secured, obtained a cannon and a flag, which the Colonel very properly asks permission, for the regiment to retain. The officers and men desire to remain permanently in Florida, and obtain supplies of lumber, iron, &c, for the Government. The Colonel puts forth a very good suggestion, to the effect that ""a chain of such posts would completely alter the whole aspect of the war in the seaboard Slave States, and would accomplish what no accumulation of Northern regiments can so easily effect."" This is the very use for negro soldiers suggested in the Proclamation of the President. We have no doubt that the whole State of Florida might easily be held for the Government in this way, by a dozen negro regiments.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BLACKS IN BATTLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BLACKS IN BATTLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96a9beaa-e8c2-5655-a4dc-dab170c4a4a6,322,nyt://article/96a9beaa-e8c2-5655-a4dc-dab170c4a4a6,

A resolution directing the Comptroller to stop the unauthorized ferry to Guttenberg from the foot of Spring-street, and to advertise to sell a ferry franchise from that point or its vicinity to the New-Jersey shore, upon the usual conditions, was laid over. A new ordinance to reimburse the relief fund, which will soon be exhausted, was presented by Mr. FARLEY, and laid over under the rule. It provides for an appropriation of $500,000.

The Paris correspondent of the London Times states that official instructions have been sent to the French Minister at Washington, suggesting that Commissioners be delegated by the North and the South, to meet on neutral ground, and to confer without hostilities being suspended. The Paris Pays publishes a somewhat similar report; also Le Nord. The London correspondent of the Manchester Guardian gives currency to a statement that the rebel Government has been doing a considerable business in England through the medium of cotton warrants -- these warrants being undertakings to deliver so much cotton at a fixed price, so many days after sight, at any Confederate port, after the recognition of the Confederacy. It is said also that the rebels have even addressed proposals to the British Government for some such provisionary transactions. From France, we learn that it has been found necessary to order 6,000 additional reinforcements to Mexico. It is announced that the Duke of Coburg has accepted the Throne of Greece on condition that the House of Bavaria renounces its rights. Other Continental news is not important.

It will be recollected that the homicide of Mr. BYRNES occurred in Greenwich-street, between Liberty and Cedar streets, early on the morning of the 29th of November last, a few days before the Charter election. The prisoner, it appears, was engaged in posting handbills for the opposition candidate to the Democracy, and, as is alleged, was attacked by BYRNES and his party, who attempted to interfere with his work. An altercation ensued, during which SULLIVAN discharged a pistol, the ball taking effect in the abdomen of BYRNES, who died from the wound at 5 P.M. the same day. The homicide gave rise to a good deal of excitement among the politicians of the First Ward at the time, and had an important bearing on the Aldermanic canvass then pending. The present trial seems to be attended with equal feeling, and the Court-room was crowded with First Ward politicians, and friends of the deceased and of the prisoner.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE HOMICIDE OF THOMAS BYRNES.; Trial of Dennis P.

The destruction of its trade and commerce, by the blocking of the Mississippi River, has long kept them out of work; and more than thirty thousand men, women and children, of all nations, (but mostly natives of the British isles,) have, since our occupation of the city, been supported by charity. Thousands of men who had joined the Confederate army left their wives and families behind them to starve; and though ""registered enemies"" of both sexes have been permitted to go within the rebel lines, very few of the residents have chosen to avail themselves of the opportunity. Gen. BUTLER mitigated the distress by putting the idle men to work on city improvements, at the city's expense; and also by levying contributions on the rich rebels, who were responsible for the unfortunate state of things. Gen. BANKS, by a recent order, announced his purpose to continue the policy of levying on property, but he has not yet carried the plan fully into effect, and has thought it prudent to stop entirely the public works. As a consequence, the distress is now nearly as great as ever, and thousands of miserable, helpless and unemployed creatures are wandering round the city, and besieging the offices of the Union authorities for aid.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Distress in New-Orleans.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Distress in New-Orleans.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8b1fe232-dc1d-50b8-ae57-d57fd9720a56,643,nyt://article/8b1fe232-dc1d-50b8-ae57-d57fd9720a56,

MERCIER, communication with the rebel authorities in Richmond. The Senatorial allegation against Mr. SEWARD was based upon a very unjust misconstruction of a passage in a dispatch of M. MERCIER to the French Government, which we published on the 6th inst. Why the Senate should have taken up the matter, and given it the shape of a direct charge, it is difficult, or perhaps not so difficult, to tell. But we should think the Secretary's reply would prevent a repetition of such shameful assaults in the future. Speaking evil falsely against authorities has attained such a fearful extent as nearly to break down the confidence of the country in every one of its rulers. Senators have been convicted of it twice, and each time in reference to the same functionary, within a few weeks.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/12/archives/the-deadrabbits-at-work-again-efforts-to-obtain-the-release-of-the.html,,"At an early hour on the morning of Jan. 16, 1859, there were committed, in the Sixth Ward of this City, two of those deliberate and unprovoked murders for which that portion of our city has for very many years been notorious. On the morning cited, a man named DECKER was shot twice in his own house in Elm street by ruffians outside; and almost at the same time a respectable citizen of Brooklyn, while passing homeward, on the other side of the street, was shot through the heart and lungs, and died immediately. The occurrence created considerable excitement at the time; and unusual efforts were made to bring to light all the circumstances connected with the murders. Full reports were published in the TIMES, of the proceedings from the morning of the murders until the perpetrators were sent to the State Prison. At the time it was considered a clearer case against the accused, than the vast majority of similar cases brought before the Court; and as there is now a strong effort making to influence Gov. SEYMOUR to pardon the convicted men and thereby set them loose again upon society, it may not be amiss to refresh our memories in relation to the case and the characters of those convicted of the offences as they were developed during the trial. Both murders were committed soon after midnight of the 15th of January. At that time JOHN GLASS, an exconstable of the Sixth Ward, and several others, rang the door-bell of No. 21 Elm-street, a reputed house of ill-fame, kept by WILHELM DECKER, a German, who refused them admittance. They then forced their way in, rushed up stairs, and commenced smashing mirrors, chairs, and whatever else in the way of furniture they could lay their hands on. Mr. DECKER hurried after them to protect his property. Seeing him, one of the party of invaders immediately extinguished the light in the hall, and all rushed into the street, leaving the hall-door open. DECKER proceeded to close it, when two shots were fired in quick succession. Both balls passed through the door, and struck DECKER -- one taking effect just behind his left ear, penetrating the skull, and lodging there. The other was imbedded in the muscles of the chest, having first entered the back on the left side, and described an erratic course in a forward and upward direction. DECKER fell helpless, and a few days afterward died of the wounds thus received. When the two pistol shots were fired, Mr. RICHARD OWENS, a master rigger and stevedore, then doing an extensive business in New-York, and residing in Brooklyn, to which latter place he was proceeding, was passing on the other side of the street at the time. Hearing the cries of DECKER, he halted to learn what was the matter, and was almost immediately shot through the heart and lungs, falling dead upon the street. JOHN GLASS and a man named JAMES HIGGINS were arrested very soon afterwards and locked up in the Sixth Ward Station-house. WILLIAM MYERS, a step-son of DECKER, positively identified JOHN GLASS as the person who fired the two shots at the door from the street. He was standing on the opposite side of the street at the time, and knew GLASS from having seen him often before at his father's house. At the same time he saw a man cross the street, (Mr. OWENS,) and fearing that there would be more shooting he ran up the street, but had hardly turned around when a third shot was fired, though he did not see who fired it -- the shot which killed Mr. OWENS. DECKER subsequently identified the prisoners as of the party who broke into his house. Additional testimony implicating JAMES GLASS, a brother of JOHN, and JAMES LOFTUS, then a constable. LOFEUS was arrested as soon as implicated, but JAMES GLASS escaped the police for awhile, but was finally captured. It was given in evidence that soon after the murders, JAMES GLASS handed a pistol quietly to JOHN QUINLAN, who put it in his pocket, and kept it until Capt. DOWLING, of the Police, obtained it from him. It was a six-barreled revolver, with three of the chambers loaded and three empty. After a full hearing the Coroner's jury, investigating the causes of the death of RICHARD OWENS, rendered a verdict to the effect that he came to his death by pistol-shot wound at the hands of JOHN GLASS; and that GLASS was aided and abetted by JAMES HIGGINS, JAMES LOFTUS, JAMES GLASS and JOHN QUINLAN. The cases were tried in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, and during the trials the Court-room was densely packed with the friends of the accused and members of rival associations in the same Ward. The influence of the accused, political and otherwise, secured them excellent counsel, and everything was done to insure an acquittal which legal skill could devise. But with all, JOHN GLASS and JAMES HIGGINS were convicted, and on the 7th of May, 1859, were sentenced to the State Prison, each for the term of twenty years, and on the 16th of June following JAMES GLASS was sentenced by the same Court to the State Prison for life. JOHN GLASS was one of the constables of the Sixth Ward, as we have stated, for the year ending December, 1858, and for a long time had the reputation of being a hardened and desperate character. Previous to the killing of DECKER and OWENS, GLASS had been arrested often for assaults. He was a member of Engine Co. No. 21, but had been expelled by the Company some months before the time of the murders. JAMES GLASS, his brother, kept a drinking saloon at No. 19 Elm-street. JAMES HIGGINS had also established a reputation for recklessness and disregard of human life. He had not followed any legitimate calling for several years prior to his conviction. These are the men the new Governor is now asked to pardon, and it is thought by their friends that, with the influence they can bring to bear upon him, they have some chance of success for their petition, which is said to have been signed by several yards of names. Nearly every working Democrat is aware there is, and has been for years, rival factions in the Sixth Ward, the more prominent being known as the ""Dead Rabbits,"" and the other as the friends and adherents of Mr. BRENNAN. It is the ""Dead Rabbits,"" as alleged, who are now exerting themselves to secure the release of the three caged members of their gang; and it is said that they have secured the names of quite a number of persons to their petition -- names which will be read with interest, in such a connection, by the people, if they can be obtained from the original document. It has been suggested that before granting the prayer of the petition, it might be well for the Governor to consult with Mr. WATERBURY, now his Advocate-General, then prosecuting Attorney, and Justice DOWLING, then Captain of Police -- both of whom are familiar with the case and the character of the men convicted.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DEAD-RABBITS AT WORK AGAIN.; Efforts to Obtain the Release of the Brothers Glass and James Higgins.

His deprival of rank was in consequence of his having, as was alleged, fought the battle on James Island, near Charleston, in June last, contrary to orders, and at the great disadvantage of assailing the enemy in an impregnable position. Against these representations, Gen. BENHAM has strenuously remonstrated, declaring that the movement was within the line of his orders, and was undertaken upon the fullest information that the enemy's position was entirely assailable; and these assertions have been sustained by his colleagues and by the Colonels of the regiments under his command.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RESTORATION OF AN OFFICER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RESTORATION OF AN OFFICER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5879fe83-4d67-5a8b-a9b7-6ba67d77ed2e,194,nyt://article/5879fe83-4d67-5a8b-a9b7-6ba67d77ed2e,

"Emperor, the, new proffered Mediation in United States",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/12/archives/the-french-emperors-new-proposition.html,"Emperor, the, new proffered Mediation in United States","It is extraordinary that a man of the practical sagacity of the French Emperor, and with a personal knowledge like his of the character of the American people, derived from a prolonged sojourn in our midst, should cling to the idea that he can be of some service in promoting peace between our Government and those in rebellion against it. There never was a completer hallucination. If one-third of France were in revolt against the government of NAPOLEON III., or one-third of England against the government of Queen VICTORIA, most assuredly neither of them would listen for an instant to any proffer by the Government of the United States of friendly offices, calculated to bring about an arrangement between the ""belligerent"" parties. Either of them would repel it, if not as an indignity, at least as an impertinence. But our case is immeasurably stronger than that. The question with us is not simply a question as to the national head, but as to the national existence. It is not simply whether this Republic shall be presided over by ABRAHAM LINCOLN, whose authority, to say the least, is quite as rightful as that of NAPOLEON the Emperor or VICTORIA the Queen, but far beyond that -- it is whether the Republic itself shall exist. It is the same question as would arise in France or in England, were it attempted to detach a third part of their territory, and form it into an independent nation. Their present rulers might be deposed by revolution, as some of their past ones have been, without in anywise affecting the national life. This sort of revolutionary work is not to be compared in audacity or fatality with that other which would cut the nation in two. But if the European sovereigns would not at all abide our coming between them and revolutionists of the first kind, how can they imagine that we will abide their coming between us and revolutionists of the second? If they would never permit their dynastic lives to be put into negotiation, what sort of human beings must they take us to be in fancying that we can be made willing to let our very national life itself be put into negotiation?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The French Emperor's New Proposition."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The French Emperor's New Proposition."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed6a05d3-401a-5e2f-b94c-f386b6f37c1c,1179,nyt://article/ed6a05d3-401a-5e2f-b94c-f386b6f37c1c,
Legislature's Mission to Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/12/archives/how-did-the-rebels-get-the-news.html,Legislature's Mission to Richmond,"-- It seems that the rebels not only have preliminary knowledge of all military movements in the North, but of all political schemes. A fortnight ago there was quite a little flurry in Richmond and in the Confederate Congress over the intelligence that Commissioners from several Northern Legislatures had arrived there to treat with the rebels. No proposition of this kind had yet been made in any Northern Legislature, and the Northern public had no knowledge that any such plan had been projected. Yet it seems the rebel news was only a short time in advance of the fact, or at least the suggestion of it.

His Reply to French Offer of Mediation,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/14/archives/from-europe.html,His Reply to French Offer of Mediation,"The steamship Etna arrived at this port yesterday forenoon, with advices from Europe four days later. She left Liverpool on the 28th, and Queenstown on the 29th ult. The most striking news by this arrival relates to an insurrection in Poland, which assumed quite formidable proportions in some quarters, but which, at last advices, had apparently been quelled by the military. It broke out in the provinces around Warsaw, in consequence, as was supposed, of the conscription which had recently taken place. Troops were attacked at various points, and numbers of them were killed, some of them being strangled in their beds. Railroads were also torn up, and telegraphic communication interrupted, but all this had been again regulated. The rumors in regard to the new mediation scheme of the French Emperor continued to circulate. The Nord, of the 27th, says that M. DROUYNDE LHUYS had addressed a note to the French Ministers at St. Petersburgh, London, Vienna and Berlin, instructing them to sound those courts upon the fitness, not of a mediation, but of simple counsels which might be given to the belligerent parties at Washington and Richmond, advising them to name Commissioners charged to examine, with or without an armistice, upon what basis an arrangement might be made to put an end to the war. It was generally thought by the English journals that the new scheme would prove unacceptable to the United States Government. The Bank of England had advanced its minimum rate of discount from four to five per cent., which movement caused a depression in the Liverpool cotton and other markets. Consols were quoted at 92 1/8@92 1/4 for money.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f266516f-d443-556e-b434-a7cb4433bab9,274,nyt://article/f266516f-d443-556e-b434-a7cb4433bab9,

A fishing smack had been seized on Lake Pontchartrain, having on board a large quantity of medicines for the rebels, and a number of letters from persons in New-Orleans to persons prominent in the rebel Government.

Is it an earthquake that is rumbling? or is the foundation on which the fabric of Government rests turning into quicksand? No matter; some folks have got an idea that their rights are in danger unless the Government is thoroughly shaken into a sense of its weakness, or unless it feels the very ground on which it has hitherto firmly stood sinking from beneath its feet, and calls in despair for help upon the unshakable dominions and powers established at Albany and Trenton, and humbly begs to be propped up again on any conditions. Let the earth shake, then, so only this result be produced. Let us go to pieces, that we may be great and free -- each piece for itself.

The King's Policy and the Chambers,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/15/archives/the-prussian-monarch-and-his-policy.html,The King's Policy and the Chambers,"The King of Prussia and the Prussian Chambers are again face to face, and everything indicates that the strife of the last session will be renewed with ten-fold bitterness in this. A King who has once wielded the sceptre of despotism, can seldom brook to descend to the condition of a Constitutional Monarch. Rather than do so, the second of the STUARTS died on the scaffold, and the last of them forfeited the triple crown of the Isles, and the present representative of the House of Brandenburgh seems to be as obstinate and as determined to brave the worst, as either of those ill-fated personages. Both the letter and the spirit of the Prussian law are against him, and yet he persists in his infatuated course. During the recess, his principal employment was invoking laudatory addresses from the Reactionary and Absolutist party, or laboring to stifle the national purpose, and to silence all expression of popular sentiment. One instance of the regal contempt for every show of constitutionalism is now much talked of in Prussia. It is customary with the municipality of Berlin to present an Address of Congratulation to the King, on New-Year's day. But as the old year waned, WILLIAM became uneasy. Aware of the liberal proclivities of that body, and not wanting to hear unpleasant truths from them, he ordered Count EULENBURG, his Minister of the Interior, to intimate to the President of the Corporation that if a draft of the contemplated address was not forwarded for his perusal, the address would not be received. Instead of the required draft, however, the Count got the address itself, coupled with the request that he would transmit it to his master. Now, reluctant as the Minister felt to discharge this mission, he nevertheless did not like to assume the responsibility of declining it, and so the obnoxious address was presented to his serene Majesty, who, having failed to awe the Berliners into courtliness, found himself obliged to entertain and answer the unwelcome document. But, though the general tenor of the address was laudatory, the temper of the King was sorely tried by the admonitions of these audacious municipals. They warned him to ""eschew the path which ends in revolution, and to tread in that which leads to reconciliation and peace."" This was, in effect, a formal censure of the past conduct of the King. WILLIAM, however, did not throw the address into the fire after reading it, but in his reply he expressed ""his determination to persist in carrying out those measures which he deemed essential to the welfare of the State, in despite of the fact that he was misunderstood by the Nation."" This explicit declaration on his part, leaves no room for doubt as to his future policy, no ground for hoping that he will walk in the way of ""reconciliation and peace."" He has evidently made up his mind to enter into no compromise with the representatives of the people. He will augment his army and levy taxes to support it, in defiance of the Lower Chamber, and by virtue of his prerogative, at a time when even FRANCIS JOSEPH has been giving proof of his respect for constitutional government, by suffering the Reichsrath to cut down the ministerial estimates, and by reducing, at their suggestion, the military force of his empire.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Prussian Monarch and His Policy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Prussian Monarch and His Policy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3aeecd6f-af73-562b-bb9c-6ed056c6b8a0,951,nyt://article/3aeecd6f-af73-562b-bb9c-6ed056c6b8a0,

The facts of the case, as detailed upon the inquest, are truly shocking, and almost too inhuman to relate. It appears that CROSBY and his wife had for several weeks past been residing together at No. 1 Monroe-street. He was much addicted to drink, and whenever intoxicated he would beat his wife in a most unmerciful manner, without provocation. On Monday night last, he came home beastly drunk, and soon after entering the house he caught his wife by her hair, and by this means dragged her several times across the floor of the room. Her hair was torn out by the roots, and large tufts of it were found on the floor twenty-four hours afterward by the Police. In addition to this, it seems that without any reasonable provocation, he at the same time beat his wife with a chair upon her head and body, until the chair was so badly broken that he could no longer use it upon her. After exhausting this means of warfare upon his helpless wife, he threw her down and stamped upon her head, neck and breast with his cowhide boots, until she could not see, speak or move from the floor.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; HORRIBLE BRUTALITY OF A HUSBAND.

This is more of a concession than most of his coadjutors in the Democratic ranks would make. It admits to the full that which the friends of the Proclamation claim, viz.: that a General commanding an army has the right to declare all the slaves within his reach free. Not of course that they will be so in fact until his military power can be brought to bear upon the slaves and their masters, but that when it is brought to bear the relation of Slavery is destroyed. It is wonderful that any one should really argue -- as so many have -- that this proceeding is unlawful. Slavery is a state of suppressed war -- and that statement alone is sufficient to show that a General who is making war has the right to deliver from that condition those who are forcibly kept in it by those upon whom he is making war. The deliverance of a conquered people has always been a powerful weapon with those who fought with their conquerors.

GILBERT, thought it prudent not to hazard a collision. Col.

He acted for several years in the capacity of clerk in the store of an elder brother who then lived in South Carolina; but the climate did not agree with his health, and at the age of 21 years he emigrated to Cincinnati, then almost a frontier settlement, where he fitted himself for the bar under the instructions of Jacob Bennet, at that time universally acknowledged to be one of the ablest lawyers in the northwestern territory. Convinced that Cincinnati would ultimately become one of the chief commercial centres of the West, he invested all his scanty savings in land, and after 25 years, spent in the practice of his profession, retired, that he might give his entire time to the management of his property, which had by that time become quite extensive. Mr. Longworth's attention was turned to the cultivation of the vine at a very early period. As long ago as 1828 he laid the foundation of his extensive vineyards in the vicinity of Cincinnati, which now cover upward of 200 acres. The wine manufactured there has attained quite a wide celebrity. In the City of Cincinnati, also, Mr. Longworth had a wine-house where he received the raw juice from the vine-dre[???]er and converted it into wine. Mr. Longworth had an extensive reputation as a general horticulturist. His experiments on the sexual character of the strawberry were so successful as to give his name to one of the best seedlings.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/da6fc41d-52c8-5f47-a214-bc9ff2db2972,492,nyt://article/da6fc41d-52c8-5f47-a214-bc9ff2db2972,

The horses are represented as moving at speed, and Lady Palmer -- a beautiful, thoroughbred animal -- being placed on the offside, gives the picture a very attractive appearance. To use a horseman's phrase, she looks as if she could trot all day. Mr. BONNER, it is well known, keeps these splendid horses for his own use, and never, under any circumstances, allows them to be used for racing purposes. He has succeeded in establishing the fact that a private gentleman can own the best horses, without being induced to bet on them.

"We have advices from Europe to the 1st inst., one week later, by the arrival at this port, yesterday, of the steamship Asia, from Liverpool. The news is important. The new scheme of the French Emperor, for bringing the North and the South together in conference on neutral ground, had been promulgated, and the general impression was that it would prove unacceptable both to the North and South. The Paris correspondent of the London Times conjectures that the proposal is meant as merely preliminary to a more important step on the part of the Emperor. A great emancipation meeting had been held at Exeter Hall, London, which overflowed into another hall, and finally into an open air meeting. Resolutions were adopted approving President LINCOLN's Emancipation Proclamation, and in their general spirit entirely in favor of the North. There was a small and ineffectual element of opposition, at the head of which was an individual believed by our correspondent to be the Rebel Commissioner MASON, though a different name appeared in the papers next morning. The accounts regarding the insurrection in Poland are contradictory. The telegrams received in Liverpool on the day the Asia sailed state that the insurgents had been overcome at all points, and that order had been reestablished, but the very latest news received at Queenstown conveys an opposite impression. The better classes of the Poles were said to be joining the insurgents. The Liverpool Cotton market had been very dull under the influence of the advance of the rate of discount by the Bank of England, but had rallied slightly at last accounts.

"A letter from Warsaw of the 22d inst. states that the Cossacks are everywhere hunting the young men who are escaping from Warsaw to join the insurgents. The Government in the meantime are taking all imaginable precautions against the spread of the insurrection. The Abbe GOHAN preached a sermon in the Cathedral on the previous Sunday, in which he blamed the National movement. A woman exclaimed in a loud voice, ""Oh Lord God!

Here are apostates who explain your laws falsely by attacking our love of country and by endeavoring to destroy the courage of the nation. Lord have pity on our sufferings!"" The preacher, amazed at this interruption, grew quite pale, and was unable for some time to continue his discourse.

Similar scenes occurred in other churches, which fully prove the enthusiasm, or rather fanaticism, which prevails among the population of Poland. The conscripts were crowded into the citadel, and it is asserted that they had no food for twenty-four hours; that strong liquor was then distributed among them, which rendered some of them nearly frantic, and which the official journal represented to the public as a proof of the happiness thus experienced at being enrolled in the Russian army. The crowds of young men who assembled round the Serok have dispersed in consequence of not being able to provide themselves with arms. Another gathering took place in the forest of Kampinosy. Though surrounded by Russian troops, they succeeded in crossing the Vistula, but great anxiety is felt for their future safety. The writer of the letter adds that the parties who had constantly urged the population to desperate measures have lost their confidence, and that they are to be replaced by a Committee of men of more moderate principles, who will act according to more matured plans. It is further said that the existing Committee, wishing to maintain its influence, had determined on adopting the desperate resolution of calling the people to arms throughout the entire kingdom.

FORBES, of this City, for the China trade, went on her Engineer's trial trip on Wednesday last. The ship was built by HENRY STEERS, on one of those exquisite models which have made his family famous; and the engine was reconstructed from one of the large Lake Erie engines by Messrs. DICKERSON & SICKELS, of this City, at the Morgan Iron Works. The ship is 285 feet long, 38 feet wide, and 22 feet deep; and with a load of 700 tons when she left, drew between twelve and thirteen feet of water. The engine is an 81-inch, 12 feet stroke beam engine, of the ordinary construction, except so far as the engineers have altered it in reconstruction; which alterations consisted in substituting a new cylinder with a steam-jacket for the old one without it, in replacing the fixed Stevens cut-off and ordinary exhaust valve gear, with the Sickel's cut-off and exhaust gear as recently improved by Mr. DICKERSON, and in giving a new sort of waterwheel, instead of the old-fashioned one. The decalarator of Mr. LIGHTHALL was also added to the condensing apparatus of the ship, whereof fresh water is given to the boilers; and the boilers are known as Smith's boilers, but are very small for the size of the engine -- made so upon the expectation that the economy of fuel which would result from the improvements on the engine, would compensate for the loss of boiler power and the want of coal consumption.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Use of Steam.; THE TRIAL TRIP OF THE FOH KIEN INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN EXPANSION THE NAVY DEPARTMENT REFUSE TO LOOK.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Use of Steam.; THE TRIAL TRIP OF THE FOH KIEN INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN EXPANSION THE NAVY DEPARTMENT REFUSE TO LOOK.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19513202-6b95-550f-8ef0-a64e0c5b1fcc,1715,nyt://article/19513202-6b95-550f-8ef0-a64e0c5b1fcc,

They reported themselves as escaped Southern conscripts, and gave their names as J. MUNY and THOMAS PRATT. They stated that they formerly lived near Dunkirk in this State, and went South a short time before the rebellion. About two months ago they took up their abode at Montgomery, Ala., and soon after were enrolled in the Southern militia. They were too discreet to exhibit any symptoms of dissatisfaction, but entered the service apparently with the purpose of doing what they could to advance the interests of the cause. Having thus warded off all suspicion, their next step was to procure leaves of absence for twelve hours, which they succeeded in obtaining. The brief time which they had to make preparations for escape was not idly squandered. They immediately went to a friend in the neighborhood who supplied them with two horses and equipments. One of the horses they subsequently bartered for a buggy and harness, which with the remaining horse constituted their means of traveling. They struck off in the direction of Pensacola, and being familiar with the road, were able to make rapid progress. After driving sixty miles without rest, they fortunately discovered a Union family in Florida, who received them kindly, and furnished food for themselves and horse. The acceptance of this hospitality, however, came very near losing them the liberty which they were so earnest to obtain, for no sooner had the time for their return to camp expired and it had become known they had left town, than a squad of cavalry was instantly dispatched in pursuit. The cavalry came up to the house of the Union family just as the young men were about to continue their journey. The Sergeant in command inquired of the owner concerning the whereabouts of the refugees, and was told that they had but a minute previous gone to the barn to harness their horses. While this conversation was going on, the young men were secreted in an adjoining apartment, and as soon as the pursuing party had adjourned to the barn to make a search, they sprang upon horses furnished them by their protector, and sped toward our lines. The cavalry followed in hot haste, but upon coming to a river, the water was too deep for them to ford, and the young men, having seized the only available boats, were half way across the stream. The cavalry fired several shots, but none of them took effect. They were, of course, compelled to retrace their steps without making the anticipated addition to their number. Arriving at Pensacola, having traveled a distance of 112 miles, the refugees made themselves known to the Provost-Marshal at that post, and were kindly furnished by him with the papers above mentioned and a passage to this City. They left town yesterday morning for Dunkirk, where their parents reside.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST.

In spreading abroad this version of the acts and motives of the alleged conspirators, the agents of the Russian Government no doubt confidently expected to deprive the Poles of their traditional hold on English and French sympathy by rousing against them that horror of socialism by which the middle classes all over Europe are still haunted, and which constitutes, at the present day, a still stronger support for arbitrary government, and a still stronger obstacle to the spread of free institutions, than either standing armies or the enslavement of the Press.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Uprising in Poland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Uprising in Poland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d3276aa-21c8-5b62-b92c-b29c5aba4046,977,nyt://article/4d3276aa-21c8-5b62-b92c-b29c5aba4046,

After the value of this principle had been demonstrated by WATT and practiced in every one of the ten thousands of steam-engines since his time, where economical results were of moment -- after high expansion had attained to such importance that nearly every improvement and patent in steam engineering was an attempt to better the means of obtaining or exaggerating it -- after its value to the public had become sufficiently important to warrant the most costly and prolonged patent suits about cut-offs -- (the means of obtaining expansion) -- while CORLISS, SICKLES and their imitators, were achieving constantly improved results by this means in this country, and RANDOLPH & ELDER, ROWAN and others in England, not content with what expansion they could get in one cylinder, expanded the same steam through two, in ocean vessels, with high economy, -- at this very time Mr. ISHERWOOD invented the uselessness of such expansion, and pronounced the whole engineering world in error. So captivated were the authorities by his presumption that they not only raised him to be Chief of the Bureau, but actually allowed him to repudiate and neutralize the professional success and talent of the whole country, and to specify, under its protest, to the uttermost detail, the machinery for a whole navy -- machinery which in the gunboats has proved a comparative blunder in every particular, which in the sloops has miserably failed before it ever went to sea, and which can only be remedied by being broken up into scrap iron and remodeled according to those laws of nature which it was vainly called upon to violate.

From this document we learn that our gallant little army from California and Colorado, aided by the native volunteers, have not only driven the invaders permanently from New-Mexico but have taken possession of El Paso and Fort Bliss, and detachments of troops have beer sent to Camp Quitman and Fort Davis, in Texas the latter fort being 200 miles east of El Paso. All the forts down to some distance in the Northwestern part of Texas have been evacuated and abandoned by the rebels; and Fort Clark, 120 miles from San Antonio, is the nearest fort to El Paso held by the Texans.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Southwestern Territory Triumphs of Our Arms.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Southwestern Territory Triumphs of Our Arms.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTHWEST', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1e9b9e2f-1ed9-520a-a276-48936208f4d9,819,nyt://article/1e9b9e2f-1ed9-520a-a276-48936208f4d9,

The circumstances attending the commission of the crime are of some interest. It appears that the accused has been a resident of Bridgeport, Connecticut, for some time past, and that while there, he succeeded in winning the affections of a good-looking, well-educated and respectable young lady. The marriage of the couple was agreed upon, and for the purpose of carrying it into effect, he induced her to accompany him to New-York, where they arrived three days ago, and put up at a private boarding-house in Clinton-street. Finding that his funds were running low, but at the same time determined to carry out the plan of the marriage tour, PEARSON entered the room of a fellow-boarder, named EDWARD S. PERCIVAL, while the latter was asleep, and stole from his pockets the sum of $300, with which he succeeded in making his escape from the hotel. The money was soon missed, and the Police put upon the track of the offender, and yesterday afternoon Officer OSBORNE took him into custody, just as he and his bride were in the midst of their preparations for departure from the house. The most of the stolen money was recovered. PEARSON was taken before Justice OSBORNE held for trial.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; AN INTERESTING CASE OF GRAND LARCENY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; AN INTERESTING CASE OF GRAND LARCENY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2bc84bcb-86f4-5cb4-8b38-7eb69e5fcdf5,404,nyt://article/2bc84bcb-86f4-5cb4-8b38-7eb69e5fcdf5,

Semi-Annual of,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/18/archives/semiannual-of-the-students-of-columbia-college.html,Semi-Annual of,"The third ""Semi-Annual"" of the Students of Columbia College was celebrated yesterday morning, at WALLACK's Theatre -- which, notwithstanding the storm, was comfortably filled long before 11 o'clock, the hour at which the exercises were announced to begin. A brighter, or more cheerful, or more intelligent audience is rarely seen in New-York. Composed in good part of the friends and relatives of the students, of course it was prepared to be pleased, and not even the fifteen or twenty minutes' delay at the commencement was potent enough to destroy its good humor, -- which was further aided by some excellent music by the orchestra, under the direction of HELMSMULLER. At length the curtain rose, and disclosed a semicircle of gowned students, among whom was seated the Chaplain, Rev. Dr. JOHN MURRAY FORBES, an Alumnus of Columbia, who opened the order of exercises with a brief prayer. The presiding officer, Mr. H.A. NAZRO, of the Senior Class, a manly-looking and well-mannered youth, now stepped forward and delivered, in clear and measured tones, a neat and tasteful address, in which he said that when, two years ago, the Faculty and Trustees of the College came to the conclusion to dispense with further Semi-Annuals, on account of the expense attending them, and the state of the country, the students resolved to continue them on their own responsibility and at their own expense, -- a resolution to which the aforesaid Faculty and Trustees had made no decided objection, though they deemed it inconsistent with the course they had decided upon to lend their presence at future celebrations. With a brief and pertinent allusion to the war, the speaker drew his address (which was rewarded with a bouquet) to a graceful conclusion, and announced the first orator, Mr. ALFRED E. CLARK. Before proceeding to notice the successive efforts of the young gentleman, we will copy, for the benefit of the reader, the list of speakers and titles of their orations:",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Semi-Annual of the Students of Columbia College.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Semi-Annual of the Students of Columbia College.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Columbia College', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cbbbf0b-0179-5088-ba1c-d6cd61a4618f,1413,nyt://article/8cbbbf0b-0179-5088-ba1c-d6cd61a4618f,

TILDEN, has disinterred during the past week a letter which he wrote in 1860, prophesying the revolt of the South in case LINCOLN were elected; and with that amusing confidence in the national baseness by which men of his school have always been characterized, points to the fulfillment of his prophesy as a crowning proof of the folly and imbecility of his opponents. That civil war should have followed the exercise by the larger portion of the people of their constitutional right of discussing the most momentous question of modern times, and of voting for a President whose convictions accorded with their own, is to him so complete a demonstration of the stupidity and wickedness of either speaking their minds or coming to the polls, that he evidently imagines that he has only to call attention to it, in order to make the Republicans both ashamed and repentant.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Price of Peace and Union', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Price of Peace and Union', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6d12cf6-6088-5a31-ba8e-c3012ef95b36,1191,nyt://article/e6d12cf6-6088-5a31-ba8e-c3012ef95b36,

"CURIOSITIES OF CRIME. -- In the Court of General Sessions, yesterday, Wm. MONTAGUE, a native of London, 32 years of age, painter by trade, pleaded guilty to forgery in the fourth degree, and was remanded for sentence on Saturday. The circumstances connected with this forgery are somewhat peculiar. It appears that the District-Attorney, A. OAKEY HALL, acting as the attorney of JOHN DE LA MONTAGNE, who is now in Europe, drew a check on the Broadway Bank for $183 75. payable to the order of WM. DE LA MONTAGNE, father of JOHN, who lives at No. 149 Madison-street. The check was deposited in the Post-office and directed to No. 139 Madison, that being the old number of JOHN DE LA MONTAGNE's residence before the recent renumbering of the street. The letter-carrier delivered the letter as directed, and the similarity of the names MONTAGUE and MONTAGNE, naturally led Mrs. MONTAGUE, to whom the letter was delivered, to suppose that it was intended for her husband. When he came home it was opened by him, and although he discovered that it was intended for another person, yet he was tempted by the coincidence in the names, to indorse the check, (merely adding ""[???]e la"" before his own name,) and dispose of it to one JOSEPH CONNOLLY, who, in depositing it in a bank for collection, discovered that the indorsement was a forgery.

The most gallant ram of our Western flock, the Queen of the West, is still lying below Vicksburgh, taking a brief respite after her wonderful dash down the river; and we have news this morning that the new Monitor Indianola has run the batteries at Vicksburgh, and now keeps company with the Queen. Whether these boats are to take any direct part in the attack upon Vicksburgh, we do not know; but there is an important and immediate work in which they could profitably be employed. The two gunboats are amply sufficient to clear the whole Mississippi River and all its tributaries of every sort of rebel craft -- of all the steamboats bearing supplies to the rebels at Vicksburgh and Port Hudson, whether they come down from Texas by way of the Red River, or up from Lower Louisiana by the Atchafalaya. The Queen of the West, herself, burnt three of these steamers and destroyed great quantities of supplies, beside capturing the town of Vandalia with a force of seven tars. But the Indianola is a far superior boat to the Queen. She belongs to the class of Monitors which have been building for service on the Western waters, and is much like our seagoing Monitors in her main features. The rebels have nothing that could stand for a moment against her. Even the boasted rebel iron-faced City of Vicksburgh could not stand the assaults of the Queen, and has had to take refuge from her iron nose behind a lot of scows. It has been reported that the rebels have three iron-clads building up the Red River; but we think it more likely that they have three hundred building in the Great Sahara. The Red River is said also to be barred on its lower waters by a raft, which the rebels can open a passage through at their pleasure. This is a likelier yarn, though unlikely enough. But no supply-boat would ever come this side of the raft or the river, if one or two of our gunboats were scouring the Lower Mississippi. We do not see that these two craft could be put to more important service than that thus indicated; and we presume Gen. GRANT intends to use them for that purpose.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Mississippi Navy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Mississippi Navy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Texas', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cac87989-ae56-5df7-b8c3-62344795de2f,1043,nyt://article/cac87989-ae56-5df7-b8c3-62344795de2f,
Pacific Railroad in Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/19/archives/the-pacific-railroad-in-congress.html,Pacific Railroad in Congress,"We are shocked to observe that Congress has not specified the diameter of the Pacific Railway axles -- a subject not only of vastly greater importance to the safety of passengers than the guage of the track which Congressmen do attempt to dictate, but which legislation is equally competent to prescribe. It is true that physical laws have settled the principles upon which these and other engineering problems are successfully solved; but shall this great National highway dare to be unsafe and expensive when its mechanical details have formed the subject of Congressional orations? It is true that the steamship Foh Kim, on her trial trip, last week, did not cease to work economically when ""cutting off"" short, even after they had opened Chief Engineer ISHERWOOD's book against ""cutting off"" short, and solemnly laid it right on the cylinder head; but however regardless nature may turn out to be of official opinions, shall any Senator dare to face a constituency whom he has outraged by neglecting to ingraft some original notion of his own -- good or bad, just as freaky Nature is in the humor to consider it -- upon the people's own railroad? What is the use of having any Congress, if engineers, plodding in a slough of traditions and formulas -- and, we may add, soldiers, clambering over the same rusty treadmill, as old as gunpowder -- cannot for once be compelled to turn a short corner and conform to the supreme power of the land?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Pacific Railroad in Congress.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Pacific Railroad in Congress.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d3f7c72c-5834-5f99-853d-96f4545f2625,1123,nyt://article/d3f7c72c-5834-5f99-853d-96f4545f2625,

Like the previous three years, 1862 was marked by a much improved state of health and general condition of emigrants, and the greatly diminished number of those requiring hospital treatment or other immediate relief on their first landing. The whole number of emigrants arrived at this port during the year was 12,660 more than during the preceding year. The number in the hospitals and of those otherwise receiving support or pecuniary assistance from the Board is less than in any former year; and although the decreased number of persons paying commutation reduced the income of the Commission much below that of most former years, yet the improved system and economy of their establishments, together with diminished county claims, enabled them to meet the current expenditures of the year, and to extinguish all debts, with the exception of those secured by mortgage on their real estate, and contracted principally in the purchase or improvement of their lands. There are no outstanding debts or claims, except such as are in dispute or to litigation. The labors of the Commissioners have been greatly diminished by improvements in the system, and their duties and responsibilities have been lessened by the operation of the law in relation to the removal of the Quarantine. The whole number of passengers landed at this port during the year 1862 was 105,383. Of these, 29,079 were citizens, or persons not subject to bonds or commutation was paid, or bonds executed, showing an increase in alien emigrants to 10,777 over 1861, and 28,836 less than in 1860; 3,016 less than in 1859; 2,283 less than in 1858, and 107,467 less than in 1857; whilst the proportion to the average of former years, since 1847, is much less than half. Of these emigrants, 32,217 were from Ireland, 27,740 from Germany, 7,975 from England, and 8,374 from other countries. The number cared for and treated in the State Emigrant Refuge and Hospital, Ward's Island, was 3,247; the number in the Lunatic Asylum was 151 -- number remaining, 66; and in the City Asylum, 9. The total number of cases of small-pox treated was 86. The number of sick sent to the New-York and to the St. Vincent Hospitals was 37; number returned to Europe at their own request, 100; forwarded to various places inland and to Canada, 178; number supplied with board and lodging, 3,649; number buried, 273; provided with situations, 6,636; number relieved and forwarded in the several counties of the State, and chargeable to the Commission, 2,343. Grand total of destitute alien emigrants landed at the port of New-York during the past five years, who were relieved, forwarded and provided with employment by the Commission, in the State and City of New-York during 1862, 16,558. The whole number of days spent in the State Emigrant Hospital and Refuge, on Ward's Island, was 207,380.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""COMMISSIONERS OF EMIGRATION.; Sixteenth Annual Report.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/20/archives/amusements.html,,"It were certainly unpatriotic, and impolitic, to draw any comparison between the French and American stage, which did not turn wholly to the advantage of the latter. But it is possible perhaps, to indirectly hint that to certain dramatic walks -- light comedy and the vaudeville business, for instance -- the French character is somewhat better adapted than either the English or American, excellent in other domains of dramatic art as these latter may be. As a heavy father, the Frenchman, in all human probability, would make a signal failure, and furnish another warning to the many on record against attempting what clearly and constitutionally lies beyond one's strength; nor do we think he would achieve eminent success in the character of a roaring lover, who shoots caresses and endearments at his mistress, as though she were an iron-plated target, and they rifled projectiles wherewith he was trying experiments. But as an imponderous parent, or a light lover, who speaks in natural tones, and carries the manners of modern society upon the stage in a play which attempts to deal with the present period, we think the Frenchman generally manages to distance, not only our glorious country, but also that distant one which we sometimes affectionately address as mother. He usually contrives to enter a hypothetical room on the stage as he would a real one off from it, he is generally thoughtful enough to remove his hat while in the presence of ladies, and talk with his eyes turned toward those whom he is supposed to address, and not toward the audience outside the footlights. It is also worthy of remark that very few cases are on record in hospitals of the French actor having broken any of his own limbs, or seriously injured the furniture by tumbling over it in entering or leaving the stage drawing-room. And by no possible torture of the lips nor convulsion of the epiglottis can he pronounce ciel in a way at all analagous to ""sk-e-ei,"" nor convert enfant into ""ch-e-ild.""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2abddf07-a8cd-5c9f-bfbe-a01562d50765,877,nyt://article/2abddf07-a8cd-5c9f-bfbe-a01562d50765,

It is really the nation's first assertion of a purpose to command the means for its own preservation. Hitherto these means have all been contingent and precarious. Our military strength was all dependent on individual good will in volunteering, and upon the good will of State officials in heeding, and adequately carrying out the calls of the Government for their just proportions of soldiers. The results have astonished the world. They will go into history as the most extraordinary manifestation of public spirit in all time. But, in their very nature, they were unsuited to a long war. There never was such a war, however just or necessary, that did not beget faction and opposition in its progress; and there never will be, so long as there is any wickedness or weakness in human nature. To throw the burdens of the war upon those only who shall remain true to it, would be rewarding unfaithfulness. To trust in any degree to its opponents for the means to carry it on, would be to make calculation impossible, and to hazard everything. If it be the supreme duty of the Government to save itself, it follows that it should have a supreme control over the means. It now prepares to assume that control; and therein, we say, is the best of all guarantees of its final success.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Conscription A New Pledge of Success.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Conscription A New Pledge of Success.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b0d91444-f214-5e0f-986c-214822e9c0d3,1222,nyt://article/b0d91444-f214-5e0f-986c-214822e9c0d3,

A sanguinary battle had been fought at Wengrow, in which the insurgents had been defeated and the town captured by the Russians. The British Parliament was in session, and the Queen's speech had been delivered. With regard to American affairs, Her Majesty said she had abstained from taking any steps with a view to inducing a cessation of hostilities, because it had not seemed that any such overtures could be attempted with a probability of success. She, however, viewed with the deepest concern the conflict which still raged, and witnessed with grief the distrees which the war inflicted upon a portion of her subjects. It was reported by the London Times that certain parties in Paris had offered a loan to the rebel Government of five millions sterling, on the basis of cotton at 5d. per pound, with the option of exchanging for Confederate bonds at 70, bearing 8 per cent. interest, and that the offer had been partly accepted. An insurrection had broken out in Cochin China, and desperate attacks had been made on the French forces. Severe fighting had taken place, but the insurgents had been repulsed with heavy loss. The French Emperor had asked the Spanish Government to send back the troops to Cochin China, but they had declined on the ground that they could not violate treaties. The Liverpool cotton market was dull and prices were weak. Breadstuffs were dull but steady, and provisions flat.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/22/archives/matters-in-prussia.html,,"At the opening of the present political campaign in Prussia, Herr VON BISMARK and his master have committed a serious blunder. They asked the Lower Chamber to sanction with its ""retrospective approbation"" the past conduct of the Government. They demand in fact, a Bill of Indemnity to legalize the arbitrary acts of Ministers in the recess. This faltering of the King, in the presence of the foe, is a virtual admission that, even in his own opinion, the course of his Government has not been in harmony with law. It is an admission that he and his Ministers are offenders against the Constitution, and need white-washing at the hands of the popular chamber. But that body has not the slightest intention of undertaking the work of purification, as may be inferred from the tenor of their response to the royal speech, which has been voted by an overwhelming majority of its members. Preposterous, indeed, would it be, were the King and his servile tools suffered to escape thus easily from the consequences of their acts, in raising taxes without legislative authority, in attempting to intimidate public opinion, and in trampling on the rights of the Nation's representatives -- especially as they mean to repeat all these outrages in the future, if they secure immunity from punishment by this act of indemnity. How utterly unworthy of such immunity both monarch and ministers are, has been shown by the fact that, when VON BISMARK became aware of the nature of the address which the Second Chamber had prepared for presentation to the King, he tried to force them to modify it by warning them that ""there was a limit to which the King could listen to."" The only ground of objection to the address was, that it described in inappropriate terms those very offences for which he had been soliciting the ""retrospective approbation"" of the Deputies. It did not even accuse the crown of complicity with the misdeeds of Ministers! In exonerating the King, however, from all responsibility for the acts of his Ministers, the authors of the address have dealt too tenderly with him. As long as a king maintains the neutral position of a constitutional monarch, it would be unjust to hold him accountable for the conduct of a Government over whose proceedings he exercises no control, and which can at any moment be hurled from power by the Legislature. But when a sovereign descends from this position, and assumes the leadership of a political party who are enemies of public liberty, he forfeits all claim to that consideration, and can no more use as a shield the maxim that ""the King can do no wrong."" WILLIAM has divested himself of the neutrality of a constitutional monarch, to become the Corypheus of an anti-national faction, and though courtesy prompted his Parliament to draw a distinction between him and his Ministers, be is not the less a party to the acts which have all but ruined them, and must share their odium. WILLIAM is, in fact, a martinet who loathes constitutionalism, and would fain dispense with its fetters, and govern his kingdom as he would a camp. In attempting to realize this crochet, he has done incalculable mischief to Prussia and his dynasty -- has outraged the rights of the people and the people's representatives -- has threatened the peace and destroyed the political prestige of the monarchy, and has inflicted deadly wounds on the common interests of all Germany.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Matters in Prussia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Matters in Prussia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/541b6a83-35b1-5fa3-8206-5477178da034,793,nyt://article/541b6a83-35b1-5fa3-8206-5477178da034,

The room was tastefully decorated -- the American colors appearing in flags, banners and streamers. There were no less than six long tables, with about fifty guests to each. It is true, the proportion of ladies was small; but, the precedent of their presence will, it is to be hoped, assist in the much needed reform of our public dinners, or suppers -- which, by the way, are much the same thing. Of the supper itself, it is only necessary to say that it was furnished by that excellent caterer and popular gentleman, L.F. HARRISON, of Irving Hall, whose efforts on this occasion were duly appreciated by all. The confectionery ornamental pieces were appropriately decorated with miniature flags, and the whole affair was well managed.

He was born in Somerset County, N.J., on Sept. 10, 1780; entered the junior class of Princeton College in 1799, graduating in 1801; pursued his theological studies under Rev. Dr. John Woodhull, of Freehold; was licensed to preach in 1804; received his first call to preach from a Presbyterian Church at Elizabeth, N.J., where he remained until 1833, when he removed to Philadelphia. There he was successively pastor of the Central and Spring Garden Church, laboring with much acceptance. Dr. McDowell was intimately connected with many of the religious movements of the present century. He was one of the founders of the Princeton Theological Seminary, of which he continued a Director up to the time of his death, and for 46 years Secretary of the Board; a member of the Convention which formed the American Bible Society, in 1816; Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, in 1820; a member of the Board of Domestic Missions, and Chairman of its Executive Committee from its organization, 30 years since; besides holding other important and honorable positions, which our limits will not allow us to mention. Dr. McDowell was the author of several works; among which may be mentioned, A System of Theology, Bible Class Manual, and a System of Bible Questions, for the use of Bible Classes and Sabbath Schools, the first, it is believed, ever published, and now published by the American Sunday School Union.

The price of Gold, which remained during the first year of the war so small as to excite little attention, began soon after the battles before Richmond slowly to rise. For eight months it has been almost constantly advancing, driven up by a factitious scarcity, and the unremitted efforts of speculators, till yesterday it stood at 162 1/2. Two widely different opinions rule the public mind in reference to the significancy of this rise. One class look upon the advance of gold as purely speculative, and as a merely accidental and unimportant effect of the excited state of public feeling. Others, still regarding gold as the standard of value, have seen in its rise the measure of a constant depreciation of the currency. Filled with prophetic forebodings, these men see for the country nothing but the continuance of this depreciation, and in its continuance nothing but financial ruin.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Depreciation of Our Currency and that of England in the Wars with Napoleon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Depreciation of Our Currency and that of England in the Wars with Napoleon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d9551edd-f4cb-5f40-a863-3367a685320b,1167,nyt://article/d9551edd-f4cb-5f40-a863-3367a685320b,

"-- Coroner NORRIS concluded the investigation, on Saturday night, into the circumstances attending the murder of Mrs. CECELIA MCLAUGHLIN, who was found dead in her room in Park-avenue, near Canton-street, on Friday morning. A number of witnesses were examined, but nothing was elicited to fasten the guilt directly upon any one, although all the attending circumstances would seem to indicate that either the husband, THOMAS MCLAUGHLIN, or the daughter, MARY ANN, or both, had a hand in the matter. Some of the tenants in the same house testified that they heard a noise as if caused by the slamming of a door, and the falling of a heavy body; screams and a cry of murder were also heard. No one went into MCLAUGHLIN's apartments to ascertain the cause, except JAMES MCCABE, residing on the second floor, who was sent for by the daughter. The deceased was lying on the floor dead when he entered. The daughter, according to her own statement, had been on a visit to a neighbor, and on her return saw her father holding her mother's head and wiping the blood from her face. She accused him of killing her, when he cleared her out of the room. The noise then made and her screams, it is thought, were what attracted the attention of the other occupants. The father also made a statement, without oath, in which he said that he had bought two pints of brandy on Thursday, and after disposing of it pulled off his boots and went to bed. His son FRANK woke him about 5 o'clock P.M., and told him that mother was lying dead on the floor. He got up, and lifting up her head wiped the blood from her face. His daughter then came in and accused him of the killing, but he denies having driven her out of the room. He knew nothing whatever of the cause of his wife's death. The son, FRANK, was likewise examined. He stated that he returned from play on Thursday afternoon, and found his mother lying dead upon the floor. The stove was tipped over, and the edge lying on her head. The stove-pipe had fallen down. He woke his father and informed him of what had occurred. It appears that the elder members of the family were in the habit of drinking to excess. They had frequent quarrels; and MCLAUGHLIN acknowledged that he had beaten his wife previous to this time. The physician's testimony showed that the right side of her skull was fractured, her left ear torn off, and that she had more than a dozen cuts and bruises about her head, face and upper part of the body. The jury were, however, unwilling, with the testimony before them, to render a hasty verdict, and, therefore, requested the Coroner to allow them till Tuesday before making their decision, which was granted MCLAUGHLIN and his daughter are meanwhile detained to await the result.

Beech Grove is a small town some twenty miles southeast of Murfreesboro, and five miles from the railroad; and if ROSECRANS has a column of his army there, it would seem that he is proposing to execute a movement on the rebel flank as well as on their front -- as he has but to march down the turnpike to Manchester, on the head-waters of Duck River, to be in a position to operate very advantageously against Tullahoma from the east.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Army in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Army in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5760eaf4-717f-59d2-9967-4bc25020f1f3,691,nyt://article/5760eaf4-717f-59d2-9967-4bc25020f1f3,

No proper hospital buildings have been raised, for the reason that it was hoped the army would not remain there any length of time, but would speedily move over to the high and wholesome region on the opposite side of the river. But instead of doing the best that was possible under bad circumstances -- instead of removing the sick away, or placing them on hospital steamboats, or using the best houses in the vicinity for their accommodation, they have been crowded into filthy negro shanties, dank hovels located in the swamp, and pens that are not fit for swine; while the few dry and roomy houses thereabouts are assigned to the officers for their use.

Free Labor in Louisiana,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/23/archives/free-negro-labor.html,Free Labor in Louisiana,"The important question, whether liberated slaves can be made to work as hired laborers, is being tested pretty extensively in Lower Louisiana. It has been discovered that the slaves within the parishes exempted from the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation are virtually emancipated by the fact that they are within our military lines; and as they amount to many thousands, and their former masters have very generally remained on their plantations, the latter, under the advice and with the cooperation of Gen. BANKS, have held consultations among themselves, and come to terms with their ex-slaves, as to their future relations with each other. No general plan has been adopted, each planter making such terms with the negroes as he finds convenient or possible. Our New-Orleans correspondent gives, this morning, a copy of the rules which have been drawn up by an old citizen of Louisiana for the management of his plantation, the labor on which is performed by his freed slaves; and their practicability is confirmed by an efficient negro overseer, who says that under these rules he can work any gang of negroes successfully. The rules provide that the negroes shall labor the usual number of hours, and receive about their usual supplies of food; but besides this, they are to get wages, averaging from $3 to $10 a month -- one-half of it at the end of each month, the balance at the end of the year. Various punishments are prescribed for bad conduct, and rewards for good conduct -- such as will appeal to the sensibilities, instincts and interests of the negro. The rules are in the main excellent, and if equally good ones have been adopted and are rigidly enforced on the other plantations, we do not see that anything better could be desired for the Louisiana or any other negroes. The plan is the best that has been adopted in any of those parts of the South occupied by our army -- as no military supervision or interference is called for. The working of these free-negro-labor schemes will be watched with great interest.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FREE NEGRO LABOR', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FREE NEGRO LABOR', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'NEGROES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6732be3-ec7f-5502-b07d-83143e14d4d2,348,nyt://article/e6732be3-ec7f-5502-b07d-83143e14d4d2,

Tom Thumb, issued twenty-five hundred invitations to the Bridal Reception held at his mother's house on Thursday last, the desire to see him and his tiny bride seems greater than ever. Whenever these thimblesful of humanity appear, they are instantly surrounded by a crowd of old and young. Their every movement is watched, and if they venture out of the house, they are pounced upon by the crowd which is always in waiting. If they ride out, their carriage is pursued by pedestrians and equestrians, who form a train more numerous (as well as more motley) than that of any monarch in the universe. If they come into our city on a ""shopping"" excursion, the store which they happen to patronize is filled with new customers who cram every corner, mount chairs and counters, and place the windows, show-cases and goods of the unhappy merchant in extreme peril. The little General complains that he is obliged to encounter similar troubles in whatever town or city he and his petite wife chance to visit. If they venture out of their room when in a hotel, they are instantly surrounded by the Brobdignagean multitude, and in several instances they have been nearly suffocated within the living wall which suddenly surrounded them! Their parlor and dining-room are frequently invaded by an army of curiosity mongers, and nothing short of a double lock and a pair of patent bolls has proved sufficiently powerful to preserve the sanctity of their bed-chamber! This infinitesimal man and wife propose to visit Europe soon, but their fame has, of course, already preceded them, and the momentous question arises, what can they do to arrest this terrible result of too much notoriety? We beg leave to suggest that the General should revise and reverse his decision that his wife shall not be exhibited. We understand that the little lady herself is not adverse to public exhibitions, but on the contrary that she ""rather likes it."" This being the case, let them hold public levees in our large cities and towns and charge fifty cents or a dollar per ticket of admission. If the General feels that he is already rich enough he will find plenty of worthy charitable objects that will make good use of his money. At all events it is very evident that with all their wealth, Mr. CHARLES S. STRATTON and his beautiful little wife, Mrs. LAVINIA WARREN STRATTON, can find no peace at home or abroad until in some way public curiosity is satisfied. -- Bridgeport Evening Standard.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Misfortune of being too Celebrated.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Misfortune of being too Celebrated.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/54455d97-6ef5-5e97-b99e-8cfcc66c21a7,440,nyt://article/54455d97-6ef5-5e97-b99e-8cfcc66c21a7,

There were present the members of the regiment, besides a large number of invited guests, including many distinguished military gentlemen, among whom we noticed several members of the veteran Gen. WOOL's Staff. The ladies comprised more than one-half of the assemblage, and added to the elegance of the affair by the magnificence of their attire. The ball-room, which is an extremely commodious one, was brilliantly illuminated, and handsomely decorated with the Stars and Stripes and the colors of the Regiment. The programme comprised twenty-five dances, the music for which was performed by ROBERTSON's Band. The gentlemen who constituted the Committee were untiring in their efforts to render the occasion an agreeable one to all, and as far as we are able to judge, they succeeded admirably. The dancing commenced with a quadrille, at about ten o'clock, and with the exception of the time devoted to supper, lasted until the ""wee hours of morning."" It was estimated that the number of tickets sold for this ball could not have been less than eight hundred. The following named gentlemen were among the Committee: Messrs.

The lady is blessed by nature with a fine voice, and practice has taught her how to use it in the best way for pleasing the public; the gentleman is experienced in stage affairs, and is, we presume, responsible for the vehicle of his daughter's talent. In the case of ""Satanella,"" he has seized upon a popular work by a pleasing composer, and retaining the most salient of the melodies, has reconstructed the plot to suit it for dialogue, pantomime and ballet. The task is not an easy one, nor has it been discharged with facility. A large amount of after-thought with have to be exercised before the piece presented last night can claim any merit on the score of construction, and extensive excision must be practiced before it can be acceptable, even as regards length. The interest of the performance centred almost exclusively upon Miss RICHING, who sang several morceaux with good effect, and was encored in ""The Glorious Vintage of Champagne."" Aided by a chorus, (strong in the male department,) and an increased orchestra, under Mr. HARVEY B. DODWORTH, these musical suggestions of the parent work were always acceptable. The scenery and dresses were good, the latter especially so; but the working of the machinery was intolerably bad, and by delaying the performance until near midnight seriously jeopardized its success. A defect of this kind will, of course, be immediately remedied. At an establishment so admirably and lavishly conducted as Niblo's, it should never be noticeable. There is an excellent corps de ballet, and several fine dancers have been expressly engaged to give importance to this department, so that when the work has been repuced to proper limits, it will present many claims to public consideration.

FREMONT would also end it, if he were only in command. Upon what these respective opinions rest it would not be easy to say. Nothing that either of these distinguished Generals has actually done, gives, so far as we can see, any warrant for such a judgment. Nevertheless, both of them have ability, and the Government is in duty bound to give the country the benefit of it. It can certainly assign to each some command which will furnish full scope for his peculiar capacity. It need not send them where their presence will be especially distasteful, or where the special faculty of each will not be required. Gen. MCCLELLAN would not be particularly useful in any Department where dash and vigorous fighting were needed, nor would Gen. FREMONT be able to render valuable service in any quarter especially sensitive on the question of Slavery.

The Sufferings of Unionists in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/25/archives/the-texas-tragedies.html,The Sufferings of Unionists in,"-- There is no surcease to the sufferings of the Unionists of Texas. Since the beginning of the war they have been subjected to ceaseless martyrdom for their principles; and from no other part of the South have we had such well-authenticated tales of horror. They have not been stories concocted at a distance, or even by the suffering party; but the most fearful accounts have been simply the narrations given by the newspapers published in the locality in which the circumstances occurred.

Among other things, he said it ""must put an end to a free Press, and destroy the right of free discussion in the South."" The noble Earl could not have shown a more complete ignorance of the past history of the South than be does in this sentence. There never have been such things there as a free Press and the right of free discussion. On almost every subject of public interest the Press of the South has been under the most rigid surveillance, not only by the Slaveholding class, but by the State authorities. On the question of Slavery, on the rights of the poor whites, on popular progress, on the reform of abuses, and on many cognate and collateral questions, the Press of South Carolina, for example, has for a half century had no more liberty of discussion than the Press of Paris now has regarding the prerogatives of the Emperor. The surveillance extended not merely to discussions on Slavery, but to everything bearing upon it, and everything seemed to bear upon it.

This unhappy class of our citizens may be distinguished by their lugubrious countenances, never relieved by a smile, except when news arrives of some disaster to the Confederate cause. Upon such occasions their pleasure is so intense that it is impossible to conceal it. The most extravagant reports of Federal victories are received by them as indisputable facts, while Confederate successes require to be a dozen times confirmed before they are considered worthy of the least attention. The greatest delusion under which such persons labor, is the belief that they are deceiving the community, and that their real sentiments are not known. Never was there a greater mistake. They are known and will be remembered. Their numbers were small at first, and they are becoming every day less. In the mountains near Fort Clark, and along the Rio Grande, their bones are bleaching in the sun, and in the Counties of Wise and Denton, their bodies are suspended by scores from black jacks.

The Military Value of,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/25/archives/the-value-of-vicksburgh.html,The Military Value of,"The only value that Vicksburgh possesses for the rebels is that of a blockade point on the Mississippi. So long as the batteries of Vicksburgh command the river in front, and prevent the passage of boats above or below, the armies of the Northwest and Southwest are sundered, and military operations in the Department of the Gulf are conducted at immense disadvantage. The armies in Louisiana have to be fed from the Atlantic seaboard, and weeks of precious time are lost in returning reports and receiving orders. The true base of operations against the rebellion in the States of the Southwest was to be found in the Northwest. Columbus, Island Ten, Fort Pillow and Memphis, hindered the advance from that direction. But as each of these places fell, the demoralizing effect on the rebels was prodigious.

A number of emancipation meetings had been held in England. At one held at Everton the Liverpool friends of the Secessionists mustered in force; but resolutions sympathizing with the North were passed by a vote of two to one. Collisions continued frequent in Poland -- said in most cases to result in favor of the Russians. The latter, however, had been deleated at Balmow.

"Yesterday afternoon the Harbor Police of this City were called upon by Capt. CHAS. G. CROCKER, of the ship Lucy Thompson, to quell a mutiny on board of that vessel. As soon as the Policemen were notified, they boarded the ship, then lying in the North River, opposite Pier No. 1, and took into custody sixteen of the mutineers, (all colored,) and forthwith took them before Justice CONNOLLY at the Tombs. From the evidence there adduced, it appears that the Lucy Thompson was ready for sea, bound for Liverpool. Her crew were all shipped, and the Captain had given orders to weigh anchor, when one of the crew named WM. WILLIAMS made an attempt to leave the vessel. Capt. CROCKER ordered him back. WILLIAMS refused to obey the order, whereupon the Captain directed that he should be put in irons. When the attempt was made to put the irons upon him, fifteen of the crew made a general attack upon the Captain on the quarter-deck, with drawn knives, handspikes, &c. The Captain and his officers, however, succeeded in driving them all forward, and ordered HORATIO WEAVER, another of the crew to be put in irons. The crew then rushed aft again, and this time they were armed with belaying pins and pistols, in addition to knives and handspikes. The Captain and first Mate, John T. Blackstock, tried to keep them back. The latter was armed with a cutlass, but the Captain testifies the mate did not strike any one with it, although he was knocked down with a belaying pin in the hands of one of the mutineers, while another struck him with a handspike.. At this stage of the proceedings, the Captain, drew his revolver and shot one of the crew named JOHN RICHARDSON in the leg. This act had the effect to quell the disturbance in a measure.

Magazines for March,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/27/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines for March,"-- The publishers and editors of the Atlantic furnish an excellent number for March. Attached to the leading paper, ""Christopher North,"" we find the name of JOSEPH DANA HOWARD. It is kind in the publishers to tell us thus much; but they will further have to explain to us who Mr. HOWARD is, as the blood of all the Howards, now-a-days, courses through a great labyrinth of democratic veins, and we cannot individualize the gentleman. There were no difficulty, however, in identifying the author of the poem, ""Choose ye this day whom ye will serve,"" even were the name of the author not whispered to us. Give OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES a biblical text or some patriotic theme, and the result may be calculated with arithmetical certainty -- a number of truisms dressed up in very pretty verse. JOHN WEISS furnishes chapter 5th of his ""Horrors of San Domingo."" ""A London Suburb"" is another of HAWTHORNE's charming sketches of the world beyond the Atlantic, or, at least, of that portion of it comprised by that fast anchored round of beef and sirloin of prejudice -- the Island of Great Britain. J.T. TROWBRIDGE's poem of ""The Vagabonds"" is clever in its way, though scarcely equal to BURNS' ""Jolly Beggars."" Mrs. CHILD's story of ""Willie Wharton"" tells of a boy who was taken from his parents by the Indians very early in life, and subsequently reclaimed with the Indian bride, whom he had acquired, to the pains and penalties of civilization. GAIL HAMILTON -- the pen name will be recognized as that of a lady essayist, one of the most charming in the world, setting America wholly aside -- issues a stirring appeal to her country-women. In reading the trumpet-call, ""O, women, stand here in the breach!"" we trust that neither matrons nor maidens will be tempted to pluralize the concluding substantive of the sentence. THEODORE TILTON's poem, ""The True Church,"" has an excellent point, which had been better had it been sooner reached. In a notice of Mrs. HOPKINSON's story, ""Under the Pear-Tree,"" commenced in the Atlantic for February, we prepared the readers to expect an excellent story -- they will not be disappointed. ""The Pear-Tree"" certainly grows in grace. Mr. GRENVILLE WEEKS, Surgeon of the Monitor, contributes a graphic story of the loss of the brave little iron-clad. In Mrs. JULIA WARD HOWE's fifth ""Lyric of the Street"" -- ""The Darkened House"" -- one would scarcely recognize the author of several stirring, nervous poems that have appeared in the same magazine over the same signature. AGASSIZ writes, ""America the Old World."" We do not pretend to criticise the Professor. He goes further down in the bowels of the lanp than any critic less erudite than BACON, or less persevering than moles, can safely follow. ""Pericles and President Lincoln"" is the title of a paper by HENRY M. ALDEN. It must be confessed that misery has made our republican ruler acquainted with strange bedfellows, and perhaps with ancient ones. In addition to the many capital articles enumerated, the Atlantic has an excellent review of Russell's Diary. Why could not some of the good things of the March number before us have been crowded into the one for February. Almost any one of them would have sparkled there in strong contrast to an almost eaden dullness.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f402d25-8e74-5042-9db9-6973753fdbfb,1268,nyt://article/9f402d25-8e74-5042-9db9-6973753fdbfb,

Another levy was authorized, and a half-million men rushed to the field, to battle for the Union. This vast army was in time found inadequate. Another call for 300,000 volunteers went forth, and, in a few days, 300,000 more, to be gathered by conscription, were called for. In all, 1,175,000 soldiers have been formally summoned to the field by the United States Government since the war began, and the greater part of them have gone.

Foreign criticism, as long as it comes from friendly pens, or lips, is always instructive, and ought always to be welcome. But there is not a line written or a word spoken by the English or French enemies of our administration at this moment, which is not inspired by sincere and hearty detestation, not simply of the policy of our Government, but of its nature. The tirades of the London Times and Saturday Review, and the lectures of Mr. BERESFORD HOPE, against Mr. LINCOLN and his Cabinet, are not inspired, and do not pretend to be inspired by zeal for humanity, or for the honor or welfare of this country or people. They care nothing about either slavery or slaveholders. They are not interested either in the security of the one or the preservation of the other. They are not interested in the restoration of the Union, or in the unity of the American people. They are not interested in the triumph of any principles, either moral or constitutional, to which any sect or party at the North avows its adherence. But they are interested, and they do not conceal it, in our failure, and the triumph of the rebels -- not because it would put an end to the waste of money and waste of blood which attends the war; not because they care a straw either for the negro or for his owner, either for Freedom or Slavery -- but because they hope to see, in our confusion, humiliation and defeat, the overthrow of those political doctrines which we have now, for eighty years, represented in the eyes of the world.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Foreign Slanderers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Foreign Slanderers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-02-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fbb565c4-7308-5e2d-a446-fda8de7184e2,973,nyt://article/fbb565c4-7308-5e2d-a446-fda8de7184e2,

These officers, because, in their opinion, Maj.-Gen. FOSTER ought to lead the forces in South Carolina, systematically disregarded Gen. HUNTER's orders, and studiously embarrassed his plans. Because they found negro soldiers in South Carolina, they openly declared that if the Union had got to be saved by such means, it should not be saved at all, and put themselves actively to the work of stirring up insubordination and mutiny among the white soldiers. Gen. HUNTER, in promptly putting some of these men under arrest and expelling others from his Department, has discharged his part of the duty in the premises.

The owl-train from New-York ran into the 11 1/4 o'clock P.M. train from Philadelphia at 2 o'clock yesterday morning, at the Princeton, N.J., station, just as the Philadelphia train was turning off on the switch to avoid it. The third car of the Philadelphia train was struck, and shattered to pieces. Nobody was killed, though several persons were injured. The locomotive of the owl-train was thrown into the canal, and two cars broken up. The obstructions on the track have been removed, and the trains are running regularly.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6283b3e2-10e3-59cb-834b-797f7ccfbcd7,622,nyt://article/6283b3e2-10e3-59cb-834b-797f7ccfbcd7,

Many charge the bad feeling between Presidents CARRERA and BARRIOS, of Guatemala and Salvador, to the ambitious views of the latter, and to his unquiet disposition. But, as near as I can judge from the discussions that have appeared between the two in the public prints, and from private letters from, and conversations with, intelligent persons, I should say that the faults in the quarrel lie principally with Guatemala. CARRERA and his priests do not like the liberal religious views of BARRIOS, and feel especially angry at his determination to make the clergy swear to obey the civil in preference to the ecclesiastical law. Guatemala has harbored all the self-expatriated priests and other discontents. She seems as little inclined to make war directly as does Salvador; and the latter will not be the first to shed blood. CARRERA, by lending aid in arms and money to BARRIOS' discontented countrymen, hopes to accomplish his purpose, which is purely personal, of overthrowing his enemy by a domestic revolution, but in which it is generally believed he will be disappointed. It is hardly to be expected that, failing in this, the bad feeling engendered between the two will eventuate in any other way than in war. And it is altogether unlikely that the war will be confined to these two parties. Honduras will, undoubtedly, take the side of Salvador, and Nicaragua cannot well be kept out of the quarrel. Costa Rica, although she should be glad to see BARRIOS overthrown, is determined to take no part, but may be forced into it.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GUATEMALA AND SALVADOR.; NICARAGUA.

From the very commencement of the present rebellion, the active cooperation of the Signal Corps with the different divisions of the army has been conspicuous, and that its service has been attended with the most satisfactory results has been proven and acknowledged upon numerous occasions. The operations of the corps have been referred to in a desultory manner from time to time by army correspondents, but the simplicity and facility with which it performs its labors have not been dwelt upon to any great extent. It is presumed that most people are aware of the nature of the duties required from this department of the service. The chief object is to furnish means of rapid communication between different portions or sections of the army, and to transmit the intelligence so received to the General and other headquarters. As it now stands, the corps is composed of officers of the rank of Captain and Lieutenant, under the immediate control of Maj. MYER, of the regular army, and the inventor of the code of signals at present used. Private soldiers are also detailed from their respective regiments to perform the manual labor required. In the event of an action, or one anticipated, it is the usual practice for one officer, attended by two or three assistants, to ride to the front and select an eligible position upon which the movements of the enemy can be observed. The position selected may be within our picket lines, or, as it often occurs, between the lines of the contending forces. If a wide distance intervenes between the outer station and the station at the general headquarters, or the point to which it is designed to transmit messages; or, if the view is intercepted by mountains, forest, or any other other obstacle, one or more stations, as the necessity of the case demands, are formed between the extreme stations. By this means instant advice of the enemy's movements is communicated to the commanding officer, who, acting upon the information received, disposes his troops to the best advantage. Another important benefit is derived from the operations of the signal corps, inasmuch as the firing of artillery may be directed to points most susceptible of damage. Such was eminently the case during the Peninsula campaign and the campaign through Eastern Virginia, where the enemy was successfully repulsed in consequence of his strength and precise locality having been made known to our Generals through the signal corps. The cam pains in other parts of the country also bear witness equally prominent of the efficiency of the corps. It is surprising to observe with what rapidity and accuracy messages are conveyed. When our army was at Harrison's Landing, one hundred and sixty-five messages were sent from the southern bank of the James River to Gen. PORTER's headquarters, on the northern bank, in the space of a few hours. The adaptability of the service to naval purposes is unquestioned, and has been and continues to be fully appreciated.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE SIGNAL SERVICE.; Its Co-operation with the Army and Navy--The Duties Required of Officers--The Mode of Communicating Signals--Apparatus Used--Recent Improvements--Major Myer's Report to the War Department--Testimonials to the Efficiency of the Signal Corps--Its Probable Separate Organization."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE SIGNAL SERVICE.; Its Co-operation with the Army and Navy--The Duties Required of Officers--The Mode of Communicating Signals--Apparatus Used--Recent Improvements--Major Myer's Report to the War Department--Testimonials to the Efficiency of the Signal Corps--Its Probable Separate Organization."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8826fd29-f045-53de-8742-23b077ecc278,1836,nyt://article/8826fd29-f045-53de-8742-23b077ecc278,

About that time he rapidly grew large and weighty, until he finally reached the remarkable figure of 509 pounds. Within the last few years, so great was his size and weight, that he was employed to exhibit at BARNUM's, and for several months one season he traveled with the Van Amburgh troupe all over this country. He was always good-natured, temperate and industrious in his habits, ate no more than a common man, and until within a short time past, always enjoyed good health.

Second Lecture on Brazil,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/02/28/archives/rev-mr-fletchers-lectures-on-brazil.html,Second Lecture on Brazil,"The second lecture of Rev. J.C. FLETCHER before the Mercantile Library Association, upon Northern Brazil and the River Amazon, was delivered before a large and intelligent audience at the Cooper Institute on Wednesday evening. He commenced by speaking of the immense area of the Brazilian Empire -- larger by 100,000 square miles than the entire domain of the United States. The physical geography of this entire region was especially adapted to make it one of the greatest, richest and most prosperous nations of the earth, while its climate was more temperate and salubrious than the corresponding latitude of either Africa or Asia. The average height of the land throughout the entire Empire was 700 feet above the level of the sea. Its mountains were tillable to their summits, its rivers were navigable for hundreds and thousands of miles inland, it was free from earthquakes, volcanoes, drouths, simoons and fevers -- in fine it was a land where the wnite man could live and thrive, though in the tropics. But alas! how it had been neglected! No American could go to South America without wishing that his countrymen inhabited the country. There were, however, signs of improvement in Brazil, and a new era was about to dawn upon the Empire. The Brazilians of to-day far surpass any of the Latin races in the Western Hemisphere, and they are fast improving in all that pertains to the welfare and greatness of a nation. The liberal and constitutional Government established by DON PEDRO the First, father of the present Emperor, was gradually being improved and perfected through the beneficent reign of his accomplished son, and a great and brilliant future for the Empire was about beginning. The Old World was nearly twice as large in area as the New, yet there was more available soil in the New World than in the Old, and in no part of it was there more available soil in proportion to the whole area than in Brazil. Mr. FLETCHER here spoke of the importance to Americans of opening a more extensive trade than has hitherto been carried on with Brazil. The English were fully alive to the advantages to be reaped from such a trade, and since the establishment of their line of steamers to Rio Janeiro, they were fast getting the better of the Americans. The speaker next reverted to the river Amazon, taking up the subject from the point were he left off in the previous lecture, and giving an interesting and vivid description of that ""King of Waters,"" interspersed with numerous anecdotes of his personal experience while navigating its bosom. From the point where the river enters the boundaries of Brazil, to its mouth -- a distance of two thousand miles -- the river was from three to seven miles wide, and although the tide set inland upward, of five hundred miles, yet so immense was the flood, and so strong the current, that the water was fresh even down to the mouth of the river. The lecturer spoke at length of the immense resources of the Amazon and other rivers of Brazil, and in fact of the entire Empire. The cotton crop of Brazil, for the last year, had more than doubled, and it ranks in the European market next to our own Sea Island. With reference to Slavery Mr. FLETCHER said he visited numerous plantations in different parts of the Empire during his trip thither last summer, and as well as in former years, and he had yet to see the first man in Brazil who held to the doctrine of Divine right of Slavery. They all, without exception, admitted it to be an evil, and acknowledged it to be their duty to do all in their power to mitigate and eventually to exterminate the curse. Unlike the United States there was no prejudice in Brazil against any man on account of his color -- but qualities of manhood alone were regarded. Under the action of influences now at work in Brazil it was generally believed that Slavery would come to a final and peaceful end within twenty years. The speaker closed by paying a high tribute to the rare qualities of head and heart which distinguish the present Emperor of Brazil and render him the greatest and best monarch now living. He also spoke of an interview which the Emperor permitted him to hold with the two Imperial Princessess-aged 15 and 17 -- during which they acknowledged with gratitude the beautiful present of copies of the Bible and Pilgrim's Progress, sent them by some ladies of New-York. The lecture was listened to with great attention by an appreciative audience, and was well worthy of a more extended report than our limited space permits us to give.

"ARREST OF A NOTORIOUS COUNTERFEITER AND SEIZURE OF $26,000 in BILLS. -- Detective DENTON yesterday arrested a well-known counterfeiter, named JEREY COWSDEN, alias COLEMAN, alias SMITH, on the charge of manufacturing counterfeit $5 bills, purporting to be issues of the Westfield Bank, of Westfield, Mass. The officer had been ""on the lay"" for COWSDEN for the past three weeks. He ascertained that he resided at No. 4 Verandah-place, South Brooklyn, and observed a light in the attic every night, where it was supposed he carried on the business of manufacturing bills. Having obtained sufficient evidence to arrest him, the officer watched the Post-office, and took him into custody, after calling for some letters, and locked him up. Detective DENTON. accompanied by Detective FROST, then proceeded to his residence and found a complete printing office in the attic story, consisting of presses, rollers, types, plates, dyes, and all other materials necessary in the manufacture of bills, together with $26,000 in printed money, and several reams of paper wetted down and ready for working off. A young man, engaged by COWSDEN at $3 per day for doing the mechanical work, was found in the office, and also taken into custody. The materials were taken possession of by the Police. The prepared bills are all finely executed on good paper, and will readily pass for genuine. The vignette, on the upper right corner, represents the village of Westfield; near the left upper corner is the word ""Five,"" in Roman characters; on the lower right corner is the figure ""5,"" and on the left side of the bill is represented a black-smith with an anvil, a seaman, two females, and a child with a spinning-wheel.
