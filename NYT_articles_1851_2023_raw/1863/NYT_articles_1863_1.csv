"The failure of our naval vessels to capture the Alabama before this time has caused the most erroneous impressions to prevail relative to the doings of the Navy Department.

Magazines or January,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/01/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines or January,"-- The Atlantic for January has several notable articles -- articles so much above the standard which our magazines seem by some mutual agreement to have adopted, as to deserve special and honorable mention. The first paper of the number, ""Happiest Days,"" by the lady whose pen-name is ""Gail Hamilton,"" furnishes subject for a more extended notice than these columns will allow. It is such a complete and lively refutation, and, withal, such an indignant hurling back of that marrowless platitude about ""Childhood's Happy Days,"" which every one feels bound to fire off on the least provocation, that a committee of grateful children should wait upon the authoress and bring her the best and rarest gifts that Santa Claus brings, as an eternal retaining fee. It is so ridiculously absurd that the poor little mannikin, that has to have its nose rubbed up the wrong way in morning face-washings, and pulled down by unnecessary applications of officious handkerchiefs, as though it were the rope of a cathedral bell -- that has all its best thoughts and carefully considered opinions nipped in the brain-bud before they can be blossomed forth in speech by the unasked-for information that ""little boys should be seen and not heard,"" -- whose heads have to submit to as much patting as cakes of butter at the hands of unctuous old gentlemen and snuffy old ladies -- who are always helped at table to wing-lips and drumsticks and prohibited from pie on account of their health -- whose sympathies are worked upon by missionaries of all sexes and uncertain ages, who persuade them to give the quarter they intended to buy a coveted toy with, to further the education of some miraculous little pagan whose name puzzles them in dreams -- it is so ridiculously absurd, we say, selling the cruelty of the thing wholly aside, that in addition to all these and ten thousand other afflictions, the young voyager upon the sea of life should be constantly assured that he is seeing his happiest days, and taught to look forward to the future with a dim, undefined dread, that we have no words to express the indignation with which the mere thought of the outrage moves us, and so refer the reader to the sprightly, sparkling and profoundly logical and philosophical essay of ""Gail Hamilton"" on the subject.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MAGAZINES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/14f511a4-93b9-577d-afca-c0fce01d083a,1829,nyt://article/14f511a4-93b9-577d-afca-c0fce01d083a,

Considering the present magnitude and splendid condition of our army, and the superb fleet of gunboats just completed -- which will not only be able to gain possession of the three remaining Southern ports, but to ascend the Southern rivers far into the interior -- it is certainly not unreasonable to believe that the restoration of the National authority can proceed, to say the least, as rapidly hereafter as it has heretofore.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Year and the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Year and the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2502266-1d4c-5e0f-bbbf-46a122f07c2d,1231,nyt://article/d2502266-1d4c-5e0f-bbbf-46a122f07c2d,

"Murfreesboro, the battle of",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/03/archives/the-battle-in-tennessee.html,"Murfreesboro, the battle of","The last day of the old year went out in quiet all over the great theatre of military operations excepting in Middle Tennessee. But there, on that day, one of the greatest, and we judge it will prove to be the very greatest battle yet known in the Southwest, was fought. The only other Southwestern battle that equals it in the magnitude of the forces engaged, was the battle of Pittsburgh Landing -- and that only on the second day, after the arrival of BUELL's column. The army of Gen. ROSECRANS comprises the greater part of the magnificent force so long drilled and manoeuvred by Gen. BUELL in Kentucky and Tennessee, and which was transferred to Gen. ROSECRANS after BUELL had failed, in Northern Kentucky, to destroy with it the same rebel army which it has now again met near Murfreesboro. The opposing rebel force is, next to the army at Fredericksburgh, the largest rebel army in the South. It was recently reviewed by JEFF. DAVIS; and in the account of the review published in the Chattanooga Rebel, the columns of Polk, Bragg, Hardee, Breckinridge, Cheatham and others were mentioned as being present. The whole, we believe, was under the immediate command of Gen. BRAGG, who handled the same army during the campaign in Kentucky. For, although Gen. JOSEPH JOHNSTON is the Commander of the Department, it was said when he took command that he was only to be a sort of closet strategist or Generalissimo, and not to lead in the field. We judge it would be a fair estimate to put each of the armies at at least eighty thousand men.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Battle in Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Battle in Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/74008688-8bad-52f5-9381-7f3deae9fed2,498,nyt://article/74008688-8bad-52f5-9381-7f3deae9fed2,

He closed by presenting the testimonial, asking Mr. V.B. to remember in after years the United States Revenue Inspectors under the Administration of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Mr. VAN BOSKERCK, in a few feeling remarks, accepted the gift. The Surveyor then, in behalf of the Inspectors, presented Mr. ANDREW R.

After describing the treachery by which the State was pushed into rebellion, he reviews the military efforts of Missouri, which now has in service for the war 38,031 loyal soldiers. The State debt is now $24,734,000. Of this amount $23,701,000 consists of bonds loaned to the several railroads, the interest upon which the roads are bound to provide for, as well as the principal, when it may become due. Still, the faith of the State is pledged to the holders of the bonds for the payment of both principal and interest; and the security which the State has is a lien upon the roads themselves. Some scheme must be resorted to by which the liabilities of the State can be so reduced as to bring them within its capacity to meet them; and as the chief liabilities are on account of the railroads, that scheme must look to the reduction of the principal of this railroad debt. To bring about this end the Governor recommends that a tax be imposed upon contracts and conveyances, such as is now imposed by Congress in requiring stamps upon all written contracts.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AFFAIRS IN MISSOURI.; Message of Gov.

T.; Essays; Fremont, Mrs. J. B.; The Story of the Guard; Richards, Mrs.; Springs of Action","-- In taking up Springs of Action, lately published by the HARPERS, we have an intuition that the book is in every respect an excellent one, and a single glance over its delicately tinted and clearly printed pages demonstrates that fact beyond all doubt and question. Must we confess that for no other reason than this exellence upon Its face we have conceived a prejudice against the work, that would grow by degrees, until it deepened and widened into confirmed and positive dislike, were we compelled to read it thoroughly and carefully through! To redeem our moral nature from the charge of inconsistency, if not of direct depravity, either or both of which would seem involved by the foregoing very candid confession, we must explain that, from the standard headings of the unexceptionable chapters of Mrs. RICHARDS' excellent book, we have a full and weary sense of what is coming. Recollections of innumerable ""Letters to Young Ladies,"" and whole ""Words to Young Men,"" of ""Finger Posts to the Kingdom of Knowledge"" -- and all other kingdoms for that matter -- which proved direct guides to the blessed ""Republic of Sleep,"" instead, and of ""Helps for the Weary,"" that left the reader exhausted at the foot of the first chapter -- recollections of all these and many other precious peerless volumes project their slanting shadows across our brain, and cause us to test the action of these springs by snapping them violently together and depositing them in an easy position on as far away a corner of the table as possible, lest another look should betray us into saying something either desperately stupid or desperately wicked. ""Health,"" ""Industry,"" ""Cheerfulness,"" ""Generosity,"" ""Justice,"" ""Transparency,"" ""Earnestness,"" ""Reverence,"" ""Patience,"" ""Magnanimity"" -- these are the cheerful springs that are set under the cushions of our mentality in the table of contents. Health -- spring the first -- is undoubtedly a very good thing in its way, but we are tired of hearing it discussed -- bored of all books that refer to it even indirectly. Man in the concrete would have been so much happier and better had he never found out that he possessed a liver or a spine, that it is a great pity any impertinent groper among vertebrae and the interior economy of the human system ever made the discovery. Not to know that one had a stomach would be to enjoy to the full that ignorant bliss which poetry and experience tell us it is folly to make wise. Those Chinese conquerors, who cut out the stomachs of captives and hang them up beyond their reach on trees, are not so inhuman after all -- though the owner is, perhaps, slightly inconvenienced when hungry. Of the virtue of all the other Springs, ""Industry,"" &c., we can speak from experience, if we except the singular one of ""Transparency."" Never within the limits of our brief yet varied experience upon earth can we remember of having been transparent, nor have we any special desire to be -- it is an attribute we are not ambitious of sharing in common with ghosts and glass doors. At first reading we thought this ""spring"" was simply a vehicle for the introduction of some pun about one's being ""full of pains;"" but no -- it is defined by the author in advice to the reader: Appear to be what you really are. This definition is not as deep as a well, perhaps, nor as broad as a church door, but still, like Mercutio's wound, 'twill do. The captious critic might urge that to appear to be what we really are might not after all conduce much to the harmony of society, and that it were preferable, so far as moral excellence is concerned, to extend the rule and be really something better than we appear to be. In either event, however, the world would be very apt to misjudge us, as the old proverb warns against trusting to appearances, and LONGFELLOW -- who is considerable of a philosopher as well as something of a poet -- advises the public that persons ""and things are not what they seem.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/798a0313-6150-5fa0-bdfa-510089c74825,1908,nyt://article/798a0313-6150-5fa0-bdfa-510089c74825,

Plundering by the Union Army in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/04/archives/the-conduct-of-the-war.html,Plundering by the Union Army in Virginia,"JEFFERSON DAVIS' proclamation will lead abroad, as it is leading at home, to a more earnest discussion then ever, of the manner of treatment by our armies of those portions of the rebel territory which they have occupied. Europe has been ringing for the last year with the charges of violence, outrage, plunder, &c., brought against our troops by the Confederates and their sympathizers; and all accounts that we receive from our correspondents in Virginia and elsewhere, testify that the inhabitants of the scene of operations, east and west, either believe, or appear to believe, them. We hear every day of men at the South once Unionists, who declare that whatever might have been the chances of a reconstruction at one time, the conduct of our armies has been such that all hope of it has passed away. We know that wherever our troops have been, houses are wrecked, fowls and pigs killed, horses carried off, fences burned, and the country, in fact, laid waste, and the people made bitterly hostile. Putting these two things together, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that for this state of affairs our officers and Government are responsible; that, in short, there is some stronger reason for the demonstrations of detestation with which our troops are constantly greeted than mere political alienation. Moreover, it is a well-known fact, that the march of our army from Washington to Maryland, prior to the battle of Antietam, was marked by almost unrestrained plunder; that bands of stragglers from the column cleared the farm-yards of their live stock on both sides of the road for miles, and this, too, we are pained to say, in districts through which the Confederates had marched without doing injury.

HISSINCK, partially intoxicated, entered the lager-bier saloon of CHAS. SCHULTE, at No.109 Greenwich-street, and had two drinks, which he paid for. Subsequently he had a third, but having no money to pay for this, a dispute arose between him and SOHULTZ, who was behind the bar. HISSINCK finally offered his watch as security, but Mr. SCHULTZ not being satisfied with this, came round from behind his bar and attacked HISSINCK. He got him down on he floor and, as is alleged, commenced stabbing him tin the eyes with an ice-pick, and succeeded in destroying the left one altogether and probably the right one also. Some citizens who were passing at the time, came in and interposed, and SCHULTZ was arrested by Officer HEY, of the Twenty-seventh Precinct. Dr. STAGER, of No. 27 Whitehall-street, was sent for by the Police to attend the wounded man, but refused to come. Dr. WOLTJE was then called and rendered all the assistance in his power. The injured man was conveyed to the New-York Hospital, where he was pronounced to be in a dangerous condition. He will no doubt be totally blind for life. The ice-pick has blood on it for 1 1/2 inches of its length. The assault seems all the more brutal, as HISSINCK was quite drunk and gave no provocation. SCHULTZ was taken before Justice CONNOLLY at the Tombs yesterday morning, and committed to await the result of the injuries.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/91fb23a8-40ca-5947-a0e2-46b300c09470,1075,nyt://article/91fb23a8-40ca-5947-a0e2-46b300c09470,

Timby's Revolving Iron Towers for Harbor Defence,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/04/archives/the-protection-of-harbors-timbys-cordon-of-revolving-iron-towers.html,Timby's Revolving Iron Towers for Harbor Defence,"In all the history of the past, few revolutions have occurred so sudden and complete as that which was effected in the methods of maritime warfare by the contest between the Monitor and the Merrimac, and its accompanying incidents, in Hampton Roads. In an hour, as it were, the Great navies of the world, that have figured so much in human history, were blotted out of existence. Since that event, the maritime nations, by common consent, have ceased to construct merely wooden vessels-of-war. Iron-clad vessels have already become the recognized feature of future conflicts upon the ocean. The revolution, however effected by the memorable encounter, did not stop at this point. From the completely impregnable character of the Monitor, it was seen at a glance, that the ordinary means of harbor defence were altogether of no avail against assaults from vessels of this class. The various maritime nations of the world at once took the alarm; the erection and construction of ordinary forts was abandoned, and for a time the tide of public opinion set strongly in favor of armor-clad vessels of war as the chief reliance, even with regard to the protection of harbors. Time has, however, somewhat modified this opinion, and it seems now to be generally conceded that armor-clad vessels alone are unable to afford complete protection. A completely impregnable vessel, such as are now being constructed by our Government, could probably pass with entire safety any fortress in the world; and if two such vessels should meet in hostility, they could not seriously damage one another -- they might as well pass one another without firing, as to waste their ammunition by ineffective shots. Under these circumstances, it is clear that some other and more effective methods of harbor defence must be devised, or all our maritime cities are wholly at the mercy of the monsters of the deep. With this object in view, we take pleasure in presenting to the consideration of the readers of the TIMES the plans of Mr. THEODOE R. TIMBY, and invite special attention to them, believing that they present the strongest possible claims to favorable consideration at the hands of the Government and people. The plans of Mr. TIMBY have been drawn up and developed with unusual care, and evince a thorough appreciation on his part of the end to be gained, the difficulties to be overcome in securing it, and the best methods of accomplishing the general result. They are, moreover, indorsed by some of the best business talent in the country. The sketch at the head of this article will give a general idea of the plans proposed.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE PROTECTION OF HARBORS.; TIMBY'S CORDON OF REVOLVING IRON TOWERS, FOR HARBOR DEFENSE."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE PROTECTION OF HARBORS.; TIMBY'S CORDON OF REVOLVING IRON TOWERS, FOR HARBOR DEFENSE."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fb16c4bb-4058-5cb8-b448-c779d27010ad,1278,nyt://article/fb16c4bb-4058-5cb8-b448-c779d27010ad,

The gross number of immigrants reached seventy-six thousand, or some fifteen hundred more than during 1861. They came the past year, too, with a full knowledge of the war raging in the land, while the Spring current of immigration in the year preceding last had begun to flow from Europe before it was believed there that there would be any war here. Considering the stories that the British and Continental Press have published about the state of affairs in this country, it is odd, if people there believed them, that a single European should have dared to set foot on the soil of the North. They were not only coming to the dominion of that ferocious tyrant LINCOLN, where they would he deprived of every human right, but the moment they landed here, LINCOLN would seize them, force them into his armies, and compel them to spend the remainder of their natural or unnatural lives in fighting for him without even the remuneration of a shilling a day. Besides, who could tell but that BUTLER might at any time break loose, and come roaring and tearing from New-Orleans, and, after the fashion of Bluebeard, devour all these unfortunate foreigners before they landed? The explanation of the circumstance may, perhaps, be that, after all, there are a good many folks in Europe who do not believe the grotesque falsehoods of the English Press. At all events, during the last two years of war, something like a hundred and fifty thousand persons have come over here from Europe to see for themselves; and, when once here, very few of them ever go back to where they came from.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE YEAR'S IMMIGRATION."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE YEAR'S IMMIGRATION."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fce2f752-828c-51e0-b47d-04cfc3adf543,2194,nyt://article/fce2f752-828c-51e0-b47d-04cfc3adf543,

Mr. SCHOLEFIELD took the part of the South, and contended that the North was not sincere in its efforts against Slavery.

He said the duty of England was for the Government to recognize the Southern States. Intervention meant war -- mediation meant failure.

"Considerable curiosity has been manifested at the fact that no mention has been made in any of the dispatches relative to the movements of Capt. BANKHEAD. It is supposed that he was one of the first officers to leave the vessel on discovering the state of affairs, for when water once begins to flow into a craft almost on a level with the water it is out of the question to save her. And thus, it is feared, that those who had not the good fortune to be on deck speedily enough after the disaster, were drowned before they could get up through the hatchway. JOHN B. BANKHEAD is a full commander in the United States Navy. He is a native of South Carolina, and entered the navy in the month of August 1838, J.W.A. NICHOLSON, SAMUEL MARCY, C.M. FAUNTLEROY, and others, graduated with him. He was attached at various times to nearly all the ships of the old navy, and cruised on the Mediterranean, the Coast of Africa and Brazil. In 1861 he was temporarily attached to the Coast Survey, and rendered good service to the Government while acting in such capacity. He is credited with over twenty years of actual sea service. The bravery and chivalrous conduct displayed by him while commanding the steam gunboat Pembina, marked him out as the man to succeed WORDEN in command of the renowned Monitor.

BANKHEAD. It is supposed that he was one of the first officers to leave the vessel on discovering the state of affairs, for when water once begins to flow into a craft almost on a level with the water it is out of the question to save her. And thus, it is feared, that those who had not the good fortune to be on deck speedily enough after the disaster, were drowned before they could get up through the hatchway. JOHN B. BANKHEAD is a full commander in the United States Navy. He is a native of South Carolina, and entered the navy in the month of August 1838, J.W.A. NICHOLSON, SAMUEL MARCY, C.M. FAUNTLEROY, and others, graduated with him. He was attached at various times to nearly all the ships of the old navy, and cruised on the Mediterranean, the Coast of Africa and Brazil. In 1861 he was temporarily attached to the Coast Survey, and rendered good service to the Government while acting in such capacity. He is credited with over twenty years of actual sea service. The bravery and chivalrous conduct displayed by him while commanding the steam gunboat Pembina, marked him out as the man to succeed WORDEN in command of the renowned Monitor.

"Vicksburgh, The Battle on rear of",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/05/archives/the-rebellion.html,"Vicksburgh, The Battle on rear of","We have definite intelligence from the Battlefield of Murfreesboro up to the evening of Friday, and telegrams from Nashville as late as Saturday at 5 o'clock P.M., at which time everything looked favorable for the National cause. In fact, a telegram received at headquarters, in Louisville, from Col. ANDERSON, announced positively that the rebels had been decidedly whipped, and that our forces were at Christiana, which is ten miles below Murfreesboro, on the railroad. After the severe struggle of Wednesday, the enemy persisted in massing upon our right, with a view of cutting off our communications with Nashville, out failing in this, they made a sudden attempt upon our centre on Thursday morning, but were severely repulsed. Late in the day they made another attempt upon the centre, but were again repulsed. On Friday afternoon a third attempt upon the centre was similarly repulsed, a fierce demonstration at the same time being made against our left, which, after a terrific struggle, resulted in the discomfiture of the rebels -- the contest here being decided by a charge of NEGLEY's Division. Gen. ROSECRANS, quick to take advantage of these successes, immediately issued a general order, which was executed in fine style, and the left was fairly established on the east bank of the river. The centre advanced to a position previously held by the rebels, and the right again occupied the ground from which it had been driven on Wednesday -- thus insuring decided advantages for us, when the day's work was closed by darkness. Of the fighting on Saturday we have no details, though, from the tenor of our dispatches, we cannot doubt that it resulted in the defeat of the rebel forces. It will be seen by the dispatches received from rebel sources that a body of our troops has penetrated ninety miles into East Tennessee, through Pound Gap, and made a serious break in the East Tennessee Railroad, which it will take some time to repair, thus cutting off all reinforcements for BRAGG's army from Virginia.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fce63a7a-57ce-5f0f-9968-19cc575f3489,1049,nyt://article/fce63a7a-57ce-5f0f-9968-19cc575f3489,

The serious work extended only over Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, though there was heavy skirmishing for several days preceding the general actions, as well as on the Saturday following them. The result of the engagements was an undisputed victory to our army. Though the rebels gained certain important advantages on the first two days during which the battle raged, and though on the afternoon of the third day they advanced in great force, and opened the attack, yet before nightfall they were driven from the ground with such serious loss that their whole army was compelled to fall back, and after a show of fight on Saturday, they fled southward, in the direction, it is said, of Tullahoma. On Sunday, ROSECRANS, with his victorious army, marched up to Murfreesboro, and yesterday occupied it. ROSECRANS, in his official report, says that part of his force had commenced a pursuit of the enemy, but of any results of this we as yet do not know. The losses are, happily, not as heavy as might have been inferred from the first accounts we had of the engagements. Gen. ROSECRANS states that his medical director estimates the wounded at fifty-five hundred and the killed at a thousand.

A heavy storm prevailed during Saturday, making it difficult to manoeuvre large [???]ies of troops, and nothing more than skirmishing took place. On Sunday morning [???]arly it was discovered that the rebels had retreated during the night, and soon afterward a brigade of our forces, under Gen. STANLEY, entered Murfreesboro. No general pursuit, however, was commenced until Sunday evening, the day being spent in preparations for the movement, in bringing in the dead and in distributing ammunition and subsistence. The Centre Grand Division was the first to start, and was followed with due promptness by the two others. The losses on our side, considering the length of time and the persistency with which the fighting continued before Murfreesboro, are much lighter than might be expected. Gen.

Bills were introduced to promote the efficiency of the army and navy. A bill taxing bank-bills and all fractional currency was introduced by Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. A resolution condemning Gen.

A resolution was adopted, making inquiry of the Secretary of War as to the number of deserters from the army, and the steps taken to punish them. The Military Committee was instructed to inquire into the expediency of so consolidating the regiments now in the field that their maximum number shall be at least 1,020 men. The Finance Committee was instructed to inquire into the expediency of modifying, or abolishing the duties on foreign paper.

Intention of the Legislature to Interfere for Peace,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/06/archives/a-state-asked-to-abet-treason.html,Intention of the Legislature to Interfere for Peace,"Interpose -- that is the word. The State of New-Jersey is called upon by a piebald squad of Know-Nothings and Democrats to ""interpose to arrest the existing civi1 war."" In this there is nothing surprising. It has long been known that the breed of New-York politicians which furnished two Major-Generals to the rebel army, is not extinct. They live, and so far as has been observable, retain every traitorous affinity. Nor is it very strange that individuals of similar instincts should be found in the New-Jersey Legislature.

H. MELLEN, of the firm of Messrs. CLAFLIN, MELLEN & Co., well-known merchants of this City, recently appeared before Justice CONNOLLY, and preferred a complaint for false pretences against THOMAS C. GILMAN, a merchant doing business in Rochester, this State. From the complainant's affidavit it appears that on the 20th day of February, 1861, Mr. GILMAN called on the firm and applied to purchase goods on credit, as the agent of his wife, MARY A. GILMAN. He represented that she had just commenced the wholesale boot and shoe business in Rochester, this State, that she was to sell for cash, and had invested $10,000 of her own money in the business, beside having $4,000 more which she intended to invest in four months from that time. GILMAN further represented that he then intended to purchase goods to the amount of $30,000, toward which be should pay $10,000 down; that his wife was nearly free from debt, and perfectly responsible. Believing these representations to be true, the firm sold and delivered to GILMAN a large bill of goods, and at intervals, up to a few months ago, continued to sell him goods as the agent for his wife, apparently fair and plausible representations being made by GILMAN at every sale. The total amount of his present indebtedness to the firm of CLAFLIN, MELLEN & Co. is $6,378 25. At length, becoming somewhat suspicious as to the pecuniary standing of GILMAN and his wife, Mr. MELLEN instituted an investigation, which resulted in satisfying him that all the representations made by Mr. GILMAN, and upon which he obtained the goods, were false and untrue, and, as complainant alleges, were feloniously made, with the intent to cheat himself and his partners out of their property. On the facts presented before Justice CONNOLLY, a warrant was issued for GILMAN's apprehension, and yesterday he was taken into custody by Officers CUMMINGS and BLUNT, of the Tombs Police Court, The accused was taken before the magistrate, and held in $5,000 to answer.

The information corresponds very nearly with that contained in a rebel dispatch from Vicksburgh published in the Richmond papers, and reprinted in the TIMES day before yesterday. The fighting on Sunday, the 28th, it will be recollected, was apparently much in our favor, Gen. SHERMAN having fought his way to within two miles of the city. The struggle over the last line of rebel fortifications on Monday, it now appears, was of the most desperate character, and resulted in the temporary repulse of our forces with considerable loss. The rebels are said to have concentrated all their forces from Jackson and Grenada, and along the line of the railroad, numbering about 65,000 men, and this overwhelming force was thrown against Gen. SHERMAN, with the effect of pushing him back to his first line. There was some fighting also on Tuesday morning, but our forces were in a position to resist any attack, and were confident of ultimate victory. One account of our losses estimates them at three thousand, while another puts them at from four to five thousand. The fighting on Sunday is represented to have been of the most desperate character, much of it being hand to hand, over fortifications and batteries. Gen. HOVEY had been dispatched with 1,500 men on a special mission -- probably to destroy railroad communication -- but had not been heard from, and fears were entertained for his safety.

Thrust into the part at the last moment, it would have been proper, had she failed, to have extended to her all the friendly consideration that the critic could call to his aid, and even in view of her success, it is right to remember that she labored under the most adverse circumstances; but the lady's success was so perfect and deserved that we have nothing but the heartiest recognition to record of it. From the Brindisi of the first act to the Gran Dio of the last, she was all that could be desired; equaling, if not excelling, in execution, all her predecessors and giving to the dramatic bearings of the part a sufficient earnestness of emotion to carry the sympathies of the audience with her to the end. It is undoubtedly the best part in which Mlle. CORDIER has been heard.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab4b934d-90f4-56e2-a61e-e72d6631aa7b,501,nyt://article/ab4b934d-90f4-56e2-a61e-e72d6631aa7b,

A conversation was opened between the two parties, when JONES remarked, ""I can lick any d -- d man there is in the room,"" and directly afterward he struck the witness in the face with his fist, knocking him down. JONES then left, but returned in a few minutes, accompanied by about fifteen men, and, the quarrel being renewed, CONNOLLY was struck on the head with an iron wrench or hinge, about eighteen inches long, in the hands of JONES, felling him to the floor. JONES was then seized, and the weapon wrested from him before be could use it again. He and his party soon decamped, and CONNOLLY was taken home, where he has since been gradually growing worse.

From thence he proceeded to Baltimore, and took lodgings at a sailor's boarding-house, kept by a good-looking young woman named BRIDGET BROWN, and her husband. BRIDGET took a fancy to HOWARD, or perhaps to his roll of green-backs, and the result was an elopement, the runaway pair coming to Jersey City, where they took board at No. 100 Bergen-street, as man and wife. After getting comfortably settled, Mrs. BROWN concluded to send her little daughter back to Baltimore, and HOWARD was prevailed upon to accompany the child there. Upon returning he discovered that his fair love had departed, taking with her the sum of $575 in green-backs, and his clothing, valued at about $40. HOWARD's love-dream was at once dispelled, and he cared not a fig where the false one might go, but he coveted the greenbacks for which he had fought and bled. Diligent inquiry brought him to a house in the rear of No. 10 Hamilton-st., N.Y., where he found that Mrs. BROWN had taken a dwelling and a partner named PATRICK PHALAN, for the purpose of keeping a sailor's boarding house. HOWARD told the woman that he cared nothing for her, but he did for his money and clothing, and that, if she would give them up he would depart in peace and happiness. Mrs. BROWN replied that she cared not for him, as she had a better man, and the sooner he left the better; and as to his money and clothing, she denied all knowledge of them. HOWARD straightway went and unburdened his sorrows to the kindhearted Mr. MARTINDALE, who sits in the halls of justice as Recorder, in Jersey City. A warrant was placed in the hands of Detective KILCAULEY, who proceeded to New-York early yesterday morning, and arrested Mrs. BROWN as the principal in the robbery, and PATRICK PHALAN as an accomplice. The prisoners were brought to Jersey City and placed in the lockup to await further developments. Officer KILCAULEY subsequently visited the apartments of the accused parties in New-York, but was unable to obtain any trace of the money or clothing. They had had sufficient time after HOWARD discovered their abode, to take good care of it. It is alleged that PHALAN resided with Mrs. BROWN, in Baltimore, and it is probable that they concocted the plan for robbing HOWARD, and the child was brought on for the purpose of carrying out their designs.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/530acbd6-9ec7-5b7d-bfa8-5e7954c990b3,524,nyt://article/530acbd6-9ec7-5b7d-bfa8-5e7954c990b3,

This Count MEJAN, from the commencement of the secession movement, distinguished himself as an enemy of the United States Government. He led the entire foreign element at New-Orleans, fomented treason wherever he had influence, induced the representatives of other foreign Governments to back him up in all sorts of offensive and iniquitous proceedings calculated to promote the Confederate rebellion, and finally, after the capture of New-Orleans by our forces, failing to find any past cause of complaint against Gen. BUTLER on his own account or on account of the French citizens of New-Orleans, he indicted a long list of infamous charges against him, on behalf of Germans, Spaniards and Greeks ""Jews, Turks and Infidels"" -- and sent it directly to his Government at Paris. This paper did more, perhaps, than all else to blacken the name of Gen. BUTLER in the eyes of Europe. But justice overtook the MEJAN at last.

ROSECRANS' body-guard."" Their notions of discipline and subordination are exactly the same as those of the officers who resigned on the Potomac in consequence of Gen. MCCLELLAN's removal, and of those orators and writers who have ever since been reviling the Government for the liberty it took in depriving him of his command. Between holding that the President has no right to exercise his own judgment in the choice of a Commander-in-Chief, and holding that every private has a right to decide on the day of battle whether he shall fight or not, or if he does, who shall command him, there is no logical stopping-place. So, if Gen. MCCLELLAN be a martyr, by all means let us have a military mass meeting before every engagement, in order to give the down-trodden privates and Corporals an opportunity of telling the General how they feel about his strategy and his tactics, and of discussing what they had better do under the circumstances. We beg to inform the ""Anderson Troop,"" however, that if their lot had been cast a little further South, and they had but to transact business with Gen.

Displeased with the Emancipation Proclamation,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/10/archives/kentucky-and-the-proclamation.html,Displeased with the Emancipation Proclamation,"-- The Legislature of Kentucky met on Thursday, and Gov. ROBINSON yesterday sent in his Message to the body. It will be seen by the telegraphic mention of it, that the Governor utters his emphatic displeasure with the Emancipation Proclamation of President LINCOLN, and calls on the Legislature also to put on record its protest against the Proclamation. It was not expected that the people of the Border Slave States would yield the same cordial support to the Emancipation edict that the rest of the loyal States have done. The force of law, education and habit retards the development of a war policy based on the emancipation of slaves in States where Slavery has been an institution for generations. The Border Slave States have held on remarkably well to their loyalty, considering the pressure internal and external that has been applied to them by the rebels. They have conquered their prejudices in many particulars, and may yet conquer their present repugnance to the Proclamation. The truly loyal men of the Border States have long since reached and proclaimed the doctrine that if the Union and Slavery became incompatible they would surrender Slavery rather than the Union. They do not believe that the necessity for one or the other to be overthrown yet exists. But the President does, and so do the vast majority of the loyal people of the country.

Operatives,"-- Yesterday afternoon the new and splendid ship George Griswold, laden with gifts of food for the famished operatives of Lancashire, was towed down the Bay of New-York, and this morning she will spread her sails, and start on her voyage across the wide ocean, for the shores of England. As she moved down the Bay yesterday, she was saluted by several British vessels in the harbor; and the crowd of sailors and citizens on her deck, as well as on the steamer which towed her out, and on the other vessels in the vicinity, exhibited their generous enthusiasm by the most vociferous shouts and cheers. A nobler spectacle was never seen in our beautiful Bay. In a few weeks she will arrive in Liverpool, and, perhaps before the close of the month, her stores will have been distributed to the hungry, and the blessings of those who are ready to perish will have been called down upon America.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SAILING OF THE SHIP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SAILING OF THE SHIP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b8f06eb6-ffaf-5c14-8f97-fafb19f2a4fc,278,nyt://article/b8f06eb6-ffaf-5c14-8f97-fafb19f2a4fc,

The evidence showed that a larger quantity of oats were shipped on board, a portion of them being shipped in binns on deck. While the boat was passing through Lake Champlain in tow of a steamer, the usual mode of going through the lake, a gale arose, and as the boat turned Cumberland Head, to go into Pittsburgh, to avoid the violence of the gate, the boats were dashed against each other, and one of the binns gave way and a portion of the oats were lost overboard. The bill of lading was a clean bill of lading, with the usual exemption from perils of the seas. The claimant sought to set off against the libelous demand the value of the oats so lost overboard. The libelant proposed to meet this by proving that it was the usage of that particular trade to carry oats thus, in binns on deck.

Brown--collision","FEARFUL COLLISION ON THE NORTH RIVER -SINGULAR AND FATAL ACCIDENT TO A PILOT. -- About 8 A.M. yesterday a fearful collision occurred between the ferryboat Hudson, of the Jersey City and Desbrosses-street Ferry, and the propeller towboat Wm.O. Brown, belonging to the New-Jersey Lighter and Transportation Company, which resulted in the death of a young man named JOHN GADDIS, son of Mr. GADDIS, Paymaster of the New-Jersey Railroad Company. The particulars were as follows: The boats were crossing the river in opposite directions, at which time the pilot of the towboat was in the cabin eating his breakfast, and the deceased, Mr. GADDIS, was at the wheel in the pilot-house. The pilot, JOHN KEARNEY, heard the bell ring to slow, and a moment after to stop. He then went outside, and as he did so the bow of the tug-boat struck the ferry-boat just aft of the wheel with such tremendous force that she was thrown on her beam ends. Mr. GADDIS was thrown against the pilot-house door with such force that the hinges and fastenings were broken away, and his body went overboard and was picked up by a revenue boat, but life was extinct. The ferry-boat escaped with but slight injury. The deck planks on the tug boat were started and the water tank below broke loose and sprung aleak, which at first caused alarm, as it was supposed the tug was sinking. Mr. GADDIS' body was brought to the ferry depot, foot of Chambers-street, where an investigation was held by Coroner COLLIN, of New-York. The testimony showed that it was the determination of the pilot on the ferryboat to cross the bows of the propeller; that the former had ample time to go behind the latter, and thereby the collision might very easily have been avoided. Several witnesses were examined, and all concurred in the above state of facts. At the conclusion of the testimony the Jury rendered the following verdict: ""We find that the deceased came to his death in consequence of injuries produced by a collision between the propeller William O. Brown and the Jersey City ferryboat Hudson, on on the 9th day of January, 1863; and we believe that the pilot of the Hudson could have avoided a collision, and we think he censurable for neglect of proper caution and care.""

This object they accomplished completely. The main body of the Confederate army had passed through the town on Friday and Saturday, the 2d and 3d of May.

MCCLELLAN moderated his expectations considerably, and confined himself to saying that his forces were ""inferior to those of the enemy,"" but that he should ""venture to hold him in check."" His purpose of a rapid pursuit seems to have been at once abandoned. Gen. FRANKLIN left Yorktown for West Point on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, attempting to land to attack the retreating column of the rebels in flank, was repulsed -- the main body of Gen.

"A most ingenious fraud in regard to New-Orleans Bank Notes, has been perpetrated by a money broker upon one of the most respectable banking firms in Wall-street, under the following peculiar circumstances. It is a shrewd swindle, and has created much talk among those who have heard of it. GEORGE D. ARTHUR & CO., of No. 34 Wall-street, are the victims. It appears by the affidavit of GEORGE H. LE HURAY, one of the firm, upon which Judge MCCUNN issued his warrant, and the party was arrested by Officer RICHARD DOUGHERTY, that on the 14Th of last November, a person named JOSEPH A. LEVY, doing business in Nassau-street as a money broker, hastily went into GEORGE D. ARTHUR & CO's., and inquired what they would give for the notes of the Bank of New-Orleans. Mr. LE HURAY said they would give 90 per cent for them. LEVY thereupon produced five $100 bills of the Bank of New-Orleans, and said he would take 90 cents. Mr. LE HURAY took them, and after giving them a careful examination, said he did not feel quite satisfied that they were all right. LEVY said there could be no doubt about the bills; that he knew the source they came from, and that they were good. Mr. LE HURAY, not knowing anything positively against the bills, and believing the representations of LEVY to be true, thereupon paid LEVY $450 cash for them. ARTHUR & CO. then sold them to a Mr. H.F. MILLER, with the firm of P.C. & WM.B. BAKER, of this City, who are in the New-Orleans trade, and as Mr. MILLER was about to proceed to New-Orleans, ARTHUR & CO. received 95 cents on the dollar for the bills. Upon MILLER's arrival in New-Orleans, he discovered that the bills were entirely worthless, being the old notes of the Bank of New-Orleans, which had long since been canceled, and deposited with the State Auditor at Baton Rouge. The Bank having its securities filed with the Auditor, upon which their circulation depends, is compelled, in taking these securities up, to cancel their bills, which is done by cross-cutting them on each of their corners and across their faces, by what is called a canceling hammer, used by banks for this purpose. They are thus effectually destroyed for the purpose of circulation, and become then the vouchers of the State Auditor for the protection of his department and the bank that its securities have been canceled. The notes thus bring in the Auditor's office, were stolen from it when our army took possession of Baton Rouge, and the manner the bills were afterward prepared and patched up by those who got possession of them, for circulation, is most curious and skilfully ingenious. Pieces of the most delicate imaginable tissue paper had been pasted over the backs of them, and the edges of the cross cut carefully brought together and so admirably united that the keenest eye, unless probably that of an expert's, could not detect the crosscuts upon the faces of the bills, and most any one would be deceived by them, until by constant circulation and handling, the tissue paper becomes worn out and breaks over the cuts, permitting the edges to turn up. Even then a person used only to ordinarily handling money would take them without suspicion. It is not known what amount of these notes were taken from the Auditor's office, but it is supposed to be a very large quantity, and sent North, as speculators going to New-Orleans would readily buy them, if such a firm as ARTHUR & CO. could be deceived by them. As soon as ARTHUR & CO. were informed of the fraud, they immediately redeemed the notes here, and caused the arrest of LEVY, who was brought before Judge MCCUNN, where the matter is still pending. It is to be hoped that not many of these bills have yet been offered here as they are a most dangerous fraud. It appears that the Bank of New-Orleans some time since cautioned the public against them, but it is quite probable that but few have seen the notice, especially brokers and Southern dealers.

Bickerings Between,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/11/archives/east-and-west.html,Bickerings Between,"We think that the men and the newspapers who are trying to stir up a spirit of animosity between the West and the East, had better cease their labors. Those journals in the Western cities, and in this City, who are beginning to make attacks upon New-England, and threatening to expel it from the Union, and those journals in New-England who are replying feelingly to these assaults, would do well to mutually ground arms, lest these stray shots lead to skirmishes, and end in close quarters and a general hullaballoo. There is and can be no geographical quarrel in this country. The present war is not a struggle between two points of the compass, North and South, but, as we are often enough told, between the principles of aristocracy and slavery on the one hand, and democracy and freedom on the other. There is and can be no such contest of fundamental political principles between the Free States of the East and those, of the West. Nevertheless touch bad blood may be stirred up between any two sections or any two or more States by bad and designing men playing upon popular prejudices; and the peace, happiness and permanent unity of the country may thus be constantly threatened. There are no two sections, nor two States, nor two villages, nor hardly two men in the land, but could make up plausible grounds of dissatisfaction or quarrel, or battle, with each other. But the beauty of our political system is that it furnishes means of removing all just causes of dissatisfaction, and adjusting peacefully all quarrels. The charges in the present case seem to be, on the one hand, in general, that New-England is fanatical; and, on the other, that the assailants of New-England are something worse even than that. Both charges may be perfectly true, and yet so long as the constitutional rights of each section and every State are respected, we do not see why they should not live together forever on terms of amity and in political fraternity. So let the bickerings be stopped, we would like to say, before they are begun.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EAST AND WEST.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EAST AND WEST.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2afd9459-8c83-5f49-8f6a-3dbf4469abed,355,nyt://article/2afd9459-8c83-5f49-8f6a-3dbf4469abed,

The picture of those high-mettled scions of Southern chivalry, whose main occupation appeared to be popping champagne corks and manufacturing claret punch, was enough to set even the dull imagination of John Bull on fire. But how terribly changed all that has been in two years. Now any account of the condition of the rebel soldiers is only a statement of raggedness and filth, and brings up only visions of things ""both common and unclean"" -- and instead of the foaming beakers of champagne and the cool draughts of claret which were then apparently the ""steady drink"" of the rebel private soldiers, we have from the Richmond papers the melancholy statement that apple brandy, at $20 a gallon, is now the best and cheapest liquor in that market, while ""the vilest whisky, which, before the war, a gentleman would not give to his negroes, is now eagerly sought after and bought at from $25 to $30 a gallon.""

For many years past they have been in a condition of discontent, not far removed from rebellion; and during Sir HENRY WARD's Administration, twelve years ago, there was an actual outbreak, which was repressed with great severity. Since then they have confined themselves to paper hostilities. At the opening of every session of the Legislature, an address was presented to the Governor, informing him of the desire of the people to be annexed to Greece, and he as regularly replied that their prayer would not be granted; and they then, refusing to do any further business, were regularly prorogued or dissolved. Mr. GLADSTONE was sent out as a Commissioner or pacificator, soon after the publication of his pamphlet on the Neapolitan prisons, and it was supposed that his well-known philhellenism would give weight to his counsels. It did nothing of the kind. He was met by the stereotyped request for emancipation from British control, and as he had no authority to negotiate on this basis, he came home a sadder and wiser man, having accomplished nothing. Since then Ionian politics have been marked by a monotony for which there is no parallel in the annals of discontent. The islands suffered greatly from the want of all legislation. Everything which depended on parliamentary action tell into decay very soon, and there appeared to be no help for it, as the Parliament would not legislate unless notice were taken of its petitions, and the Executive invariably sent them back unnoticed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cession of the Ionian Islands to Greece --English Politics in the East.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cession of the Ionian Islands to Greece --English Politics in the East.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3dc1006a-46de-5f17-aa0b-1929c5bf7bb3,854,nyt://article/3dc1006a-46de-5f17-aa0b-1929c5bf7bb3,

Officers and soldiers swarm on every square, and in every shop. It is very easy to believe the statement made in the Senate on Wednesday last, by WILSON, of Massachusetts, that there are now seven thousand eight hundred officers absent from the army, with or without leave, and 411 have deserted from the front. Those in the City are of course mostly from the Army of the Potomac; and we do not wonder that they prefer the City to the camp -- the saloons, theatres and family firesides to the tents and huts along Aquia Creek and the Rappahaanock. The Metropolis is a very nice place to loaf in; and when the army is doing nothing, the men doubtless can't see but what they might as well enjoy themselves.

Additional French troops are imperatively called for in Mexico, to the extent of ten thousand men. Cotton had a downward tendency in the Liverpool market, owing to the stock being largely in excess of the estimates. Breadstuffs were steady and unchanged. Provisions were very dull.

A room was shown him, with which he expressed himself satisfied, and his baggage was accordingly taken to the apartment.

The girl shortly returned with the report that his room had a very strange appearance, and that there were balls and powder scattered on the table and floor.

He acknowledges at the same time that ""the subject of the controversy"" in which the hard words which have led to all our present wars were spoken, was Slavery; and that out of this controversy arose all that mutual contempt, and that disregard for the constituted authorities, which he alleges to have been the direct cause of the civil war. And it is clear, from the general tenor of his Message, that his idea of a perfect, indissoluble Union is one in which nothing shall be said at the North which shall hurt the feelings of people at the South, and vice versa. In this he but expresses the sentiments of the greater portion of the Democratic Party. With them no picture of national happiness and prosperity is complete in which there is any writing, or preaching, or talking against Slavery, or in which Slavery is ever mentioned except in praise. The South, they say, is on this subject extremely sensitive. Its people are excitable, and will not submit to these attacks on their social organization.

His first station was in Western Florida, at Pensacola, where he made several efforts to take Fort Pickens, but all his operations and efforts there ended in our capturing Pensacola and the fortifications he had erected with such vast labor. From Florida he moved his army Northward, and for the last year he has been campaigning in the Southwest, with almost invariably bad success. On the Cumberland he was driven hack, at Shiloh he was badly beaten, and in East Tennessee he did nothing. When, three or four months ago, he marched at the head of a great army into Northern Kentucky, and from the Capital of the State issued his high-sounding Proclamation to the People of the Northwest, it was only that he might fight a useless fight at Perryville, wheel round again with his force to the South, and travel back with a disorganized army into Tennessee. From the Eastern part of the latter State he moved to its centre, and took up a position at Murfreesboro, from whence he announced his purpose first to capture Nashville, and then follow up his assured victory by planting his flag on the banks of the Ohio. He remained stationary at Murfreesboro for over two months, when ROSECRANS, weary of waiting for his assault, marched out and gave him battle in his chosen position, with results now known to all the world.

"The, and the National Income",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/11/archives/our-war-expenditures-and-national-income-come.html,"The, and the National Income","-- The value of the taxable property in New-York is officially stated at $571,967,345. This magnificent accumulation of wealth, which constitutes the glory of the third City in the world, is said to be about equal in value to one year's net profits of the loyal States, after paying the cost of the war. This estimate is approximately correct. There is no fear that our people, when possessed of such prodigious resources, will be unable to raise among themselves, without foreign aid, all the funds necessary for the suppression of the rebellion. The ordinary amount of capital continually produced and continually seeking employment, will more than suffice for the supply of the National wants. The census returns show that the real and personal property of the loyal States, which in 1850 was five thousand millions of dollars, had in 1860 accumulated to twelve thousand millions. At this ratio of yearly growth, the loyal States would be gaining one thousand and fifty millions of dollars a year, after paying for the subsistence of the people, and deducting the loss of productive laborers for the army. The rest of our exuberant productive forces -- our steam engines, our multiplying machinery, our labor-saving inventions, our fertile land -- are as busily employed as ever in the work of enriching the nation. The aggregate products this year will probably be not less, but greater, than in 1860.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR WAR EXPENDITURES AND NATIONAL INCOME.; COME.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR WAR EXPENDITURES AND NATIONAL INCOME.; COME.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e6ab96da-3160-5daf-8386-50e49f29974b,635,nyt://article/e6ab96da-3160-5daf-8386-50e49f29974b,

D.; Holy Land and Europe; American Presbyte...","-- The republication of Mr. BOYD'S Essays in this country was not very happily heralded in the beginning. The first volume was put forth as The Recreations of a Country Parson. Naturally enough, the idea occurred to all apprehensive minds that what was recreation for a country parson would be anything but fun for his audience. At least it was with some such impression that we turned over the pages of that first book. This wore away, however, as successive chapters unfolded themselves, until finally the author revealed himself to our surprised senses as one of the most pleasing essayists of the age. It is urged against him that he never rises above a certain level; but it must be borne in mind that that level is in itself considerably above that of the common sea of literature, and also that he very seldom falls below it. He tells a great many simple truths -- truths that are generally recognized by the popular mind without dispute; but he tells them in an unostentatious, conversational way, and not with the important air of one who fancies he has discovered new continents in the wake of other explorers. There is a certain sameness about his writings; but to find fault with an author for this would be about as reasonable as to find fault with a cherry tree for bringing forth each successive season nothing but cherries. If the cherries are good, we should be content, and willing to look for peaches and pears on other trees. Each human mind is to be regarded as a piece of machinery specially adapted to the performance of some particular work, and not to the turning out with equal excellence of things as different and varied from each other in mould and nature as horn buttons and silver spoons. The Graver Thoughts of a Country Parson are published by TICKNOR & FIELDS. In this volume the Parson puts on his gown, and speaks to his parish of readers in something of an ex cathedra style. In no respect does this collection of essays differ from his preceding ones, save that formerly he spoke of trifles, and now he discourses of eternal interests. He preaches a cheerful religion, adapted to human needs and human capacity. With the chapter on ""Christian Self-Denial"" we are especially pleased. The Parson takes a sensible, manly stand against the too-prevalent idea that self-torment is one of the surest and most acceptable means of praising and pleasing God.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Reviews', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed5e97b2-8fbb-544d-bb00-524f78577faa,2314,nyt://article/ed5e97b2-8fbb-544d-bb00-524f78577faa,

BRAGG'S army, when it occupied Murfreeshore, was exactly in the geographical centre of the State of Ten nessee. It was a capital position for offence or defence. From there he guarded East Tennessee, the most important strategic region in the Southern Confederacy; he menaced ROSECRANS at Nashville; he threatened GRANT'S army in the rear, and could reinforce Vicksburgh, as is proved by the fact that, just before the late battle, he sent ten thousand men there; he guarded the States of Alabama and Georgia on the north; and in case he defeated ROSECRANS, he would gain control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, and probably of the whole State of Tennessee; and he would also be in an admirable position to march up to the northern line of Kentucky, from which he retreated before Gen. BUELL, three months ago. Murfreesboro itself had been chosen by BRAGG, for its natural and artificial advantages, and had been well fortified during the two months he occupied it. It had railroad connections with the Charleston and Memphis road, and the lines connected therewith, running south and east as far as Richmond. It was in the centre of a region which abounded with provisions and forage -- if any part of the South may be said to do so. In all military aspects, Murfreesboro was a good position. It was a point from which the rebel commander would never have retreated if it had been at all possible for him to hold it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Bragg at Tullahoma--The Grand Bearings of Rosecrans' Victory."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Bragg at Tullahoma--The Grand Bearings of Rosecrans' Victory."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7aae3f89-539f-5bbd-891b-8c8f7d6fbfa3,926,nyt://article/7aae3f89-539f-5bbd-891b-8c8f7d6fbfa3,

What are we to make of the constant fulminations of the Kentucky senators and Representatives at Washington against the Executive policy? How happens it that of the three slaveholding Border States, Maryland, Missouri and Kentucky, the last alone should be kindled into rage? Missouri, five years ago, was as extreme in its devotion to Slavery as South Carolina itself, and even more furious. Its slave population, in the decade between 1850 and 1860, increased thirty-one and a half per cent., while that of Kentucky increased less than seven per cent. And yet we find Missouri promptly and cordially endorcing the emancipation propositions of the President, by a large majority of its popular vote. We see, too, the leading men of Maryland, and the ablest portion of its Press, taking the same bold stand; and there is no longer a question that the State will, not long hence, concur formally in the plan of compensated emancipation. If Gov. GAMBLE and Gov. BRADFORD can yield so pleasantly to the new necessities of the day, why should Gov. ROBINSON storm so fearfully? If the present Congressmen from Missouri and Maryland, opposed to emancipation as most of them personally are, can submit with such quiet grace to the new policy, why should the neighbors and followers of HENRY CLAY -- the great Kentuckian, who always declared Slavery to be a great misfortune to Kentucky -- why, we ask, should Mr. WICKLIFFE and his colleagues blaze with such indignation because the Government has at last opened a way by which their State may be cleared of Slavery?

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/13/archives/city-inspectors-report.html,,"We publish this morning the annual report of the City Inspector. It is taken up with the usual subjects, discussed in pretty much the old way. The only conclusion that one can come to, in reading the reports of this Department from year to year, is that things are all wrong. The City is in bad condition: its streets, with the exception of Broadway, are filthy; it has a bad system of sewerage and drainage; thousands of its people live in cellars whose atmosphere is death; slaughter-houses, livery stables and fat-boiling establishments are scattered all over it; barrels of abomination and heaps of ashes line its sidewalks and block up its gutters; some of its piers are used as permanent depots for the accumulation of street manure, and the air is ""poisoned with the stench emitted by these reeking and pestiferous mounds of uncleanliness."" And yet, notwithstanding the fact that these nuisances, and a hundred others, are patent to every eye, and recognized by every sense, the officers whose duty it is to attend to the sanitary condition of the City can take no cognizance of them, nor adopt any measures to remove them. According to the City Inspector, they have no power to do so. The streets and all their dirt are in the hands of Contractor HACKLEY, who neglects his work, assigns his duties to sub-contractors, and only secures for himself enormous profits; and Mr. DELAVAN can only hope that the newly chosen Counsel to the Corporation may find something in the contract making it possible to carry into effect its proposed objects, and thereby secure a cleanly condition of the City. ""But,"" says he, ""should such effort be, as is apprehended, a fruitless one, there will be no other remedy at hand than to promptly put an end to the contract, the provisions of which have been so often misconstrued, perverted or violated, to the detriment of the City."" About the other innumerable public offences in the City, the City Inspector's Department can say nothing; or, rather, it can do nothing but annually say a little about them. It is evident that the functionary should either have more authority -- with greater responsibility -- in certain matters, or his costly department should be altogether abolished, and the sanitary condition of the City put in charge of men who have both capacity, knowledge and power. We hope the new Common Council will take speedy action upon this question, whose bearings upon the greatness and well-doing of New-York are more important than any other.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""CITY INSPECTOR'S REPORT."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""CITY INSPECTOR'S REPORT."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/893ce79a-68a4-5336-86b0-e3cd4957c6be,537,nyt://article/893ce79a-68a4-5336-86b0-e3cd4957c6be,

His presence here has given rise to many speculations as to the object of his visit, and the Anti-Administration journals generally have busied themselves to circulate most incorrect and even calumnious reports relative to his views, operations, and intentions. His private and social meeting with the financial men of New-York, which took place at the residence of Mr. JOHN J. CISCO, United States Treasurer of this district, on Saturday evening, has been referred to by the aforesaid journals in statements full of misrepresentations and inaccuracies. The gathering alluded to was, it is true, partly of a business character. But it was not, nor was it intended to be formal. Neither was it expected that immediate practical results would flow from it. It was designed to bring together the Secretary and the moneyed men of our city in order to secure a full and free interchange of opinions -- which could not be obtained so advantageously in a formal public meeting. It was much the same species of gathering which took place a year and a-half since between the same gentlemen, at the same place, and which it will be recollected resulted in the prompt taking of the hundred and fifty million loan, and the issue of the 7-30s. On that occasion, as on this, the preliminary meeting was of a partially social character, resulting in the call of a subsequent formal meeting, at which the practical results desired were attained. It is not at all improbable that the meeting of Saturday will partake of much the same nature. Mr. CHASE took occasion to converse with all present, including Mayor OPDYKE, Mr. A.A. Low, and the managing officers of our leading Banks. It was evident from his remarks, that the Secretary fully appreciated the support which the moneyed men of New-York have given to the Government in its hour of need; that he comprehended the critical condition of the nation's finances; that he was keenly alive to the necessity for promptly discharging the Government indebtedness to the army, and the many other just claims awaiting settlement. He took occasion to reiterate his confidence in the banking scheme already proposed by him.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; SECRETARY CHASE IN NEW-YORK.

There have been good reasons for this, unquestionably. In the first place, the Army of the Potomac has, at different times since its organization, outnumbered our other armies, by great odds. In the second place, it has been charged with graver duties than any other -- at least, with duties absorbing more of the interest and exciting more of the sensibilities of the people, to wit: 1. The defence of the National Capital, when menaced at different times by the rebels. 2. The capture of Richmond, and the dispersion of the rebellious Government holding its defiant councils there. It might be added, perhaps, that the Army of the Potomac is the first created great army of the country -- that its organization was attended with extraordinary commotions and some serious dangers, such as the deep excitement that continued so long after the first battle of Bull Run, and the intense passion, bordering on popular phrensy, at the North, following the murder of Massachusetts troops by the mob in Baltimore. The Army has, from these causes, drawn around itself much of the interest that, by a law of nature, always attends the ""first-born;"" and the dangers that attended its birth, and cling to its career, have given it a hold on the popular sympathy, and kept alive an interest in its fate that no other army of the Republic can boast of.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Army of the Potomac.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Army of the Potomac.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e0f46bbe-096e-538c-bd80-6f9a28b071d2,987,nyt://article/e0f46bbe-096e-538c-bd80-6f9a28b071d2,

Speech on How to Raise Money for the Government--House,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/14/archives/the-national-finances-how-to-raise-money-for-the-support-of-the.html,Speech on How to Raise Money for the Government--House,"Mr. CHAIRMAN: The immediate requirements of the Treasury are not less than $100,000,000. Before you can pass this bill through both Houses, have it approved by the President, and get bonds and notes engraved, printed and issued, at least $50,000,000 more will be required. The pressing demands upon the Treasury, between this and the 1st of next month, for the pay of soldiers and other creditors may be put down at $150,000,000. The gold and silver in the banks in New-York, Boston, and Philadelphia, on the 1st of this month, probably did not exceed $50,000,000; to which you may add the gold and silver in all other banks in all the loyal States, as will appear in official reports to the 1st of January, 1863, and the whole sum will not exceed $86,000,000. All this coin is necessary for the banks to take care of their own liabilities; but even if the Secretary of the Treasury could, on the credit of the Government, by a sale of bonds at any sacrifice, or by the aid of the military power, visit every bank in the country, and by force compel all this coin to be paid into the Treasury, it would not pay fifty cents on the dollar of the demands due from the Government, and which ought to be paid in the next twenty days. It is, therefore, perfectly plain, that even the small sum of $150,000,000 now due, cannot be paid in gold. It would be a great gratification to me, and, I doubt not, to every other loyal citizen, if it were otherwise. It is no fault of the Secretary or of Congress, that gold cannot now be paid to the soldiers and other creditors. It is simply an impossibility, by any plan, to get enough for that purpose.

The rebel Generals CHEATHAM and McCOUN are said to be at Shelbyville with their divisions, and expecting to be reinforced by LONGSTREET and his corps from the Richmond army, numbering thirty thousand men. It will be remembered that we have had several reports from Federicksburgh that the rebel army, or a portion of it, was apparently leaving the line of the Rappahannock and going in the direction of Richmond, and it is possible that this transfer of LONGSTREET's Corps to strengthen BRAGG's Army has been made, as the line of railroad communication through North and South Carolina and Alabama is still open. It would appear, in this case, that another desperate effort to defeat the National army under Gen. ROSECRANS is to be made, even at the risk of weakening the rebel army under LEE, which disputes Gen. BURNSIDE's way to Richmond. Our correspondent states, also, that four thousand rebels, with two full batteries of artillery, under FORREST, WHEELER and STARNES, have marched toward Charlotte, forty miles west of Nashville, with the view of destroying the transports in the Cumberland River with supplies for Gen. ROSECRANS' army. Eight regiments of our troops -- four cavalry and four infantry -- have, however, been sent in pursuit. One of our transports, loaded with Commissary and Quartermasters' stores, has already been captured and destroyed. It is reported, also, that the guerilla MORGAN is again in Kentucky, medicating damage to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. With the Cumberland properly patroled by gunboats, however, Gen.

The congregation have worshiped for many years in the elegant edifice on the corner of Church and Franklin streets, but, as the location was too far down town, it was determined to erect a new building in a more convenient place. A suitable lot was obtained on the south side of Twenty-second-street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, and the corner stone laid some six months ago. This church is now entirely completed and ready for occupation. The carpets are down, the seats cushioned, and the building presents none of that lack of finish so often observable in new ecclesiastical edifices. The style of the church is Gothic; the front is of yellow stone, provided with three entrances, and surmounted by a spire. The interior is very neat and elegant. The walls are of a light yellow color, and painted so as to imitate stone. A gallery of dark oak extends around three sides of the church, and is supported by the pillars rising from the nave. The windows are of painted glass in light, cheerful colors, and the chancel is roofed with glass, imitating in brilliant golden hues the rays of the sun extending down to a field of blue dotted with stars. On the rear wall of the apsis, in which is the chancel, are aflixed three tablets, on which are inscribed the Lord's Prayer, the Decalogue and the Creed. The pulpit is at the right hand, in the old-fashioned half-barrel style, and is surmounted by a heavy and handsomely carved sounding board. The pews in the church are of oak, without doors, and comfortable for setters. The organ loft is slightly elevated above the gallery, is furnished with an elegant oak screen, and contains an organ built by ERBEN -- the case of which is in Gothic style, and in design a copy of that in Ascension Church in Fifth-avenue. The church will seat about a thousand persons.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Church Du Saint Esprit, ITS CONSECRATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Church Du Saint Esprit, ITS CONSECRATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f392a5dc-f87d-594b-ba53-1ebe88fad202,568,nyt://article/f392a5dc-f87d-594b-ba53-1ebe88fad202,

Dr. LYMAN BEECHER, whose dead was announced in the TIMES of Sunday, must have held a prominent place in the affections of the people among whom he had ministered during his many years' service as a Gospel preacher -- and that he also was second to none in the esteem of the citizens of Brooklyn, was fully evinced yesterday, by the spontaneous outpouring of the people, who filled Plymouth Church on the occasion of his obsequies. Long before the time appointed for the commencement of the funeral ceremonies, large crowds had gathered in Orange street, eager to gain admission into the church, and when the doors were opened, the throng of humanity that commenced to pour in appeared to be endless. It was not long thereafter when the edifice was packed to density -- every nook and corner having an occupant -- and the entire assemblage presenting a coup d'oeil seldom equaled, and never excelled. Meanwhile, numbers continued to swell the crowd outside, which had been unable to obtain admittance. The clergy had, by special invitation, assembled in the lecture-room in the rear of the church, whence they proceeded to join in the procession, which started from the residence of the deceased and arrived at the church at 2 o'clock P.M. Among the clergymen present, we noticed the Rev. Drs. Hitchcock, A.D. Smith, Hatfield, Floy, Canfield, Cuyler, Cox, T.A. Hills, and Rev. Messrs. Henry Belden, S. Bliss, Foss, Baylis, Gloucester, Baldwin, Holme, and numerous others of this City and Brooklyn, besides clerical representatives of nearly all evangelical denominations from Connecticut, Massachusetts and New-York State. The principal mourners were Mrs. Lyman Beecher, widow of the deceased, and his sons Rev. H.W. Beecher, Rev. Chas. Beecher, Rev. Wm.H. Beecher, Rev. Thomas K. Beecher, and his daughters Miss Catharine E. Beecher, Mrs. H.B. Stowe, Mrs. Hooker and Mrs. Perkins, who were followed by a long train of distant relatives and intimate personal friends of the deceased. On the arrival of the cortege the remains were placed immediately in front of the pulpit, the near relatives taking front seats, and the ministers occupying the news which had been reserved for them on each side of the north aisle. The coffin was of rosewood, having six silver handles for the pall-bearers, and on the lid a cross, two wreaths of evergreen, and a silver plate bearing the following inscription:",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBSEQUIES OF REV.

Provision is made for guarding the negroes and preventing crime, and the planters were to pay certain stipulated prices per month for their labor.

what will he do with it,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/16/archives/mcclernands-army-what-will-he-do-with-it.html,what will he do with it,"Beyond the fact that the expedition under Gen. SHERMAN against Vicksburgh has been withdrawn by Gen, McCLERNAND, and the whole force reembarked and moved up the Mississippi River, we know nothing definite about it. One report says that the attack on Vicksburgh has not been abandoned, but is about to be made from another direction. We are at a loss to conjecture on what side that stronghold could be approached more feasibly than on the one selected by SHERMAN. Another report says that a council of war was held on board of the fleet after Vicksburgh was given up, and a new place decided on for attack. And following this report is an account of part of the expedition moving up White River. The inference on the face of these statements is that some point in Arkansas is to be attacked. But we apprehend this is not the case; or if there be truth in it, only a partial occupation will be found for MCCLERNAND's army up White River. There is a battery, it is well known, at or near St. Charles, on White River, which once before checked the progress of our gunboats up that stream. The horrible tragedy to the steamer Mound City occurred there, and the rebels disgraced humanity by shooting our scalded seamen, who threw themselves into the river while writhing in horrible torture from the steam of an exploded boiler. It would be well enough, if Gen. MCCLERNAND has an adequate force and nothing else for it to do, to send a detachment up White River, and destroy the fortifications near St. Charles; and he may have done so. But it is hardly probable he would take his entire force, or the half, or the fourth of it, to perform that insignificant job. If the attempt be made and the work done, there would be nothing in the region beyond to employ the army. At the little town of Des Arc, still further up, there is said to be some rebel manufacturing establishments started, including one for powder. It may be worth while to penetrate to Des Arc and put an end to that enterprise. But the Army that assails Vicksburgh is not needed for these trifling achievements. If MCCLERNAND wishes to meet and fight an enemy, he need not turn his army toward Arkansas at all. He will find no considerable force of Rebels, and no strongholds now in that State. If he wishes to go into the Cotton trade, he can not do better, perhaps, than occupy the towns on the White and the Arkansas rivers. The planters will cheerfully do as they did in all the region round about Helena -- sell cotton freely on consideration of having their slaves kept out of the Union camps and forced to stay on their plantations. But this army, we hope, will be put to no such base uses.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""McClernand's Army What Will He Do With It?"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""McClernand's Army What Will He Do With It?"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e30d17f-0a48-5ed4-a8d4-3ec1a1884607,837,nyt://article/9e30d17f-0a48-5ed4-a8d4-3ec1a1884607,

Plaintiff's dress was caught on a nail, and she ran along for some distance, and being unable to extricate herself, was thrown violently upon the pavement. A crowd was attracted and the car stopped. Her clothes were completely torn from her person. She was conducted to a neighboring drug-store, where she was attended to.

An English actor, whatever his standing, can hardly fail to borrow something from his predecessors. Experience is always the bully of Genius, until it becomes its slave. It is the red tape of life, finding what can be, by what has been done. With us the flimsiest tradition concerning SHAKESPEARE is a matter of awful concern. The Germans, freed from these restraints, and being destitute of veneration for anything except intellect, have succeeded better than any other people in bringing a cool judgment to the consideration of works that are, for the most part, immured in histrionic rubbish, and involved in the comments of common-place commentators. It must be admitted that the revival inaugurated by the three great names we have mentioned never progressed very far as a means of public amusement and instruction. Its best fruits reverted to the literary source whence they emanated. No literature can boast a more careful and kindly regard for the English Bard than the German.

A resolution offered by Mr. MCDOUGALL, of California, directing an inquiry into the construction and capabilities of our iron-clad vessels, was rejected by a tie vote. A bill giving authority to the heads of Departments to appoint persons temporarily to discharge their duties, was reported from the Judiciary Committee.

W.; The Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua Critically Examined","The ludicrous side of the experience of good Bishop COLENSO, who went to the Cape to convert the Zulu Kaffirs and came back converted by them, is too palpable to have escaped the popular eye; and the reading public on both sides of the Atlantic have heartily enjoyed a joke which is all the more enjoyable in that it springs from a soil not hitherto supposed capable of that kind of yield. It is not the first time that missionaries have met with the like discomfiture. HENRY MARTYN, who labored among the Persian Mahometans, records that he found no difficulty in making them believe all he told them of the Scripture miracles; but they directly paralleled them by wonders of their own. They were proof against any argument from the resurrection because they held that their own sheiks had the power of raising the dead! Who knows, if missionaries were wont to emulate the candor of COLENSO, how frequent such experiences would be seen to be? For ourselves, we are free to confess that we willingly overlook any violation of the conventional dignity of the Episcopal office, whereof the Bishop of Natal may have been guilty in his naive narrative of how he was floored in his first wrestle with the ""Zulumind,"" for the value of the experience itself. If it is lawful, in the spirit of the Apostolical injunction, to be all things to all men to the end to ""win some,"" the good Bishop may be pardoned for having, (though quite unbeknown to himself, we may be sure) caught the ear of our frivolous age by making even the Pentateuch the subject of a ""sensation."" The source of the book, and the circumstances of its publication, have led many who certainly would never otherwise have been tempted to look into biblical exegesis, to consider the weighty matters it suggests. It has had a wide currency, both in Europe and America. Rejoinders and replications are already published and publishing, and the great argument is reopened for discussion before the bar of the public conscience. If we thus assign to The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua Critically Examined an important mission in awakening many to thought on the highest subjects of human speculation, we may be allowed to say that its scientific significance is absolutely null -- that it treats only of topics already exhaustively treated, and that it adds nothing to the vast fabric of biblical criticism raised by the labor of continental, and especially of German scholars.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ARITHMETIC OF THE PENTATEUCH.; THE PENTATEUCH AND BOOK OF JOSHUA CRITICALLY EXAMINED.

A guard of marines detailed for the occasion, under command of Sergt. R.J. ALEXANDER, occupied the centre aisle during the services, standing on either side of the representative coffin of the deceased. Rev. Father OUELLET, Chaplain of the Sixty-ninth Volunteers, or Father WILLETT, as he is sometimes called, sang the Mass, Father MAGUIRE was the Deacon, Father WOODS Sub-Deacon, Father STARR performed the absolution, and Father MCNEIRNEY was Master of Ceremonies. Fathers LAFONT, CURRAN, DONNELLY, FARRELL, NELLIGAN, MALONE and KILLEEN assisted. The en [???]e services were exceedingly imposing, and were witnessed by as many as could crowd within the spacious edifice.

PELL, who is an Englishman, was arrested at Binghamton, Broome County, on suspicion of having been concerned in two forgeries, one on the 4th of September, 1862, for $4,370; and one on the 8th of September, 1862, for $4,700, the same purporting to be checks drawn by F.P. JAMES, a banker of No. 36 Wall-street, on the Bank of North America. The one drawn on the 4th of September was certified at the Bank of North America and paid at the Grocers' Bank. The second forgery was not so successful. It was presented at the Seventh Ward Bank and Grocers' Bank, and refused at both places. It afterwards turned up at the North River Bank, where it was deposited, and a certificate of deposit taken for it. This certificate of deposit was taken to Chicago and negotiated, and afterwards came back to the North River Bank for payment. From certain information received by the officers, suspicion rested upon PELL as being the guilty party, and they immediately went upon his track. Sheriff BOWEN, of Broome County, afforded the officers such facilities as to render the task of arresting PELL a comparatively easy one, and he was, on Friday evening, brought to this City, and locked up. The accused, it is alleged, is an extensive operator, and has pursued his practices for a series of years. He was taken into custody about a year since, on charge of presenting a forged check at the Bank of the Republic for $2,000. He is supposed to have been concerned in a forgery upon the Newark City Bank on the 17th inst., for the sum of $3,207, and upon the Mechanics' Bank, of Newark, for $1,000, and upon the State Bank at Newark for $2,400, all of which were paid in good money. PELL answers the description of the man who presented the checks. He was taken before Justice CONNOLLY yesterday morning for examination.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/375a072e-f3f8-5986-91f3-c316116bdd98,704,nyt://article/375a072e-f3f8-5986-91f3-c316116bdd98,

Grant's cruel order expelling from Department of the Tennessee,"One of the deepest sensations of the war is that produced among the Israelites of this country, by the recent order of Gen. GRANT, excluding them, as a class, from his Military Department. The order, to be sure, was promptly set aside by the President, but the affront to the Israelites, conveyed by its issue, was not so easily effaced. It continues to rankle, and is leading to sharp controversies and bitter feuds in the ranks of the Faithful. It seems that a committee of Jews, in this City, took it upon themselves to thank the authorities at Washington for so promptly annulling the odious order of GRANT. Against the conduct of this committee the bulk of the Jews vehemently protest. They say they have no thanks for an act of simple and imperative justice -- but grounds for deep and just complaint against the Government, that Gen. GRANT has not been dismissed from the service on account of his unrighteous act. The matter has been made to assume an importance that requires a mention of it in our columns, as constituting an exciting chapter in our current history. We therefore present the order of Gen. GRANT, that the public judgment in the premises may rest on a clear perception of the facts:",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gen.

D., on Oratory","The redemption of soiled postage stamps, which has been in progress at the New-York Postoffice about a month, will positively close on Tuesday afternoon. All those who have any soiled postage stamps must avail themselves of the opportunity to have them redeemed on Monday of Tuesday as no more stamps will be redeemed after those days. Postmaster WAKEMAN has given the most liberal construction to his order concerning the redemption, and has not counted in the holidays and Sundays. During the last two days he has detailed an extra force of clerks to wait upon all applicants, and the line has been exhausted several times. All who apply on Monday or Tuesday will be attended to, if it takes a force of a hundred clerks. There need, therefore, be no excuse for any one to complain of the Government for not redeeming its postage stamps in this City. All packages under five dollars are redeemed immediately, and all over that sum are receipted for, and, when counted and pronounced good, are redeemed in turn. Already about a quarter of a million dollars' worth of soiled stamps have been redeemed. At least twenty thousand dollars worth of stamps have been rejected as having been used on letters and subsequently washed. Only a day or two since a package of stamps was received, the backs of which were neatly gummed. Minute investigation, however, developed the fact that every stamp in the package had been used for postage, and subsequently washed.

The Comptroller at once communicated with Capt. DOWLING, of the Sixth Precinct, and the latter official, aided by Sergeants JOURDEN and GOLDEN, of the same Ward, yesterday morning began the work -- ferreting out the den where these notes were made, and the general rendezvous of the persons believed to be implicated in the swindle. The officers first went to a place in Liberty-street, where they lay in wait for some evidence which would enable them to trace the matter a little further than they had yet advanced. They had not long to wait, for soon a boy appeared coming down the stairs of the Liberty-street House, bearing in his arms a large bundle. So certain were the officers that they had now got hold of something tangible, that the boy and bundle were seized in a summary way. The bundle was found to contain five hundred sheets of finely-lithographed notes, purporting to have been issued by the Corporation of the City of New-York, pursuant to an ordinance of Oct. 15, 1862. Upon each sheet there were two hundred of these shinplasters, and of the denominations of five cents, ten cents, twenty-five cents and fifty cents.

He commenced his strange career, as he tells in some of his published sketches, by an extensive pedestrian tour through the Western States; after which he made several voyages down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers in the capacity of a common boatman. He next turned up as a police reporter in Louisville, from which he gradually diverged into the study of medicine. Not liking that, he took up the profession of stenographer, and spent some time as Congressional reporter in Washington. With a capital of fifteen dollars, the net result of his labors in that branch of industry, he set out to see the world; got as far as New-York, spent his money, and shipped before the mast in a New-Bedford whaler. During a voyage of a year and a half to the Indian Ocean, he assisted in the capture of many whales, visited the Azores, Canary, and Cape de Verd Islands, Madagascar, Comoro, and Zanzibar. At Zanzibar a mutiny broke out, and he left the vessel. He spent three months on the island, among the Arabs, and then worked his passage home in a Salem merchantman, visiting St. Helena on the way. The result of this voyage was a Narrative of Adventures in the Whale Fishery, published by the HARPERS in 1844. From that date till 1848, he was engaged in the United States Treasury Department as compiler of bank statistics, and private secretary to Mr. ROBERT J. WALKER. He was next appointed a Lieutenant in the revenue service, and ordered for duty to the Pacific coast. During a voyage round Cape Horn he visited the Brazils, the Island of Juan Fernandez, Lima, and other places of interest, of which he has given some amusing sketches. His visit to Crusoe's Island, published in Harper's Magazine in 1853, attracted considerable attention.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Something of a Traveler.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Something of a Traveler.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6828c547-5ee3-5a15-baa8-60686090b450,773,nyt://article/6828c547-5ee3-5a15-baa8-60686090b450,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/19/archives/amusements.html,,"Mr. WALLACK favored his inconveniently numerous patrons with a revival of VANBRUGH and CIBBER'S comedy of the ""Provoked Husband,"" on Saturday evening, attracting to the exhumation of that delectable fossil one of the most crowded and fashionable audiences of the season. The piece is hardly known to the present generation of theatre-goers, and will not, we think, live in remembrance from its present resuscitation. Sir JOHN VANBRUGH belongs to the dullest period of English dramatic literature, when under the influence of good Queen ANNE, the stage was trying to purify itself of the licentiousness of the previous reign, and to set itself up as a monitor. The ""Provoked Husband"" teaches the lesson that female gamblers bring misery to their homes, and in the end are sure to estrange the affections of their husbands. Wholesome as this lesson may have been in the day when it was given, it has lost its significance now, and the homilies of Lord Townley, and the fashionable flippancies of his lady are alike wearisome. Of plot or intrigue there is really nothing. The analyist looks in vain for anything beyond characterization; listens with unrewarded diligence for an expression higher than a conversational commonplace. The only character that possesses vitality is that of Lady Townley, and it is probable that SHERIDAN, in calling her Lady Teazle and giving her a reasonable opportunity in the ""School for Scandal,"" was actuated by motives of benevolence. It is certain that the two characters are almost identical. For the rest we may say briefly that the piece is long and tiresome, that it has a comic department bearing no relation with the main concern, and that the fun is the fun of clod-hoppers. Why the piece should be produced, except to add another unfortunate husband to the calendar of Mr. WALLACK's Court of Arches, we are at a loss to understand.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cfa07005-d7ea-5b01-8d72-74edd4878512,1052,nyt://article/cfa07005-d7ea-5b01-8d72-74edd4878512,

"and Longstreet, The Armies of",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/20/archives/the-armies-of-rosecrans-and-longstreet.html,"and Longstreet, The Armies of","-- The immense fall of rain and snow in the west and southwest, has put an end to all apprehension that Gen. ROSECRANS would find difficulty in supplying his army at Nashville. All the rivers of Tennessee and Kentucky are at their highest Winter flood. Boats of the heaviest draft known on the western waters can navigate the Cumberland as easily as the Mississippi. The telegraph announces the arrival of twenty boats, yesterday, at Nashville, laden with army supplies. With the river and the railroad to serve him, Gen. ROSECRANS will not be detained from pursuit of the enemy by lack of provisions. It is said, however, that reinforcements are needed before the rebel army, now under the command of LONGSTREET, can be again attacked. This is probable. Our loss at Murfreesboro was doubtless equal to 16 per cent. of the force we had engaged.

We have borne, if not with equanimity, at least with fortitude, during two long years, the covert or avowed hostility of the influential classes in Europe. The rank and fashion of England and the Continent are all against us, or use their immense moral influence in bringing us and our cause into disrepute, in exaggerating our reverses, and discrediting our victories. Much as this chagrined us for a time, everybody knows it has not at all disheartened us. Our soldiers have fought just as bravely as if their praises were on every lip in the ""gilded saloons "" of the aristocracy, and have borne their hardships just as firmly as if there were a thousand duchesses and countesses occupied every night in making pie for them. There is, however, a limit to human endurance, and we greatly fear the revelations made in the intercepted dispatches have brought us close upon it. We needly hardly say that the discovery which so profoundly discourages us is, that, as appears by Mr. MEMMINGER's dispatch of the 25th October to Mr. MASON, the Confederate Plenipotentiary in London, SMITH, of Glasgow, and BROWN, of Edinburgh, have both gone over to the enemy, and are now affording aid and assistance to the rebels.

The Monitor indeed went down, and settled alongside the Central America and the other weak vessels that have nestled snugly on that sea-bottom since coasting began, and from similar causes; but the Passaic and the rest rode out the storm, although their decks were but eighteen inches out of water. High sides, then, are not a necessary feature of a seaworthy vessel. A great billow did not roll over them from stem to stern and swallow them up at a gulp. So long as the welts and rivets of her hu[???] held on, the cabin of the Monitor even was as dry as the saloon of the Adriatic. At the first tidings of her loss, there were most gloomy apprehensions. The last hope of constructing a vessel that would carry armor thick enough, because small in area, to stand modern ordnance, was slender.

The rumors of fighting which have reached us from Washington may be premature, but we shall no doubt soon receive details of another great struggle on the Rappanannock. A still further assurance of this may be found in the Address of Gen. BURNSIDE to his Army, published among our dispatches. It is dated the 20th (Tuesday), and announces in positive terms that another movement against the enemy was about to commence. The crossing probably took place on Wednesday, above Fredericksburgh, a simultaneous movement being made below as a feint, which, however, would be turned into a real attack, should circumstances justify it.

POPE The public were greatly surprised yesterday to learn the decision of the Court in the case of Major-Gen. PITZ-JOHN PORTER. It was universally anticipated that he would be acquitted of the charges made against him by Gen. POPE -- an anticipation probably based, in great measure, upon the [???]sion that it was impossible to have any high officer of the army convicted and punished for any military offence whatever. Yet we think no one can have read carefully and [???]y, the evidence given on the trial, which we have published very fully, without being convinced of the justice of the sentence he has received, in being cashiered and dismissed the service for disobedience of orders. PORTER was not disloyal in any sense of consciously aiding or abetting the treason of JEFF. DAVIS -- and he was not on trial on any such charge -- but, in the wide and deep significance of the word loyalty which implies faithfulness, truth and devotion to a superior -- which superior in this case happened to be Gen. POPE -- we think nothing can be clearer proven than that he was disloyal. It was not only in one nor in two instances that he effended, but he evaded, disregarded or disobeyed almost every one of the orders he received while acting under Gen. POPE. To attempt to assign as an excuse for his disobedience any motive whatever is preposterous; in a military and patriotic sense, his motives were necessarily bad. We are glad that in the first case in which an officer's culpability has been proven, punishment has followed; and we are rejoiced that the President has had courage to approve the sentence.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POPE CAMPAIGN AND GEN.

"A lamentable accident occured on the Hoboken and Newark Railroad at a few minutes past 6 o'clock this morning, by which three persons lost their lives and two others were seriously injured. The first morning train on that road leaves Newark  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/24/archives/faatl-accident-on-the-hoboken-and-newark-railroad-the-train-runs.html,,"A lamentable accident occured on the Hoboken and Newark Railroad at a few minutes past 6 o'clock this morning, by which three persons lost their lives and two others were seriously injured. The first morning train on that road leaves Newark at 6 o'clock, and usually arrives in Hoboken at 18 minutes past 6. At a little more than half the distance from Newark to Hoboken the road passes over a bridge spanning the Hackensack River. This bridge has a draw which is always left open during the night to allow vessels to pass, but is required to be closed early in the morning, before the train from Newark comes along, unless a vessel should be passing at the time, in which case a signal is required to be displayed, as a warning for the train to stop. Whether that signal was so displayed when the train came along this morning is a question in dispute, and will probably be a subject of investigation at the proper time. If it was displayed, it was unfortunately not seen by the engineer in time to stop the train, and the result was that the engine and tender, together with the baggage and smoking car, were precipitated through the draw into the river. There was only one passenger-car in the train, and this, fortunately, escaped. It was but a hairbreadth escape, however; for the car was propelled to the very brink of the gulf, and now stands upon the bridge, with its forward end projecting some feet over the draw. Teere were some ten or twelve passengers in the car at the time, all of whom escaped injury. The persons who were killed, were the engineer, whose name was JACOB A. WOODRUFF, and who is supposed to have remained at his post and gone down with his engine, and two passengers, whose names are unknown. Although the tide was low at the time, yet such was the impetus, that the engine and tender were completely buried out of sight in the bed of the river. The passengers who lost their lives were in the smoking-car at the time, together with the conductor and a boy, who escaped. The conductor, however, whose name is WM. H. HAVENS, was thrown into the water, where he remained some time, and is considerably injured. The fireman, also, saved his life by jumping from the falling wreck, although he landed in the water and was considerably injured. The passengers who were lost, the conductor says, were laborers going to their work at the long dock of the Erie Railroad. Neither of their bodies nor that of the engineer has yet been recovered. The passengers say that after the accident occurred, the man who attends the drawbridge came out of his house near by with nothing on but his pants and shirt, and with the appearance of having just got out of bed. They are of the opinion that he neglected to display the signal, although he says that it was up, and when the passengers' attention was called to it they found it properly displayed. They think, however, that the signal was raised during the excitement and confusion after the accident, in order to make it appear all right for the bridge-tender. The passengers agree in saying that the whistle blew and the brakes were put on before the train reached the bridge, but not in time to prevent the accident. The engineer whose business it was to look out for the signal, having lost his life, cannot of course give his evidence as to whether it was displayed or not; but whatever may have been the facts, the accident teaches a lesson which should have been sufficiently learned from the great Norwalk accident, (which was precisely similar to this,) and that is, that the lives of scores of passengers should not be made to hang on the chances of an engineer seeing a given signal, or the chance of a signal man attending to his business, but every train should be compelled by law to come to a dead stand at every draw-bridge, whether the signal be up or down. This is the preventive that has been applied on the Eastern roads since the Norwalk accident, and it has proved effectual and satisfactory to the public.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FAATL ACCIDENT ON THE HOBOKEN AND NEWARK RAILROAD.; The Train Runs Into an Open Draw-Bridge The Engineer and Two Passengers Killed Supposed Negligence of the Drawtender.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FAATL ACCIDENT ON THE HOBOKEN AND NEWARK RAILROAD.; The Train Runs Into an Open Draw-Bridge The Engineer and Two Passengers Killed Supposed Negligence of the Drawtender.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1103bbd2-aeeb-5a1b-907d-afc0d6f22231,719,nyt://article/1103bbd2-aeeb-5a1b-907d-afc0d6f22231,

the Necessity for a,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/24/archives/the-statistical-bureau.html,the Necessity for a,"-- The establishment of an efficient Bureau of Statistics, on a plan similar to that which the Secretary of the Interior recommended to Congress a few days ago, is a National necessity. Involving no additional expense whatever to the Government, it would confer on the most vital interests of the country benefits which might be cheaply purchased at the cost of millions of dollars. Every nation in Europe with any pretensions to commercial importance, has its Statistical Bureau. The monthly reports of the Board of Trade possess a value which no consideration would induce Great Britain to be without. Moreover, it is a circumstance not a little remarkable, that the time when this English Bureau of Statistics was established, marks exactly the turning point in the course of British opulence and industrial ascendency. From the moment when Mr. BULL began to set his house in order and to look into his monthly accounts -- both the Government and the people noting the ebb or rise of National prosperity -- a new impulse was given to progress, fiscal errors were brought to light, exhaustless productive forces were unchained, labor and wealth developed each other, and a prodigious capital has been annually heaped up which is the wonder of the age.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE STATISTICAL BUREAU', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE STATISTICAL BUREAU', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21ddbe96-5fbb-5137-abcc-58421200151c,428,nyt://article/21ddbe96-5fbb-5137-abcc-58421200151c,

Even before the breaking out of the present war, the same question had been mooted, but there was not any action of consequence on the subject, until after the attack upon Fort Sumter. Then the military spirit broke out in the schools, as it did everywhere else, and juvenile military companies, formed from the schools, were seen on the street every day. The drill, however, and other necessary preparations for parade, were attended to after school hours, and outside the school-rooms. In the larger schools the teachers soon saw the advantages of such military drill in the management of the male departments, and it was not long before the boys were drilled in marching, countermarching, right face, left face, and such other manoeuvres as tended to their more orderly movement from one class-room to another; and now the drill, so far as marching in military order goes, is practiced in nearly every public school in the City. In nearly all the female and primary departments and schools, calisthenics, to a greater or less extent, have been introduced as a daily exercise. The military drills and evolutions are confined principally to the boys' departments of the grammar schools. These exercises are looked upon with great favor by the Superintendent, who believes that no better mode could be adopted by which that physical bravery which is indispensable to health, both of body and mind, be combined with a spirit of patriotism, and the duty which, in a crisis like the present, devolves upon every young man, of preparing himself adequately and thoroughly for defending his country against foreign or domestic foes. Among the schools in which the marching drill has been particularly attended to are: No. 49, Thirty-seventn-street. near Second-avenue; No. 44, corner of North Moore and Varick streets; No. 45, Twenty-fourth-street, between Seventh and Eighth avenues: No. 35, Mr. THOMAS HUNTER, Principal, in Thirteenth-street, near Sixth-avenue: No. 32, T.D. MARTIN, Principal, Thirty-fifth-street, near Ninth-avenue No. 17, JAMES MONTRETH, Principal, Forty-seventh-street, between Eighth and Ninth avenues; No. 14,Twenty-seventh-street, near Third-avenue; No. 11, Seventeenth-street, near Eighth-avenue, and No. 10, Wooster-street, near Bleecker. But, as has been said, in nearly all of them some attention is given to the marching drill. In several, there are teachers who have been connected with the City militia, and through their knowledge of military movements thus obtained, the pupils have arrived at greater proficiency than in other schools in which there are no teachers who have had a military training themselves. In school No. 10, there is a very fine little military company, which has been taught by Mr. HANNIDAL ROBINSON, a teacher there, who was a soldier in the Mexican war. This class understands and practices not only the marching drill, but also the manual of arms. Should the Board of Education decide in favor of placing military instruction in the regular course of studies, we shall soon have a large and interesting army of little warriors in this City alone. The whole number taught in the Ward Schools, when the last annual report was made up, was 119, 932, and in the Primary Schools 32,352; which, including the Corporate schools, gives a grand total of 162,503. Should military instruction be confined to the boys in the Grammar departments entirely, we would even then have an army of about, if not quite, 30,000 growing up in our midst, which, in a very few years, in case of invasion, or of another rebellion, could march out disciplined and ready to defend the land of Common Schools against all comers.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Military Discipline for the Public Schools, ITS EXTENT AND PROGRESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Military Discipline for the Public Schools, ITS EXTENT AND PROGRESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/975b193b-72a5-5d20-b32b-f7e213bdf2c9,629,nyt://article/975b193b-72a5-5d20-b32b-f7e213bdf2c9,

We supposed that that at least was an army that would never disappoint the country. But just after these two officers had given HINDMAN the most tremendous whipping at Prairie Grove -- after their troops had marched from Fayetteville across the Boston Mountains to Van Buren, had captured that place, and, gazing across the Arkansas River, had caught a glimpse of the routed rebels flying as fast as their legs could carry them toward Arkadelphia -- after BLUNT and HERRON had captured steamboats, transports and abundant supplies, and found plenty of forage -- after the way was open and clear to Little Rock, and the complete occupation of Arkansas -Gen. SCOFIELD, who ranked both BLUNT and HERRON, arrived on the field, took command of the army, stopped its progress, and planted it on the banks of the Arkansas River. It has not been heard of since. Gen. SCOFIELD was sick at St. Louis while the irrepressible BLUNT was performing his exploits. We fear the journey to Van Buren brought him down again. We fear he is sick -- as some imagine the country to be -- of West Point. Of that trouble BLUNT was altogether free.

Tne purchase of church  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/24/archives/more-modern-resurrection-a-vault-full-full-of-remains-purchased-by.html,,"The expose of the shameful manner in which the bodies buried under the old Sullivan-street Church were being removed, (which appeared exclusively in the TIMES of Monday last,) has created an excitement in this community unsurpassed in the annals of local intelligence. Tne purchase of church property in this City hereafter will be suspiciously regarded as a cemetery investment, and additional clauses will be demanded in the deeds conveying such property, to the effect that there are no human remains lying beneath the buildings, or buried in the lands sought to be conveyed, or that, if there be any such, they will be removed at the expense of the vendors and not of the purchaser. Already this idea is being acted on in a case which has come to our knowledge, only that, in this instance, the purchaser will be put to the expense of removal, in case he does not contest the terms of the contract of purchase. It will be recollected that in the disastrous conflagration in November last, in the vicinity of Greene and Houston streets, the Associate Presbyterian Church which stood on the southwest corner of those streets was burned, leaving only the walls remaining. Although the neighborhood is one which presents a most extensive field for religious labors, (the majority of the residents being very far from practicing angelic virtues,) the congregation decided not to rebuild the edifice, but sold the property to Mr. THOMAS STILLMAN, of No. 248 Greenwich-street. In the verbal terms of sale was a proviso that if any human remains should, on excavating, be found burled there, they were to be removed at Mr. STILLMAN's expense -- the idea conveyed to that gentleman being that there were but few, if any such, there. To this provision, understanding it as above mentioned, Mr. S. agreed. The expose of the Sullivan-street affair, however, set him to thinking whether he might not possibly have bound himself to perform rather a large job in the resurrection line, and investigation proved that there is an immense vault underneath the ruins, containing probably not less than twenty-five hundred corpses. To paying for the removal of these the purchaser demurs, alleging that the proviso in the terms of sale has been used to deceive him, and that if the vendors have not been guilty of an expressio falsi, they are at least chargeable with a suppressio veri -- that they were in a position to know of the existence of this vault and its contents, but failed to inform him of it.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'More Modern Resurrection.; A VAULT FULL FULL OF REMAINS PURCHASED BY AN UNSUSPECTING SPECULATOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'More Modern Resurrection.; A VAULT FULL FULL OF REMAINS PURCHASED BY AN UNSUSPECTING SPECULATOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fbea4220-8cd9-5c2e-825d-9f95aa8bdef7,638,nyt://article/fbea4220-8cd9-5c2e-825d-9f95aa8bdef7,

"Morris and Essex Train thrown into Hackensack River; Golden City; Pacific Mail Steamship, Launch",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/25/archives/fatal-accident-on-the-hoboken-and-newark-railroad-the-train-runs.html,"Morris and Essex Train thrown into Hackensack River; Golden City; Pacific Mail Steamship, Launch","A lamentable accident occurred on the Hoboken and Newark Railroad at a few minutes past 6 o'clock yesterday morning, by which three persons lost their lives and two others were seriously injured. The first morning train on that road leaves Newark at 6 o'clock, and usually arrives in Hoboken at 18 minutes past 6. At a little more than half the distance from Newark to Hoboken the road passes over a bridge spanning the Hackensack River. This bridge has a draw which is always left open during the night to allow vessels to pass, but is required to be closed early in the morning, before the train from Newark comes along, unless a vessel should be passing at the time, in which case a signal is required to be displayed, as a warning for the train to stop. Whether that signal was so displayed when the train came along, yesterday, is a question in dispute, and will probably be a subject of investigation at the proper time. If it was displayed, it was unfortunately not seen by the engineer in time to stop the train, and the result was that the engine and tender, together with the baggage and smoking car, were precipitated through the draw into the river. There was only one passenger-car in the train, and this, fortunately, escaped. It was but a hairbreadth escape, however; for the car was propelled to the very brink of the gulf, and now stands upon the bridge, with its forward end projecting several feet over the draw. There were ten or twelve passengers in the car at the time, all of whom escaped injury. The persons who were killed, were the engineer, whose name is JACOB A. WOODRUFF, and who is supposed to have remained at his post and gone down with his engine, and two passengers, whose names are unknown. Although the tide was low at the time, yet such was the impetus, that the engine and tender were completely buried out of sight in the bed of the river. The passengers who lost their lives were in the smoking-car at the time, together with the conductor and a boy, who escaped. The conductor, however, whose name is WM.H. HAVENS, was thrown into the water, where he remained some time, and is considerably injured. The fireman, also, saved his life by jumping from the falling wreck, although he landed in the water and was considerably injured. The passengers who were lost, the conductor says, were laborers going to their work at the long dock of the Erie Railroad. Neither of their bodies nor that of the engineer has yet been recovered. The passengers say that after the accident occurred, the man who attends the draw-bridge came out of his house near by with nothing on but his pants and shirt, and with the appearance of having just got out of bed. They are of the opinion that he neglected to display the signal, although he says that it was up, and when the passengers' attention was called to it they found it properly displayed. They think, however, that the signal was raised during the excitement and confusion after the accident, in order to make it appear all right for the bridge-tender. The passengers agree in saying that the whistle blew and the brakes were put on before the train reached the bridge, but not in time to prevent the accident. The engineer whose business it was to look out for the signal, having lost his life, cannot of course give his evidence as to whether it was displayed or not; but whatever may have been the facts, the accident teaches a lesson which should have been sufficiently learned from the great Norwalk accident, (which was precisely similar to this,) and that is, that the lives of scores of passengers should not be made to hang on the chances of an engineer seeing a given signal, or the chance of a signal man attending to his business, but every train should be compelled by law to come to a dead stand at every draw-bridge, whether the signal be up or down. This is the preventive that has been applied on the Eastern roads since the Norwalk accident, and it has proved effectual and satisfactory to the public.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FATAL ACCIDENT ON THE HOBOKEN AND NEWARK RAILROAD.; The Train Runs Into an Open Draw-Bridge The Engineer and Two Passengers Killed Supposed Negligence of the Drawtender.

"A bill will soon be presented to Congress to constitute certain street railways, already built in Philadelphia, a military and post route, in order to enable the New-York and Washington trains to pass through the unaccommodating right-angled village without transhipping passengers or breaking bulk. This result was effected last Summer by ferrying the trains bodily across the Delaware; but the boat employed for that purpose is quite inadequate for Winter navigation. Indeed, transshipments by city cars occupies less time. A bill contemplating the same objects was defeated by the last Congress, on the ground that the existing monopoly would have too much power, and might, in virtue of the authority thus given, bridge the Delaware below Philadelphia and the Hudson at New-York. An equally satisfactory objection would have been that the convenience of travelers would be too greatly enhanced. What excuse Congress will next interpose, we cannot divine. In fact, the proposed law, instead of giving a valuable monopoly to the existing Companies, will impose upon them the cost of adapting the City tracks in question to long cars, for temporary use only, as they are already constructing a steam road around Philadelphia, to be completed within a year, thus leaving the Quaker City out in the cold, as far as through traffic is concerned. This new road branches from the Philadelphia and Baltimore at Gray's Ferry, a few miles below the former city, on the west side of the Schuylkill, and runs five miles to the Reading Railway, which already crosses the Schuylkill and connects with the Philadelphia and Trenton -- that is to say, the Camden and Amboy. The latter Company are about to still further shorten this detour by a straighter line, to meet the new branch of the Philadelphia and Baltimore. If Congress, then will grant the power asked, the public will, in a few weeks, be able to cross Philadelphia without changing seats -- which, we think, conveys a more striking idea than changing cars -- and without the risk of permanently aiding the present Companies, if that is any objection. Otherwise, the public will have to endure the present annoyance another year; and it may be that the Government and the country will suffer for the want of proper connection between the Metropolis and the Capital. While Congress is declining to act, in the fear that some corporation or other will be unduly benefited, the emergency will have subsided.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/25/archives/newyork-and-washington-railway.html,,"A bill will soon be presented to Congress to constitute certain street railways, already built in Philadelphia, a military and post route, in order to enable the New-York and Washington trains to pass through the unaccommodating right-angled village without transhipping passengers or breaking bulk. This result was effected last Summer by ferrying the trains bodily across the Delaware; but the boat employed for that purpose is quite inadequate for Winter navigation. Indeed, transshipments by city cars occupies less time. A bill contemplating the same objects was defeated by the last Congress, on the ground that the existing monopoly would have too much power, and might, in virtue of the authority thus given, bridge the Delaware below Philadelphia and the Hudson at New-York. An equally satisfactory objection would have been that the convenience of travelers would be too greatly enhanced. What excuse Congress will next interpose, we cannot divine. In fact, the proposed law, instead of giving a valuable monopoly to the existing Companies, will impose upon them the cost of adapting the City tracks in question to long cars, for temporary use only, as they are already constructing a steam road around Philadelphia, to be completed within a year, thus leaving the Quaker City out in the cold, as far as through traffic is concerned. This new road branches from the Philadelphia and Baltimore at Gray's Ferry, a few miles below the former city, on the west side of the Schuylkill, and runs five miles to the Reading Railway, which already crosses the Schuylkill and connects with the Philadelphia and Trenton -- that is to say, the Camden and Amboy. The latter Company are about to still further shorten this detour by a straighter line, to meet the new branch of the Philadelphia and Baltimore. If Congress, then will grant the power asked, the public will, in a few weeks, be able to cross Philadelphia without changing seats -- which, we think, conveys a more striking idea than changing cars -- and without the risk of permanently aiding the present Companies, if that is any objection. Otherwise, the public will have to endure the present annoyance another year; and it may be that the Government and the country will suffer for the want of proper connection between the Metropolis and the Capital.

Another correspondent, in a letter which we published yesterday, writing from the Grand Reserve Division of Gen. SIGEL, stated that during the last few weeks Courts-martial had been held in that command, and also cited some instances of the severe but just sentences which had been passed upon officers for various derelictions of duty. Among them was that of a Lieutenant-Colonel cashiered for drunkenness, and a captain cashiered ""for cowardice and misbehavior before the enemy."" The Commanding General, in confirming the proceedings, findings and sentence of the Court in the last-mentioned case, remarked: ""The punishment is not too severe; the proper punishment for such conduct is death."" In the other Grand Divisions of the Army of the Potomac we hear of similar proceedings.

Greece and the Great Powers; Pay and Mail Robbers',https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/25/archives/greece-and-the-great-powers.html,Greece and the Great Powers; Pay and Mail Robbers',"A recent Paris telegram announces that a conference of the representatives of the Great Powers is to be shortly held in London, in order to determine the conditions on which the Ionian Islands shall be ceded to Greece. Those islands, then, are not to be a free gift from England. Their cession is to be made dependent on the assent of the Greeks to certain terms, not yet formally promulgated. A quid pro quo is to be exacted for their surrender; and what the general nature of that quid will be, may be gathered from another telegram transmitted by the British Government, at an earlier date, to its Minister at Athens. This brief note intimates to the Hellenes the terms on which England is ready to hand over the Septinsular Republic to their little State. If the people adhere to a monarchical form of government, and choose a sovereign acceptable to England, England will be prepared to reward their docility by surrendering to them those coveted islands. But should the Greeks presume to abjure monarchy, or to elect a King who shall not find favor in British eyes, they must not expect any such surrender. These conditions are not creditable to England. They indicate a disposition to take an ungenerous advantage of the weakness and difficulties of Greece. They betray a desire to exact an exorbitant price for that which England should freely surrender. The Greeks have already given manifest proof of their predilection for monarchy -- of their partiality for the reigning house in England. But, since they cannot induce Prince ALFRED to reign over them, are they to forfeit all claim to British favor should they prefer a native ruler to another German, or a constitutional Republic to an alien despotism? Let England palter with her promise -- let her withhold the Ionian Isles from ""living Greece"" if she pleases; but let her not persist in tempting the Greeks to barter their rights as freemen for the acquisition in question. The country which first gave consistency to European civilization is surely not less worthy of having her privileges respected than her younger sister, Italy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Greece and the Great Powers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Greece and the Great Powers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4bdb5d99-cc12-529c-ba23-83eb03d24cd7,1045,nyt://article/4bdb5d99-cc12-529c-ba23-83eb03d24cd7,

"MORE SOLDIERS PAY. -- Mr. MARCUS L. WARD, of Newark, yesterday afternoon received a large sum of money from the Seventh New-Jersey Regiment, the proceeds of their recent payment. The plan upon which Mr. WARD operates, in the delivery of money to the families of soldiers, and which originated with that philanthropic gentleman, is so simple, and at the same time, admirable, that we describe it for the benefit of other localities which are as yet destitute of any system of distribution. The plan is for the men, as soon as paid, to hand their money to the Chaplain of their respective regiments, taking a receipt for the same. A draft is then forwarded to Mr. WARD for the amount, the soldiers sending their receipts to their families, who present them to Mr. WARD, when they are duly honored. By this plan it is found that much less money is squandered by the soldiers than is customary, as a faithful Chaplain usually succeeds in persuading the men to forward nearly all their pay. Mr. WARD has received hundreds of thousands of dollars -- probably fifty thousand within the past week -- and not a dollar has been lost. The performance of the almost incredible labor of receiving, arranging and paying out this money, besides writing innumerable letters for soldiers wives and friends, all of which is performed by Mr. WARD without fee or reward, render his example one of the noblest with which genuine Christian philanthropy has ever blessed mankind. We think the plan adopted by Mr. WARD, if introduced everywhere, could not fall of the happiest results. It is true every community is not blessed with such a large-hearted friend of the soldier, to perform the labor gratuitously, yet even if some competent person had to be paid for doing it, it would be far better than the ordinary plan of the soldier simply forwarding his money, without any one to look after it.

Grant and McClernand soon to Move in Southwest,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/25/archives/our-armies-in-the-southwest.html,Grant and McClernand soon to Move in Southwest,"Our three great armies in the Southwest that of ROSECRANS at Murfreesburo, that of GRANT at Memphis, and that of McCLERNAND, on the wing will soon, we have reason to believe, be again in motion and action. Gen. ROSECRANS has had a great deal of work to do during the three weeks that have elapsed since he defeated the army of Gen. BRAGG. He had communications to open and keep open, supplies to bring forward, and heavy preparations of various kinds to make, before he could again assume the offensive. Nearly all this work is now done. And we have the good news also in a definite shape that he has really received very large reinforcements. In the meantime the enemy is about the same distance away from him that they were when ROSECRANS moved against them from Nashville; they are at Shelbyville and Tullahoma, and it is supposed that their next place of battle will be on Duck River. We have had no confirmed of LONGSTREET's having reinforced them with eleven rebel brigades; but if he has, we suspect they will find that ROSECRANS, too, has at least eleven brigades more than he had when he drove them from their works at Murfreesboro. The threatening demonstrations which they made in the direction of the Tennessee River ten or twelve days ago, seem to have been nothing but guerrilla raids, and were not preliminary to any offensive movement, as some feared. Nothing, however, could suit ROSECRANS better than that they should assume the offensive. He could keep them out of Nashville with one quarter of his army, while with the remainder he would push on to Chattanooga, which is the real strategic centre of the whole country for hundreds of miles around, and which, if once in our possession, would put the entire game in all this part of the Southwest in our hands. ROSECRANS, however, can now anticipate no such good luck as this. He is quietly and cautiously preparing to move out from Murfreesboro; and he will probably do so as unexpectedly to the public as he left Nashville. ROSECRANS, as one of our correspondents remarked yesterday, is sending out no rumors of a grand advance, and giving the enemy no clue to his plans. But the rebels are none the less fearful of his appearance, and are probably trying to give the impression that they have received immense reinforcements, that they may thus delay as long as possible the evil day.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Armies in the Southwest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Armies in the Southwest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/59888d60-3d8c-52cd-b4a0-a9fdef7ce5f3,761,nyt://article/59888d60-3d8c-52cd-b4a0-a9fdef7ce5f3,

At the Winter Garden Mr. COULDOCK's powerful performance of Peter Probity suffices to keep the ""Chimney Corner"" on the bills for another week -- a result which, we may add, is due in a large measure to the admirable way in which Mr. JACKSON has put the work upon the stage. Senora CUBAS, however, appears in a new part -- that of Naramattak, the Child of the Forest, in the piece of that name. At Niblo's Theatre, the play of ""Leah, the Forsaken,"" in which Miss BATEMAN's success has been as decided as her most ardent admirers could have anticipated, will be repeated. The lady triumphs over the literary imperfections of the piece itself, and, by her own powerful and impressive acting of the principal character, has infused into it an amount of vitality and interest sufficient to render it one of the most popular and effective of her whole repertory. The theatre has been crowded every evening to the full extent of its capacious means of public accommodation, and there is every prospect of the piece continuing to be attractive for many nights to come. It is but just to say that Mrs. CHANFRAU, Mr. J.W. WALLACK, Jr., Mr. EDWIN ADAMS and Mr. BURNETT deserve great praise for what they usually do to insure the complete excellence with which the piece is presented. At Laura Keene's, the charming comedienne, Mrs. JOHN WOOD, will appear in the operetta called the ""Pet of the Petticoats,"" and the farce of ""Mr. and Mrs. White"" will be given, with the other members of the company.

The proceedings opened with a personal explanation from Mr. FIELDS, in answer to some just strictures in a New-York paper. The ninety-first ballot for Speaker was then taken, in which Mr. TRIMMER had 60 votes, Mr. CALLICOTT 60, and Mr. DEPEW 1 -- one member being absent. When the ninety-second ballot was commenced, the member before absent had returned, and cast his vote for Mr. CALLICOT, thus insuring that gentleman's election should the ballot be consummated. A scene of the greatest excitement ensued, and the old game of filibustering to prevent any further proceedings, was immediately commenced. At one point in the proceedings, the Clerk having left his position for a few minutes, the Democrats attempted to usurp the Speaker's chair for one of their number, but this was carrying the matter too far for the patience of the Republican and Union members, and their opposition came near leading to bloodshed. Finally the Clerk reappeared, and took his place, when the excitement gradually subsided, but not, it appears, before it was understood that an adequate police force had been called, and were at hand to enforce order. It was finally agreed to adjourn until to-day, at 11 o'clock A.M., at which time the vote is to be proceeded with without further opposition.

It sarcastically adds that this condition of things is very consoling to the South, and then proceeds to indicate a remedy for it. ""The remedy lies,"" says the Examiner, ""in the extension and rigid enforcement of that law to which we owe our salvation. We must bring out the conscripts."" ""If,"" it is added, ""we do not within the next two months add seventy-five or a hundred thousand men to our forces in the Southwest, we shall come to grief."" This is all indubitably true. The rebels in the Southwest will come to grief in the Spring if they do not raise a hundred thousand new conscripts; and a hundred thousand new conscripts they cannot raise; and they will come to grief whether they raise them or not.

Advices from Vera Cruz and other points are to the 1st inst. The French were said to be awaiting reinforcements before advancing upon Puebla, toward which place they had progressed no further than Palmar. The expected reinforcements were to consist of two divisions of the Imperial Guard, making the entire effective force for attacking Puebla only about 15,000 men. On the Mexican side the disposable force was much larger -- 25,000 regulars and 10,000 volunteers being in Puebla alone, while at other points were supposed to be in the neighborhood of 50,000 men. At Puebla ten forts had been constructed, mounting nearly 200 cannon, and the fortifications of the capital were on an equally extensive scale. A rumor prevailed in Havana at the date of our latest advices, that the French had advanced against Puebla, and had suffered another repulse. There is a possibility that the rumor is true. Indeed, we receive from another correspondent in Havana news of a more explicit character, which leads us to place considerable reliance in it. The communications between Vera Cruz and Orizaba are said to be entirely cut off, and can only be restored by posting strong guards all along the road. The guerrillas are in strong force, and worry the French unceasingly. The report of the repulse at Puebla is reiterated, with the addition that the French vanguard, four thousand strong, was completely surprised by eight hundred Mexican cavalry, and about two thousand of them killed and wounded.

LAMBERT, were yesterday brought before Justice QUACKENBUSH, upon the complaint of Mrs. CHARLOTTE GUEST, of No. 391 Bleecker-street, who alleges that the prisoners stole from her private apartment, on the 5th inst., property consisting of a box of jewelry, a crape shawl, a gold watch and chain, and other valuables, amounting in all to $267. The testimony discloses the fact that ELLEN had recently been in the employ of Mrs. GUEST, as a dressmaker, and while there she had an opportunity to learn the place where her employer kept her valuables. The evening previous to the theft ELLEN learned that the complainant would be out the next forenoon; she accordingly made her arrangements, entered Mrs. GUEST's private apartment when there was no one in the house to interfere with her plans, took the property and departed. The shawl was subsequently recovered at a pawn shop, where it had been pledged by ELLEN. The remainder of the property has not been found. The other prisoner, LAMBERT, is known to have presented some of the other articles at a pawn shop in Greene-street, but the pawnbroker refund to receive them in pledge on the ground that he suspected them to have been stolen. The latter prisoner has recently abandoned an intelligent and amiable wife and seven children, who reside in Forty-third-street, and has since been living with ELLEN FOX at the corner of Crosby and Spring streets, where both parties were arrested by Officer BOWER, of the Second District Police Court. The Magistrate committed ELLEN for trial.

BURNSIDE for the movement of the army were interfered with by officers writing to or visiting Washington to oppose them, and if such movements were arrested, and if so, by what authority."" It is due to Gen. BURNSIDE, and, more still, it is due to our army, and to the cause of the country, that the truth be brought out on this point. It is needed, so that such interferences be prevented in future; for if subordinate officers, who object to the plan of the Commanding General they are serving under, may write or run to the President, and pour into his ears such tales as may affect his judgment of the skill and reliability of their superiors, then it will be impossible that any military programme should ever be carried out, or any success ever attend our arms. One will, said NAPOLEON, is essential to the operations of an army. Subordinate Generals may have their quarrels among themselves, but, toward their commander, nothing is permissible but unqualified devotion and loyalty. If the insinuation in the resolution is correct -- and it has been publicly made from more than one quarter -- the delinquent officers should be cashiered.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARMY MOVEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RESPONSIBILITY FOR ARMY MOVEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9b1a2f6c-6282-5a17-b25e-1ad5c40465b4,460,nyt://article/9b1a2f6c-6282-5a17-b25e-1ad5c40465b4,

Rosecrans; French cruelties at Vera Cruz","Mr. CALLICOT deserves the highest praise for the manner in which he has conducted himself throughout the whole of the extraordinary contest which has happily closed by his election as Speaker of the State Assembly. His triumph is something more than the triumph of a party, as his conduct also showed that he could rise above the trammels of party when the welfare of the State and the course of legislation required that party should be ignored. He has been maligned, insulted, browbeaten, and threatened by members of his own party; charges the most preposterous have been made against him; abuse the most malign and interminable has been heaped upon him; and bullies belonging to the riotous faction have even gone so far as to threaten his assassination in case he was elected. It was twenty days from the time the House met till it was organized, and ten days from the time Mr. CALLICOT was nominated until he was chosen Speaker. For the first ten days of the session it seemed impossible to relieve the deadlock which the position of parties placed upon legislation. There had then been seventy-seven ballots for Speaker, and the prospect was, if neither side of the House had been sufficiently magnanimous to take up a candidate from the opposite party, and if every member of each political party had factiously adhered to it, that the ballotings might have reached a thousand, and the purpose for which the Legislature was elected have been utterly frustrated. There was but one course for the Republicans to adopt, and a Democrat was nominated. Since then, for ten days, the Assembly Chamber has exhibited scenes the like of which never before disgraced the Legislature of New-York. The proceedings of the factionists were little short of being revolutionary. The violence culminated on Saturday last, when Mr. FIELDS, who had been the leader in it, poured out a torrent of vulgar defamation upon Mr. CALLICOT, and defied the House to enforce order. During all this time, and amid all these scenes, Mr. CALLICOT bore himself with a manliness, a courage and a prudence which could not be surpassed; and, through all, his patriotism has shone conspicuous. Those Democrats who, toward the end, exhibited a willingness to cut loose from the factionists who would have precipitated the State into revolution to forward their selfish purposes, and who aided in the effort to organize the House, also deserve the respect of all lovers of law and order.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Speaker of the State Assembly.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Speaker of the State Assembly.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c39e4b8b-5039-5428-9008-236bf7be89ad,2555,nyt://article/c39e4b8b-5039-5428-9008-236bf7be89ad,

In the early part of the present month BRUFF took into his service several parties, among whom was the prisoner, MCLOUGHLIN. From that time until the present the complainant has daily missed a quantity of the manufactured arms, and in many instances he missed them after the revolvers had been carefully packed in boxes ready for shipping. The matter at length became so serious that an application was made to the Police of the Sixth Precinct and Officer GOLDEN undertook to ferret out the facts and he very soon detected the prisoner and look him into custody while he was in the act of pawning one of the stolen revolvers. A further investigation led to the recovery of about thirty costly revolvers, all of which had been pledged at various pawn offices, in this City, by the accused. When going in pledge a pistol he invariably told the person in charge of the pawn-shop that he was a discharged cavalry officer, and in this manner he managed to avoid suspicion. Justice CONNOLLY committed him in full for trial.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ca5cbbdb-d025-5abb-a999-356a90f74303,924,nyt://article/ca5cbbdb-d025-5abb-a999-356a90f74303,

"Robinson, Prof. Edward",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/29/archives/death-of-prof-robinson.html,"Robinson, Prof. Edward","Prof. EDWARD ROBINSON, the celebrated philologist and biblical scholar, died at his residence in this City on Tuesday night last, of dropsy in the chest. He has been in feeble health for some months. He visited Germany during the last Summer for surgical treatment of his eyes, which were for some time threatened with entire deprivation of sight. He returned in the Fall, but never resumed, actively, his accustomed labors. Dr. ROBINSON was one of the most distinguished scholars of biblical learning in this country. He was a native of Connecticut, born in 1794, graduated at Hamilton College in this State in 1816, and went to Andover in 1821, where he studied Hebrew and became associated with Dr. STUART in the translation of some text books from the German and in the instruction of his classes. In 1826, he went to Europe, where he studied four years, when he returned, and became Professor of Sacred Literature in Andover. He resigned this position in 1833, and removed to Boston. In 1837, he was appointed Professor of Biblical Literature in the Union Theological Seminary in this City, and held that position until his death. Previous to entering upon its duties he visited Palestine, and made a very minute and careful study of the country in connection with the geography of the Bible. In 1841, he published the results of this study, in three octavo volumes, which became the text-book for all the students in that Department Much of his subsequent life was devoted to the revision and perfection of this work, though he published some others connected with classical studies. Dr. R. married in 1816 a daughter of Rev. S, KIRKLAND, a missionary among the Oneida Indians, but she died three years after. In 1829, he married Miss TERESA A.L. VON JACOB, daughter of Prof. VON JACOB, of the University of Halle, a lady of rare ability and scholarship, whose writings and translations, under the name of ""Talvi,"" are widely known in this country and in Europe. She survives a husband, who leaves also a son and daughter. Prof. ROBINSON was the leading man of a class, small, as yet, in this country, who achieve European celebrity in the department of letters to which he devoted his life.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Death of Prof. Robinson.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Death of Prof. Robinson.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/234827fa-4eb9-5020-aa75-286b1adf39b9,376,nyt://article/234827fa-4eb9-5020-aa75-286b1adf39b9,

DEHART, No. 60 Adams-street, Newark, N.J. The boiler was about 25 feet long, and the explosion shot the main portion of it, with the force of a thunderbolt, through the end of the boiler-room across a vacant lot adjoining, entirely through a building used as a soap manufactory, through a stable on the same premises, and nearly across another vacant lot, in which it was finally deposited. The engineer, who was named WILLIAM BLAKE, was sitting near the end of the boiler, and was carried with it through the wall of the engine-room and into the soap manufactory on the next lot. He was terribly bruised and burnt, and cannot possibly survive.

Proposed Expulsion from the Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/29/archives/the-proposed-expulsion-of-senato-saulsbury.html,Proposed Expulsion from the Senate,"If the United States Senate has any genuine self-respect, it will vindicate it by the summary expulsion of Senator SAULSBURY, of Delaware. A more outrageous indignity was never committed upon a deliberative body than was his conduct on Tuesday when called to order. In styling the President of the United States by name an ""imbecile,"" he not only put himself on a level with the lowest pot-house blackguard, but commuted a gross breach of the rules. The Vice-President did nothing less than absolute duty in calling him to order. The Delaware Senator contumaciously and contemptuously refused to heed that call. The Vice-President, under the rules, had no alternative then but to order the Sergeant-at-Arms to take him into custody. In drawing his revolver -- a weapon which no man worthy of respect ever carries into a legislative body -- upon the officer, Mr. SAULSBURY defied the authority of the Senate; and all of his subsequent behavior, both in word and act, was to the highest degree ""in contempt."" It is hard to conceive how any man accustomed to gentlemanly associations could so play the bully anywhere. That a Senator of the United States should do it in the Senate of the United States is a thing till now altogether unheard of. We look in vain for something in palliation. Nothing of a personal character had been previously uttered to irritate and provoke. The debate had been perfectly cool and orderly. The Senator himself had held the floor for a considerable time before he launched out into his vulgarity. As there was no prior provocation, so there was no subsequent apology -- not a word that denoted regret. Even after he had had twenty-four hours to reflect upon his conduct, his only language was that of contemptuous defiance. ""I have no favor to ask,"" comprised all that he had to say on the subject.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Proposed Expulsion of Senato Saulsbury.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Proposed Expulsion of Senato Saulsbury.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/817b5c63-1954-5e95-8a9e-c39dd9fe4509,603,nyt://article/817b5c63-1954-5e95-8a9e-c39dd9fe4509,

Gen. Hooker,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/29/archives/discipline-among-army-officers.html,Gen. Hooker,"One of the worst features in our army of late has been the habit of certain high officers of publicly criticising the military ability, the military plans, and the movements or projected movements of their Commanding General. The letter we published from Washington, on Tuesday, mentioned, as the primary cause of the failure of BURNSIDE's late advance, the insubordination of some of his Generals, who went about denouncing the movement before it had been begun, while it was in progress, and after it had been abandoned, in presence of their subordinates, and of all who chose to listen. Of course, it is impossible that any Commander or any operation should prove successful under such circumstances. Any disparaging remark of an officer concerning his Chief will nearly always be known even to every private soldier within an hour after its utterance, and repetition of such remarks must either destroy the soldier's respect for their utterer, or his confidence in the leader to whom they are applied; and in either case it will produce demoralization. Even a poor General, with a bad plan, often achieves a brilliant success if he is heartily sustained by his subordinates; but genius itself cannot rear an edifice that may not tumble in confusion if the workmen are unfaithful to the designs, and receive orders only to criticise or evade them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Discipline Among Army Officers.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Discipline Among Army Officers.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a1f42480-7706-57a2-a24f-6ecb0a2b0f03,528,nyt://article/a1f42480-7706-57a2-a24f-6ecb0a2b0f03,
Address to Troops on Battle of Hartville,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/29/archives/miscellaneous-war-items.html,Address to Troops on Battle of Hartville,"-- Capt. W.J. PALMER, of the Anderson Troop, of Pennsylvania, who was taken prisoner by the rebels some time since, has escaped from the South, by ways and means which he does not think it prudent to expose at present. He does not seem at all disposed to justify the action of the Troop in refusing to go into action when ordered to do so by Gen. ROSECRANS. In a card published by the Philadelphia Press the Captain says: ""The old Troop was recruited for Gen. ROBERT ANDERSON, but before it was fully organized, both he and Gen. SHERMAN, his successor -- who had, on taking command, also chosen the old Troop as his escort -- had been relieved, and were followed by Gen. BUELL, who, only because it suited him, ratified the choice of his predecessors. In the present case, Gen. ROSECRANS, who had a perfect right to choose his escort, did not, it appears, select the Anderson Cavalry. Everyman in it knew when he joined the regiment that it was to be attached to Gen. BUELL's headquarters, as it would undoubtedly have been. But it the War Department or the President chose to remove that General, the men had no right to believe that they would descend as a legacy to his successor -- who was yet unknown as such -- although there was a reasonable probability that the same qualities which induced Gen. BUELL to select them for the post of honor would influence him who succeeded. This only was beyond question. Every man knew that he was taking an oath to serve the United States for three years or the war, to obey his superior officers, and to fight the rebels, which, if done well, would earn them as high honor as this world can give.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS WAR ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS WAR ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a22224e8-973a-56dc-b712-80d24e34b1f1,1906,nyt://article/a22224e8-973a-56dc-b712-80d24e34b1f1,

If we can trust the assurances of the State Department, and the indications of current events, this peril seems for the present to be overpast. The French Emperor's attempt to secure a joint mediation with England and Russia in our domestic dispute, proved a failure. How complete that failure was, -- how definite was the refusal with which it was met, and how permanent may be the temper which prompted it, we have yet to learn. But we are warranted by the official advices which have thus far reached the public, in believing that the attitude of our Government and of the country toward any foreign Power that may attempt intervention in our affairs, is one of distinct and unequivocal hostility. The whole world has been given to understand that this is precisely the one thing which our people will not for an instant tolerate, -- and that if any foreign nation attempts in any way, singly or in concert with others, to control by dictation, by force or by unsought advice, the future fate of this Republic, that nation will be instantly met by the peremptory and, if needful, the armed resistance of the loyal people of the United States, without distinction of party.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prospects of the War Foreign Intervention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prospects of the War Foreign Intervention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aea4b212-94ed-5a12-9e9d-e84e0ced7580,1386,nyt://article/aea4b212-94ed-5a12-9e9d-e84e0ced7580,

"The New Pirate, the Florida",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/30/archives/the-new-rebel-privateer.html,"The New Pirate, the Florida","The new Anglo-rebel privateering steamer Florida (or Oreto) has begun her career of destruction in flaming style. She sailed out of the harbor of Mobile on the 16th instant, in presence of seven of our blockading vessels, and chased by the fastest one of them; but she escaped, and next day captured and burned the Boston brig Estelle; on the 20th she entered the harbor of Havana and coaled; on the morning of the 22d (Thursday of last week) she left Havana, and gave chase to an American bark which escaped, but on the afternoon of the same day, when near Matanzas, she captured and burnt the brig Windward; next morning she captured and burnt another brig, and shortly after captured two more brigs, one of which she burnt and the other sunk. All this was precisely one week's work; how many more of our vessels this piratical rover may have captured and burnt during the seven days that have elapsed since the 23d, we shall probably not be long in knowing. From the statements made, it would appear that the Florida is quite as fast a sailer as her compeer, the Alabama, and it is evident that Capt. MAFFIT is as venturesome a knave as Capt. SEMMES. Of course the capturing and burning of unarmed and unsuspecting trading craft in the West India waters is not a work that contains in it a single characteristic of courage, or that requires much skill; and the fact that the Florida depended entirely upon her speed for safety from the guns of our vessel that started off Mobile in pursuit -- and the further fact that when about to leave Havana, her commander had to obtain the assistance of the Spanish officials to enable him to escape one of our gunboats, and that he also obtained permission from the same functionaries to pass the guard-ship after nightfall, so as to evade our cruisers -- abundantly shows that MAFFIT was not willing to test the metal of his ship with that of any of our armed vessels. In this respect the Florida has begun in precisely such a careeras has been that of the Alabama.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Rebel Privateer.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Rebel Privateer.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/019d4d80-008c-54b1-ab7d-0bf57e35c0f4,791,nyt://article/019d4d80-008c-54b1-ab7d-0bf57e35c0f4,

M.L. BONHAM, earnestly recommends the repeal of the act requiring the Adjutant-General of the State to order an election for field officers of the several regiments of the First Corps of Reserves, and of such other regiments now in service, where field officers had been appointed by the Executive Council. The reason assigned for this recommendation is an absence of power to order an election for field officers of regiments transferred to the Confederate service. The Governor says that whatever opinion he may entertain as to the propriety of the field officers of these regiments being elected in the first instance, he believes it to be the true policy, under existing circumstances, to allow matters to stand as they are.

A very large number of witnesses were examined, whose evidence was contradictory. The testimony of Messrs. HEWES & PHILLIPS, who made the boiler, showed that it was six years old. They said it was made of the best quality of Pennsylvania charcoal iron, and in their opinion it was in good order. The testimony of experts went to prove that the boiler had an extraordinary pressure upon it, which was corroborated by the evidence of a Mr. CADMUS, who swore that he was in the boiler-room about two hours before the explosion, when there was 102 pounds of steam on. He called the attention of BLAKE, the engineer, to the fact, who told him that he was compelled to carry high steam in order to raise the water. The wife and mother-in-law of Mr. BLAKE testified that he was a sober man, and that he had often told them the boiler leaked, and was not fit to run with. The jury returned the following verdict: ""That MILES MURPHY and WM. BLAKE came to their death from a defective boiler, and an over-pressure of steam on said boiler; and that the jury cannot, from the character of the evidence before them, attach blame to any person or persons on account of the explosion of said boiler."" The scene of the accident reveals the most tearful traces of the explosion. The building through which the boiler passed is completely pulverized, and one of the flues inside the boiler is flattened so that it looks like a single plate. Pieces of the unfortunate man (Mr. MURPHY) who was killed in the soap manufactory are yet picked up in the lot where the boiler lies.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c0baca8f-4a0d-5beb-9b31-0e5c94342cb6,1108,nyt://article/c0baca8f-4a0d-5beb-9b31-0e5c94342cb6,
