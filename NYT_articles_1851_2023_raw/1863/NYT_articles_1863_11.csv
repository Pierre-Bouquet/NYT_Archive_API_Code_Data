CURRIER against CHARLES PIERSON, of the well-known firm of UBSDELL, PIERSON Co., of this City, and which was tried in May last, in Superior Court, has been settled by the parties, the plaintiff, E.M. CURRIER, receiving $3,500, besides her attorney's costs, in settlement from the defendant. Attention was particularly directed to this case at the time, and it created considerable excitement in the legal circles, as well from its peculiar nature as because of the distinguished counsel engaged in it on both sides -- J.T. BRADY for plaintiff, and D. MCMAHON for defendant. On that occasion the Jury disagreed, and, as it was about to undergo a second trial, Mrs. COURRIER consented to compromise damages for her alleged grievances. The facts of this case, in brief, were simply these: Mrs. CURRIER was arrested on the supposition, strong at the time, of course, of having stolen a piece of silk from the firm, but the goods not having been found in her possession, Mr. PIERSON, on the following day, made an humble apology, which was accepted by E.M. CURRIER and husband, and they parted in a friendly manner, shaking hands, &c., as witnesses testified. Weeks after, to the no small surprise of the firm, a suit was commenced against Mr. PIERSON for defamation of character, &c., damages $10,000. Under such circumstances, $1,000 was offered, $1,500, and so on, and, finally, she accepted $3,500.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/62592d84-9852-5e96-a99f-6da7fd341257,1602,nyt://article/62592d84-9852-5e96-a99f-6da7fd341257,

YATES, of Illinois, speak upon the topics of the day. S.M. GRISWOLD, Esq., Vice-President of the Fourth Ward Union Association, presided. The Glee Club of the United States receiving-ship North Carolina, were present, and sang several songs, which were enthusiastically received, after which Gen. STRONG, of St. Louis, was introduced, and addressed the assemblage in a patriotic strain, when Gov. YATES was presented. The Governor made a lengthy and able speech, in which he reviewed the part taken in this war by the West, and especially by Illinois. He enlarged upon the importance of the present struggle, and contended that it was neither the Abolitionists, nor the Republicans, nor ABRAHAM LINCOLN who brought on this war, but the Southern slaveholders, who desired to reestablish the Union upon the basis of Slavery. He expressed himself in favor of the Emancipation Proclamation, the Conscription and the Confiscation acts; and the only fault he had to find with the President was, that he was not fast enough in forcing measures for the suppression of the rebellion. As to the West, however the East might feel upon the subject, they would never permit the Mississippi River to be under the control of any Power other than the United States. The waters would be crimson with human blood, and the banks a graveyard from its source to its mouth, before they would give it up. As to Slavery, he contended that that was the actual cause of hostilities, and if it died in the prosecution of the war, he was in favor of its dying and its eternal damnation. Slavery stood in the path of the Republic. It had kept in chains four millions of human beings, and had kept up Southern pride and arrogance long enough. It had divided the churches, the Whig party, the Democratic party, and, at last, the country. He wanted peace, but peace would never come until the rebellion died, and it would never die until Slavery died. In reference to the anti-draft riots in New-York, he said that instead of going to Washington and demanding of the Government to stop the draft, every house in the City should have been reduced to the ground before the law should have yielded to the authority of a mob. After referring to the importance of the approaching election, and its effect upon other States, he concluded by recommending that the rebels should pay all the expenses of the war, and if they are not able to do so, when the rebellion was crushed, to confiscate their property and devote the proceeds to paying the wounded soldiers and providing for the widows and orphans of the patriotic Union soldiers who had fallen in battle.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8f1fa428-7f2d-5281-99b3-cb810b4ae946,902,nyt://article/8f1fa428-7f2d-5281-99b3-cb810b4ae946,

Though these classes, and all classes, have a common dependence upon each other -- are necessary to each other, and should be friends -- there has been an attempt on the part of demagogues to get up an antagonism between them. There is also in every large City a class of men unmistakably bad. The ignorant and vicious element in such communities forms a large part of their population. Great cities draw such men into them, and furnish the lairs in which they hide, and the fields in which they ply their vocations. They are the foul and dangerous animals which prowl through our streets, watching for their prey, and which make the night-side of the City so unlike its noonday character. They are the natural enemies of all wholesome government; kept under restraint by nothing but sheer force. Few suspect the existence of such a class, in any considerable or formidable number, till some interruption of government relaxes the pressure which restrains them; and when such an outbreak occurs, we can see this army of ruffians swarming forth from the cellars and the slums of the City, and strong enough to fill the streets with terror.

At Cooper Institute,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/02/archives/gov-seymour-at-the-cooper-institute.html,At Cooper Institute,"Gov. SEYMOUR has just made his third appearance as a speaker in New-York since his entrance into office. The first was at the Academy of Music, on July Fourth, when he addressed the Democracy in an elaborately prepared speech, the whole burden of which was denunciation of the Government as an insufferable tyranny, and an averment that the war, as conducted, was a dead failure. His language on that occasion seemed to be specially shaped to demoralize and depress the public mind to the greatest degree possible, and to fit it for a favorable reception of such terms of peace as LEE then in Pennsylvania, and, as was generally supposed by the Copperheads, destined to overwhelm the Federal army, might soon proffer. The fall of Vicksburgh had not been heard of, for it had taken place only five hours before; and the Governor took occasion to declare that Vicksburgh could not be taken. The news of Gettysburgh had not reached our City in any authentic shape. Every patriotic heart was harassed with anxiety. There never was so dark an hour since the rebellion began. Gov. SEYMOUR, instead of using his official and personal influence to inspire the people with constancy, and courage and cheer, seized upon the occasion to propagate distrust, despondency and despair. Considering the demands of the crisis, a more craven, faithless, vicious speech never passed human lips. Had LEE been the victor at Gettysburgh, and had the rebel flag continued to float over Vicksburgh, the consequences of that harangue of the Governor of the State of New-York would have been most mischievous, and might have been positively fatal to the National cause.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gov.

Managers, it they remembered this, might easily take an evening to themselves. Whatever one of the six it happened to be, the public would quickly recognize it as the novelty-night at their particular establishment, and the manager would receive that undivided attention from the Press which he cannot now expect.

Mr. BEECHER possesses the faculty, beyond any other living American, of combining close, rapid, powerful, practical reasoning with intense passion. His mind is always aglow with his subject, and whatever comes from it, even if does not flash conviction, is almost sure to kindle sympathy. This, combined with his marvelous power of illustration -- marvelous alike for its intense vividness and its unerring pertinency -- and with his great flexibility, whereby he adapts himself completely to the exigency of the instant, gives him a rare command over a common audience.

"-- An inquest was held yesterday, by Coroner RANNEY, on the body of WM. ADLEE, a German shoemaker, residing at No. 346 West Thirty-ninth-street, who committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. The deceased had, for the last three years, been in the employ of Mr. JOHN FELSLER, as a journeyman shoemaker. The testimony given on the inquest showed that at intervals during the last two years he had manifested symptoms of insanity.

Corps Commanders,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/05/archives/corps-commanders.html,Corps Commanders,"When the interior history of our military operations comes to be fully known, it will, we think, be found that it has happened to some of our heads of armies to receive praise and to others to receive blame for actions in which they themselves came in but for a small part, and the success or failure of which was really, owing to the conduct of their subordinates, and especially of the commanders of corps. It is hardly to be expected that people will take such considerations into account in their verdicts of commanders, and indeed there is seldom the means even if there were the disposition to do so. There is a savage summariness in popular judgments of military men: success is success, on whatever accident it may have turned; and failure is failure, however excellent the plans of the commander may have been. A strict justice, however, would take these into account -- would be disposed to pity rather than to censure the General whose combinations may have been defeated by inefficient, intriguing or unwilling subordinates, and on the other hand would not unduly exalt the commander whose victory may have been in great part the fruit of the happy inspiration or energetie action of able lieutenants.

"Capt. HARTT, of the Thirtieth Precinct, yesterday reported at Police Headquarters that at about 4 P.M. on Tuesday, a disturbance occurred at Manhattanville of a very serious nature.

Officers RYAN and SULLIVAN immediately arrested him, and men began the war. All our available force was on hand. We left Sergeant PHILLIPS in charge of a sufficient force to protect the ballot-boxes and then engaged the mob, which momentarily grew larger. The conflict was fierce and, for a short time, terrible.

As a triumph of social art the Russian Ball will be remembered as long as any triumph of any kind can very well be in this land of things ""a moment bright, then gone forever."" A palace was improvised by bridging a street, and the locale being thus provided by the managers of the ball, the world of New-York provided the rest. A throng -- which only in the extremest exigencies of the evening ever became a crowd -- a throng of men presumably brave, and of women visibly fair, assembled in one general panorama of grace, and beauty, and spirit, the best elements of our New-York life, to do honor to the representatives of the one great Empire which, alone among the leading Powers of the earth, has frankly and cordially maintained its old relations of amity and good will with the Republic in these days of trial and endurance. If a political significance must be sought for in so bright and evanescent a show, the very head and front of it ""hath this extent, no more."" America prefers no judgment of favor or disfavor upon the internal policy of Russia, nor does she ask from Russia any judgment of favor or disfavor upon her own internal policy. We simply recognize with the warmth and frankness which become us, the justice, forbearance, courtesy and respect with which Russia has borne herself toward us from the outset of a struggle the burden and responsibility of which are ours, and ours alone. If there be a lesson in this -- if it be true, as we believe that true it is, that the subjects of no other great European Power would now be welcomed to these shores as the sailors of ALEXANDER have been -- if to no others would we pipe, nor ask them with us to dance, it is simply that no others have cared to mourn with us in our mourning, nor have any others practiced toward us even the poor charity of a silent indifference.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Russian Ball.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Russian Ball.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6379021d-47cf-50db-accf-5ef05b935c27,504,nyt://article/6379021d-47cf-50db-accf-5ef05b935c27,

"In the beginning of this war, nothing could be heard from Southern trumpeters but songs of the self-sacrificing of the blue blood of the South.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/08/archives/the-southern-chivalry.html,,"In the beginning of this war, nothing could be heard from Southern trumpeters but songs of the self-sacrificing of the blue blood of the South. Of how the kid-gloved exquisite, and the owner of five hundred negroes, had shouldered the musket, and marched side by side with the bone and sinew of the seceded States. It was claimed that they were fearfully in earnest, and were showing it practically by laying down their pink-tinted and musk-scented persons on the altar of their country. Months went by, and gradually, this line of brag faded out. Their Press was filled with advertisements for substitutes, and it was plain that the chivalry were beginning to find out that life in camp, under arrogant officers, was not exactly suited to their constitutions. Very soon after, the very same Press was rampant upon exemptions, declaring that more than half of those who had managed to crawl out from their army were liable for service, and that the laws against, desertion were a dead letter, because the deserters were of the wealthier classes. The Richmond Enquirer was especially severe upon these kid-gloved soldiers who had got enough, declaring that they should be made especial examples of, and hanged, drawn and quartered instantly. In spite of all this, the flower of chivalry continued to withdraw itself, until the rank and, file was left as bare of the aristocratic taint as a French mob in the days of the downfall, of LOUIS XVI., the blue blood having retired quietly to its luxurious home, there to await the coming of the victorious Yankees, and by loyal professions secure its ""crop."" The example of enlistment was good, as far as it went, and succeeded in deluding into the unholy strife the laboring population of the country; that part which did not go in by its own consent being taken, anyhow, by conscription, but its effect did not last, and very soon the poor dupes saw that they had been sold, cheaply sold, to an oligarchy afraid to trust its precious carcase where it would send them. For over a year this fact has been patent to the rank and file, of the Confederate army, and they feel, now, that instead of fighting side by side with statesmen and millionaires, they are simply a band of poor men battling for the rich, who are sitting at home, preparing for the time when the grand smash shall come, that they may quietly slip out of the back door. This is the true history of that Southern chivalry which has a bit of lively romance, was supposed to throw itself into the breach, and for the sake of liberty, and a divorce from the tyrannical mudsills, break down at a blow, all those distinctions of caste, to uphold which, they had been fighting all their lives a battle they have now shifted on to the shoulders of these poor dupes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Southern Chivalry.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Southern Chivalry.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a1bcdd0-b296-5c46-b1aa-41e4580b5dfe,487,nyt://article/0a1bcdd0-b296-5c46-b1aa-41e4580b5dfe,

SEYMOUR'S recent speeches, and particularly the last one, to avoid all direct opposition to the war, or even to the maintenance of the army, but by dwelling upon the apparent difference in the degree of advantage which various States derive from the Union to assist in that ""disintegration of the North,"" which the Southern Press counts upon as the surest agent in securing peace. The formation of the Union was, as the world knows, rendered possible only by the spread amongst the people of the conviction that all would enjoy greater safety, happiness, and prosperity in it than out of it. This was at that time made comparatively easy by the fact that the country was fresh from an experience of the working of the old Confederation -- a body whose existence was made manifest mainly by the establishment of a debating club at Washington. Everybody then knew by actual experiment that Disunion meant weakness, disorder and degradation, and that standing alone, even the most powerful of all the States was no better, and no more respected, than any petty principality.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Dangerous Doctrines Warnings of the Past and Perils of the Future.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Dangerous Doctrines Warnings of the Past and Perils of the Future.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c0107ad-a0bf-56b3-807c-2ceea2cb3808,1133,nyt://article/4c0107ad-a0bf-56b3-807c-2ceea2cb3808,

The War in,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/08/archives/the-war-in-newzealand.html,The War in,"The last Oriental mail brought bad news from New-Zealand to our British relatives. The Anglo-Maorian war has assumed an alarming aspect. The Colonists are now almost reduced to the necessity of fighting for their hearths and altars. The native forces, to the number of over 7,000 warriors, are in the vicinity of Auckland, and a general rising of all the tribes is apprehended. To repel this great danger, every civilian capable of discharging military, duty, whether in garrison or in the field, has been called out. Yet, even including the regular troops, the entire force at the disposal of Gen. CAMERON for active operations against the natives, does not exceed 3,000 men. With this little army, however, that enterprising officer determined to transfer the seat of war from Taranaki to the country of the Waikatos. About the middle of July he accordingly pushed on to the Maungatawhirri Creek, which is esteemed the boundary line between the aboriginal and European territory. Having crossed this creek, he advanced a short distance, and then ordered his troops to throw up redoubts in a commanding position. Hardly had these works been completed, when large bodies of natives were observed hovering around as though they meant to attack them. But seeing the General disposed to anticipate their design, they retired to a line of rifle-pits, which they had dug on the neighboring heights for protection, and there awaited his onset. As the British approached, the Maories saluted them with a heavy fire, which for a moment checked their advance; but, on Gen. CAMERON taking the lead in person, the soldiers rallied, and, carrying the rifle-pits with a rush, they put the enemy to flight, and pursued them to a distance of six miles from the battle-field. In this action the natives lost one hundred men, among whom were seven or eight chiefs of distinction, one of them uncle to the Maori King. The result of the conflict did not, how ever, prove of such importance to the colonists as might be supposed. On the contrary, it gave the Maories a lesson from which they were not slow to profit. Placing no more reliance on rifle-pits, they adopted, a new mode of warfare, for which their forest-crowned hills are admirably fitted, arid which will be more formidable to the Europeans than any other they could devise. The new strategy consists in placing ambuscades in the almost impenetrable brushwood which underlies their forests, and assailing their foes from thence. The efficacy of this system of warfare has been already tried and demonstrated. On the 1st of August Gen. CAMERON, at the head of 700 men, went on a reconnoitering expedition to the village of Paparod, where a large body of natives was said to be collected. After a fatiguing night march, he reached the village, but found it entirely deserted. Then he advanced into the forest in search of the enemy. Nor had he far to proceed. As his soldiers treaded their way through the brushwood, a risk fire was suddenly opened on the leading files by an invisible foe. This was at first returned by the British, but evidently with such little effect that the General, rather than sacrifice his men in a hopeless contest, ultimately ordered a retreat, and had the mortification to see the exulting savages issuing from their lair, and following in the footsteps of his discomfited troops.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War in New-Zealand.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War in New-Zealand.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b84cee6-4dea-53ec-8823-b853aa891ec2,1429,nyt://article/6b84cee6-4dea-53ec-8823-b853aa891ec2,

He has written to Washington, proposing this plan, but an answer has not yet been received. It is also proposed that the officers who come on from the Army of the Potomac to obtain conscripts for their regiments, of whom there are about 150 now at Riker's Island, should be allowed to come to the City and recruit for their several regiments, in which case the premiums would be paid to the volunteers instead of to the recruiting officer. The bounties offerred for volunteers are very large and cannot fail to secure an abundance of recruits when the arrangements are perfected and in working order. Each volunteer will be allowed to select his own regiment from among those now in service, which, to many men, will be by no means the least among the many inducements to enlist.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The New Call for Volunteers Recruiting in this City The New Assistant ProvostMarshal-General, &c.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The New Call for Volunteers Recruiting in this City The New Assistant ProvostMarshal-General, &c.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7f83807b-97b3-5a06-86b3-be41f670f854,371,nyt://article/7f83807b-97b3-5a06-86b3-be41f670f854,

In this view especially, Gov. MORTON'S late plan, submitted to the War Department, is deserving of notice. The Governor proposes a method for filling up depleted three years regiments in this way: That propositions shall be made to those regiments now in the field, which have been reduced to the lowest numerical standard, or those which are the oldest organizations, calling upon three-fourths of their members to reenlist. Should they do so, the regiment is then to be brought home and furloughed, both officers and men, for such time as the Governors of their respective States see fit, for the purpose of recruiting. This rule to be repeated until each regiment has undergone the furlough, and been recruited, the reenlisted men receiving the $100 bounty, which will then be due, as well as the $402 awarded to veterans.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gov.

Camp rumors are notoriously not to be depended on, and we can see no reason to make an exception in favor of this from Hilton Head. We are sure that an agreeable fact of such importance as the surrender of Fort Sumter would have been made known officially before this, if it had happened as long since as last Monday.

The move itself -- at a time when so much hangs upon our activity in Virginia -- is very gratifying; the captures are large enough to make a brilliant bulletin; and the strategic advantages already gained are very great. The movements of Gen. MEADE have, for some days past, been shrouded in obscurity, but it is obvious, from the line of march he has taken up, and the points at which he has thrown his army upon and across the Rappahannock, that he does not again mean to try the route by Culpepper and the upper Rapidan, the disadvantages of which had become so apparent. The army passed the Rappahannock at the railroad crossing and at Kelly's Ford, the same point at which HOOKER's main force crossed for the Chancellorsville campaign. This indicates a purpose of advance by the Fredericksburgh line. There is no fear, however, that our army will need, this time, to undergo such an ordeal as it has twice gone through in getting possession of its frowning heights, for the position in which Gen. MEADE has planted his army lakes Fredericksburgh in reverse. He will now be able also to obtain his supplies by way of Aquia Creek, a route entirely clear of guerrillas. Gen. MEADE has effected the passage of the Rappahannock in a very handsome manner. Everything now depends on the operations of the next few days. A single march will bring him to the old Chancellorsville battle-ground. The Army of the Potomac has never yet been able to stay more than three or four days south of the Rappahannock.

The enemy attempted to throw an entire division across the river at Kelly's Ford, but the movement was checked by Gen.

Mr. Loring's Pamphlet; on International Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/10/archives/american-and-english-position-in-international-law.html,Mr. Loring's Pamphlet; on International Law,"It is a matter of deep regret that so few of our public men and political leaders have made a study of International Law. Several very foolish and inconsistent positions, into which the guides of popular opinion have been betrayed during this war, might have been avoided by a more thorough acquaintance with this science. Nor is there any reason to believe that the mass of educated people on the other side of the ocean have any greater familiarity with it. In the discussions on the Foreign Enlistment act and the rams, Parliament and the Times have shown quite as much of mere popular passion, and quite as much ignorance of the precedents set in their own Courts, as our own excitable Democracy. A few writers and statesmen on either side have examined the questions now at issue in a truly legal and careful manner; and we believe we do not commit an American exaggeration when we say that the more thorough and profound the investigation is, the more clearly do the justice and fairness of our position in regard to the rebel privateers appear. Among the pamphlets which these questions of international law have called out on this side of the ocean, we do not remember to have seen one characterized by greater legal acumen and more thorough investigation than a recent brochure from an eminent lawyer of Boston, Hon. C.G. LORING, entitled ""The Neutral Relations of England and the United States."" Many of the letters of which the pamphlet is made up appeared in England during the Summer, and the position taken -- till then not recognized by any authority -- that the turreted rains were in their very structure ""armed vessels,"" and, therefore, not permitted to be furnished to a belligerent by a neutral, may have had some influence on the subsequent remarks and action of Earl RUSSELL, who has at length accepted this interpretation of the Enlistment act.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'American and English Position in International Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'American and English Position in International Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1bedb70e-a032-5702-903a-3fa100757652,1147,nyt://article/1bedb70e-a032-5702-903a-3fa100757652,

France, though excelling England in soft words, is found not a whit better in practical action.

This begun, the Society could extend its scope into a wider range of inquiry. The sixth regular monthly meeting was held on Thursday evening last, the President, Judge GREENWOOD in the chair. The report of Rev. Dr. STORES, Chairman of the Executive Committee, showed its progress to have exceeded any other in the history of such Societies. It engaged at once the earnest, cordial labors and received the liberal voluntary donations of the best men of all the intelligent classes of the City. It already numbers more than four hundred members. Its library contains 7,269 volumes and pamphlets, 3,000 of these being bound volumes. The library of AUBURY DICKENS, Esq., containing a full sett of Congressional documents for a long period -- about 700 volumes -- being for sale, Mr. S.B.

LES has very promptly followed up his late campaign from the Rapidan to Bull Run, by an official report of its purpose and progress. In reference to its purpose he declares that the movement was undertaken ""with the design of bringing on an engagement with the Federal army."" We fancy this theory states the purpose of seeking a battle with rather more determination than it really existed in his mind. It is quite possible that under very favorable circumstances LEE would have been willing to risk a battle; but that he sought it at all hazards, as he would make believe, is not true, and it would have been a piece of audacity of which he is incapable, if with his forty thousand men against a Union force of almost double that strength, he had done so. He was unable to find this favorable opportunity, and along the line of advance he not only did not seek, but he avoided battle. LEE's avowed intention was to gain the fortified heights of Centreville in advance of MEADE. In this he failed, and the failure is thus accounted for:",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LEE'S REPORT OF THE LATE CAMPAIGN."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""LEE'S REPORT OF THE LATE CAMPAIGN."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ad360e76-8d46-53b6-bc5f-bf1dacfc443b,319,nyt://article/ad360e76-8d46-53b6-bc5f-bf1dacfc443b,

the Exchange of and Rebel Ill-treatment of them,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/10/archives/the-exchange-of-prisoners.html,the Exchange of and Rebel Ill-treatment of them,"The accounts which are now coming in every day of the ill-treatment of the Union prisoners at Richmond, confirmed, as they are, by the appearance of the men who are exchanged, are so horrible that the Government outght at once to take measures to bring about a general exchange. Whatever the merits of the controversy between Mr. OULD and Gen. MEREDITH may be, it will hardly be maintained that it is better to let ten or twelve thousand of our soldiers be starved to death than to give way. We believe that the real matter in dispute at present is as to the number of paroles granted on each side, and the difference in the two lists amounts to something like 17,000 -- a very large number, no doubt. Considering the indifference with which the oath of allegiance is regarded by most rebel sympathizers, and the extraordinary unscrupulousness which rebel leaders have at various times displayed in their dealings with the North, it is not at all unlikely that great numbers of their paroled prisoners have gone back to duty before being exchanged. It is very probable that we are egregiously cheated in every one of our exchanges. When people are in such a state of mind that their newspapers applaud such outrages as the sack of Lawrence as a ""fair blow at the enemy,"" and approve of murder in cold blood like that of ELLSWORTH, as a legitimate mode of carrying on war, and finally, as within the last few days, recommend that prisoners of war be put ""where the cold weather and scant fare will thin them out in accordance with the laws of nature,"" it is hardly to be expected that they should be very nice in their regard for such an abstraction as a ""parole of honor,"" when given to a hated enemy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Exchange of Prisoners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Exchange of Prisoners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2ec01aa-d71a-55be-90bc-0da30f809442,956,nyt://article/e2ec01aa-d71a-55be-90bc-0da30f809442,

The President's Call for Volunteers,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/11/archives/the-presidents-call-for-volunteersthe-duty-of-young-men.html,The President's Call for Volunteers,"The question whether the President's call for volunteers shall be met with in the period to which it is limited, depends mainly upon the public spirit of the young men. They are the class from which alone serviceable soldiers can be obtained. ""Young men for war"" is the accepted maxim in all nations. Their physical vigor and endurance, their elasticity and dash, particularly fit them for the field. The loyal States are very powerful in this class of population. Notwithstanding all the drain that has been made upon them, they still contain over two millions of men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. A sixth part of this number, properly armed, drilled and disciplined, and incorporated with our armies already in the field, might sweep off all that remains of this rebellion before next Summer. There never was a more sacred call. Every young man who has a spark of manhood in his breast ought to give heed to it. The country has a right to the service of its stoutest arms without compelling that service; and it is far more honorable to go to the field as a volunteer than as a conscript. Many of the exemptions which the present law of Congress grants, particularly the three hundred dollar commutation, will probably be repealed before the drafting process is again applied; and there will be hereafter comparatively few chances of escaping the consequences of the lot when it is once drawn. The Government is determined to have the personal services of just so many young men as it requires -- voluntarily if it can, compulsorily if it must. It is not so much a question to the young men whether they shall go, as how they shall go -- by choice or by coercion.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The President's Call for Volunteers--The Duty of Young Men."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The President's Call for Volunteers--The Duty of Young Men."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/05beaab5-3700-5084-9253-725c45c34742,1146,nyt://article/05beaab5-3700-5084-9253-725c45c34742,

His new campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/11/archives/gen-meades-new-campaign.html,His new campaign,"The advance of Gen. MEADE, if pushed with the vigor the occasion demands, should disturb the rebel plans for an offensive campaign in East Tennessee. It was the avowed belief of the rebels, in their late advance movement in Virginia, that the destruction of the railroad would so embarrass the Union army that the season available for active operations this Fall would be consumed, and that a small force would serve to cover Richmond permitting heavy detachments to be made from the rebel force in Virginia to reinforce their army in Tennessee. It must be acknowledged that past experience quite authorized them to form this conclusion, for every one of our Virginia campaigns has been followed by a long period of quiescence. But this time they have reckoned without their host. Gen. MEADE, in place of waiting for the completion of the railroad, to enable him to resume his former front of operations on the Culpepper line, has, by a well-planned movement, effected a change of base, (that is a change of secondary base,) and planted his army south of the Rappahannock, thus transferring operation to the Fredericksburgh line, and enabling him to draw his supplies by way of Aquia Creek.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

A few of the more impatient write letters to the newspapers, exhorting the rich to attend to their political duties, and vote at the primary meetings and at elections. Occasionally there is an amount of indignation got up sufficient to elect an honest Mayor, or an honest Comptroller, or an honest Street Commissioner; but the character of the legislative body is never changed. The Boards of Aldermen and Common Councilmen remain, in their essential features, precisely the same. There is the same majority of ignorant, unscrupulous and greedy hackmen, grogshop-keepers, contractors and nondescripts; the same feeble and accommodating minority of divers other professions; and the same resolute determination on the part of the whole body to spend money lavishly in spite of everybody. The Mayor's veto is about as effectual in impeding their action as the City Hall clock, and the Comptroller's honesty has about the same influence over their proceedings as the opinions of a private soldier over the policy of his Government. So that, in reality, the annual spasm of our ""respectable classes"" does little or nothing to lessen the sum of our abuses. As the time is approaching when we shall witness another election, we think it as well to warn people that no radical change can be effected under the present system, no matter how heroically the property-holders may go to the polls.

"The Board of Supervisors met at 2 o'clock P.M. yesterday. A resolution was adopted asking the Corporation Counsel to report a detailed statement of all suits pending against the County relative to taxes. Another resolution was adopted asking his opinion as to the right of the Board to remit taxes after the expiration of six months from the time they were levied, in cases where application for remission had been made prior to the expiration of the six months. A third resolution was adopted requesting the Committee on Annual Taxes to ascertain what amount was expended by the Union Defence Committee in 1861, to fit out regiments and send them to the field, with the view of asking Congress to reimburse the City for such outlays, in order to save the County from taxation in 1864 to pay the bonds upon which the money was raised. The Special Committee to recruit men for the army, under the new $2,000,000 ordinance, reported the result of the mission of a sub-Committee, consisting of Messrs. BLUNT and TWEED, who were sent to Washington last week. They went on there to ascertain if the Government would credit the men the Committee may raise on the quota claimed from the County. The Secretary of War received them graciously, and through Provost-Marshal-Gen. FRY, he conceded the guarantee desired by the Committee, that the recruits shall be credited to the County and to the Congressional Districts in which they resided at the time of their enlistment. The Committee express confidence in their ability to raise the full quota of the City by voluntary enlistment. The Board of Education sent in their estimate of expenses for 1864. The total amount is $1,789,000, of which $1,100,000 are for teachers' and janitors' salaries, and for the support of the Free Academy.

In this instance it is the worthy President of the National Academy of Design, Mr. DANIEL HUNTINGDON, who occupies it. A famous picture of his, called ""Mercy's Dream,"" has returned to the land of its inception, and challenges anew the admiration which it obtained in a cruder form, more than twenty years ago. The present painting is the ripe realization of an early fancy. So far back as 1841, Mr. HUNTINGDON had given ideal shape to JOHN BUNYAN's dream of Mercy and the Angel. There was a certain completeness about the picture even then, which pleased the public, and it was suggested that it should be engraved. Mr. HUNTINGDON, with a keener eye to the defects of his handiwork than to its beauties, determined to repaint the work before submitting it to the burin of the engraver. Seventeen years later this determination was carried out. It is the ""Mercy's Dream"" of 1858 that we now have an opportunity of seeing. The work, we may add, has been engraved, and the disposition of the engravings has been intrusted to Mr. JOHN MCCLURE, who is also the grand chamberlain of the picture, and performs all the essential courtesies between it and the public.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fine Arts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fine Arts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24af3849-4c27-5565-8b85-d8289329073a,919,nyt://article/24af3849-4c27-5565-8b85-d8289329073a,

It is said that all the contractors are determined to ask the interference of the Government in preventing the disasters which the strikes are likely to occasion them, by either increasing the amount of contract money to be paid for the vessels when finished, or by regulating by law the wages to be paid to mechanics. According to the contractors' story, a whole fleet of iron-clad vessels, which are not as vet completed, were contracted for over a year and and a half age, when wages and materials were 50 per cent. cheaper than they are now. They allege that the Government did not furnish the plane as rapidly as it promised to do, and also that it made alterations in the vessels which rendered it impossible to complete them in the time originally laid out for the work. They are, therefore, of opinion that the Navy Department should assist them in the present crisis. The workmen, on the other hand, assert that the employers are making a hundred per cent. on the capital sank in building the vessels, and that they do not give five for wages.

Their camps or settlements had no sanitary police; they were unprovided with proper clothing or medical attendance; they depended for food on the charity of the army officers, and no machinery for providing them with regular work had been contrived.

"Brig.-Gen. HAYES, the new Assistant Provost-Marshal-General, went to Albany last evening to consult with the Governor in relation to the means to be adopted for recruiting volunteers in this State under the new call of the President. The Board of Supervisors have decided to offer $300 each for volunteers enlisting in the City, which, with the bounties offered by the State and General Government, will amount to $706 for all recruits who have seen service, and $600 for new volunteers. If this does not have the effect to speedily fill the quota for this City, it is pretty certain that no pecuniary inducement would accomplish that result. The only evil effect of the large bounties offered here, will be that they will induce volunteers from the country districts to come here and enlist, and thus diminish the supply in other parts of the State. This can only be remedied by the cities and towns of the interior offering similar bounties. It will also have a tendency to stop the volunteering for the new regiments which are being raised by the State authorities, as the Government bounties, with those offered by this City, only apply to volunteers for regiments now in the field. One object of Gen. HAYES' visit to Albany, is to try and devise some means of harmonizing the recruiting service as carried on by the State authorities and by the General Government. There are several new regiments now being organized in the State, to whose officers it would be a great sacrifice to be compelled to abandon their enterprise after so great an outlay of time and money. We understand that Supervisor BLUNT is about to receive the commission of Major-General of Volunteers.

How to Deal With Them,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/13/archives/the-virginia-guerrillas-how-to-deal-with-them.html,How to Deal With Them,"There is something very extraordinary in the impunity enjoyed by the guerrillas who are operating within our lines in Virginia. From ""gobbling up"" small parties of our men, cutting off trains, robbing sutlers, and stampeding mules and horses, these gentry have now commenced the practice of assassination on a great scale. They lie in wait in the woods, singly or in parties of two or three, and fire upon passing officers or soldiers. Every day we hear of men being shot down in this way, and the evil is steadily increasing. The woods between our front and the Potomac are said to be swarming with ruffians who make their presence known solely by robbery and murder. They are said to be ""MOSEBY's men,"" but we believe nobody has the least knowledge whether they have anything to do with MOSEBY or not, or whether they have the smallest connection whatever with the Confederate army. There can be nothing easier than to take a musket and go into the woods and shoot at everybody who passes along the road. There is no reason why deserters, stragglers and robbers of all kinds and degrees should not rush to this mode of enriching themselves, or gratifying their bad passions; and we may be right well assured that as long as we content ourselves with the conclusion that anybody who waylays our soldiers in the vicinity of the camp is one of ""MOSEBY's guerrillas,"" and therefore entitled to the rank and honor of an enemy, all the bad characters who invariably swarm round an army, will go into the business of lying in wait and murdering. An orderly cannot at this moment be sent anywhere outside our camp without danger to his life; the officers cannot ride between two divisions of the army without a strong escort. And yet we are not half way to Richmond. We may imagine what the state of things will be as we advance further South, and when every needy Virginian and broken-down sutler that we leave behind on our track becomes fully aware that he has only to take a shot-gun, and get behind a tree, in order to fill his pockets with greenbacks and watches, with the certainty of being treated as a prisoner of war in case he is caught.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Virginia Guerrillas How to Deal With Them.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Virginia Guerrillas How to Deal With Them.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7db65dfd-f450-5763-a9fe-d68f7b4b2fc5,870,nyt://article/7db65dfd-f450-5763-a9fe-d68f7b4b2fc5,

Movement to join Grant,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/13/archives/gen-shermans-column.html,Movement to join Grant,"The fortunes of the moving column of Gen. SHERMAN, on its way from Vicksburgh and Memphis, to form a junction with the main body of GRANT's army, have for some time engaged the attention of those who follow military operations in the Southwest, and not always without anticipations of ill-luck. From latest accounts it is tolerably certain that this force has, by this time, reached its destination and formed a junction with GRANT's right wing at Stevenson. In order to effect this, however, it was found necessary to give up both the line by which it was intended this column should advance, and one of the prime objects it was expected to accomplish by the way. In the redistribution of Gen. GRANT's army after the capture of Vicksburgh, the Thirteenth corps was sent to Gen. BANKS at New-Orleans; a column made up of parts of the three other corps was dispatched under STEELE into Arkansas; the Seventeenth was assigned the duty of holding Vicksburgh, and the Mississippi, below Helena; the Sixteenth was given the task of guarding the Mississippi from Helena to Cairo, and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad as far east as Corinth, or, perhaps, Bear Creek, thirty miles beyond, on the Alabama line; and finally it was designed that the Fifteenth corps, under Gen. SHERMAN, should open the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, from Bear Creek as far east as Decatur, with the purpose of making this the main line of communications with Chattanooga. A glance at a map whereon the railroad lines are indicated will show that this line, after nearing the Tennessee at Iuka, runs eastward on the southern side of the river, and follows its general course as far as Decatur, where it crosses to the north side of the river, and thence continues eastward to Chattanooga, crossing again to the south side of the Tennessee at Bridgeport. It is obvious that if the portion of the line of railroad running on the south side of the Tennessee -- that is, from Memphis to Decatur -- could be reopened and maintained, it would afford an invaluable channel through which the army at Chattanooga might draw supplies. Work was accordingly commenced, and by the 1st of November the road had been opened from Corinth for forty miles, through Iuka, and across Bear Creek to Cherokee Station, Ala. No sooner was this purpose apparent, however, than a powerful rebel cavalry force, said to amount to ten thousand, under command of Gen. S.D. LEE, swarmed in the vicinity, hanging on and harrassing the flank of our force, and retiring before it, tearing up and destroying the railroad as they receded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

"Delaware, The Election in",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/14/archives/the-election-in-delaware.html,"Delaware, The Election in","A very active political canvass is going on in Delaware for the election of a Member of Congress. Mr. SMITHERS, the Union candidate, is a man of ability, an eloquent speaker and a thoroughgoing supporter of the Government in its prosecution of the war against the rebellion. His opponent, CHARLES BROWN, is, practically, and to all intents and purposes, a Secessionist. He was formerly Collector of the Port of Philadelphia, and has but lately taken up his residence in Delaware. Public meetings, large and enthusiastic, are held in various parts of the State, and the Union men hope for a very decided victory. In another part of this morning's paper we copy from the Delaware State Journal, a speech made by Mr. RAYMOND at Wilmington on the 6th inst., in which the various points involved in the National contest are discussed. Among them are the subjects of arbitrary arrests, the object for which the war is carried on, and the question of Reconstruction. The ground taken on the latter point is, that no State can possibly release any one of its citizens from his allegiance to the National Constitution, -- and that much less can it release them all; that they are, therefore, as much in the Union to-day as they were before the rebellion broke out.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ELECTION IN DELAWARE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ELECTION IN DELAWARE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Delaware', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4c1f29ac-7cdc-5b4e-926e-789bd9ff746f,454,nyt://article/4c1f29ac-7cdc-5b4e-926e-789bd9ff746f,

Our readers will recollect that she was a vessel fitted out by the notorious APPLETON OAKSMITH, of this City. He did not have the title to her in his own name, but had the entire charge of her, and was fitting her up ostensibly to go on a whaling voyage. The Government seized her, however, believing that she was intended to go to the African coast. Her owners gave bonds for her, and receiving her again into their possession, boldly prepared still to carry out their intention and send her to sea without any change in her fitment or alleged destination. There have been times when vessels seized for the Slave-trade and bonded, have been allowed to proceed upon their voyage, but those days are past. The Government officers, finding that the enterprise was apparently being continued, did not hesitate to seize her again, and this time the owners did not bond her, but left her in the custody of the Court till this second case should be tried. Both cases in due time were tried -- the first before Judge SHIPMAN, who decided against the vessel, the second before Judge SMALLEY, who has not yet decided either way. An appeal was taken from Judge SHIPMAN's decision to the Circuit Court, and on this appeal the District-Attorney gave evidence of the proceedings of the vessel subsequent to her being bonded until she was seized the second time; and Judge NELSON now affirms the decision, holding that these new proofs show clearly that her second equipment was for a slaving voyage, and from the relation of this to the first equipment, it was clear that that was also a voyage with that intent.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Case of the Slaver Augusta.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Case of the Slaver Augusta.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b4f85a90-40ab-54b2-aa49-f8025c2f21db,395,nyt://article/b4f85a90-40ab-54b2-aa49-f8025c2f21db,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/14/archives/musical.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- BELLINI's opera of ""La Somnambula"" was the attraction here last night. How marvelously fresh and charming are the melodies in this work, notwithstanding the many, many years of hackneying they have had to undergo! Would that we had more of such subjects treated in so superb a manner. The distribution last night was in all respects good. Miss KELLOGG is one of the most graceful and charming Aminas now on the stage. The music lays easily within the best parts of her voice; her execution of it is in every respect neat, modest and effective; her dramatic rendering of the character is in the highest degree pleasing. With such strong points in her favor -- and blended, we may add, into a consisent and lovable whole -- it is not remarkable that Miss KELLOGG always achieved a new success in this part. Throughout the performance she was in admirable voice. Signor G. LOTTI was the Elvino. This gentleman's efforts have been confined heretofore to German opera. It was only in ""Macbeth."" under Mr. MARETZEK, that he gave the promise of a career. The sweet quality of his voice -- assisted perhaps by the entourage -- astonished and pleased every one. In BELLINI's opera he has an opportunity which he can hardly hope to better, however much his ability to seize it may improve. He succeeded remarkably. Visibly nervous, he contrived to reserve his best strength for the second and third acts, where strength is most required. There are few tenori-de-grazia now before the public with more acceptable voices than Signor LOTTI. Time and practice will accustom him to the business of the stage -- in which he is evidently inexperienced -- and study will, we are sure, reveal new beauties in a voice already so acceptable. Signor BIACHI was a good Rudolpho, and Miss FANNY STOCKTON, although too timid to do full justice to herself, sang the music of Lisa with ability. The orchestra and chorus under Mr. MARETZEK were both admirable.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c0a06d50-4b54-566f-9abb-d00ca44e00a7,455,nyt://article/c0a06d50-4b54-566f-9abb-d00ca44e00a7,

Prisoners are starved, deprived of drink until they are driven to the verge of insanity, interrupted in their sleep at frequent intervals, and often nearly flogged to death. Besides those who are in the prisons, thousands of youths, landowners, townsmen, priests, and peasants, have been exiled to Siberia, their clothes torn, their feet bare, and their arms loaded with chains. Many districts are completely depopulated; the estates of all who belong to the insurrection, or are suspected of having belonged to it, have been sequestrated, their proprietors banished or imprisoned, and their wives and children turned out to beg in the roads. The corn in many fields is still standing, the peasantry being encouraged to remain idle by the Government; all trade is paralyzed, and the merchants refuse to buy corn at a third of its value, although the cost of labor has increased three-fold. Any one neglecting to pay the Government tax of 10 per cent. has his estate occupied by the troops, and everything on it sold for mere trifles to the peasantry. Decrees rivaling each other in severity are published daily. The last orders the land-owners to give up all the corn on their estates to the Government.

Plenty of cotton being in a store near by the Court-house, the Colonel ordered a sufficient quantity to be used to barricade the streets surrounding the Court-house square, and having eleven cannon, planted them in position to rake the three streets leading to the centre of the city. His force was less than 700, with no infantry. The enemy attacked both places at 9 o'clock simultaneously on the southeast, south, and west sides of the city, they having come in on three different roads. On arriving at the outskirts, shells were thrown in every direction into the city, and no notice given for the women and children to leave. The bursting of the shells caused an extraordinary excitement -- women and children running from every direction to the Court-house for safety. In a few moments the rebels advanced, directing their fire upon the building. The women and children were removed under the banks of the river, where they remained exposed, throughout the cold, dreary day, until the battle was over, which was about 5 o'clock in the evening.

"SAD DEATH IN A SCHOOLROOM. -- Coroner RANNEY held an inquest on the body of a little girl aged about 4 years, named LOUISA SCHNEIDER, who died in her schoolroom under the following circumstances: The child for some time past has attended the Twenty-fourth-street school. It appears that it is the habit if the teachers of that school to detain after hours such of the pupils as may have been deficient in their lessons during the day. Upon the occasion in question, the deceased, with twelve other scholars, were kept in. Deceased seemed to take the punishment very seriously, and asked her teacher to allow her to go. The teacher, noticing her agitation, kindly told her that she might go as soon as she was able to spell correctly, the word ""hedge."" This appeared to appease her and she went to her seat. Soon, however, it was observed that the child threw her head back and was gasping for breath. The teacher took her in her arms and did all she could to relieve her, but after three or four gasps she expired. These are the facts as testified to upon the inquest. The jury rendered a verdict of death from ""Syncope."" Dr. RANNEY made an examination of the body, and his testimony was in accordance with the verdict. He further testified that ""Syncope"" might be produced by fear, excessive grief, or the heat of a room. At first there was much feeling among the relatives of the deceased; they fearing that the teacher had ill-treated, and too severely punished her for not reciting her lesson, but the evidence of the teacher and several pupils all went to show that such was not the case. The child was possessed of very fine feelings, an affectionate nature, and was greatly beloved by teacher and schoolmates.",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/15/archives/general-city-news.html,,"SAD DEATH IN A SCHOOLROOM. -- Coroner RANNEY held an inquest on the body of a little girl aged about 4 years, named LOUISA SCHNEIDER, who died in her schoolroom under the following circumstances: The child for some time past has attended the Twenty-fourth-street school.

"At a late hour on Thursday night last, the fur-store of GEORGE C. TREADWELL, situated on Broadway, in the City of Albany, was entered by a gang of burglars and robbed of $3,000 worth of mufls, cloaks and capes. As soon as the burglary was discovered, the Chief of Police of the latter city telegraphed to Police Headquarters in New-York, giving notice of the robbery; that there were strong suspicions that the offenders were then on their way to this City, and asking the Detectives here to be on the watch for them.

The plan at length succeeded, and when the night steamboat, Isaac Newton, arrived at her wharf yesterday morning, she was boarded by the officers, under direction of Detective FARLEY, and after a long and tedious examination, five men, who well answered the description, were found and taken into custody.

"EXPLOSION OF GUNPOWDER IN A FANCY-STORE -- THE BUILDING SHATTERED AND A YOUNG GIRL INJURED. -- About 1 1/2 o'clock on Friday afternoon an explosion occurred in the fancy-store of Mrs. LYDIA BOOTH, No. 71 Hudson avenue, near Water-street, which resulted in great damage to the building and serious injury to a young girl (a servant) named BRIDGET DUNCAN. Mrs. BOOTH, it appears, was a licensed seller of gunpowder, and had on hand, as she states, about four pounds, which she kept in the usual manner, in cans, and had them placed upon the shelves. The first floor, which she occupies, consists of a front room, in which the store is kept, and a back sitting-room. An entry, leading to the upper stories, is detached from the rooms. The building is of brick, three stories in height. Mrs. BOOTH was sitting in the back room, while the servant (the girl DUNCAN,) was cleaning the stove, when, the powder exploding, completely demolished all that was in the stove, forcing out the windows and doors tearing out the partitions and shattering the house from foundation to roof. The ceiling of the basement was torn off, and the floor of the second story was heaved up to such an extent as to turn the stove upside down and scatter everything in the room. Officers BEDELL and PEARCE, of the Forty-second Precinct, who were passing at the time, entered the building and found the girl DUNCAN lying among the ruins, frightfully burned and otherwise injured. She was at once picked up and taken to the drug-store No. 50 Hudson-avenue, where her wounds were dressed by Drs. THEALL and YOUNG. She was then conveyed to the Brooklyn City Hospital. She stated to the officers that she was alone in the store; that she was using no light, and could not account for the accident. The loss sustained by Mrs. BOOTH amounts to about $1,000, and the damage to the building about $1,000 more -- insured in the Brooklyn Insurance Companies.

The Anglo-Japanese War,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/15/archives/the-anglojapanese-war.html,The Anglo-Japanese War,"The British force which lately assailed Kagosima was more formidable, the fight more desperate, the result more tragic, than the account via San Francisco led us to suppose. This is evident both from the telegraphic report of the affair published in the London papers, and from the news in relation to it just brought by the East Indian mail. The squadron which, under Admiral KUPER, bombarded Kagosima, consisted, of two frigates and five smaller vessels. Sudden as was the advent of the British, the Japanese were not unprepared for them. The forts mounted over 90 guns, including four 150-pounders and some 13-inch mortars, mostly American. Hardly had the squadron taken up position in front of the city, when the shore batteries opened fire, which was promptly responded to by the ships, and thus began an engagement that lasted until dark. The retainers of Prince SATSUMA fought bravely, served their cannon well, and inflicted serious damage on their assailants -- for the British had, according to their own statement, thirteen killed, fifty wounded, and so many of their vessels disabled that, as soon as night put an end to the conflict, they deemed it prudent to return to Yokahama to refit.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/17/archives/catarrh-the-lightning-calculator-a-remarkable-case.html,,"In the nomenclature of medicine there is no disease so little thought of and yet none, when permitted to become chronic, so subtle or so fatal in its character as catarrh. It often originates in coryza, or ordinary cold, and as such, when the inflammation is local, extending not beyond the Schniederian membrane, it is readily reached and with proper attention may be removed. When, however, it is neglected, the disease rapidly but silently spreads itself, and soon the patient finds himself surrounded by a web of diseases that are certain to carry him to the grave, unless he is fortunate in finding one who, knowing the gravity of his case, applies remedies that cannot fail to reach and ultimately destroy not only the parent affection, but all the attendant horrors that follow in its fiery train. From coryza, catarrh may develop itself into gravedo, attacking the frontal sinuses, and then we have what is called ""cold in the head:"" if from the nose and head it extends to the fauces or posterior part of the mouth, sore throat results, which rapidly spreads to the glottis and pharynx, inducing cough and hoarseness, and, following these, we have (provided the affection is not arrested) opthalmia, deafness, the paralyzation and eventual destruction of the digestive organs, and last stage of all, phthisis. Thus we have the origin and some of the phenomena of a disease which, often proceeding from cold, ends in death. The acrid matter which is secreted in the nose and head, where abscesses are formed, drops on the tongue; and thence, as it burns its way down the throat, attacks the stomach, and presently the villous coating is affected. With offensive breath, the tongue is often swollen and the skin removed, and the action of the papillae paralyzed, if not utterly destroyed. There are many other affections that originate in catarrh which it is not necessary to speak specifically of in this place, as we desire to present, in the person of one who is notorious in our City, a striking example of how far, when improperly treated, catarrh may undermine the physical constitution, and then how readily it can be made to yield to scientific treatment.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Catarrh ""The Lightning Calculator"" A Remarkable Case.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Catarrh ""The Lightning Calculator"" A Remarkable Case.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19168de0-974d-55b7-bc03-169753e15d36,1219,nyt://article/19168de0-974d-55b7-bc03-169753e15d36,

For obvious reasons we are not permitted to state its location. It is one of the most marvelous inventions of the time, and if successful, will revolutionize naval ordnance. Mr. ERICSSON contracted, some time since, to construct some 13-inch smoothbore guns, which are to have a much greater initial velocity than any now in use. He is to receive nothing for them unless they burn over 50 pounds of powder; for every pound of powder beyond 50, Mr. ERICSSON is to receive $5,000. He is confident of being able to burn 100 pounds, and is certain of burning 75 pounds. The solid shot will weigh 220 pounds. The English 68-pounder, (of 12,500 pounds,) said by H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge to be the most powerful gun in the English service, with 10 pounds of powder, (nearly one-fourth of the charge.) has an initial velocity of 1,800 feet per second, and, therefore, a punching power against iron plates of 27,500,000 pounds. The rifled guns, with charges of one-tenth to one-twelfth of the shots, and the 15-inch gun, with a charge of thirty-five pounds to its shot of 425 pounds, have velocities ranging from 1,100 feet to 1,400 feet per second. The 300-pounder Parrott has, therefore, a punching power of 42,000,000 pounds, and the 15-inch gun of 55,500,000 pounds. The new gun, with 75 pounds charge, (one-third of the weight) will have as great a velocity as the 68-pounder, and its punching power will be 55,000,000 pounds, or exactly double that of the English gun. With 100 pounds of powder its velocity should be raised to 2,000 feet, and its punching power will be 68,000,000 pounds. It will thus be by far the most formidable gun yet constructed.

"On Sunday morning, about 5 o'clock, the Hendrik Hudson, on her down trip from Albany, came into collision with a schooner attached to a tow. The morning was pitch dark, and the steamer was under good headway. The schooner struck her, tearing away all the railings, guards, and many of the staterooms forward the wheel-house, smashing in the wheel-house, and ripping away the side works and some of the staterooms aft -- in short, making a wreck of one side, and punching a hole in one of the boilers. The concussion was terrific, and the passengers, of whom there was a large number, were aroused, and rushed from berths in all kinds and lengths of garments; terrified on meeting the steam, and not knowing what fate awaited them, an indescribable scene ensued among men as well as women and children. No officers of the boat made their appearance to allay the terror, and it was some time before it was ascertained that danger of burning or sinking was not imminent. But in that ""some time"" there was a world of agony and apprehension to all on board. There was no damage done to the steamer beyond that stated. The accident occurred some forty miles from this City, and as a precautionary measure the Hendrik was run, with the aid of the remaining boiler, near the shore into shoal water, where daylight was awaited, when the trip was resumed to New-York, reaching here at 2 P.M.

In view of the difficulties between Denmark and the German confederation on the Schleswig-Holstein question, Austria intends to send a portion of her fleet from the Adriatic to blockade the Danish ports. The state of affairs in Poland shows no change. Continued activity on the part of the insurgents was reported. The advices from Austria indicate that MAXIMILIAN is making preparations for his trip to Mexico. FRANCIS JOSEPH has decided upon authorizing such Austrian officers as may wish, to accompany the Archduke, with the view of cooperating in the military organization of Mexico, and do so with the faculty of reassuming their grade in the Austrian army on their return.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e4335078-75ea-5999-9284-eb91c8479ac2,236,nyt://article/e4335078-75ea-5999-9284-eb91c8479ac2,
"Rev. C.C. GOSS closed, on Sunday, his series of interesting and valuable discourses on ""The Moral Aspects of our City,"" in the Tabernacle on Broadway.

Twice in the course of our civil war the Government has found occasion to depend upon the militia of this and the neighboring States, and its chief support in both instances has proceeded from the militia of this City. The timely aid it furnished at the commencement of hostilities saved Washington from capture and held Maryland in the line of loyal States. It has been under fire in many battles, and manifested the spirit and coolness of veteran corps. It has made forced marches, and been subjected to exposures equal in severity to any borne by the hardiest soldiers. Composed largely of men whose business interests suffer from their absence, it has never shirked its duty, but marched unhesitatingly to the field whenever an emergency demanded. It must always be remembered that its action has been voluntary, and in response to a sense of patriotic duty only. It has never been forced to the field. During the late invasion of Pennsylvania, two of our most recently formed regiments -- the Thirty-seventh and Twenty-second -- held Carlisle against a superior force and under heavy fire, and saved it from threatened destruction.

Hard Up,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/18/archives/hard-up.html,Hard Up,"-- It is very melancholy to see a martyr reduced to extremities. So long as his martyrdom makes him popular, there is something inspiring and heroic about it; but a professional martyr who fails is a sad sight. VALLANDIGHAM seems to be in this category, His old Democratic friends are reproaching him with having caused their defeat in Ohio. Several of the Western Democratic papers are speaking of his having adopted an ""unfortunate theory"" in regard to the war, with which the people do not sympathize! That is a very mild way of putting it. One of them says that it is better that ""a dozen Vallandighams should go under"" than that the Democratic party should be ruined by his mistakes. While the country alone suffered from his ""peculiarities,"" these journals were quite resigned; but when the party was endangered, things wore quite a different aspect. But nothing can show the desperate and dismal condition of poor VALLANDIGHAM's fortunes better than the fact, announced by the last foreign steamer, that he has taken to writing letters to WM. CORNELL JEWETT. That's the last stage of political delirium tremens. Our neighbor GREELEY could have warned him against it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HARD UP.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HARD UP.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce6fefb3-3fbc-5839-a266-2d473b3df69b,197,nyt://article/ce6fefb3-3fbc-5839-a266-2d473b3df69b,

"The County Canvassers met at noon yesterday, but immediately adjourned to 10 o'clock this morning, out of respect to Supervisor DAVIS, whose wife's obsequies were to take place at 3 o'clock P.M., and which the Board, as Supervisors, had resolved the day before to attend. Judge MCCUNN, with his counsel, and counsel for Judge BOSWORTH, were present to argue the question of allowing any alteration to be made in the returns from the Tenth District of the Eighth Ward, in case the District Canvassers should acknowledge the returns they have already made to be incorrect. The clerks to the County Canvassers figure out a majority of twenty-two for Judge BOSWORTH, and if the supposed defective returns are canvassed as they are now rendered to the Board, he will be declared elected. Then Judge MCCUNN doubtless will take legal proceedings to supersede Judge BOSWORTH by proving that votes were actually given for him in the District mentioned. On this fact he will claim that the returns were invalid, and that therefore the votes for Judge BOSWORTH ought not to have been allowed. These points gained would, it is believed, give him the election. The Canvassers, who are the best judges, will adhere to the returns as made by them. If MCCUNN goes to law in the attempt to recover an honor that votes did not confer upon him, he will receive a second condemnation which will give Mozart a riddance that they will thank their deities for.

The Senator sailed from this port, loaded with grain, and was lost at sea on the 27th of August, 1862, as is claimed by plaintiff, during a heavy gale. The ship was insured in five Companies. Only one, the Neptune, has paid the amount of its policy without contest. Suits are pending against the others. The defence allege that the vessel was so old and unseaworthy that she cropped to pieces; that she was not lost in a gale, but foundered in ordinary weather from weakness and being overloaded. The amount involved is over $35,000. The Captain of the Senator has been arrested, charged with scuttling the ship. The case has occupied the Court for several days. The evidence of well-known sea-captains, and of the plaintiff himself, was given at great length to show the seaworthiness of the vessel at the time of sailing. On the part of the defence the mates of the Senator were examined. The second mate, Mr. Thompson, testified that before sailing part of the cabin furniture, spare sails, cordage, &c., were sent ashore. That part of the lower hold was not stowed; that she commenced making water the evening of the first day out and on the fifth day she had five and a half feet of water in the hold. They had, in his opinion, no rough weather -- nothing more than a good stiff breeze. On the fifth day the master of the ship asked Thompson to go among the men and frighten them in regard to the condition of the vessel. In consequence of what Thompson told them, the men went aft to the Captain and it was decided to abandon the vessel. At that time the weather was calm and pleasant. The first mate was also examined and testified that with the assistance of the Captain he had scuttled the ship, although in the protest he swore that she was lost through the stress of weather. The witnesses for the defence were subjected to a rigid and lengthy cross-examination by plaintiff's counsel.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Case of the Ship Senator, Alleged to have been Scuttled by the Captain.; SUPERIOR COURT TRIAL TERM.

Ten coffins of funereal cypress received the honorable deposit, one for each of the tribes of the city, and an eleventh in memory of the unrecognized, but not therefore unhonored, dead, and of those whose remains could not be recovered. On the fourth day the mournful procession was formed; mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, led the way, and to them it was permitted by the simplicity of ancient manners to utter aloud their lamentations for the beloved and the lost; the male relatives of the deceased followed; citizens and strangers closed the train. Thus marshalled they moved to the place of interment in that famous Ceramicus, the most beautiful suburb of Athens, which had been adorned by CIMON, the son of MILTIADES, with walks and fountains and columns; whose groves were filled with altars, shrines and temples; whose gardens were ever green with streams from the neighboring hills, and shaded with the trees sacred to Minerva, and coeval with the foundation of the city; whose circuit inclosed",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ADDRESS; DELIVERED AT GETTYSBURGH ON THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE CEMETERY Prepared for the Interment of the Remains of Those Who Fell on the 1st, 2d and 3d of July, in the Battles There.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ADDRESS; DELIVERED AT GETTYSBURGH ON THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER AT THE CONSECRATION OF THE CEMETERY Prepared for the Interment of the Remains of Those Who Fell on the 1st, 2d and 3d of July, in the Battles There.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'BY Edward Everett', 'person': [{'firstname': 'Edward', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Everett', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6af5f219-8570-587a-94e2-92045e6d6995,13706,nyt://article/6af5f219-8570-587a-94e2-92045e6d6995,

South and North,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/20/archives/cavalry-south-and-north.html,South and North,"-An article recently published in Richmond on the Confederate cavalry, says that the cavalry arm of their service has recently become an ""object of distrust, if not of contempt,"" and admits the great superiority and higher effectiveness of the Northern cavalry. It was of their cavalry that the rebels boasted loudest during the first year of the war. The ferocious Southern horsemen, the centaurs of the Southwest, were to trample down the greasy mechanics, small-fisted farmers, and mudsills generally, like weeds in their path. They were to ravage and play havoc all around. We in the North were inclined to tacitly admit the rebel superiority in this branch, and kept rather quiet about our cavalry at first, though there were some things, like TOMPKINS' charge through Fairfax Court-house, and ZAGONYI's charge at Springfield of which we felt justly proud. But two years have made a very great change. We have now a splendid body of cavalry, though not nearly as powerful as it ought to be; and during the bygone Summer and Autumn, they have met the rebels in a hundred fights of varying magnitude, from the great battle in June on the Rappahannock, down to hand-to-hand encounters between a half-dozen men, and in nearly every one of these actions the rebels have been worsted, as has been shown from time to time in the thrilling ""Cavalry Record"" of our correspondent, Mr. PAUL, and as the rebels themselves have at last reluctantly confessed. And now they are forced to own that the Southern cavalry, whose exploits were to be so terrible, have become an ""object of distrust, if not of contempt.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CAVALRY, SOUTH AND NORTH', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CAVALRY, SOUTH AND NORTH', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af4fa22e-02bf-5b32-9ce3-f7b857039de3,271,nyt://article/af4fa22e-02bf-5b32-9ce3-f7b857039de3,

There seems to be no doubt but that the rebels are operating in considerable force against BURNSIDE from the Southwest, and that this force is a part of BRAGG'S army, detached for that especial purpose, and commanded, probably, by LONGSTREET. The dispatch speaks of the advance of the enemy as being made by the Kingston Road. Kingston, like Knoxville, is on the north bank of the Tennessee, but owing to a great bend in the river lies almost due west from the latter place, and distant about fifty miles. We have had no account of its occupation by the rebels, and they have probably avoided it, as it is too far to the left of their line. It now seems that the rebels, after compelling our troops to evacuate Loudon, on the river, thirty-five miles southwest of Knoxville, two weeks ago, crossed at that place and moved upon Knoxville. following the line of the railroad and bringing np supplies via Cleveland, Tenn. Knoxville has been the headquarters of Gen. BURNSIDE ever since he entered East Tennessee, and it is reported to be strongly fortified. It should not surprise any one if some of the ground in that section is yielded when threatened by a heavy force. Gen. BURNSIDE has been clearing out and occupying a district of country two hundred miles long by nearly one hundred broad, and his troops have been necessarily widely scattered.

In their haste to get to the altar most of them wont stop to learn any business properly; and the few who do, by the very act, become worth having as wives, and thus are pretty sure to get husbands, who, of course, would not let them continue at their trade, even if they were willing to do so, which never happens. Thus, good female workers are always scarce, and poor ones superabundant. Of course then, while the former are well paid, the latter are miserably paid, and always must be until we can contrive to change female nature or escape the laws of political economy. Madame DEMOREST employes about two hundred girls and women, at wages ranging from a dollar and a half a week to twenty. The cheap ones she can get any number of; the dear ones -- and she says it is a general complaint -- have ""never been so difficult to obtain.""

The usual haut en bas tone of the Tory Press was mimicked by English commercial men, and we were often treated to such phrases as ""Laws cannot be changed in England as they are in the United States, in a moment;"" ""Mobs do not rule in Great Britain,"" and ""We must obey law, you know!""",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'International Law before Parliament.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'International Law before Parliament.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3c272b9d-7215-5326-bcbf-15f293104dc9,821,nyt://article/3c272b9d-7215-5326-bcbf-15f293104dc9,

When he spoke of misdirection, he must be understood to include in that the omission to give a proper direction, and also giving a direction which might in one sense be justified, but which had a tendency to mislead, and might have misled the jury. The learned gentleman then stated that the information was filed by the Crown on the 25th May last, on the seizure of the vessel, which took place in the yard of Messrs. MILLER & SON, shipbuilders, at Liverpool. There were ninety-eight counts in the information, that number being rendered necessary by the rather complicated structure of the clause of the Act of Parliament on which the information was founded. In substance to charged the persons whom he would mention with various acts against a certain section of the Foreign Enlistment Act. The persons charged in the record were these: The members of the firm of MILLER & SONS, the builders of the vessel, and in whose yard she was when she was seized; the firm of FAWCETT & CO., manufacturers of machinery at Liverpool, who came forward as the claimants of the vessel; the firm of FRAZER, TRENHOLME & CO., who were proved to be the general agents for the business of the Confederate States at Liverpool; a person named Capt. BULLOCK, the special agent for the business of those States; and a person named TESSIER, who was also employed in that business. Those persons, together with others not known, were charged in every count of the information with different acts in violation of the Foreign Enlistment Act. The separate counts were founded on the language of the seventh section, which was directed against the ""equipping, furnishing, fitting-out, or arming"" of a ship or vessel, or attempting to do so, with the intent of employing such ship or vessel in the belligerent service of a foreign people or state against persons with whom her Majesty was not at war. The learned Counsel then pointed out that the words ""equipping,"" ""furnishing"" &c., were employed in the disjunctive sense, and observed that the Crown did not charge ""arming"" in the information.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN TOPICS.; CASE OF THE ALEXANDRA.

"Of all diseases, there is none more prevalent, deleterious, and yet more neglected, than Catarrh. Few realize the fatal consequences of neglecting it, and, consequently, are not cognizant of how many diseases to which it is inducive.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/21/archives/a-treatise-on-catarrh-by-dr-rowe-of-no-49-concordst-brooklyn-its.html,,"Of all diseases, there is none more prevalent, deleterious, and yet more neglected, than Catarrh. Few realize the fatal consequences of neglecting it, and, consequently, are not cognizant of how many diseases to which it is inducive. It is truly surprising that, of a disease so prevalent, and exercising such pernicious effects on the system, so little should be known by both professional and non-professional. It is much to be regretted that the medical faculty should have paid so little attention to it, or otherwise much suffering would have been relieved, and undoubtedly many might have been saved from a premature grave. But, nevertheless, it is a fact that cannot be denied, hundreds, yes, thousands, being living witnesses to this fact, and how many that are gone none can tell. In consequence of their total ignorance of it, and exerting themselves in no way to gain more information on the subject, hundreds of nostrums, in the shape of snuffs, have sprung up like mushrooms, as the panacea for the disease in all its stages; and, worse than this, these very snuffs have been recommended by physicians. Not willing to admit their ignorance of the disease, the patient is dismissed when applying for aid, with the answer that ""Catarrh can never be cured."" Try a little snuff, says one; a little fine salt and sugar, says another; snuff up a little cold water, says a third. If these remedies are not prescribed, it is either neuralgia or the effects of a cold, which will soon wear away. Alas! how many there are that wear away before the cold does! Being a regular Physician myself, and at one time a general Practitioner, nothing disrespectful is intended to the general practitioner, as, feeling that their services are but too little appreciated, it would be foreign to my object to wish to make the slightest imputation, but in a work like this, where the health, comfort, and even lives of thousands are at stake, it is not only impossible to avoid, but absolutely necessary to criticise, even though it be harshly. It will be seen from this that really nothing that could be beneficial has been done. Consequently there are many that believe that the disease can never be cured, added to which, their having been told by those in whom they naturally placed confidence, that ""Catarrh can never be cured."" has tended to make them more positive in their opinions. It must be remembered by such that this is a progressive age. Science has made and is making gigantic strides. Many things that could not be done when they were boys, and which had one hinted of being ultimately done, would have brought down the ridicule of those before whom he should have been so foolhardy as to venture the assertion, have been accomplished. The sciences of both Medicine and Surgery have not been behind hand, but have kept pace with the other branches of science. How many operations in by-gone times, now performed with facility and success, were then looked on as not only impracticable, but absolutely impossible. Why then may I not ask, should not more have been learned of Catarrh and an effectual method of treating it?",,7,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Treatise on Catarrh, by Dr. Rowe, of No. 49 Concord-st., Brooklyn.; ITS CAUSES--PERNICIOUS EFFECTS ON THE SYSTEM-- WHERE LOCATED--HOW TREATED HERETOFORE--DISEASES WHICH IT PRODUCES--FATAL CONSEQUENCES OFNEGLECTING IT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Treatise on Catarrh, by Dr. Rowe, of No. 49 Concord-st., Brooklyn.; ITS CAUSES--PERNICIOUS EFFECTS ON THE SYSTEM-- WHERE LOCATED--HOW TREATED HERETOFORE--DISEASES WHICH IT PRODUCES--FATAL CONSEQUENCES OFNEGLECTING IT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c7b5ba5-e8a5-5f75-8b33-41e3c465ce8b,2267,nyt://article/7c7b5ba5-e8a5-5f75-8b33-41e3c465ce8b,

The ever-increasing poverty and ignorance of large cities, the inequality of conditions, the little chance afforded to vast numbers of people of ever gaining even the common goods of life, and the fearfully explosive nature of a population which has no solid interest in the public welfare, and yet is moved by all the passions of the lowest humanity -- are enough to excite the utmost anxiety in all who regard the security of society. It is not to be wondered at that innumerable plans for ""social reorganization"" should have been brought to birth in this century, many of them weak enough and impracticable, but all springing from a profound sense of social wrongs and inequalities, and an intense desire to raise up the lowest classes. The idea of the ""Association of Labor"" has entered into the laboring mind of Europe, and has brought forth marvelous fruit already in the industrial classes. The wonderful prosperity of continental Europe, the last few years, has descended also to the working-people, and many social evils among them have been corrected. In England, however, it is doubtful if any considerable effect is produced on the mass of ignorance and poverty accumulated in the large cities, by all the humanity and Christianity of the age.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Social Evils of our Large Cities.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Social Evils of our Large Cities.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/27c17831-f067-5ae2-95f2-2b2d7e30d1f3,1153,nyt://article/27c17831-f067-5ae2-95f2-2b2d7e30d1f3,

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- Mr. MARETZEK's prosperity always begins at the wrong end of the season. A dozen such houses as that which greeted ""Don Giovanni"" on Friday night would be the making of his management, but alas! there are not a dozen nights remaining, and if there were, we are quite sure that the lieges would be found wanting. The charm of MOZART's chief d'oeuvre lays in its imperishable melodies. A half-dozen of these touch the popular heart, and leave an affectionate impress that time cannot remove. Everything else in the work is relative in its merit. The instrumentation is remarkable for the period, dealing generously with the instruments that were then in vogue. But for the present generation, accustomed to vehement polyphonic combinations, it is necessarily a little tame. This remark applies, but in a less degree, to the concerted pieces. MOZART, however, is always felicitous when dealing with the voice. Of choruses there are none worth speaking of, except a few shouts for liberty, and a musical instance of mob violence on the subject of an outraged damsel. The libretto need not be discussed.

The Emperor Napoleon's Speech on,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/22/archives/napoleon-and-poland.html,The Emperor Napoleon's Speech on,"More than a third of NAPOLEON'S speech at the opening of the French Chambers, was devoted to the delicate subject of the Russo-Polish difficulty. France, be it known, never makes war for an ""idea,"" save against Powers like Austria or Mexico; when confronted with such an antagonist as Russia, she only arms to vindicate her honor, or repel threatened aggression. Now as neither the honor nor the interests of the Emperor of France is involved in the Polish Question, it is of course no affair of his in particular, but an ecumenical question which concerns Europe at large. Before Europe, however, engages in a war to compel Russia to respect the rights of Poland, his French Majesty thinks that one more proposition ought to be made to the Northern Collossus. GORTSCHAKOFF having somewhere in his dispatches intimated that Russia would offer no objection to a general conference, if it were authorized to set at rest all the questions which agitate Europe, as well as the Polish question, NAPOLEON recommends that this concession should be turned to account if possible, and made the basis of a pacific arrangement. He is disposed to take GORTSCHAKOFF at his word, and offer to submit to the arbitrament of a European Congress all the other questions that trouble Christendom, if the Czar will only consent to submit the settlement of that which relates to Poland to the same tribunal. If ALEXANDER accedes to this proposition, the peace of Europe may, in the opinion of NAPOLEON, be preserved; but should the Czar refuse to accept the ultimatum, then, according to the Emperor, the sole alternative of Europe will be silence or war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Napoleon and Poland.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Napoleon and Poland.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Poland', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5ce75ed-f061-5cc4-99bd-04a90234683e,937,nyt://article/a5ce75ed-f061-5cc4-99bd-04a90234683e,

"My Farm of Edgewood; Thoreau, Henry D.; Excursions",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/23/archives/new-books-my-farm-of-edgewood-a-country-book-by-the-author-of.html,"My Farm of Edgewood; Thoreau, Henry D.; Excursions","There is little risk in predicting for Ik Marvel's latest work a popularity exceeding even the fervor of reception which he has heretofore met with from the public. Not all men are sentimental, and even of those so tinged, the impression rarely dominates the entire life, but is confined to the human spring, the season of buds and flowers that knows no second youth. There generally comes a time when the Reveries of a Bachelor are exchanged for the realities of the married man, when the visions of Dream Life fade into the light of common day, and when the ornamental Lorgnette is replaced by the more serviceable spectacles; but the taste for a country life pervades most classes and ages of mankind, especially those who do not lead it. As thousands read Walton's Angler, who never touched a rod and line, so My Farm at Edgewood will be studied by thousands ignorant of the smell of guano, and, like the author's city visitor, (page 258,) unable to distinguish between a Devon and a short-horned cow, or a Muscovy duck and a Bremen goose. Every one keeps a corner in his heart for the sentiment of the country and country life. Men who live and all but die in offices where, like Kit's blackbird in the Old Curiosity Shop, they can actually see a piece of sky, if they ""look up and twist their heads round a little,"" solace themselves with the idea of a possible future, a brief day of grace ere the final balancing of the great books, when the mind shall be gently attuned to harmony with the sights and sounds of nature, and shake off some of the clinging rust of the fetters of daily City life. To all these innumerable farmers in idea, My Farm at Edgewood, will be a treasure, and to the smaller number who have achieved a realized ideal it will be equally valuable. We have here indeed in it, a prose Georgic, a work that avoids no portion of the sober truths of the subject, but, while grappling with them, invests them with the hues of a brilliant fancy and the associations of a cultivated mind. Mr. Marvel (as it pleases him to be called) is a man whom the pleasures of foreign travel and the dignity of official rank in the Queen City of the Adriatic were unable to wean from a longing for an old-fashioned New-England home, and his book is a record of the steps he took to procure such an abiding-place, and the measures of improvement he adopted when it was once secured. Under four heads: ""The Search and the Finding;"" ""Taking Beins in Hand;"" ""Crops and Profits;"" ""Hindrances and Helps"" -- the reader is made acquainted with the result of the author's plunge into the ocean of Farm Life, shares his sober joy as the fair creation of his hands widens to his view; inspects his private balance-sheet of profits and losses, and by many a sparkling sentence and speaking trait, observed and noted with the pen of a master in the art of writing, has a foretaste of the rocks ahead, in the shape of imperfect help, unsympathizing neighbors, and the vis inertia of a dead and senseless routine that scorns improvement as visionary, and looks with distrust on attempts at progress, as akin to ruin. In spite of all drawbacks, the author's decision is largely in favor of the mode of life he has adopted, and the great question ""will it pay?"" is answered in a manner to satisfy the sober and moderate capitalist, who does not look for his only return in the shape of bank interest, but is willing to allow a market value for healthful occupation, sound slumbers, untainted air, and wholesome food. To give a more detailed account of a book in the hands of every one is superfluous. The writer is justly reputed perhaps the meet careful and finished of our literateurs, and My Farm will certainly not detract from his reputation. If we were to ""hint a fault,"" it would be a slight complaint at the excess of foreign allusion. There is something too much of the ""picked man of countries"" who cannot enjoy or praise a native scene without making it a peg to hang a reference on, to something like or unlike abroad. This, however, is mere matter of personal impression, and is probably pleasing to many. The getting up the book shows a fine eye for the esthetics of publishing, and is in keeping with the attractiveness of its contents.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; MY FARM OF EDGEWOOD.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/24/archives/british-barbarity.html,,"Events every now and then occur in almost all countries, which reveal the very superficial nature of modern civilization and humanity. The wild animal in human society which has been so long domesticated that we had almost forgotten its existence, suddenly shows its claws and fangs. The barbaric blood which ethnologists tell us still betrays itself in the most refined stocks, unexpectedly reveals itself to the world in some terrible acts of ferocity and cruelty. In many of these instances we are not surprised. When the New-York mob hangs innocent boys and men and burns asylums, we see that such are the natural fruits of long ages of oppression, destitution and ignorance in the Old World, which we, in the New, must reap. When the Southern officers deliberately insult and starve our unfortunate prisoners, we see that this is the legitimate result of Slavery, and that nothing else ought to be expected. Even the blowing of Hindoo rebels from British cannon, though it shocks, does not so much astound us, because we remember the atrocities which had roused up the baser passions of the English soldiery. But there are actions at times which seem to thrill the pulse of all mankind with horror, and which call forth an instinctive cry of condemnation from every civilized people. Especially is this the case where the connivers and perpetrators have been holding themselves up as the especial guardians of civilization, and have been preaching for a long period with holy indignation against trivial offences, committed by their neighbors.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'British Barbarity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'British Barbarity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/180d2e9e-7a42-5148-80ff-d1e2d35b3561,920,nyt://article/180d2e9e-7a42-5148-80ff-d1e2d35b3561,

STETLER, of Philadelphia, by Court-martial, to five years' imprisonment in the penitentiary for supplying the army with adulterated coffee is the first instance, we believe, of any account, of the practical enforcement of the law which passed Congress last year, making such frauds on the army penal, and triable by Court-martial. Though the good work has commenced late, we trust that it will now be followed up with the sternest rigor. The amount of iniquity of this nature which has been practiced upon our soldiers is beyond calculation. In the early part of the war it was the most rampant evil affecting the service, and though it has been largely reduced since, it still prevails to a scandalous extent. So long as the system of opening contracts to general competition is maintained -- and it is the only correct system -- dishonest men will often get contracts, and no plan of inspection, however well devised, can of itself always insure against fraudulent supplies. The amount to be inspected is too vast to admit of minute examination; and moreover, even were this otherwise, the urgency of the demand is often too great to allow time for it. No management for detection can alone remedy the evil; there must also be management for prevention. The severe penal act passed by Congress was just what was needed. It enabled the army to protect itself by subjecting every contractor without exception to military law. We have thought it strange that this power has not been more frequently exercised.

Plaintiffs allege that in the year 1860 Commodore VANDERBILT entered upon the waters of New-Yok harbor, at a point south of Pier No. 1, and outside of the line recommended by the Commissioners, and built or put there an obstruction in the nature of a pier filled in with stone, the same being unauthorized by law and wholly without the exterior line. Plaintiffs notified defendant to remove said obstruction within five days, and such notification not being complied with, they bring this action to recover the penalty of $25 a day for each and every day from the 10th day of November, 1860, up to the day of trial. The defendant claims at the time of the Battery extension there was a small pier south of Pier No. 1, and inside of said Battery extension; that by a resolution of both branches of the Common Council defendant was authorized to build and extend said small pier parallel to Pier No. 1 as far as the exterior line of the proposed Battery extension; that by order of said resolution defendant sunk a crib filled with stone within the exterior line of the Battery extension; that before said pier was finished defendant was restrained by an injunction afterward made perpetual from proceeding with said structure, that all that he did was done under the authority of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of New-York, and defendant is not liable for the penalty; defendant further alleges that said obstruction was not outside the extreme line of the harbor fixed by law; that he had no recollection of receiving any such notice as that required by law. The amount of the penalties sought to be recovered, is over $27,000. A motion to dismiss the complaint was made on the ground of the insufficiency of the notice given to Mr. Vanderbilt, it being claimed that the notice had not been shown to be the act of the Board of Commissioners of Pilots, but only one of its members.

The piece will be remembered by their patrons. It has been played frequently, and always to the acceptance of the public. On the present occasion it gained new interest from the very generous way in which it has been placed upon the stage by Mr. WHEATLEY. The scenery and costumes are both excellent.

"A new and successful plan for highway robbery was initiated during the late political campaign by the thieves and murderers of the City. Quite a number of cases occurred wherein it was not only successful in the matter of robbery, but where the victims were very badly injured. The villains emboldened by their successes during riot week in attacking and robbing everybody whom they met, from whom they thought spoils could be secured, adopted the following ingenious plan. Five, six, sometimes more of them, would assemble in a body on the occasion of political parades, fall into the ranks and march along as part and parcel of the party; watching their chance for a victim, one of them would rush from the ranks and strike him as though he had offered an insult to the procession, and on the instant the others would spring to the assault; the man would be knocked down, beaten and robbed of all valuables about him in a moment, and the whole affair be considered as a ""political row."" Thus did these murderous scoundrels make the different parties the cloak for their villanies. They operated the same way at the different political meetings outside of Cooper Institute. It was a shrewd plan, and until recently was not developed to the Police authorities; so soon as known prompt measures were adopted to prevent it. ""Political fights"" are now considered synonymous with ""highway robbery"" -- those engaged in them highwaymen. Processions hereafter, will be so attended that this class of villains using them as a cloak will be promptly arrested. It would be well if the different parties would make a note of these facts, and on any occasion of a disturbance on the route of their marches, or at their meetings attribute it to the class of thieves mentioned, and promptly aid in their arrest. On one occasion, during the late canvass, a gentleman was knocked down and robbed on Broadway, badly beaten also, and yet despite his assertion of robbery, those who were really participants in the procession, and who crowded to the scene, were particularly excited against him because of the blatant assertion of the thieves that he had insulted the procession as it passed.

BOTTS is not a confessor after the style of Parson BROWNLOW or ANDREW JOHNSON, who hurls defiance at the rebels from the soil which they claim. Nor does he desire to become a refugee from his native State, and operate actively against the rebellion, as so many noble southerners have done. But while residing upon a debateable ground which is alternately within the lines of one and the other army, and which is continually haunted by guerrillas, he does not fail to maintain a certain kind of indifference, and does not scruple to lay bare with a skillfully handled knife, some of the foul and fetid sores of the Southern Confederacy. He undoubtedly occupies ground, morally as well as physically, which is eminently precarious to his own person. It is very likely that the rebel authorities may make some of the charges he mentions in his letter, a pretext for seizing him and depriving him of his liberties, as they have done before. It is well that Mr. BOTTS does not succumb before the rebellion; but it would be better if his Unionism, if such it may be called, were of a more positive type, and that then his farm, or at least himself, were safe within the Union lines.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LETTER OF JOHN M.

BURNSIDE, had been quickly wheeled round and down to Chattanooga, at the order of Gen. GRANT. HOOKER, too, will, doubtless, have a hand in the affair. We hardly suppose that the rebel column of LONGSTREET, which has been fighting BURNSIDE up at Knoxville, has had time to join itself to the army of BRAGG, though it was reported a day or two ago that it had withdrawn from Gen. BURNSIDE's front.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Battle in Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Battle in Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b998e9c-16bf-56a7-a695-f4d26c0cbb12,265,nyt://article/4b998e9c-16bf-56a7-a695-f4d26c0cbb12,

WILLICH's, attacked the enemy and drove him from his rifle-pits, capturing 200 prisoners, and occupying Orchard Ridge, the only high ground between our position and that of the enemy. The whole movement was completely in view from the lines of both armies.

It appears that previous to the battle reported this morning, BRAGG had been falling back from the line he till lately held in the immediate front of Chattanooga, and had begun a retrograde movement back of Chickamauga Station. There is nothing, however, to show whether this action was in consequence of an offensive demonstration on the part of Gen. GRANT, or whether it was voluntary on the part of BRAGG, and in execution of a previously formed design. A reconnoissance on the 23d revealed the rebels as occupying the position at Missionary Ridge and the intervening heights. Thereupon Gen. THOMAS pushed forward a part of Gen. GORDON GRANGER's corps, consisting of the divisions of WOOD and SHERIDAN; two important knolls, half way between our line and Missionary Ridge, were carried by a brilliant charge, and the whole position up to the foot of that ridge was gained.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- To-night GOUNOD's ""Faust"" will be produced for the first time in New-York. It is a grand romantic opera, involving in its interpretation all the resources of the Academy. Mr. MARETZEK has spared no expense, and has been prodigal of labor in the bringing out of this very important work. GOUNOD is a French composer, who, in ""Faust"" at least, has won a success which Europe has not been slow to indorse. Since the days of MEYERSEER's ""Robert le Diable,"" there has been no opera that combines inspiration and learning in so remarkable a manner. ""Faust"" has created a popular and artistic sensation in all the cities where it has been played. If it fails to do so here it will not be the fault of Mr. MARETZEK, who has been liberal in all that can contribute to the success of the mise en scene and music. There is, however, no ground for apprehension. The composition is beautiful, and to-night will witness one of the memorable successes of the age.

Robinson, Silas Seymour and Alvin C. Morton vs. Edward P. Flint, James P. Flint, George H. Kellogg, William G. Gliddon, John A. Gliddon and J.M.S. Williams. -- This is a case of some interest from the large amount involved, the allegations of fraud against well-known merchants, and the eminence of counsel engaged on each side. The plaintiff, comprising the firm of Robinson Seymour & Co., in the year 1854 entered into an agreement with the Sacramento Valley Railroad Company, whereby they agreed, for the sum of $1,800,000, to construct and equip the entire road of said Campany, and also agreed to assume a contract previously made by the Railroad Company with the Boston agents of Thompson & Forman, of London, for 2,000 tons of railroad iron of T. & F.'s manufacture, or some other manufacturers of equal celebrity. The defendants, comprising the firms of Fluict, Peabody & Co., and Gleddon & Williams, had guaranteed the full performance on the part of the Railroad Company of all the stipulations in the above contract with the agents of Thompson & Forman to as full an extent as if said defendants had been the sole purchaser of the iron, and the defendants also agreed with the Railroad Company to receive the iron at Boston and ship it to San Francisco, and they did receive the whole of the 2,000 tons, of which they shipped to San Francisco 491 tons. The plaintiffs having assumed this contract, one of them visited Boston to ascertain the market price of such railroad iron, and whether the defendants were in a condition to carry out the above contract, so that plaintiffs would be bound by their contract with the Railroad Company to take that particular iron, although the contract price and charges greatly exceeded the then market value of such iron in Boston by a difference, as plaintiffs ascertained, of $32 per ton. Plaintiffs then applied to the defendants and stated that they were ready to carry out the original contract made by the Railroad Company, provided the iron originally purchased was still on hand in Boston, and not otherwise. Thereupon, as plaintiffs allege, the defendants, with intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiffs, and to induce them to enter into the contract for the iron at a price greatly exceeding its market value, falsely represented and stated to the plaintiffs that the identical iron originally imported was then on hand in Boston piled up in warehouses where it had been kept on storage from the time of its importation under the original contract of purchase. Whereas, as the plaintiffs allege, the whole 2,000 tons, except the 491 tons shipped to San Francisco, had been sold to other parties and no part of the same was then on hand in Boston, and plaintiffs claim that they were thus created and defrauded and induced to enter into a contract to pay for this iron, and did pay for it a much larger sum than it was worth, and much larger than they would have paid had they known the truth in relation to the iron. That when this iron was delivered in San Francisco, it proved not to be the iron originally imported, nor was it manufactured by Thompson & Forman, but was iron of a poor quality of many different patterns, and not worth exceeding $35 per ton. That by reason of the poor quality mentioned, and especially by reason of its not being the original iron contracted or in the first instance by the Railroad Company, the Company refused to pay plaintiffs the contract price agreed upon for building the road, but deducted therefrom $50,000, and plaintiffs claim that, by reason of the above facts, they have been damaged, and have lost the sum of $171,000, for which sum, with interest, they seek to recover.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Supreme Court Trial Term.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LAW REPORTS.; Supreme Court Trial Term.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'Before Justice Allen', 'person': [{'firstname': 'Before', 'middlename': 'Justice', 'lastname': 'Allen', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2ffd8e5d-ef5e-5c0a-98c0-5f77b720fd01,680,nyt://article/2ffd8e5d-ef5e-5c0a-98c0-5f77b720fd01,

F.; Levana","The increasing popularity of JEAN PAUL's works is evidenced by the handsome editions now issuing, in rapid succession, from the house of TICKNOR & FIELDS. The present volume is the fifth of the series. In the absence of any indication of the translator's name, we presume it is a reprint of an English version, issued anonymously in London in 1848, and which has now become scarce. While struggling with the difficulties that beset his earlier career, it is well known that RICHTER was for a time engaged in the education of youth, both as private tutor and as a school teacher, at Schwarzenbach. At a later and happier period, when he had become a husband and father, and had tested his knowledge, by the holier discipline of parental joys and sorrows, he developed the principles of education which had guided him, in the present work. Named from Levana, ""the motherly goddess, who was formerly entreated to give a father's heart to fathers,"" it is consecrated to the inculcation of the great truths of ""Home Education,"" the training of the mother, the family and the household, in opposition to the pedagogic theories of system-mongers. Intensely German in its conception, and professedly fragmentary in its treatment, it is scarcely fitted for continuous perusal; but it is a book that cannot be opened without disclosing words to ponder on -- passages of the highest beauty, pregnant with deep and intense feeling, and profound knowledge of human nature. ""A mother's heart -- the sun that gently warms and dries the dew-drops of early tears,"" on the opening page, is the first sentence our eyes light on, and how beautiful it is. To English readers German humor is generally a sealed book in an unknown tongue, and JEAN PAUL seems never so much beneath himself as in his comic vein, but some trifling incongruities of this kind should never deter the reader from an intimacy with the sterling excellences of a book almost unique in its scope and character.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LEVANA; OR THE DOCTRINE OF EDUCATION.; Translated from the German of JEAN PAUL FREDERICH RICHTER, Author of ""Titan,"" &c. 12mo.

In this line Mr. TAYLOR has developed a new talent that will surprise the readers of his travels. There is a life and individuality about his portraits and a careful minuteness of delineation that stamp them at once as realities, and Seth Wattles, Rev. Mr. Waldo and their associates, are at once admitted as friends for life -- people whom we surely must have known somewhere. Spiritualism, philanthropy woman's rights, and the other hobbies of the day, all play a part in the development of character and incident. We have too much consideration for novel readers to abridge the story of the book and leave them the pleasure of tracing how the heroine softens down from the ultra-social reformer into the happy wife and mother. It is very rare for an established author to break new ground with such assured success as Mr. TAYLOR has done, and we predict a series of novels from his pen outnumbering the formidable array of his Travels.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HANNAH THURSTON.

New-York Central; Mr. Corning's Position,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/26/archives/newyork-central-railroad.html,New-York Central; Mr. Corning's Position,"Mr. CORNING by no means restricts the use of his position to supplying his road with the materials used in its management and repairs. Every occasion is alike prostituted to fill his already over-gorged purse. We will give an example from a score we have at hand. At the time of the consolidation, the owners of the Schenectady and Troy Railway were eager, of course, like good Hindoos, to be absorbed in the great totality, and to exchange their gross dross for fine gold. The road had proved itself to be the veritable elephant. For eleven weary years it had netted a heavy loss -- the cost of running far exceeding earnings. Not a cent was ever realized or expected on its capital. Its cost was about $700,000, but was purchased of certain parties, with a view of including it in the consolidation, for about $150,000. Mr. CORNING was not a party to this purchase, but undertook, for one-sixth part of the profits that might be realized, to engineer the poor outcast into the safe haven of consolidation, He got it reported by the Committee, but when the subject came up before the convention of the respective companies, the imposition was so palpable, that it was, upon the motion of Mr. H.B. GIBSON, of Canandaigua, stricken off the list of roads to be included. Mr. CORNING, nothing daunted, succeeded, in the absence of Mr. GIBSON, in getting the matter of this road recommitted, and at an adjourned meeting at Albany succeeded, by the use of tactics, of which he is a consummate master, in getting a favorable report, which brought the Troy road into the concern at a higher price than had been previously named, and higher than its actual cost. The price paid was $650,000 in Central stock, of which Mr. CORNING received $100,000 worth at the time, about $120 per share. The profits of the transaction that went into his pocket were fully $75,000. The Central Company at the same time assumed the payment of bonds to the amount of $100,000, loaned by the City of Troy to the Troy Road. This transaction, consequently, engineered by Mr. CORNING, and without whose aid it could not have been accomplished, cost the Company $750,000, and was just so much taken out of the pockets of the stockholders for the benefit of Mr. CORNING and his associates.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New-York Central Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New-York Central Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/caf820f1-9ca4-5128-bb46-1da9afa1965d,658,nyt://article/caf820f1-9ca4-5128-bb46-1da9afa1965d,

Were fancy portraits, in THOMAS HOOD's style, now in fashion, our author would be fittingly represented by a sort of cross between Methuselah and the Calculating boy, so unfailing is his individual recollection of all that has happened on our Island, so intimate his knowledge of dates, figures, and even the street number of the houses occupied by his heroes. Though some may think a work of this nature merely panders to a diseased appetite for personal gossip, we are inclined to take a broader view of its claims to notice. The circumstances under which New-York has, within our own lifetime, risen from a petty provincial town to its present status of the largest commercial port in the world, and the third in population among cities of Christian civilization, are entirely exceptional, and have no parallel in ancient or modern history. The social and economic changes incident to such a transformation will be of the highest interest to the future philosophic historian, who will be thankful for the contribution to the knowledge of the subject contained in these volumes. In all former commercial countries, Venice, Genoa, Holland, England, the mercantile aristocracy has been enduring and permanent -- hereditary, in fact -- as much so as the lands and titles of the nobleman. The London Directory of 1863 records many names that figured in its first issue, (of which only two copies exist,) for 1677. Among bankers the instances are well known of the flourishing firms of STONE, MARTIN & CO., who represent an uninterrupted succession the house of Sir THOMAS GRAHAM, the princely Elizabethan merchant; Messrs. HOARES, of Fleet-street, with whose predecessor of the same style OLIVER CROMWELL kept his ""running cash"" account, or Messrs. CHILDS & CO., who had for a partner (and probably far from a ""silent"" one) the famous SARAH, Duchess of Marlborough. Other branches of commerce can show as deeply rooted stems, going back for two or three centuries. Unlike these hereditary magnates of the Exchange, the merchants of New-York have been, with scarcely an exception, the founders of their own fortunes, and their princely revenues are the work of their own hands. To these men and their successful enterprise, and not to the noisy politicians, the unexampled growth of the City is due, and it is fitting that they should not pass away without a record like that which our author seems supremely qualified to furnish. What DAVID VALENTINE is among the material antiquities of Manhattan, WALTER BARRETT is in relation to the human interests of the same olden time. The need of such chroniclers is peculiarly felt among us, because, from the shifting nature of its population, there is in New-York almost a total absence of the current tradition that connects the present with past times in smaller and slower moving communities. Mr. BARRETT intimates that his budget is far from being exhausted, and we hope to see many other volumes from his pen, equally bristling with facts and figures as the present.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; THE OLD MERCHANTS OF NEW-YORK CITY.

New-York Central; Mr. Corning's Grasping Hand,https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/27/archives/mr-corning-and-the-newyork-central-railroad.html,New-York Central; Mr. Corning's Grasping Hand,"Into whatever department of the Central we look, we always find the grasping hand of Mr. CORNING ever busy in promoting his own advantage. Everything has to bend to his insatiable avarice. He is the pivotal point around which the road, with all its ramifications, revolves. He will not brook the least restraint upon his will or his schemes. A notable instance of this occurred some years ago. For some time after the consolidation, the utmost looseness prevailed in the manner in which supplies for the road were furnished. Each official ordered whatever he pleased, and his order was deemed sufficient evidence, without any other proof, that the articles were needed for, and were used on the road. The accounts then received the initials of Mr. VIBBARD or Mr. CORNING, and were handed over by bushels to the committee on accounts to be passed by them. The committee saw the impropriety and wrong of all this, but what could they do? It happened, luckily, that Mr. CORNING made a visit to Europe, and during his absence they had sufficient influence with the Board to get a system adopted that effectually protected the Company. Every person using or disbursing supplies was required to return regular and frequent statements of the amount of materials or supplies on hand, and the amount required in his Department, so that it could be seen at a glance whether his requisition was a proper one, and whether the articles furnished had been judiciously expended. A purchasing agent was also appointed. All these reforms stared Mr. CORNING in the face when he came home. He was excessively angry, complained to the Committee that he had been grossly insulted by their interference, and set himself about to neutralize, as far as possible, their action. How far the checks that were adopted to prevent fraud or wastefulness in the ordering or use of supplies, have been abrogated, we cannot tell; but the purchasing agency was other discontinued, or it is now little, if anything, more than a go-between between Mr. CORNING and the Company. The Committee did their best to vindicate their conduct in the matter, but nothing could appease Mr. CORNING's wounded pride or his resentment at the interference with his prerogatives, and it was not long before some of the Committee, most resolute for reform, were left out of the Board.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. Corning and the New-York Central Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mr. Corning and the New-York Central Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Railroads', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/994a0d1e-e942-54cc-a68b-5a391c85578c,1110,nyt://article/994a0d1e-e942-54cc-a68b-5a391c85578c,

He commenced with a reference to the peculiar significance of the present day of thanksgiving, observed as it was by all Americans, wherever resident, in response to the recommendation of the Executive. It was a grand spectacle, an entire nation united in offering up incense on an altar of a religion all alike profess -- thanksgiving and praise to the Supreme Being. Divesting themselves of social, political and religious distinctions, superior to the division of sentiment engendered by sectional ideas and antagonistic theories, they assembled in their respective places of worship, to pour forth praises to Him enthroned on hish. Actuated by these considerations, his audience had gathered together in their house of God, that they too might join in the grand anthem swelling upward to celestial heights. Israelite and Christian grasped each other's hand in cordial confidence, working together, fighting together the battles of the Union, pouring their blood on the battle-field in friendly rivalry for country's sake. There was no trace of religious intolerance or sectional feeling in the proclamation of the day; we were called upon to observe it as Americans, acknowledging special obligations to Heaven for the providences so graciously displayed in the progress of our struggle for national existence, and not unmindful of His divine favor in the daily blessings unintermittingly showered upon us, whose value we often fail to diiscern until we are deprived of them.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sermon by Rev.

GRANT over the chief army of the rebellion, and at the most important military point of the South, the crossing of the Rapidan by the Army of the Potomac, under Gen. MEADE, and the imminency of a general battle with the other great army of the rebellion -- these are the events of the week, and they are events which, even in their present development, are not surpassed in magnitude by those of any week of the war. The one campaign, that of Gen. GRANT, is well on toward consummation; and the other, that of Gen.

Even the West, which has been wont to strain credit to the utmost, is now buying and selling for cash to an unprecedented degree. The long credits to the South which once rendered large branches of mercantile affairs so uncertain, are, of course, entirely at an end.

LITTLE & BROWN's announcements of new books is one that promises to reflect credit on their enterprise and on' the Boston Press. we refer to a new collection of Old English Plays, in ten volumes, to be edited by Prof. J. RUSSELL LOWELL. Every one interested in early English literature is acquainted with the collection that takes its name from DODSLEY, the publisher, and of which the last edition by COLLIER is now a scarce and covetable book. But little critical taste went to the selection in the first instance, and now the republication of the entire works of many authors sampled in it has much abridged its value. It will be an easy matter for Prof. LOWELL to excel his only predecessor and bring together a collection from the scarcer and hitherto inaccessible Elizabethan Dramatists that will delight every reader of taste, and be received with acclamation both here and in England. It is remarkable that the study of old English literature seems to follow the poet's ""path of empire,"" and finds its greatest encouragement in the West; certain it is that the mother country has at present no critics engaged in the study that can compare in loving familiarity with the elder worthles of our tongue, and delicate tact for discriminating their beauties, with Prof. J.R. LOWELL, Prof. CHILDS and GEO. P. MARSH. The works of the latter are well characterised by The Reader as the most valuable of recent contributions to the study: ""Mr. MARSH has made the study of our older literature, at first hand, a labor of love, and has brought a strong power of independent thought to bear upon it.

Nearly all the things which we need are now manufactured in the South, and the quantities supplied both to the Government and to the people, are already sufficient to lower the price of goods procured through the blockade. In another year the South may laugh at the blockade. In the beginning of the war we depended on Europe for every shoe, for every pound of powder -- almost for every new gun. The demand of the people for the ordinary articles of civilized life was equally imperious. Had the blockade been as close in the first two years of the war as now, we might have had a much worse time of it than is commonly supposed. Under the demand, manufactories sprang into existence in the South. But, although established with unexampled rapidity, they could not meet all our wants in a year; they are even yet insufficient; but they will very shortly be complete, and then we may cease to be troubled about intercepted letters or cargoes, and can carry on a war of defence indefinitely, as well without as with, the recognition of the European Powers.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE INTERCEPTED CORRESPONDENCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE INTERCEPTED CORRESPONDENCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1863-11-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Richmond Examiner', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3dc69576-d10b-5040-9809-c4d479d38637,279,nyt://article/3dc69576-d10b-5040-9809-c4d479d38637,

If a false and unfair system of interpretation has been applied to the text of Scripture, the best way of confuting it is to apply a true and legitimate one. The honor of originating the plan is due to the Speaker of the House of Commons, who consulted several of the Bishops on the subject, and the Archbishop of York, at his instance, undertook to organize a plan for producing a commentary which should ""put the reader in full possession of whatever information may be requisite to enable him to understand the Word of God, and supply him with satisfactory answers to objections resting upon misrepresentation of its contents."" The plan has received the sanction of the Primate. A committee, consisting of the Archbishop of York, the Bishops of London, Lichfield, Llandaff, Gloucester and Bristol, Lord Lyttleton, the Speaker, Mr. Walpole, Drs. Jacobson, and Jeremie, takes the general supervision of the work. Rev. F.C. Cook, preacher at Lincoln's Inn, will be the general editor, and will advise with the Archbishop of York and the Regius Professors of Divinity at Oxford and Cambridge upon any questions which may arise. The work will be divided into eight sections, the first of which will consist of the Pentateuch, a difficult subject, and will be edited by Prof. Harold Browne, Revs. R.C. Pascoe, T.F. Thrupp, T.E. Espin, and W. Dewhurst, contributing. The historical books will be consigned to Rev. G. Rawlinson, editor, and Revs. T.E. Espin and Lond Arthur Hervey, contributors. Rev. F.C. Cook will edit, and Revs. E.H. Plumptre, W.T. Bullock and T. Kingsbury will annotate, the poetical books. The four Great Prophets will be undertaken by Dr. MCCaul as editor, and by Revs. R. Payne Smith and H. Rose as contributors. The Bishop of St. David's and the Rev. R. Gandell will edit the twelve Minor Prophets, and the Revs. E. Huxtable, W. Drake, and F. Meyrick will contribute. The Gospels and Acts will form the sixth section; the first three Gospels will be edited by Prof. Mansel, the Gospel of St. John by the Dean of Canterbury, and the Acts by Dr. Jacobson. The editorship of St. Paul's Epistles is appropriately assigned to Bishop Ellicott and Dr. Jeremie, with Dr. Gifford, Prof. T. Evans, Rev. J. Waite, and Prof. J. Lightfoot as contributors. To the Archbishop-elect of Dublin and the Master of Balliol is assigned the rest of the sacred canon. This really promises to be a work second only in importance to the LXX, or the English version made by the older of King JAMES. Perhaps it will be quoted as ""the XXX.""

The statement that Russia has assented must therefore be regarded as quite premature, if not entirely devoid of foundation.

The Sixty-ninth now numbers about seventy men. Under the recent orders of the War Department, they will be allowed a furlough of forty days between the expiration of their present term and the time of their reenlisting. On reenlisting, they will be entitled to the Government bounties, and Capt. MCGEE has procured from Mr. BLUNT a promise that they shall also receive the $300 bounty offered by the Board of Supervisors. Capt.

Mozart and Tammany had so long ruled the City that it was almost taken for granted that it was simply labor lost to right them. Our people had been so long used to their arbitrary power, that they had acquired very much the same sort of submissive spirit that keeps a European community quiet, even under a most unwelcome yoke. The outrageous abuse of that power by the attempt to make such a men as MCCUNN a high Judge over our liberty and property, stung us into a spasm of resistance, like some European emeute -- rather the effect of despair than the prompting of hope. And yet, this wild, striking act of the day came very near laying the tyranny in the dust. It is now seen that the merest additional trifle of wise, discriminating effort would have done the business for MCCUNN, and that it would have cost not much more to have served out the other special favorites.

"This District, embracing the Eighteenth and Twenty-first Wards, has a large Democratic majority, and the chances are that the Democracy will carry it for all their candidates, unless a concentration be made in it of the votes of those who seek a new and better order of things.

BARRETT, of the firm of BARRETT, BRINSMADE & BARRETT, well known lawyers in Wall-street, has been placed in nomination by several of the Anti-Machine Democratic organizations, and also by the Independent Tax-payers' Association.

Mr. BOIES, the Union nominee, is little known at the Bar, and there are indications that he will not be supported by the bulk of his party. Mr. T.J.

Mrs. MCEVOY, whose Christian name is MARY, fell to the floor as soon as the shots were fired, and her husband, believing that he had killed her, started forthwith for the Tombs Police Court. When he entered the latter place he very excitedly exclaimed: ""Capt. DOWLING;"" meaning the Judge, ""I am your prisoner, I have murdered my wife, and I wish to be committed to the Tombs.""

It is this unique fact which forms the most striking characteristic in a success so magnificent in all the features of its planning and execution. Indeed, in the estimate of the great weight of debt under which Gen. GRANT has laid the nation by this victory, it is not easy to say whether we should set most by the material gain to the Union arms of this great blow inflicted on the enemy, or by the moral gain to the whole country of this inspiring example of unwonted military vigor and power. At a stroke, Gen. GRANT has brushed away the cobwebs of military pedantry, (dignified by the name of prudence,) which would make us believe that the pursuit of a defeated foe has become an impossibility; and in a country which accumulates in itself every condition unfavorable to pursuit (thus making it the more glorious) has ground to powder and scattered to the winds a great army of the rebellion, a week ago intrenched in a position so formidable by nature and art as to seem absolutely unassailable.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Union Victory in Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Union Victory in Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1863-11-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8197266-10ff-502b-b316-fb2d83f0f0c5,1198,nyt://article/c8197266-10ff-502b-b316-fb2d83f0f0c5,
