We desire indeed to see industry more diversified than formerly, manufactures larger, commerce greater, and a broader basis for business of all kinds.

The fast is inaugurated with reciting the lamentations of Jeremiah, and, after the morning service, several hours are employed in the synagogues in chanting in plaintive tones the compositions of the saints of antiquity, and imploring the God of Israel to remove the rod of chastisement from Israel, and again to relume the light of other days, by the reestablishment of their Temple and restoration of their government to its original splendor.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'JEWS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/163bb56b-fe28-52e1-b19e-d770c6e95738,584,nyt://article/163bb56b-fe28-52e1-b19e-d770c6e95738,

Lord DUNCAN, in the course of his canvass, called, and not for the first time, at the house of a gentleman named BALL, who now occupies a large farm near Leamington, but who was formerly engaged in the naval service. The noble visitor was on terms of intimacy with Mr. BALL, though differing from him in politics, and being both tired and hungry he said, on seeing the remains of a round of beef on the table -- the quantity enough for one and a half or two men -- ""That's a nice piece of beef you've got, BALL."" ""Well, I don't think it is,"" was the response; ""but I'll tell you what I'll do; if you like to sit down and eat it, I'll give you a plumper at the election."" Lord DUNCAN sat down and tackled to his work, and when he had got three parts through with it, he said he should die if he ate any more. ""Ah!"" said the elector, ""I've been too far north for you."" ""I hail from Dundee,"" said his guest. ""Oh, but I have been to the North Pole,"" said the free and independent voter; ""and if you don't finish the piece of beef I shall vote for MORDAUNT and WISE, the Conservative candidates; but if you eat it I'll plump for you, and I'll appear in front of the hustings on the day of nomination with the piece of bone in my hand."" Lord DUNCAN thereupon called for some Scotch whisky, and then disposed of the remainder of the beef.

"So many partial and incorrect statements have been made respecting the distribution of the rewards offered for the capture of BOOTH and his associates, that it becomes proper to say that no money has yet been paid to any one, either by the general or city authorities. The Secretary of War being unable to give the matter his personal attention, designated Judge HOLT, Adjt-Gen. TOWNSEND and Assistant Secretary ECKERT as a board to hear and decide the claims of the multitude of persons who demand a share of the government reward.

"A SOLDIER GARROTED AND ROBBED. -- About 1 o'clock yesterday morning two young men, named MARTIN HARNEY and JOHN FINETY, were arrested by Officer O'DONNELL, in Hudson-street, Jersey City, charged with having forcibly robbed JOHN DOWLEY, who belonged to Company D, Seventeenth New-York Volunteers, who was paid off and discharged at Hart's Island a week since. The circumstances are as follows: About 11 o'clock on Sunday Light DOWLEY went to Myers' Hotel, in Exchange-place, and paid for lodgings over night. The accused parties, as is alleged, got into conversation with him, and induced him to drink. The parties spent a couple of hours in a sociable manner, and during that time one of them a utioned DOWLEY to be very careful about exhibiting his greenbacks, as there were a great many thieves about. DOWLEY assured them that he would look out for himself. Finally one of them invited him to accompany them to the house of a friend to take a good drink, which he at first declined, saying that they could as well drink where they were; but after urgent solicitation he consented to accompany them. The party conducted him around the end of the depot, across the railroad, and were proceeding some further in the dark and unfrequented loyalty, when DOWLEW refused to go any further, and proposed to go back and get a drink. At this time two confederates came up and he was seized by the party, one of whose, special duty was to choke him as hard as possible, while the others were going through his pockets. DOWLEY cried out ""for God's sake don't kill me; give me $5 and you can have all the rest, and I'll say nothing about it."" By this time the ruffians had succeeded in getting his wallet containing $65 from his pocket, and a moment after the officer came up and succeeded in arresting two of the party, who were committed for examination. The wallet was found on the spot yesterday morning, but the money was not recovered. DOWLEY's face and neck shows the marks of rough usage, being scratched and cut with finger nails.

Americans in Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/02/archives/americans-in-europe.html,Americans in Europe,"It is estimated that there are about one hundred thousand Americans in Europe at this time. Probably, there will have been altogether not less than two hundred thousand there in the course of this Summer. Paris is, of course, their chief place of resort, but they penetrate into every country of Europe, from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean. Their object is not to engage in business, work or speculation; but simply to enjoy the pleasures and advantages of travel, and to spend their money. They and their money are, of course, greatly admired by the hotel-keepers, shopkeepers, dressmakers, tailors, jewelers, lazzaroni, cicerones, gamblers, grisettes, and so forth; and those of them liable to temptation are greatly courted by these people. But there are among them many men and women of the best American type, who will honor this country abroad by their bearing and character. There is nothing in this country now for which they need to apologize, but everything to make them proud of it. Its universal freedom, its universal order, its universal prosperity, the exploits of its citizens in war, the spectacle of the disbandment of its mighty armies, its conduct during the Presidential election, its conduct at the time of the assassination, its clemency toward those who were its enemies, its magnanimity toward the revolted States politically -- all these things give the United States an exceptional position among the nations of the world.

The houses, with the lots, will be of brick, built somewhat after the Philadelphia style, with two stories and basement, with gas and water, and will cost, with the lots, about twenty-five hundred dollars each. It is intended to sell these houses at cost to worthy applicants, or to rent them at simple interest on the outlay. The company considersits present efforts merely preliminary. If its plans succeed, its capital will be increased and others will be invited to join the association,or other new associations will be formed. It is believed that the present experiment will be well tested by early Autumn. One of the associates of the company is present abroad and will probably bring back with him the working drawings of the houses which have been erected in London, Paris, and the other cities, for the accommodation of the working classes.

Bishop WILMER thinks, as there is no longer any Confederacy, there is not much use in praying any longer for the Confederate authorities. And he thinks that, as the only government they have now in Alabama is a military government, there is no obligation to pray for that, inasmuch as it does not represent the ""civil authority,"" and is, moreover, a very undesirable arrangement in itself. Bishop WILMER, however, reaches a safe conclusion on the question of praying for public officials, and at the same time holds out a premium for the restoration of Alabama to her civil rights when he says, ""when civil authority shall be restored in the State of Alabama the clergy shall use the form entitled, 'A Prayer for the President of the United States.'

"THE PEACH CROP. -- In all parts of the State of New-Jersey the peach, crop promises to be larger this year than has been for many years past. Large orchards, which were set out three years ago in Hunterdon, Morris and other counties, bear for the first time this season, and the fruit is reported to be of the finest quality. During the past three weeks, dealers in Washington Market have traversed the peach-growing section of the State, and have bought the fruit on the trees at a large price, so as not to fail in filling their orders with parties in Albany, Saratoga, Boston and other Northern cities, from which the demand, thus far, is unusually large. As yet there are but very few peaches coming from New-Jersey, the fruit requiring about two weeks more time to ripen, when it will be fit for the market. The favorite peach with the masses is known as the ""Harvest John,"" which is good sized, with heavy red cheek, having a most delightful flavor. For table desert it is considered superior to the ""Malacatoon,"" the latter being very juicy, and generally used for preserving, in connection with what is known in New-Jersey as the ""Morris Whites."" In Somerset County, Mr. STRYKER has an orchard of 8,000 peach trees, which were set out four years ago. This year there is scarcely a tree but is laden with fruit, and a mile around the atmosphere in charged with the perfume of the peach. He will probably realize over $5,000 from the sale of his fruit this year, which will be an ample remuneration for his time and labor. Within the few years past a number of distillers have bought up large quantities of the peach for the purpose of making peach brandy, and have made a snug sum out of the operation. The flavor appears to be pleasing with the masses, and the sales have been ready and the price large. This year the distillers in New-Jersey will do a large business, having taken heavy orders for the brandy. During the past week a train of fifteen or twenty freight cars, laden with Delaware peaches, have arrived in Jersey City for the New-York market. The fruit is unusually large this year, and the sales thus far have been very great. The best fruit is sold for $2,50 and upward per basket; but in a few days it will be down to $1,75, and when the Jersey crop arrives peaches will be within the reach of everybody.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/02/archives/newjersey.html,,"THE PEACH CROP. -- In all parts of the State of New-Jersey the peach, crop promises to be larger this year than has been for many years past.

Until recently, this gentleman has not identified himself at all publicly with the valuable newspaper property he owns. But some two or three years ago he took to the business of having his dull parliamentary performances reported at great length in his own journal. And the unfair character of some of these reports -- or what was alleged to be their unfair character -- led to a personal discussion in the House of Commons, relative to Mr. WALTER's connection with Printing House-square. Little came, directly, of that discussion. But since then the defeated proprietor has affected a consequence and standing which his natural talents indifferently sustain. His specialty has been public education, and all the heavy things he could say on that novel subject have been reproduced in the best columns of the London Times. He has also made no secret of his desire to become a Peer of the realm, so soon as his Parliamentary votes and the Ministerial organship performed by his journal should give him a feasible claim upon Lord PALMERSTON. The electors of Berks have spoiled, for the present, this laudable ambition. Mr. WALTER's connection with the ""leading journal,"" instead of bringing him credit with the yeomanry of England, has, by his unfortunate avowal of it, brought him political discomfiture.

There are, no doubt, many citizens of Philadelphia, who remember seeing this individual daily marching to and fro in front of Independence Hall. After the lapse of several months of tramping in front of that place, during which time he was never known to utter a harsh word, he was grossly insulted by a citizen. He struck the person who thus molested him, and was taken into custody therefor, and bound over to answer at court. He was acquitted on the ground of insanity, but was sent to temporary quarters in the County Prison, from which place he was removed to the State Lunatic Asylum. He remained in that institution until it was ascertained that his malady was incurable, when it was thought necessary to return him to the prison whence he came. He was then taken to the Blockley Almshouse, where he remained a very peaceable inmate until last Wednesday, when death removed him. It was a very great mistake to suppose that his military walk arose from any warlike proclivity. He was quiet, ""well to do"" farmer in the interior of the State of Pennsylvania, and remarkable for his industry. While following the plough beneath the burning rays of the sun, he fell a victim, and like to have died from congestion of the brain, superinduced by the great heat. He recovered, however, but his mind was partly gone. An angel of peace appeared and advised him to forego all agricultural pursuits, and to proceed to Philadelphia to guard the relics in Independence Hall. It was necessary, however, to assume a sort of martial bearing, and, therefore, the unfortunate man procured a pair of heavy cavalry boots -- a scarce article in those days -- and a pair of buff-colored pantaloons, over the legs of which the boots were drawn. Thus attired, he left the agricultural scenes of the State, and commenced his ""tramp, tramp, tramp,"" up and down in front of Independence Hall. He speedily excited considerable attention, and in a short time became one of the celebrities of the city, as the ""Man with the Military Walk."" He was taciturn; never spoke to anybody unless he was first spoken to. He often conversed with himself, but in such a mumbling manner that he could not be easily understood. He generally carried rations in his pocket, and, therefore, remained on duty all day. He was regular in his visits to the hall until the unfortunate day when he gave a person who insulted him a military kick, which deprived him of his self-imposed mission.

They soon became masters of the situation, and they have been reaping the benefits of our disasters. But now we see a practical proof that we are soon to contest this business, and again our flag will cover our mails and passengers, and a fair portion of the freight. It is true we may expect that it will be somewhat difficult, at first, to turn the tide of travel and business; but, as Americans, we are bound to aid every enterprise which has for its object the advancement of our national strength and dignity.

"A conscientious and through fulfillment of the street-cleaning contract ought to greatly mitigate, but must always come short of eradicating the great, all-pervading evil in our sanitary arrangements. Contractors cannot be held responsible for cleaning gutters which connect simply with miserable surcharged drains, instead of a thoroughly-constructed sewer. In all the upper part of the island on the North River side, which ought to be the very healthiest portion of the city, there is no outlet sewer at all, but innumerable small drains emptying their contents into the river wherever there is a convenient fall, and poisoning the air along the entire shore-line.

"On Monday last a German named LANTZ accidentally fell off the high rocks at Bull's Ferry, N.J., where he lay three days before being discovered, having broken one of his arms and a leg, and receiving such internal injuries that he died on Thursday morning. It appears that he had only been in this country about two months, and could not speak a word of English. On Monday last he made the acquaintance of another German, who induced him to go to Guttenburg to look for employment, stating that he was out of work himself, and that there was an opening for both at the above-named place. They crossed the Forty-second-street ferry and proceeded to Guttenberg, where they visited several lager-beer saloons, and drank quite freely. LANTZ lost his friend, and, wishing to return home, started, as he supposed, in the right direction for the ferry, but it appears went in the opposite direction. The result was that he soon reached Bull's Ferry, where he tried to descend to the river-road. Finding the rocks very steep, he continued along the edge for some distance, until he came to where the rocks are over one hundred feet in height, where he accidentally lost his foothold and fell off, being precipitated about seventy feet below, landing in a small crevice in the rocks, breaking his arm and legs, and receiving internal injuries. In this condition he lay unconscious from Sunday night to Tuesday morning, when he revived, suffering the most intense agonies. He tried to crawl out, but found himself too weak; and, in fact, so badly injured that he could not get off his back. He tried to call, but could not make sufficient noise to attract attention. He lay all day Tuesday with the broiling sun pouring down upon him. Tuesday night and nearly all day Wednesday he remained in the same condition, unable to obtain assistance. On Tuesday evening a Mr. PRINDLE, residing near by, heard a very singular noise, but gave the matter no serious attention. During Tuesday night he awoke and heard the same noise, and finally called his wife's attention to the matter. They, however, fell asleep, but in the morning the same noise was heard. Mr. PRINDLE, fearing some accident had happened to some animal, communicated the fact to two of his neighbors, Mr. THOMPSON and Mr. ROACH, when all three started up the rocks to ascertain the cause. They had, however, got but a short distance when they came to where LANTZ was lying. He was sensible, but very feeble, and stated to them how long he had been there. They immediately took him out and conveyed him to Fort Lee, where the only medical attendance could be procured. Everything was done for the unfortunate man, but he died the following morning.

It must hereafter, as before, be the great regulator of our foreign exchanges, and thereby the great conservator of our financial soundness. Herein it has a certain divine right which we could not alter if we would. Providence has ordained that the belt of North America embraced between the Atlantic and the Rio Grande, covered by the Southern States of this Union, shall be the region adapted above all others, upon the face of the globe, for the growth of the best qualities of the cotton-plant. This can be said of no other American production. Wheat and all the grains, sugar, rice, tobacco, every agricultural staple produced by us, can be raised elsewhere, nearly if not quite as well. Other lands are dependent upon us, for them only to a very limited measure. They can meet but comparatively little of the heavy balance that yearly accrues against us.

"-- At 2 1/2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, while the steamer Philadelphia was en route for Hilton Head, having on board the One Hunred and Thirty-first New-York Volunteers, when about half a mile below Fort Pulaski, a citizen, clad in rebel uniform, for some unexplained reason suddenly grasped Private HENRY CAMERON, of Company C, One Hundred and Thirty-first New-York Volunteers, and attempted to push him over the deck guards into the river. CAMERON, supposing the fellow was joking or trying to play some sort of a trick, clinched his opponent closely and held on to his clothing, but he soon discovered that the man was in earnest and really intended to put him overboard. Before he could extricate himself from the would-be murderer, both parties lost their balance, and almost unobserved by the large number of soldiers on board, fell into the river. CAMERON says he heard the citizen strike the woodwork on the paddle-boxes, and in a few seconds heard stifled groans, and he thinks the paddle-wheels struck the drowning man and killed him, as he saw nothing of him after this occurrence. CAMERON being a good swimmer, at once struck out boldly for the shore, which was half a mile distant, experiencing great difficulty in stemming the swift current with his clothing on. He finally succeeded, with great difficulty, in divesting himself of all his clothing, and pressed rapidly for the dim outlines of the shore, which he reached in a nude and terribly exhausted condition. CAMERON landed on an extensive bed of oysters, cutting his feet badly, and here he remained till daylight, waiting like Micawber ""for something to turn up."" His eyes wore gladdened at day-light by beholding the white soils of a fishing smack, which he hailed, and was soon taken on board by VALENTINE MARTIN, a fisherman, who at once conveyed CAMERON to his house, at Sebastopol, on Long Island, fed him bountifully and gave him some clothing. The next day VALENTINE MARTIN conveyed CAMERON in his yawl to Fort Pulaski, where he was supplied with more clothing, and transportation furnished to bring him back to Savannah. Private CAMERON is very anxious to have his parents speedily informed of his safety after his perilous trip, as he fears his comrades will report him drowned on their arrival in New-York, and our New-York exchanges will confer a favor by stating this fact, and thereby relieve the anxiety of the family and relatives, who are expecting their son home with his regiment. -- Savannah Republican.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/04/archives/a-curious-story.html,,"-- At 2 1/2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, while the steamer Philadelphia was en route for Hilton Head, having on board the One Hunred and Thirty-first New-York Volunteers, when about half a mile below Fort Pulaski, a citizen, clad in rebel uniform, for some unexplained reason suddenly grasped Private HENRY CAMERON, of Company C, One Hundred and Thirty-first New-York Volunteers, and attempted to push him over the deck guards into the river.

They do not comprise the whole range of general truths on the subject, but the ground covered by them is unassailable. They are in substance as follows: 1st. The subjects or citizens ought to contribute to the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities -- that is, in proportion to the revenues which they enjoy under its protection. Any deviation from this rule constitutes inequality. 2d. The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain, and not arbitrary. The time and manner of payment and the sums to be paid ought to be plain to the contributors and everybody else. Otherwise they are placed more or less in the power of the tax-gatherer, who may use it for oppressive purposes. 3d. Every tax ought to be levied at the time and in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributors to pay it. This is one great advantage in indirect taxation, as the purchaser of an article upon which it has been assessed, can buy or not, when or to what amount, be pleases. 4th. Every tax ought to be so contrived as to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible above what it brings into the public treasury. In other words, it should be collectable at a minimum of expense. The levying of a tax may require a great number of officers, whose salaries will eat up the greater part of the produce. It may direct labor to less profitable employments. It may harrass the payers by fines and forfeitures, and give a great temptation to smuggling; or it may annoy them by too frequent visits and odious examinations.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TAXATION ARTICLE NO.

The scarcity of naval seamen, men who were conversant with the routine and duties of men-of-war, gave the government much anxiety during the late war, and frequently caused delay in fitting out vessels for important service. The new system gives the apprentices a thorough training in all practical duties of naval seamanship, such as handling of yards and sails, use of lead and compass, knotting, palm and needle, boating and great guns, howitzer drill, sword and rifle exercise, gunnery, going over the mast, and so on, while attention is also given to the ordinary elements of school education. The apprentice, on entering, must be fourteen and not over eighteen years of age; must be stout, active and of good character; and any attempt to foist into the service sickly boys, with a view to improve their health, or refractory boys to improve their morals, will be met with a firm refusal by the commander of the Sabine, which has been established as the school-ship. Over two hundred apprentices are now on board, and over a hundred, in addition, have been sent out on cruises in our men-of-war. The Navy Department requires three or four thousand of these naval apprentices in all, so that there is yet an opportunity for those lads who desire to enter this patriotic service.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'APPRENTICES FOR OUR NAVY.

If this report is correct, DAVIS' friends would appear to want something more than a fair and speedy trial for their friend. They speak as if to try him at all were an outrage. They deliver themselves on the political situation generally, as if the Executive and his advisers ought to change places with the head of the late Confederacy.

The colored man says he was formerly free, and working for wages in Maryland, across the Eastern Branch. He went South in 1859 with a Dr. LEE, for whom he had worked, persuaded by specious promises of higher pay. Going first to Athens, Georgia; afterward to Knoxville, Tennessee, where Dr. LEE for a time kept the Knoxville Hotel, and subsequently removing to Jonesboro. Receiving wages at first, he was at length held and treated as a slave. In the Winter of 1863 Dr. LEE hired him out to the rebel Quartermasters at Jonesboro. After remaining there ten months he attempted to escape to the lines of the national army. He got twenty miles away, but was caught and taken back, when this rebel Quartermaster sent him to Surgeon WELLIN, in charge of the rebel hospital there, and ordered the latter to cut off his feet and hands to prevent, as he said, his attempt to run away again. The doctor partially complied, amputating both legs just above the knee. He left the stumps undressed over night, but, finding him alive next day, said: 'What, you d_____d nigger, are you alive yet? I intended to kill you.' He then had him placed on an ambulance, taken to a hut of an old colored man, where he remained until our troops occupied the place.

Mr. Mr. HENNESSY was very anxious that the dog should be killed, and accordingly Recorder AVERY furnished him with all necessary authority to carry out his desire. The dog was found on board the Bremen steamer, lying at the dock, and Mr. H., after some delay, having secured the animal, took him out to the end of the pier foot of Third-street, for the purpose of drowning him. It is alleged that Special Deputy REED threatened to throw HENNESSY overboard if he attempted to drown the dog, when the latter pitched the animal overboard, and then pitched into Mr. REED, but with assistance was finally ejected from the pier. Subsequently, while REED and some friends were standing at the corner of Third and River streets, HENNESSY came up and renewed the attack, when Officer KING came up, and HENNESSY turned and struck him, and at the same time REED put in two or three well-directed blows. HENNESSY was arrested, but on being taken before the Recorder the officer withdrew the charge of assault and battery, and accused plead guilty to disorderly conduct.

"Croton, Act Authorizing New Reservoir",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/05/archives/a-new-reservoir.html,"Croton, Act Authorizing New Reservoir","The necessity for an increased supply of Croton water has been long felt by our citizens. No sooner does the dry weather set in, than the commissioners feel it necessary to economize the supply, much to the inconvenience of housekeepers. Last year, it will be remembered, there were serious apprehensions of a scarcity; and this season, although the reservoirs are full to overflowing, complaints are made that the water will not rise above the second stories of the up-town residences. This, the commissioners say, is caused by the fact that more water is used at this season of the year than any other for washing and bathing purposes. It may be reasonably presumed, however, that the outflow from the reservoirs is diminished by those having the matter in charge, as a precautionary measure against the scarcity likely to be felt during the dry season extending through July and August.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New Reservoir.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New Reservoir.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1a7ed44-49b4-535d-abb0-6169a427d45a,799,nyt://article/e1a7ed44-49b4-535d-abb0-6169a427d45a,

Garibaldi's Letter on Tomb of Dante; West Indian Remedy for,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/06/archives/foreign-items.html,Garibaldi's Letter on Tomb of Dante; West Indian Remedy for,"-- The China Telegraph publishes a curious bit of information. A series of articles have recently appeared in the Norddcutsche Zeitung, said to be from the pen of Count EULENBERG, in which the establiment of a Prussian Colony in the Chinese Seas is very strongly advocated. The writer wants to create ""German India"" after the model of the Netherlands India, and selects Formosa as the most fitting spot. He recommends that two Prussian men-of-war and a large body of skilled artificers should be dispatched to the west coast of Formosa, and there found a colony, first claiming possession of the whole island. As soon as the buildings were completed cultivation would be commenced, and reinforced by troops of emigrants ""now lost to Germany,"" would speedily spread over the whole territory, and, perhaps, cross over into the main land. This notion of founding German colonies is one which has been repeatedly discussed in Germany; but the Prussian Court has scarcely at this moment the means for such undertakings, and will certainly not persuade men who can go to America to betake themselves to a tropical island, to work under sweltering heat amid a hostile race. The idea of a penal settlement, also mooted, is more formidable, but Formosa, belongs to the Emperor of China, and England will be scarcely disposed to see his territories taken from him by a power which as yet has no footing in Eastern waters.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Diphtheria', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0744ee70-05ca-52d3-9b89-48f9842eac4f,2798,nyt://article/0744ee70-05ca-52d3-9b89-48f9842eac4f,

"-- The Manchester-Mirror tells the following good story: A young soldier belonging to a New-Hampshire regiment, while far away from the fair damsels of his native State, thought it would be a relief to his loneliness if he could persuade some one of them to hold communication with him by letter. So he placed an advertisement in the New-Hampshire papers, inviting some beautiful and amiable young lady between sixteen and twenty-four years of ago to open a correspondence with ""Frederick,"" of the Second New-Hampshire Regiment, with a view of matrimony. Some waggish acquaintances of the young soldier in this city who saw the advertisement and knew its origin, resolved to gratify his desire for a female admirer to the full extent of their power, and secure at the same time a little amusement for themselves. A letter was dispatched to him by one of the wags forthwith, written in the most delicate female hand, in which ""Rosalia Templeton,"" whose name appeared at the close, expressed the most tender love and sympathy for Frederick. The latter was overjoyed, and responded in the most ardent manner. ""Rosalia"" replied, declaring that life would be insupportable unless she could cherish the hope that she might eventually repose in the embraces of the gallant and patriotic young soldier, her beloved correspondent. In the most passionate manner she entreated him not to let her ""burst in ignorance"" of his real name and history. She also begged he would send her his photograph, that she might feast her eyes upon the features of her dearest ""Frederick."" She assured him that her father had ample stores of wealth, and that when the war was over they would resign every care, and nothing should disturb their unalloyed bliss.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/06/archives/perils-of-lovemaking-by-mail.html,,"-- The Manchester-Mirror tells the following good story: A young soldier belonging to a New-Hampshire regiment, while far away from the fair damsels of his native State, thought it would be a relief to his loneliness if he could persuade some one of them to hold communication with him by letter.

"GOTTFRIED F. NESTLE, a German brewer, committed suicide, in his dwelling, at No. 157 Attorney street, between 12 and 1 o'clock yesterday morning, by shooting himself through the head with a common Colt's navy revolver. The story, which is the old one of excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquors, is briefly as follows: NESTLE kept a small brewery and large drinking saloon in the basement of No. 157 Attorney-street, and was himself one of the best customers of the place, having been a heavy drinker for-twenty years or more, and for full five weeks past. He had in his house a small armory, containing several pistols, revolvers, rifles, &c., with which he threatened several times to put an end to his existence, but was always persuaded by his wife not to do so. For about five or six weeks NESTLE had been drinking more than usual, and in his conduct showed the signs of delirium tremens, with the exception of the last few days, when there appeared to be considerable improvement in his condition. On Friday he drank two bottles of Rhine wine, several drinks of brandy, and a large quantity of lager beer, which of course upset him entirely, in that state he went around the house, murmuring threats, but at midnight was finally pursuaded by his wife to go to his room. Mrs. NESTLE left him there, and was just returning to enter a small bed-room where her three children were awaiting her, when NESTLE pulled a large navy revolver from his breast and shot himself through the head. The ball broke the skull, scattering the brains all over the floor. The condition of poor Mrs. NESTLE can be easier imagined than described. She fainted at the horrible sight, and it was some time before she could be revived. The excitement in the neighborhood was wide-spread, as NESTLE was well known, and much sympathy is expressed at his untimely end.

Our readers may remember that we stated some two mouths since that the Sea King, which had cleared from London on the 9th of October for Bombay, was intended for this purpose; and that the Laurel, which cleared from this port for Nassau about the same time, was conveying the armament and men to the Sea King. The truth of our statement was immediately, denied by a merchant of Liverpool, in a letter addressed simultaneously to ourselves and other papers. We have our opinion of the purpose of that denial, and so likely have most of our readers. We are now enabled to furnish our readers with something like an authentic account of the transaction, made up from documents in our possession, and in doing so cannot help saying that such transactions are greatly to be deplored. They reduce our boasted neutrality to a mere sham; they furnish a friendly nation with just ground of complaint against us; they create bitter enmities between two great kindred peoples, whose true interests are dependent on mutual good will and amity. They compromise the character of British merchants, we might say of the British nation, in order that a few reckless and unprincipled individuals among us may derive a little gain. They threatened to involve us in a war with a powerful nation, the cost of which must fall not on the delinquents, but on the British people. There must be some way of stopping them, and that way should be found. It appears, then, that the Sea King was built at Glasgow, in October, 1863, and registered as the property of WILLIAM WALLACE, of London, banker, and others; her registered tonnage lining 790 tons; her combined power 200 horse; frame work of iron, with wood planking.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PIRATE SHENANDOAH.; The History of Her Ownership Arming of the British Pirate The Beauties of English Neutrality Illustrated.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PIRATE SHENANDOAH.; The History of Her Ownership Arming of the British Pirate The Beauties of English Neutrality Illustrated.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Liverpool Daily Post', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6cc85330-5fe1-5a94-b0d7-eb6a213662a4,2716,nyt://article/6cc85330-5fe1-5a94-b0d7-eb6a213662a4,

Republican learns that a petition will be presented to the United States Senate, at its next session, protesting against the validity of the election, by our Legislature, of Hon. JOHN P. STOCKTON as United States Senator. The grounds are that he did not receive the votes of a majority of the joint meeting. The provision of the constitution is as follows: ""The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof."" Under this provision it has everywhere and always been held, until this election of Mr. STOCKTON, that a majority, not merely a plurality, was necessary to a choice. A majority of the joint meeting voted against him. There were 81 members of the joint meeting, all being present. Of these, 40 voted for Mr. STOCKTON, 37 for Mr. TEN EYCK, and Ex-Gov. VROOM, Col. WALL, Hon. H.S. LITTLE and Hon. T.T . FRELINGHUYSEN each received one vote. If this election is valid, a time may come when less than one-fourth of the Legislature may elect officers. The joint meeting is composed of 81 members, and instead of six candidates, sixty may be voted for for Senator. If forty can elect when there forty-one opposed, then three votes can elect, although there were seventy-eight votes opposed to the candidate elected, but so divided that no other candidate has received more than two. If the Senate shall decide that the election is not valid, of course the seat will be vacant, and to be filled by the next Legislature.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERSONAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERSONAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/81be400e-4855-51ec-84e4-8c3f9a85b81c,2034,nyt://article/81be400e-4855-51ec-84e4-8c3f9a85b81c,

"Y.-- A sad and fatal accident occurred on Friday of last week, at Worcester, a few miles west of the county line, in Otsego County, resulting in the death of Mrs. ROBINSON, the wife of HAMILTON W. ROBINSON, Esq., of New-York, and the severe injury of himself and eldest daughter, Mrs. HARRIS. It seems from the accounts we are able to gather that Mr. ROBINSON has always made a Summer visit at Worcester, where he formerly lived, since he first went to New-York to engage in the practice of law. He had taken much pains fitting up the old homestead, and it was here he delighted to take his Summer recreations with his wife and children. On the day of the fatal accident the family were enjoying a drive, Mr. ROBINSON having taken his own carriage and horses with his driver into the country with him. While going down some slight declivity in the road, the neck-yoke or pole-strap gave, way, seeing which, the driver threw the reins from his hands and leaped from his seat, leaving the occupants of the carriage at the mercy of the horses, who now, for the first, became frightened and commenced running. When near the bridge the carriage was overturned. Mrs. ROBINSON was killed outright. The injuries of Mr. ROBINSON are very severe, and it is feared they may prove fatal. Mrs. HARRIS, the daughter, was also severely injured, but to what extent we are unable to learn. The others in the carriage were bruised snd scratched. A little boy, either a son or grand-son of Mr. ROBINSON, who was setting on the box with the driver at the time of the occurrence, says that if the driver had given him the reins, instead of throwing them out of his hands and jumping from his seat, he could have guided the horses so that no accident would have happened. The driver was a negro man, and so outraged were the people of the neighborhood at the cowardice evinced by him him that preparations for lynching him were being made, when it was discovered he had effected his escape, and has not since been heard of.

Her frame is of white oak and locust, and she is planked entirely with white oak; the floors are solid, the bilge streaks are oak, and the ceiling of white pine. She is in every respect like the Newport, except she has sponsons, which aid her in weathering the winter storms of the Sound, and is the only Sound steamer thus finished.

"-- The statement has been frequently made of late years that with the water thrown up from many of the artesian wells, recently bored by the French in the northern district of the Sahara desert, small fish have been ejected from depths of 150 to 200 feet. This statement, which has been generally descredited, is now, however, proved to be true; M. DESOR, the eminent Swiss naturalist, who has recently returned from an exploration of the northern Sahara, testifying to its authenticity. He states in a recent letter that he ""found the fish in the stream leading from one of the wells at the oasis Ain-Tala where the fish were observed when the water first rose to the surface. It is impossible that these fish should come from anywhere else than from out of the well, for the water stands in no communication with either basin or river. The fish belongs to the family of carps, and if I am not mistaken, to the proper species of Cyprinodon. The most curious thing is that these fish, although coming from the interior of the earth, from a depth of more than 150 feet, having nothing sickly or misshapen about them; they are of most remarkable liveliness, and, what is especially worthy of note, have fine, large, completely healthy eyes. You know that the fish and other aquatic animals which are found in the subterranean ponds of the A[???]sberg cavern in Steyermark, and in the Mammoth cavern in kentucky, are all blind. Their ocular organs are slanted, and often nothing is left of the eye but the optic nerve. Some naturalists, therefore, have tried to classify them as a species of their own, while others maintain that every organ deprived of the opportunity to exercise its functions must necessarily degenerate at last, and become defective. But here we have a fish from the interior of the earth with perfect eyes. How are we to account for this? I confess that this phenomenon puzzles me, yet I think I have found the key to the riddle. The subterranean basin, which feeds the artesian wells, must be of considerable dimensions, as the water springs up on a space of many square miles, wherever it is bored. Beside these artificial wells, there are ponds in several oases, especially that of Urlana, fed by rich sources, and from which real brooks spread in different directions. These ponds harbor the same little Cyprinodonts which rise in the water of the artesian wells, by which I conclude that a subterranean connection exists between the ponds and the wells. Probably they visit those ponds periodically, perhaps to spawn; this would explain why their eyes, and their formation in general, show nothing abnormal. -- Annual of Scientific Discovery.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/06/archives/fish-in-the-depths-of-the-earth.html,,"-- The statement has been frequently made of late years that with the water thrown up from many of the artesian wells, recently bored by the French in the northern district of the Sahara desert, small fish have been ejected from depths of 150 to 200 feet.

Probably they visit those ponds periodically, perhaps to spawn; this would explain why their eyes, and their formation in general, show nothing abnormal. -- Annual of Scientific Discovery.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FISH IN THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FISH IN THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a5e0e332-a202-5f9b-ba2a-a740f2f1471f,458,nyt://article/a5e0e332-a202-5f9b-ba2a-a740f2f1471f,

RUGGLES, of this State, made some observations respecting the transportation of emigrants to the West, which seem to us worthy of peculiar attention. The principal lines engaged in this service are the Erie, the Central, the Pennsylvania Central and (in Summer) the Grand Trunk of Canada; if the Baltimore and Ohio and the various roads composing the chain from Boston to Ogdensburgh, run regular emigrant trains, it is more than we are aware of. Emigrants are now carried at about one cent per mile, a rate which scarcely pays expenses these days.

Upon searching the bushes they discovered an indifferently-clad male infant, apparently about four weeks of age, which must have been suffering the greatest agony, as it was covered with myriads of mosquitoes, which were drawing out its life-blood.

Prospective Party Changes in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/07/archives/prospective-party-changes-in-england.html,Prospective Party Changes in,"Among the political intelligence from Europe which we publish this morning is the report, circulated by a well-informed Liverpool journal, that Lord PALMERSTON contemplates an early retirement from the Premiership. There are various reasons, aside from the state of the Premier's physical strength, which would be found to strengthen the credibility of this report. The character of the new House of Commons will undoubtedly be found more Liberal in the genuine sense of the term than any that has preceded it since the first Reformed Parliament met. It is not in the mere ousting of Tories from old and firmly-held seats that the ruling party has made its gains. It is not alone in the accession to its ranks of members of the strict Whig persuasion that the Ministerialists have run up their majority from a dozen or two to seventy or eighty. The strict party men of the office-holding class have in many instances suffered overwhelming defeats -- such as Mr. FREDERICK PEEL, Lord BURY, Col. WHITE, and Lord ALFRED PAGET. The Liberal gain has been rather in substantial Reformers than in well-disciplined party voters. Of these substantial Reformers, there is now a solid band, which will not only make a respectable show on the cross-benches, and stand as monitors against Whig backsliding, but which will operate as a power in the Whig councils, and compel the adoption of a Ministerial programme which will include not a few of the great liberal measures which have heretofore been ""open questions."" The suffrage, and representation, and the Church rates questions may safely be reckoned among those on which the real Liberals of the new House will require their party leaders to take a definite and decided stand. The phalanx of thorough Reformers, at the head of which hereafter stand such men as MILL, BRIGHT, FOSTER, KINGLAKE, HUGHES, EDWARD BAINES, EDWARD BAXTER, etc., will be more than a mere body of free lances. They have now the numbers, the talent, the energy, the moral support of the outside community, essential to give them positive weight in shaping the national policy; and no mere figurehead, however venerable and illustrious, will now serve a Whig, or so-called Liberal administration much longer in the place of an actual practical and immediate policy of progress -which shall include substantial, if not radical reforms both in Church and State.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prospective Party Changes in England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prospective Party Changes in England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/13ae8e0d-2adc-5fc3-a8a1-d0c5778202ae,764,nyt://article/13ae8e0d-2adc-5fc3-a8a1-d0c5778202ae,

HALL & ROGERS' studios. Promptly giving the alarm, and ascending to the fourth floor to ascertain what was best to be done, he found near the spot where the flames were fiercest a brace and bit lying near a staircase where several holes had been bored, and a strong odor of benzine gave him the impression that a bituminous preparation had been scattered on the floor; he therefore inferred that the fire was of incendiary origin. The flames made rapid progress, and before the firemen reached the spot, had burst from the window. Half an hour later, the fire threatened the entire building, and a messenger was dispatched to Police Headquarters, requesting Inspector CARPENTER to telegraph for Metropolitan Fire Engine No. 1. She was on the spot within ten minutes. But as other machines had secured desirable places and were working well, throwing as much water as was necessary, Metropolitan was not assigned position. As matter of curiosity, and presuming that a trial of skill might occur, our reporter noted the names of the fire companies that were working, as follows: Nicaragua, No. 4; Guardian, No. 29; Croton, No. 47; Lady Washington, No. 40; Marion, No. 9; Howard, No. 34, and Jackson, No. 24 -- all steamers, and Niagara, No. 4; United States, No. 23; the two latter hand machines that took position directly under the fire. These machines had the fire under and practically extinguished by midnight, and only the third and fourth floors had been consumed, while moderate damage had been done by water on the first and second floors, which are occupied by the Eighth National (old Baltic) Bank, the Baltic Fire Insurance Company, and Messrs. William M. Knabe & Co., dealers in pianos. This firm also occupied the third story. On the fourth floor several artists had studios; among them Messrs.

He had in his house a small armory, of pistols, revolvers, rifles, &c., with which he threatened several times to put an end to his existence, but was always persuaded by his wife not to do so. On Friday he drank two bottles of Rhine wine, several drinks of brandy, and a large quantity of lager beer, which of course upset him entirely, in that state he went about the house, murmuring threats, but at midnight was finally pursuaded by his wife to go to his room. Mrs. NESTLE left him there, and was just returning to enter a small bedroom where her three children were awaiting her, when NESTLE pulled a large navy revolver from his breast and shot himself through the head. The ball broke the skull, scattering the brains all over the floor. The condition of poor Mrs. NESTLE can be easier imagined than described. She fainted at the horrible sight, and it was some time before she could be revived.

They threw out every proposition brought forward by the ministry; but the ministry carried their measures into effect with a cool effrontery which drew from the opposition a tremendous series of protests and indignant resolves, but nothing more. At length the testy old King got tired of their eternal speechifying, and summarily sent them packing, adding insult to injury in the form of a sharp rebuke of their contumacious disregard of his royal wishes and instructions.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Easy-going Prussians and their Foolish old King.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Easy-going Prussians and their Foolish old King.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68bb7ba5-2393-58e7-8bb1-df6f5370f626,855,nyt://article/68bb7ba5-2393-58e7-8bb1-df6f5370f626,

"-- THOMAS ROSS, a colored man, one of the crew of the gunboat Tioga, called upon us yesterday, and gave an interesting account and showed us some of the effects of a four years' compulsory residence among the cannibals of the Pacific Islands. The vessel in which he had shipped from Sydney, Australia, was wrecked off one of the South Pacific Islands, known as Mitchell's Group, lat. 8 deg., long. 179 deg. E. Himself, the captain, and five seamen, escaped to the island, where they were immediately seized by the natives thereof, stripped of their clothing, and at once inducted into the modes and ways of life peculiar to that people. No harm was done them, but they were compelled to adopt all the fashions of the natives. The result of one of these Mr. ROSS still bears on his person. Their ears were perforated, and rings of cocoanut half an inch in diameter, inserted to the number of thirty in each ear. The effect of so much weight was to stretch the lower part of the ear until it became aligned with the chin. Mr. ROSS still wears a number of these rings, The wide aperture thus made is usually stuffed with bunches of flowers, giving to the wearer a grotesque appearance. Vessels occasionally passed the island during his enforced residence there, but the natives at such times kept a strict watch on their captives, and never permitted their presence to become known to those on shipboard. ROSS and a companion escaped by swimming off to a vessel one dark night. Their companions, for aught he knows, are still on the island. Corn, pumpkins, yam and oranges were abundant, and required but little cultivation. The natives were frequently at war with a neighboring tribe. Going forth to battle, they confined their captives in a stockade, releasing them on their return. In all other particulars they were treated as equals and brothers. Many other interesting particulars were communicated, which we have not space to enumerate. -- Bangor (Me.)

The Old Colony is to be one of the finest of our Sound steamers, and in all her appointments will probably have no equal in this country. She was built by JOHN ENGLIS & SON, who built the steamer Newport, of the same line. She is 320 feet in length, 42 feet beam of hull, and 80 feet over all, and 14 feet depth of hold. Her frame is of white oak and locust, and she is planked entirely with white oak; the floors are solid, the bilge streaks are oak, and the ceiling of white pine. She is in every respect like the Newport, except she has sponsons, which aid her in weathering the winter storms of the Sound, and is the only Sound steamer thus finished. The joiner-work is by HOFFMIRE, and will be beautiful in design and finish. She will have 150 staterooms and 150 berths. She has one engine with 80 inch cylinder and 12 feet stroke of piston; the wheels are 38 feet in diameter. She has two tubular hollers. The machinery has been put in by Mr. GUYON, and was built at the Allaire Works.

However, the great question in regard to the superiority of one or the other of these rival organizations will soon be settled, for on Monday next the second and decisive match is to take place on the Capitoline Grounds, Bedford, at which locality Superintendent FALK, of Brooklyn, will reign supreme, and his well known opposition to the rowdy element will insure a clear field for the match, and prevent the possibility of any outside interference, let the result be ever so close. Until Monday, therefore, the question will remain in abeyance.

"-- A suicide, attended with unusually sad circumstances, was committed yesterday morning on Washington-avenue, near Swanson-street. The self-murderer was HENRY W. ERDMAN, late First Lieutenant of Company I, Ninety-first Pennsylvania Volunteers. He called at the Union Volunteer Refreshment Saloon yesterday morning, and, from his conversation, was believed to be laboring under mania-a-potu. Among other things, he said that he intended to drown himself. To Mr. COOPER, the store-keeper at the saloon, he said that he had not tasted liquor for three days, and, holding out his hands, desired him to see how steady his nerves were. Mr. COOPER's business calling him away from, ERDMAN, he left him sitting in the Washington-avenue passage to the saloon. A few minutes after, as a freight train was approaching. ERDMAN left his seat and walked to the railroad track, then laid down upon it, immediately in front of the first car. The attention of the brakesman was at once called to ERDMAN, and he tried to stop the train, but was unable to do so. Three wheels passed over the unfortunate man, nearly cutting him in two. Death was almost instantaneous. The body was removed to the Second District Police Station, where an inquest was held on it, and a verdict in accordance with the facts was rendered. Deceased was twenty-nine years old, and was married. He entered the army as a private, was first promoted to a sergeantcy, and subsequently was, on the field, promoted to a first lieutenantcy for meritorious services. His commission bears date the 1st of May, 1865. From his mustering papers it appears that he was born in Germany, and that he was enrolled as a jeweller. He was of fine personal appearance, being nearly six feet high, with dark complexion.

"A returned soldier was killed at Greenwich, Conn., on Saturday night, while heading a riotous crowd of young fellows who had undertaken to inflict summary punishment upon a negro who was living near that town, very peaceably, and minding his own business. His offence, as they deemed it, was in having a white wife, an Irish girl, who voluntarily married him, and with whom he had lived for a considerable period. This was thought by the assailants to be worthy of mob justice, and, after fortifying with the requisite liquor, they undertook to drag forth the parti-colored partners. But a little accident interfered; a wide-awake old negro woman, who was not afraid to defend her house, nor even afraid of handling a gun, confronted the mob at the door and advised them to desist, at the same time firing over their heads. They were only about fifteen to one, and after a little scare they concluded to go on with the job. So they threw stones at the house, and made various attempts to get in. The old black woman at last fired directly into the crowd, shooting the ringleader through the brain. He died immediately, and his brave companions retired, giving up the job as a bad speculation. The negroes were taken into custody without resistance, and all parties were examined by the Coroner's Jury. The case was plain, it would seem, the jury found a verdict of justifiable homicide, and ordered the discharge of the prisoners, but not the retention of the young fellows who testified that they were of the party, and went on purpose to play the mischief with the darkeys. All was now over, but there seems to have been an amusing episode in the form of a volunteer address to the chief negro by one of the jurors, speaking, of course, for himsef only. The spirit of his address was this: You have done just right; the law is all on your side; we must all justify and protect you; there is nothing we can get hold of against you, but, if I were you I would leave here; of course, you have a right to remain, but you are unpleasant, and our feelings ought to take precedence of your legal rights; in fact, you have no right to be a negro, or else your wife has no right to be a white woman -- or the other way -- or, or -- well, at any rate, I should prefer that, since you are a nuisance, you should got out; you may go where you please, of course; and if any other neighborhood objects to you, why, keep going -- in short, a nigger has no right to a home anywhere if his white fellow-citizens don't like to have him anywhere.

At noon a four-horse stage, with a committee of the Enterprise Club, of Brooklyn, with which club they were engaged to play, drove up to the hotel for their guests and took them over to the Capitoline Grounds at Bedford, where, at 3:30, they began play together. In this game the Enterprise had out the same nine -- with one exception -- with which they played the Stars, and it was soon evident that their practice together on Saturday had improved their play considerably, for they opened the game with some very lively fielding, and aiding it with good batting, soon took a decided lead in the game, the totals at the close of the seventh innings standing twenty-nine to twenty in favor of the the Enterprise, and by way of finishing things off in style, they ran their score up to 38, their adversaries falling short ten runs, their total at the close of the ninth being 28. It was a well-earned victory for the Enterprise, and a prettily played game. JEWELL led the score on the Enterprise side, and MAPES on the part of the Hudson River. In fly catching, FISHER made the best display on the Hudson River side, COOKE leading on the part of the Enterprise. The Umpire strictly observed the sixth and thirty-ninth rules, and hence the game was decided by good play, and required but two and a half hours.

Mr. KNIGHT, landlord of the hotel when it was known as the Sewell House, was buried under the mass; but policemen and members of the Fire Insurance Patrol took him out, happily, alive, but with a fractured shoulder-blade and serious internal injuries. There are three buildings, connected on the second story -- front, centre and rear -- all belonging to this hotel, and it was the centre building which fell. Workmen had some time past been making alterations in the centre building, such as to require shoring up with jack-screws; and it is believed that the foundations upon which these jacks were based were undermined by the cataracts which were played upon the Eighth National Bank building, adjoining the St. Charles, at the time of the fire there on Saturday night; at least this is the theory of Messrs. BAKER & LONDON, the masons who were making the alterations in the St. Charles, and of others who have examined the premises. The scene at the time of the accident is described by Mr. CHARLES D. GABLE, one of the occupants, who had a room opposite Mr. KNIGHT's bedroom. He says that when he went to bed on Sunday night, at about 10:30 o'clock, he observed that the building seemed to be settling, and that the door of his apartment could be closed only with considerable difficulty. He went to sleep, however, and was awakened about 12:30 o'clock by the loud crash of falling walls.

If the great cable meets the expectations formed of it, we shall find it an auxiliary of commerce and an agent of peace. But it is important, withal, that we should remember that its international character is determined by sufferance, instead of being established by treaty. Essentially, it is a British enterprise, beginning and ending on British territory. Our interest in it is great and direct. So also is our interest in the splendid fleets of German, French, English and Scotch steamships that keep the Atlantic Ferry running. In these enterprises we are not only interested, but they are most deeply interested in us. We give them all the commercial value they possess. We fill their holds with freight, and their cabins with passengers, going East and coming West.

Button on the Black Man,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/09/archives/button-on-the-black-man.html,Button on the Black Man,"The recent transaction in Connecticut, in which a gang of white ruffians undertook to mob, and doubtless to murder, a poor weak woman of their own color, because they did not happen, over their cups, to approve of her choice of a husband, suggests a few words of reprobation of the spirit of lawlessness evinced in the case, and of advice to the people where it occurred. One of the ruffians -- the ringleader, as appears from the testimony -- was killed, and every good citizen will say that he got no more than his crime merited. We do not mean to justify violent measures for protection, unless the case demands it; and this case, so far as we can see, did demand it. Here it is: A man, recognized as a good and quiet citizen, marries a woman, who is also a good and peaceable citizen. They live together, man and wife, and for a long time no one says nay; they are quiet, industrious people, earning their living by hard work, employed by their neighbors, and generally applauded for good conduct. But it happens that they differ in color -- the man is tawny, the woman is pale -- the man is partly African, the woman is wholly Irish, and consequently white. It is a matter of taste -- ""the law allows it and the court awards it ;"" there is no legal impediment to the union -- no legal difference between a man of yellow skin or of blue skin. Of course the neighbors have their opinions, and many of them denounce the marriage as monstrous. Had the parties not been married, but simply lived in open prostitution, and kept a house for general accommodation, as scores of them do here in New-York, all would have been right -- the fortunate nigger would have been a prime fellow, and the white wench would have had the best of patronage. But they, foolish people, had regard to moral laws, and audaciously stepped from illicit commerce to legal union -- hence the trouble.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Button on the Black Man.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Button on the Black Man.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0786a51d-cb8f-59ff-8956-eafd45ba58a5,1001,nyt://article/0786a51d-cb8f-59ff-8956-eafd45ba58a5,

DODGE, of this city, will add greatly to the deservedly high reputation of that popular artist. One of these photographs (they are of the imperial size) is of President JOHNSON, and the other of JOHN BROWN, whose soul, the song says, is ""marching on."" The portrait of the President, from which this photograph is taken, was painted from life on the order of Mr. JOHNSON in May last, and is in every respect an admirable production of art. Nearly all the likenesses of Mr. JOHNSON give an angularity and sharpness to his features which those who have seen him know that they do not possess. The portrait by Mr. DODGE avoids this infelicity while it gives the expression of Mr. JOHNSON's countenance with lifelike fidelity and accuracy. Secretary MCCULLOCH, in a letter to the artist, speaks of the picture as ""a most excellent likeness and a beautiful specimen of art."" He adds: ""I have rarely seen a portrait which pleased me so much.

Lord MONCK in his opening speech to the Legislature, it will be seen, uses words of great friendliness toward the United States -- words, the sincerity of which would have been better attested in the crisis of our conflict, than after its triumphant close. Still, we must accept Lord MONCK's courteous greetings in good spirit, and let the past be forgotten. The new ministry brought together is little different from that which dissolved upon the death of Sir E.P. TACHE, the late Premier. A French Canadian, and one, too, with a British title, again succeeds to the chief ministerial office. Sir NARCISSE BELLEAU, gazetted Premier and Receiver-General, is a respectable lawyer, who has been President of the Legislative Council, and in that capacity was knighted during the Prince of WALES' visit. He will do what his predecessor did -- prevent the radical and tory members of the coalition government over which he presides from coming to an open fight Nearly all the old members of the Cabinet appear to have come together again, with some changes in the distribution of offices. They will, therefore, work as before in favor of confederation, and, as far as possible, endeavor to carry out the views of the parent government on that and kindred schemes.

It appears that, in January last JESSE COLUMBUS, who had always lived with his sister, the defendant and upon whom she depended for support, enlisted and went to the war, packing his wearing apparel, and leaving it at No. 62 1/2 West Washington-place, and that subsequently the sister, having become indigent, applied to Mrs. SIGLER, and received the clothing from her, and pawned it. The brother having been honorably discharged from the army, returned to New-York, and naturally called upon Mrs. SIGLER to get his clothes; but was told that they had been delivered to his sister, and that he would do well to apply to her. He accordingly went to his sister's, and she frankly admitted that she had claimed and received the clothing and pawned the same, and gave him the pawn-tickets; but, instead of acting the part of a brother, and redeeming the clothing, JESSE entered complaint at the Second District Police Court against his sister, and she, having been apprehended by Officer PALMER, of the court, was committed in default of $500 bail, to answer for grand larceny. The prisoner, who is a native of New-Jersey, 25 years of age, says: ""I do not consider that I stole the things at all. He always lived with me, being my brother. When he went to the war he took his things and left them with a woman in West Washington-place. I went down and asked for them, and she gave them to me.

Jones) recaptured","WILLIAM JONES, who is better known as Jack Sheppard, having recently escaped with a confederate from the Sing Sing prison, was recaptured in this city, yesterday, by Detective Officers FARLEY and TIEMANN, at the office of Harnden's Express. JONES is one of the most accomplished operators that has ever made work for the New-York police. He began his career here about five years ago, and for a long time baffled our keenest detective policemen-sometimes escaping with his booty, and sometimes leaving his ""plunder"" behind rather than rise capture. His favorite mode of procedure is to hire a carman, remove from a sidewalk a case of goods of any other thing that may suit his fancy, and deliver the same at any given point -- JONES watching the goods during their transit, and receiving them at the point designated; then taking them thence on another truck and selling them for whatever sum his confederate receiver of stolen goods may choose to pay. But he played this trick once too often, and was sentenced to serve in State Prison for thus stealing a case of goods of the value of $1,300 from in front of a warehouse in Broadway. While in the Tombs he attempted suicide by beating his skull with the irons into which the keepers had found it necessary to put him; but in this he was foiled. He was at length sent to Sing Sing and actually incarcerated; but after a brief tarry himself and a fellow-convict contrived to regain their liberty, and JONES, not fancying the atmosphere of New-York, went to Boston, where he was not so well known as here; his companion in escape, however, was recaptured not many miles from Sing Sing. In Boston the fugitive pursued the same line of operations as here and was quite successful until he undertook to send forward by Harnden's Express to this city a costly case of goods belonging to Messrs. OLMAN, HIBERT & Co., of Boston. These gentlemen, happily, learned whither their goods had been consigned in season to telegraph to the New-York police; and it therefore happened that when JONES appeared to claim the package, he encountered two claimants for his person. He was taken to the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, and is to be returned to Sing Sing in due time. Meanwhile, he quietly informs the� policemen that Sing Sing has not sufficient strength to hold him, and assures them that they may soon again expect to go on a fool's errand in quest of a fugitive ""Jack Sheppard.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Office of the Detective Police.; RECAPTURE OF JACK SHEPPARD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Office of the Detective Police.; RECAPTURE OF JACK SHEPPARD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0d5fa39-2d82-5094-863d-df931dbdec6f,424,nyt://article/a0d5fa39-2d82-5094-863d-df931dbdec6f,

True, the Gothams did not have GEORGE WRIGHT, alias Cohen, in this game; but the Empires were also minus the efficient services of WESTERVELT as centre field, who has done so much to support MARTIN's pitching. The game opened favorably for the Empires; in fact, their batting, in the second innings, almost decided the result of the match, their totals at the close of this inning standing 12 to 1 in their favor. In the last seven innings of the game they scored 17 to 5 on the part of the Gothams, the wild throwing and lack of harmony in their nine being two prominent features at the Gotham play. The contrast in the fielding was shown by the fact of the Empires taking no less than 17 fly-balls -- of which MARTIN secured 7 -- to 4 on the part of the Gothams, the latter marking their fielding with 19 wild throws, on which bases and runs were secured. MARTIN was also the most successful at the bat, HARRY WRIGHT taking the lead both at the bat and in fielding on the Gotham side. During the playing of this match the Hudson River Club and the Eagles made up a scrub match on the south field, and had a lively little game together of seven innings, the Eagles winning by a score of 24 to 21.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""OUT-DOOR SPORTS.; Base Ball.

Attempt to Abduct,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/09/archives/another-attempt-to-abduct-george-n-sanders.html,Attempt to Abduct,"-The telegraph has of late brought us repeated stories of attempts having been made to abduct Mr. GEORGE N. SANDERS from his abiding-place in Montreal. On Monday matters were brought to a crisis by the pretended connivance of a provincial detective with the kidnappers. The police of Montreal were warned, and the intended victim was released from his captors by the aid of a large force of the local constabulary. There is still a reward of twenty-five thousand dollars pending on the capture of SANDERS. In view of all these horrible kidnapping stories, would it not be well to reduce the amount to twenty-five cents? We really think that is about all this member of the Niagara Peace Conference is worth. If we had him here, and he should escape conviction by any chance, he would be a perpetual nuisance at large.

DERBY & MILLER, of No. 5 Sprucestreet, have just published ""The Life, Public Services and State Papers of ABRAHAM LINCOLN,"" by H.J. RAYMOND. It is an octavo volume of over 800 pages, and contains all of Mr. LINCOLN'S State papers, with his speeches, addresses, messages, letters, and proclamations. The text, from the pen of Mr. RAYMOND, connects them in their proper order, and succinctly details the circumstances under which they were issued or made. The documents given in this volume also comprise many not heretofore published, and which are not only interesting but highly important, because of the light they shed upon the political history of the country during the last four or five years. In connection with the famous Niagara Falls peace negotiations we have the following curious documents, one of which (Mr. GREELEY's ultimatum) was reproduced in the TIMES from an English journal some weeks since.

Condensed; American Milk Company's,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/10/archives/milk-something-useeul-to-know.html,Condensed; American Milk Company's,"-- We have been shown a specimen of condensed milk, prepared by the American Condensed Milk Company. The process by which this article is prepared is simple and differing from those heretofore in use. The milk is evaporated at a temperature of 120 degrees Fahr., in vacuum receivers, this moderate heat not altering the character of the milk, nor carrying off any of its nutritive qualities, as is said to be the case with processes where a greater heat is employed. The condensed milk before us bears, according to the proprietors' statement, four parts of water to one of the condensed fluid, in order to produce the best quality of milk usually sold. We placed with it six parts of water, however, and found the result to be quite equal to the average of milk delivered in this city. A basin of bread and milk, the milk boiled and diluted at the latter rate, was excellent. From careful examination we are convinced that this condensed article is nothing but pure milk, and as such we commend it. The makers sell it very much cheaper than ordinary milk; it will keep sweet double as long, and need not be purchased every day, (it is not delivered on Sundays,) while its decreased bulk makes it much more convenient for handling and transportion. If this new condensed milk takes the place of the attenuated fluid now doled out to this city, the monopolists are rightly served.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MILK SOMETHING USEEUL TO KNOW', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MILK SOMETHING USEEUL TO KNOW', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Milk', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/43779d2d-8e23-5182-82f8-51a5b0f31f1e,243,nyt://article/43779d2d-8e23-5182-82f8-51a5b0f31f1e,

As we understand it, this is the position of affairs: The government claimed that the tax was due under the Internal Revenue Act, and the bankers disputed the claim. Thereupon the government brought suits in the United States Circuit Court in this district against some of the bankers, to test the point and recover the amount of the tax. Judge NELSON, before whom it was heard, decided against the government, holding that bankers are not liable to pay a tax on sales of such bonds, made not as brokers for others, but on their own account.

Death of a Dog,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/10/archives/the-death-of-a-dog.html,Death of a Dog,"-- San Francisco papers give details of the killing of WILLIAM MULLIGAN, whose fate we have already announced by telegraph. This utterly devilish specimen of a villain was, after a career of wickedness that probably never had a parallel in this country, the victim of the most aggravated delirium tremens. His guilty soul was haunted by the spectres of those he had killed or grossly abused, and his closing hours were very naturally a scene of revolting horror. After the people, with mistaken clemency, had tried every means to tame the infuriated wretch, and after he had added the blood of two more unoffending men to his black catalogue of murder, an officer shot him through the head, and within the minute he went to his long home. This MULLIGAN was a representative man of his class; a class that should have died with him. There is a romantic notion that most great criminals have certain secondary virtues, such as bravery, magnanimity, &c.; but this creature was a stranger to any such weaknesses; he was, from first to last, an unmitigated fiend. He lived too long by twenty years; the gallows was cheated of its due by just about that length of time.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DEATH OF A DOG.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DEATH OF A DOG.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'MULLIGAN, WILLIAM', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e7cf9d1-ce95-596a-b0d6-d992620f7545,203,nyt://article/9e7cf9d1-ce95-596a-b0d6-d992620f7545,

FRASER, TRENHOLM & Co., from parting with or disposing of a freight of cotton, consisting of some 1,500 bales, which had been shipped from Havana to him, as a Confederate, agent, to be turned into money for the purposes of the late rebel government. The United States, as plaintiffs, claimed the property; but the defendant insisted that his title as a successful runner of the blockade was a good one, and that even if this did not hold good, he had a prior claim to the United States, in consideration of the fact that he had lost &#163;20,000 by the Confederate Government. The Vice-Chancellor's decision appears to have been very clear. He said there could be no doubt that the United States were entitled to the cotton, but as to the force of the argument between the Southern Government and Mr. PRIOLEAU that was a most serious matter, since it was a transaction ""between a government de facto and the citizen of a country wholly unconnected with the rebel and de jure governments. It could not be doubted that when the transaction was entered upon the cotton was the property of the so-called Confederate States, they having bought it with money levied as taxes. The question then was, in what character the Southern Government must be regarded. He held that it could not be deemed a mere band of marauders, but must be presumed to be an actual de facto government, exercising authority and receiving submission. What, then, he asked, became of it when its power terminated, and its functions were resumed by the United States? The Vice-Chancellor considered that there, could be no difficulty as to the law applicable to this state of things; for international law had settled that when a de facto government came to an end its property became that of its successors. He considered, however, that subject to any argument to be hereafter adduced, when the cause was thoroughly heard; these successors to such de facto government were bound by the agreement of those to whom they succeeded. This view had been anticipated in the arguments before him, and it had been set up in opposition to it that Mr. PRIOLEAU (or Messrs. FRASER, TRENHOLM & Co.) had taken possession of this cotton, knowing that he received it from people who were substantial rebels, and conscious at the same time of the rights of the United States as lawful governors of the so-called Confederate Territory. The Vice-Chancellor considered that this proved too much, since if it were correct the United States might at any time during the war have restrained the departure of any vessel acting as a privateer against the United States, whenever such vessel happened to be in a British port, simply by filing a bill in Chancery. He put very forcibly the argument that the Confederate Government must be held to be a government de facto, and not a mere band of banditti, because if they had been a mere banditti, there would have been no rights against them in the United States, but only in the private individuals whose property had been plundered. He considered, therefore, that the United States must take the cotton subject to fulfilling the agreement made between the Confederate Government and Mr. PRIOLEAU; but as much dispute would arise in negotiating the settlement of the affair, and as one half of the cotton appeared to be pretty certainly the property of the defunct government under the agreement and not Mr. PRIOLEAU's, he ordered that Mr. PRIOLEAU should be appointed receiver in the cause, which would enable him to dispose of the cotton and pay all proper charges, he giving security for &#163;20,000, the amount which would probably be found absolutely the property of the United States. We need not tell our readers that this suit is one of a very interesting character, and that the settlement of it is likely to lead to considerable discussion, although, fortunately, the affair is so entirely in the hands of the lawyers that no diplomatic difficulty is likely to arise out of it. At the Dock Board, yesterday, there was no trouble on the subject, the board simply being freed by the Vice-Chancellor's decision from any responsibility in the matter, Mr. PRIOLEAU receiving the cotton from them upon the terms of the order of the court, and being thenceforward responsible in the matter.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/10/archives/great-britain-ownership-of-confederate-government-cotton-from-the.html,,"A case of considerable interest arising out of the late American war, was incidentally mentioned at the Dock Board yesterday.

Locked Up for Drunkenness,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/11/archives/upon-the-hill.html,Locked Up for Drunkenness,"The facts that a rebel General named HILL recently got drunk, and became indecent, was locked up by the Washington police, and lay in the workhouse for two or three days, because he had not money to pay his fine -- that finally two mechanics (""mudsills,"" as HILL would call them) raised the funds and released the hero -- will serve as a text for many a smart paragraph. Let the press be merciful to this HILL. If he got drunk, he simply kept up the customs of his old home; for it is down in Dixie that the flowing bowl flows most lavishly, where drunkenness has been reduced to a science, and to be habitually sober will (in the case of a white man) subject the offender to a suspicion of conspiring against the State. This HILL, who is doubtless a whole chain of mountains in his native region, ought not to be roughly dealt with. Are not the nobs of British aristocracy permitted to smash the hats of the Charleys, and upset the boxes of dozing officers, and call it a ""demnition good joke?"" Why should not that HILL get drunk, and brawl and brag, as his kind have done for forty years, in the streets and, barrooms of the national capital, without being molested by a poor wretch of a watchman, who works for his living? Alas, alas! the degeneracy of modern days; when a gentleman -- ay, and a General, too -- can't get drunk without being arrested just like a vulgar plebeian, thrust into an odoriferous calaboose, haled before a vulgar beak, fined money, (the same to be in gold or greenbacks,) recommitted for the lack of the needful, and at last be extricated only by the suspicious sympathy of a couple of common working-men, whose object may, after all, be to humiliate the already cast-down and sadly humbled HILL. ""Two mechanics paid his fine.' If he had a decent regard for the opinions of mankind he would go right back to the work-house and pick oakum until a recognized sprig of the chivalry came to the rescue. Where are the ""sympathizers"" in Washington? Can they see the grand nation (that was to have been,) thus humbled in one of its chief pillars without an effort at redemption?

"HER HUSBAND HAS A DREAM. -- A woman of respectable appearance went before Recorder MARTINDALE, of Jersey City, yesterday, and asked to have a warrant issued for the arrest of a woman who resides near her in the upper part of the city, on suspicion of having stolen the complainant's wedding ring. It appears that on Wednesday afternoon, as complainant was about to mix up a batch of bread, she drew from her finger three rings, and placed them upon the mantle-piece by the side of the clock. Subsequently she had occasion to go down to the back yard to get some water from the hydrant and the door was left unlocked. Shortly, after one of her neighbors came in to get her dinner-kettle, which was standing on the table near the mantle-piece, and a quarter of an hour later another woman came in to inquire the time of day. The complainant then bethought herself of the rings, and went to the mantle-piece for the purpose of putting them upon her finger, when the wedding ring was found to be missing. The husband of the woman came from his work and was informed of the disappearance of the ring. After tea he eat down in a large rocking chair and after a while dropped off to sleep.

Cost to Him of Being Kidnapped,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/11/archives/the-cost-of-it.html,Cost to Him of Being Kidnapped,"It would be interesting to know how much it cost GEORGE SANDERS to be ""kidnapped."" The ""put-up"" job is tolerably well understood now-a-days, but this one seems to have been not very cleverly managed. First, a party of ""dangerous-looking fellows"" arrive from the United States. There they meet (by appointment, no doubt) with a detective -- one O'LEARY; they offer the detective the fabulous sum of ten thousand dollars for the worthless carcass of SANDERS. Of course, the detective at once posts SANDERS, as in duty bound, and the hirsute GEORGE goes forthwith to see the Chief of Police and the Recorder. On the way the attempt at abduction is made, and, of course, fails. Now, GEORGE, we respectfully submit that you are drawing it a little too strong. Your detective is one of the best-known men in Canada, and it is hardly reasonable to suppose that real kidnappers would have sought him for a confidant. And then to arrange for an assault while ""on the road to the Recorder's office!"" Why, you evidently dared not trust your own instruments, and so, instead of boldly counterfeiting suicide by a plunge from Victoria Bridge, (with half-a-dozen small boats conveniently near to pick you up,) you grandiloquently mount a kitchen chair and dive into the water-butt, splash and splurge, cry ""Murder,"" &c., as set down in the programme, and finally crawl out and live to prove a seeming paradox -- that even GEORGE SANDERS can get lower and be meaner than he ever yet has been.

HALLECK has just sailed from New-York for California, taking with him, as we of the newspapers remark, a great deal of unpopularity. This is not surprising. He has never sought to ingratiate himself with any portion of the public. Despising all the arts which often make men popular favorites, and cherishing an overweening repugnance for fools and bores, he has always been indifferent alike to manifestations of favor or disfavor. This constitutional peculiarity has not been relieved by the brilliancy of military success, which would have left all else in forgetfulness. The only active campaign which he conducted, that of Corinth, though in no wise disastrous, and though the main point was gained in the possession of that important centre, was yet marked by such extreme caution, and proved so comparatively barren of results, that he never again sought to take the field. In his conduct of affairs as General-in-Chief in Washington, Gen. HALLECK did not satisfy the people, nor retain the entire confidence of Congress; and GRANT, who had triumphed at Vicksburgh and Chattanooga was accordingly called into end the war.

"Three years ago, Mr. MATTHEW MCCARTY emigrated from Dublin, leaving his wife and four little children in their native city, but expecting soon to send for them to join him here. The war had not, however, opened so many avenues to wealth as he had been led to suppose were open, and he found nothing more inviting than the army. He accordingly enlisted. He served faithfully and fought like a hero until, having received a bullet in the knee, he was sent back to this city with an honorable discharge; and having again come hither, he became once more a drop in the ocean of New-York life -- but distinguished above the mass of us by the thrice honored insignia of a soldier's cap and crutch. Meantime he had sent money to his family in Dublin, bidding them be of good cheer and look hopefully forward to the happy hour when he should bid them embark to meet him. But they, it seems, applied this money as he little thought they would. The mother had fallen into consumption, and felt that her course of life had nearly run. She had no relatives -- there was no refuge for her children, save the pauper's home; and she knew that if they could reach their father, whatever his lot might be, their future would be brighter than it could be in their native isle; she therefore husbanded the means which the father sent, until she had accumulated a sum sufficient to pay their passage to America, and then, committing them unto the Father of the fatherless, she bade them adieu forever. Of the transit of the Atlantic the children have a very confused idea.

BRACKETT's force -- took them to the Headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, and there entrusted them to the care of Mr. GEORGE WASHINGTON EWING, the Janitor, guardian of lost children.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/11/archives/the-remarkable-story-of-four-little-children-an-episode-at-police.html,,"Three years ago, Mr. MATTHEW MCCARTY emigrated from Dublin, leaving his wife and four little children in their native city, but expecting soon to send for them to join him here. The war had not, however, opened so many avenues to wealth as he had been led to suppose were open, and he found nothing more inviting than the army. He accordingly enlisted. He served faithfully and fought like a hero until, having received a bullet in the knee, he was sent back to this city with an honorable discharge; and having again come hither, he became once more a drop in the ocean of New-York life -- but distinguished above the mass of us by the thrice honored insignia of a soldier's cap and crutch. Meantime he had sent money to his family in Dublin, bidding them be of good cheer and look hopefully forward to the happy hour when he should bid them embark to meet him. But they, it seems, applied this money as he little thought they would. The mother had fallen into consumption, and felt that her course of life had nearly run. She had no relatives -- there was no refuge for her children, save the pauper's home; and she knew that if they could reach their father, whatever his lot might be, their future would be brighter than it could be in their native isle; she therefore husbanded the means which the father sent, until she had accumulated a sum sufficient to pay their passage to America, and then, committing them unto the Father of the fatherless, she bade them adieu forever. Of the transit of the Atlantic the children have a very confused idea. They only know that they landed in Montreal, friendless and alone; that some humane person, learning that their father was in New-York, had sent them hither; that at the Hudson River Railroad Depot they were quite as far from their father as though they had been in Ireland; and that, after they had wearied of waiting they knew not what for, and planning, without tangible base for any plan, a policeman -- unknown to them, but known to us as Officer HILLS, of Capt.

"AN ADROIT FEMALE THIEF -- SHE SAILS UNDER FALSE COLORS -- OVER $500 WORTH OF PROPERTY FOUND IN HER TRUNK. -- A few days since, Mr. G.W. THORN, a resident of South Bergen, wishing to obtain a servant girl, applied for one at the office of Mr. HENDERSON, in Nassau-street, New-York. Among those who were desirous of obtaining the situation was a prepossessing, modest-appearing young woman, who gave her name as SARAH HENRY, and stated that her parents resided in Williamsburgh. She presented a recommendation from Mrs. F.W. HODGKISS, of Elizabeth, (with whose husband Mr. THORN was acquainted,) in which it was stated that SARAH had resided in her family for fifteen months; that she was perfectly honest; was a Protestant, and had regularly attended the Episcopal Church. Upon this recommendation, Mr. THORN immediately engaged the girl, and upon returning home at night, congratulated his wife upon their good fortune. The following morning the girl came to her new place, bringing with her a trunk and bundle of clothing. On Wednesday last, SARAH complained of being too unwell to work, and left for home, saying that if she did not get better soon she would send for her trunk. On Thursday Mrs. THORN missed quite a number of articles of wearing apparel, when her suspicions fell upon the girl, and upon further examination, it was found that by means of false keys a number of trunks had been opened and the contents overhauled. The girl's trunk was then opened, when it was found packed full of stolen goods, consisting of lace curtains, costly female under-garments, linen sheets, towels, about thirty spools of thread, half a dozen pocket-knives, a valuable diamond ring, a costly breast-pin, a gold thimble and numerous other articles, in all valued at about $500. In the trunk was also found the property stolen from Mr. THORN. Mr. THORN then proceeded to New-York and called at the office of Mr. HODGKISS, who informed him that during the fifteen months SARAH had resided in his family, they had been constantly missing wearing apparel and other articles, and during that time half a dozen girls suspected of committing the robberies had been discharged from his employ, but they never for a moment suspected the real thief until the present developments. About 6 o'clock on Thursday evening SARAH returned to Mrs. THORN's house to get her trunk, when Mr. THORN caused her arrest. Yesterday the prisoner was taken before Justice BEDFORD, and after an examination was held, she was committed to the County Jail, to await trial at the October term of court.

It has been waged for over two centuries -- the Indian always defeated, yet never defeated. From all their vast hunting-grounds on the Atlantic seaboard, in the Valley of the Ohio, and in the Valley of the Mississippi, they have been driven, till now, in their last refuge on the great plains and under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, they find themselves confronted and surrounded by the old white enemy, and no possibility of further retreat. The Indians are at bay. They are bewildered; they are helpless. It is not in their nature to adopt the habits and follow the pursuits of the white man; and it is not in the nature or destiny of the white man to permit the Indian to follow his hereditary habitudes. Feuds and fights, cruelties and hatreds, wretchedness and despair, exile and extermination, constitute the present, as the past, history of the poor Indian, in presence of the white settler.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE INDIANS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE INDIANS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/24f7c05f-bb57-5a48-bf9c-e79babe5abfa,341,nyt://article/24f7c05f-bb57-5a48-bf9c-e79babe5abfa,

Singular Ceremonies,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/12/archives/local-intelligence-a-new-religion-singular-baptismal-ceremonies-at.html,Singular Ceremonies,"The grand baptismal excursion of the New Spiritual Baptist Church and Progressive Association, which was advertised in yesterday morning's papers, to proceed from the foot of Morton-street, North River, to the waters in the vicinity of Glen Cove, under the Auspices of Prof. EZRA NOYES WHEELER and his feminine coadjutor Mrs. ELIZABETH DRAPER, or as she is otherwise known, ""The Daughter of Zion,"" a very obese lady of over 250 pounds avordupoise, turned out to be a failure, if the financial result of the excursion is to be taken into consideration. On arriving at Glen Cove, it was the intention of Mrs. DRAPER to baptise the professor anew, in the waters in the vicinity, in order to fit him for the ministry whose garments he was about to assume. At the conclusion of the immersion, the ""Daughter of Zion"" was to break a cruet of sweet oil on the head of the professor, and with the singing of an appropriate hymn, the excursionists were to take the barge for their respective homes, happy in their new regeneration and religious belief. But as one of the excursionists expressed himself on the boat, ""no one knows what a day m y bring forth,"" and the day was agreeably diversified by a number of incidents ludicrous or otherwise, which certainly did not appear in the printed programme of the ceremonies. Our reporter reached the St. John which had been substituted for the W.H. Morton, as early as 8 o'clock yesterday morning, and on making inquiry of the officers of the boat, ascertained that none of the excursionists had as yet made their appearance. About 8:30, however, Prof. WHEELER, carrying the large black bags, and accompanied by half a dozen or more of the ""sisters"" of the new church, stepped on board of the boat. On looking around the promenade-deck and discovering such a paucity of excursionists, the worthy gentleman became disheartened and gloomy, but finally consoled himself with the thought, rather loudly expressed, that ""the Lord would make it all right in the end."" After a short delay, the boat started, with about twelve passengers, including the cook, and proceeded on its way to Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn, the second stopping-place, and about a dozen additional passengers got on board at this place; and the next landing was made at the foot of Broome-street, East River. Twenty or thirty persons, male and female, came on board there, and as the Professor was surety to the Captain for $155 charter money, the prospect for payment looked veryblank, and having proceeded a distance of half a mile or so up the East River, Capt. MYERS informed Prof. WHEELER that, unless he could raise a certain sum, he would be forced to land the passengers at the point from which they started. This intimation of the Captain's was received with blank faces and disapproving nods by the majority of the passengers, and the Professor made an ineffectual attempt, seconded by Mr. LAMBERT, FRANCIS J. TUCKER and a few others, to collect the necessary funds among the passengers, to ensure the Captain remuneration for his trouble and time. But alas! the whole amount collected (about seventy-five cents) did not suffice to pay for the tobacco used by the employes of the boat while on the trip. The boat then steamed down the river, and the passengers were landed at Morton-street, their original starting-place. Before the passengers left the boat for the deck, a few of the more irreverent made a proposition to Mrs. DRAPER, requesting her to perform the baptismal ceremony in a tub of water located in the hold of the steamer. The Professor declared that he had no objection, if the lady was willing to perform the ceremony, but to this request Mrs. DRAPER refused to accede, declaring that she wanted to get away from the ""sin floating around New-York;"" and some individual in the crowd then made the suggestion that the entire party proceed to Staten Island, where a purer atmosphere reigned. This idea was received with acclamation by all parties, and the excursionists took the cars for the Staten Island Ferry at the Battery. While in the ferry-house waiting for the boat, Mrs. DRAPER became entranced, and astonished the bystanders by a series of terrific yells, intermingled with incoherent sentences in the Spanish language, in the shape of an introduction to the ""Great Spirit,"" as she termed the Divinity. On the passage down to the island the ""Daughter of Zion"" got into an altercation with an excited Irish woman, who denounced Mrs. DRAPER in a rather harsh manner, as a ""devil"" and an ""imposter,"" who was endeavoring to lead souls astray. In the course of the argument Mrs. DRAPER happened to treat the name of the Virgin Mary in an irreverent manner, and it was with difficulty that the excited female Celt was kept from demolishing or tearing the ""Daughter of Zion"" to pieces. Having arrived at the lower landing the excursionists, after a walk in the hot sun, to a point selected for the ceremonies, nearly opposite Fort Lafayette, luncheon was spread, and every one present enjoyed themselves as far as possible, with the good things displayed on nature's carpet. The repast being concluded, the Professor and his spiritual spouse retired to a neighboring farm-house to disrobe, and shortly after reappeared in while linen garments, the lady having a pair of blue Roman sandals fastened on her feet. After a prayer by the Professor, the procession was formed; the Professor and Mrs. DRAPER at head of column, and the following hymn was slowly chanted as the pair entered the water:",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; A NEW RELIGION.

Here, in the brick-and-mortar prison of inflexible duty, we are able to rejoice in the great and undeserved blessings showered upon our land by an ever kind and merciful Providence. Shall we not humble our hearts in thankfulness to that Providence, when we remember that through all our long civil war the guiding love of Heaven has led us to prosperity and finally to peace? Our national history will not show another period of four years when harvest so justified hope, and gave such abundant cause for thanksgiving. And even now, when the soil to a great extent lies untilled, because of the exhaustive drain of war upon our working population, we find that the loss of breadth is more than made up in the weight of the crops. Here we are in the middle of August, and the earth blooms and grows with all the vigor of June. A harvest of hay absolutely immense has been gathered; the yield of wheat has been generous and even ample, so much so that the annual croak about rust and weevil has fallen upon unheeding ears; oats and other early grains have fulfilled all reasonable expectation; and now corn, the golden-crowned King of the Continent, is striding on in this hot weather with a vigor that promises the most satisfactory results.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Blessed Harvest The Provocation to General Thanksgiving.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Blessed Harvest The Provocation to General Thanksgiving.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3528f7c5-1660-5b0d-b1f6-3cea7e5ea808,787,nyt://article/3528f7c5-1660-5b0d-b1f6-3cea7e5ea808,

But there has not been -- and it is not natural there should yet be -- any important emigration of actual and permanent settlers, such as farmers, mechanics, artisans, young merchants, and so forth. These classes will begin to penetrate the Southern States from the North in the coming Autumn months. They will look around for lands, make inquiries as to employment, and see what are the opportunities for business. They will study questions of climate, production, soil, trade, commerce and industry. They will make up their minds as to their chances. If found favorable, they will communicate with friends and acquaintances in the North; and next Spring, the border States of the South, such as Tennessee and the two Virginias, and the cities of the seaboard, will see the real beginning of a genuine tide of emigration that will yet sweep over their entire surface, carrying enterprise, industry, capital, education, prosperity and wealth.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EMIGRATION TO THE SOUTH,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73e9c490-b860-5a56-bf11-b8a312a82e52,199,nyt://article/73e9c490-b860-5a56-bf11-b8a312a82e52,

As a sporadic instance of ruffianism, perhaps it may not be worthy of further attention. Similar outrages occur daily; they are chiefly the fruits of idleness and indulgence in rum. But this case is peculiar -- it is of a representative character -- it is one of a large family of similar tenor that will speedily follow unless prompt reprobation shall discourage the actors. The extraordinary spectacle of a jury undertaking to investigate a homicide that was confessedly the result of premeditated riot; a jury quietly listening to the important confessions of scamps who boasted of their participation and of their joining in a deliberate organization to do this very outrage -- a jury thus brow-beaten and quietly submitting to the scourging, is a spectacle that excels its infamy only in its cowardice. With the hesitation and bated breath of men who were performing an unpleasant duty, these craven jurymen managed to -- what? Did they promptly order the arrest of the men who had, by their own confession, undertaken murder? No; they saw nothing to punish, nothing to censure even, in the jolly little freak of trying to separate man and wife by hanging, shooting or stoning to death the two persons whose offence consisted in simple and respectful obedience to the laws of the State. No; those solid men of Connecticut -- grave citizens of a State most oracular in her assumption of superior virtue -- had no word of reproach for the mob, no good advice for the villains who adorned their court-room, but were with difficulty enabled to repress direct approbation of this ruffianism. We are glad to find one little thing to their credit -- they did not theoretically (although they did practically) ignore the law; they mustered sufficient courage to justify the attacked man, and say that the law held him guiltless. But still no censure of the ruffians; on the contrary, the considerate jury volunteered a little, good advice, or rather warning, to that or any future gang who might undertake to mob peaceable citizens; they (the jury,) assured these mobbing gentlemen that whenever they indulged in their delicate pastimes, they must expect to run dangerous risks; that they might get hurt, perhaps shot, might be killed, and still the absurd laws of Connecticut would hold the shooter guiltless -- and the very excellent Accident Assurance Company of that blessed State would peremptorily refuse to take risks in any such venture.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Irrepressible Conflict.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Irrepressible Conflict.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'GREENWICH, CONN.', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/82e6ccf3-48a7-58e5-97ce-ffd94fad5fb1,1633,nyt://article/82e6ccf3-48a7-58e5-97ce-ffd94fad5fb1,

FLETCHER, HARRISON & CO., embarked on board the new propeller Nahpa, plying between this city and Hudson, to see the practical workings of a new direct-acting beam-engine, with the Stevens cutoff and the ordinary puppet-valve gear, which in principle is the same as has been in use for some time, but quite different in form. A few minutes after 5 o'clock the steamer left her dock at the foot of Harrison-street, and started up the river under a pressure of about twenty-five pounds of steam, the engine working up from fifty-five to sixty-eight revolutions per minute, and in beautiful style. As the steam ran up the revolutions were increased, and at one time reached the remarkable speed of seventy-one turns per minute. It has always been supposed that no beam-engine could use the puppet-valve at a speed to exceed thirty-three revolutions per minute with any degree of certainty or safety, and where beam-engines have been applied to screw propulsion it has always been in connection with gearing. By this new method economy of space, weight and cost of engine are largely gained, so that the introduction of this new system, as fully demonstrated in this trial, promises to work a great change in steam-engines of this class. The ease, rapidity and certainty with which the valves worked on this occasion gave much satisfaction to all the spectators, among whom we may mention such names as those of C.H. Delemater, Erastus W. Smith, Robert Robinson, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Pollock, Hopper, Douglass, and others well known in engineer circles.

We have not only not sought to mingle politics with this business, but have carefully avoided the slightest allusion to parties. Somebody sends us a certificate about BUTTON, to show that he is a decided Republican. We accept the statement -- there are consummate fools in all parties; the Republicans need not expect exemption.

The number of employes at the arsenal has been reduced from 1,500 to 400. During the war, there were employed 500 boys and girls some of whom earned excellent wages. The girls were employed in making cartridge papers, and the boys in scraping and greasing bullets, and pinching cartridges. There has been a reduction of wages within the last few weeks, and a number of returned soldiers who had been wounded in war have been given employment.

"-- The hop crop will be a failure. From the adjoining counties we have had frequent reports that the hops looked badly, but until within a fortnight the yield promised fair in this county. Within that time the yards have become infested with lice, and these injurious parasites are playing havoc among the vines throughout the whole section. Fine, green looking yards have, within eight days, become faded and blighted by the pests, the growth looking at a distance as if it had been scortched by fire. The hop is now just breaking from the burr and the lice taking advantage of this creep from the vines into the hop and soon destroy it. It is hoped that copious showers may perhaps reduce the number or arrest the increase of the insect, but upon this little dependence can be placed. We have heard of one case where a gentleman offers his crop for $200, whose yield last year, from the same area amounted to $2,000. Some of the hop growers are trying smoking their yards with tobacco, with what success, however, we have not learned.

STONE., Collector of Internal Revenue for the Columbus (Ohio) District, and one of the proprietors of the Ohio State Journal, died on August 2. The day before his death he went into the cemetery where his children were buried, and in the evening was found asleep on the graves of one of them. Mr. STONE was born in Hampshire County, Mass., in 1813, and was consequently, at the time of his death, about 52 years of age. He leaves a widow and four children to mourn the loss of a husband and father. Mr. STONE has been, for over thirty years, an active and enterprising merchant and business man of Columbus. Besides the office he held at the time of his death, he occupied several other important public positions. In the Fall of 1844, he was elected a Representative to Congress, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Hon. HEMAN A. MOORE, which took place the preceding Spring. Gov. CHASE, in the Summer of 1857, appointed Mr. STONE, Treasurer of State, to fill out the remainder of the term of W.H. GIBSON, who, after the discovery of his defalcation, had resigned.

"Recently, Capt. HEDDEN and Sergt. WEBB, of the Sixteenth Ward, learned that one HENRY THOMPSON, or ANDREW WISEMAN, of whom they had heard as an old counterfeiter of twenty years' experience, here and elsewhere, was engaged in the manufacture of spurious fractional notes in this city, and they concocted a scheme to capture both him and his gang. The story of this scheme is as follows: Sergt. WEBB, assuming the garb of a drover, and the name of George H. Cooper, took lodgings at the Tontine Hotel, on the southwest corner of Broadway and Howard-street, and thence addressed a note to WISEMAN, at No. 126 Forsyth-street stating that he had heard that spurious bank notes were sold by WISEMAN, professing that he desired to purchase a quantity for use in making his purchases in the West, and begging WISEMAN to visit him at the Tontine, and exhibit samples. This letter was mailed early last week. The Sergeant did not expect WISEMAN to bite instantly, but presumed that he would send a confederate or subordinate to take observations in and around the Tontine; so, therefore, he strove to act well his part as an inexperienced drover, and so well did he sustain the character that he had the gratification of being frequently cautioned by the policemen of the Eighth Ward, and informed by them that if he was not more careful some of the Broadway statues that lounge in the neighborhood of Howard-street would yet pick his pockets. The ruse succeeded, and at length, by representing to WISEMAN that pressing business would force him to depart for the West yesterday, he succeeded in arranging for an interview on Friday morning, and at 10 o'clock WISEMAN went to the hotel accompanied by one FRANK BAKER, who gave his occupation as a gambler. No sooner, however, had they entered the Sergeant's room than several officers pounced upon them. WISEMAN and WEBB ran for the same window to leap thence, but the latter manoeuvred his retreat so dexterously as to cut off that of the would-be fugitive. Thus the two men, WISEMAN and BAKER, were secured; but in order to play out their parts, WEBB and his two friends were also handcuffed, and taken in irons to the Twentieth-street Police Station. On the way thither, and while in the omnibus, Mrs. JOHN WOOD, who is personally acquainted with WEBB, entered the stage, and seeing the peculiar position of that gentleman, looked rather amazed, but caught a wink and said nothing.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/13/archives/sergt-webb-goes-among-the-counterfeiters-and-gets-into-a-cell-what.html,,"Recently, Capt.

Entomological Society of Philadelphia,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/13/archives/entomology.html,Entomological Society of Philadelphia,"-- The Entomological Society of Philadelphia have issued a circular as to the management of that institution heretofore, and the funds now required to place it on a substantial and permanent basis. It appears that the lamented Dr. THOS. B. WILSON, late President of the Academy of Natural Sciences, had given $5,000 to the general fund of the Entomological Society, and $5,000 more in trust toward the publication of its reports. These papers have been issued with the utmost economy -- the members of the publication committee themselves performing without charge most of the labor of composition and press-work. The Society is located in a two-story building, erected for and devoted to its purposes and uses, at No. 518 South Thirteenth-street. Philadelphia. The library, now including over 1,500 volumes on entomology, and a cabinet of over 50,000 specimens of insects, is well provided for in works on entomological subjects; ""and here again the active interest and great liberality of the late Dr. WILSON is particularly observable, for it is to his assistance that its completeness -- making it second to none in the United States in the number of valuable works on our particular department of science -- is owing.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ENTOMOLOGY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ENTOMOLOGY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5e493bd2-fbc8-564f-9d82-8179ebcce4e3,289,nyt://article/5e493bd2-fbc8-564f-9d82-8179ebcce4e3,

Barbarities and Justice to Perpetrators,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/13/archives/crimes-against-civilization.html,Barbarities and Justice to Perpetrators,"The movements initiated, and likely to be initiated, for visiting justice upon the men who, in their mad insurrection against the Government, violated all the rules of civilized war, have greatly disturbed certain journalists and public men. Incredulous, during the war, as to whether the reported outrages really occurred, they are now forced both to admit the facts and their heinousness. But they plead for mercy on behalf of their whilom proteges, in style fit ""to draw iron tears down Pluto's cheek,"" asking a general amnesty for all offences, as the course most worthy the magnanimity of a great people. We believe in national magnanimity, but we believe also in justice. The world, astonished by a display of clemency toward the Southern rebels to which history will be ransacked in vain for a parallel, has already paid its reluctant tribute to the matchless magnanimity of the American people. The only fear lies in the contrary direction, -- lest lavish generosity shall eclipse wholesome justice. We have friendly feelings toward the insurgents to cultivate; but so have we duties to perform toward posterity, duties which demand such an example to be made of crime as will be a terror to evil-doers and a safeguard to the nation, through unborn centuries. Nor shall the cries of those gallant soldier-lads who died for the country, in tortures which only savage nations could have inflicted, fall on deaf ears. It is not the offences against the law of the land that most demand our care. Justice is likely to overtake such offences. President JOHNSON has declared that ""treason is a crime, and must be punished."" And the great crime of treason will accordingly be fittingly expiated, doubtless, by representative traitors. But it is the offences against the laws not only of the land, but of all civilized war, of humanity, and of God, which chiefly must be reviewed and punished. These form a catalogue so long and so appalling in their atrocity that humanity will shudder to believe them possible.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Crimes against Civilization.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Crimes against Civilization.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7bbd93c5-fa1a-5e83-b2bd-3af3e85890b5,865,nyt://article/7bbd93c5-fa1a-5e83-b2bd-3af3e85890b5,

England is no longer mistress of the seas, say these wiseacres, her still youthful progeny is outstripping her; and it is considered sufficient to point to the thousands of vessels in our late navy, and the amount of work so well done by them in blockading our long coast, to establish any assertion that may be made. But let us look at the truth. It is well to have a good opinion of ourselves, but in a close rivalry it is not well to have too poor an opinion of our antagonists. We propose now to glance at the provisions England and France, the only Powers that can pretend to rival us, have made for building and maintaining a navy, and to compare them with our own.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE WANT OF OUR NAVY.; The Dock-yards of England and France Compared with the Navy-yards of America.

"On the 30th of July, a man named LESTER was arrested by one of the police of Jersey City, on a charge of drunkenness.

If these points are fairly settled -- settled to the satisfaction of the intelligent rate-payer -- half of the actual burden is relieved at once. On this subject HALLAM says: ""It is difficult to name a limit beyond which taxes will not be borne without impatience, when they appear to be called for by necessity, and faithfully applied; nor is it impracticable for a skillful minister to deceive the people in both these respects. But the sting of taxation is wastefulness. What high-spirited man could see, without indignation, the earnings of his labor, yielded ungrudgingly to the public defence, become the spoil of parasites and speculators? It is this that mortifies the liberal hand of public spirit; and those statesmen who deem the security of government to depend not on laws and armies, but on the moral sympathies and prejudices of the people, will vigilantly guard against even the suspicion of prodigality.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'How the People Bear Taxation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'How the People Bear Taxation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Taxation', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d8e521f4-0860-52d2-a04f-c4193fecc2f7,184,nyt://article/d8e521f4-0860-52d2-a04f-c4193fecc2f7,
"THE POLICE COURTS. -- The Police Courts were tedious yesterday, affording but one case of special interest and this we withhold for the present, in compliance with the request of Inspector DILKS. At the Tombs, PAUL KAYSER, of No. 528 Pearl-street appeared before Justice HOGAN, and complained that JOHN MEYERS, of Philadelphia, having taken lodgings with him at No. 15 Bowery, left on Saturday morning with $200 of his money, which he had concealed under his pillow before sleeping, MEYERS was apprehended by Policeman FOLLIS, of the Cedar-street Police Station, and committed in default of $1,000 bail. ....Officer LUCAS, of the Fourteenth Ward, arrested JOHN WELSH while in the act of stealing $200 worth of wearing apparel from Mr. JAMES MC LARNEY's dwelling, at No. 24 Spring-street. Justice HOGAN committed the prisoner for trial.... WILLIAM ROBINSON, of Deposit, Delaware County, N.Y., was taken into custody, yesterday, by patrolman GEARY of the Third Ward, and Mr. MICHAEL MILLMORE, of No. 224 West Forty-first-street appeared before Justice HOGAN and made affidavit that RUBINLON and another person entered his store to purchase three pieces of silk, and that ROBINSON's companion took the silk out under pretence of exhibiting it to his wife, but did not return. Whereupon the deponent caused the arrest of ROBINSON. Justice HOGAN committed the accused in default of $500 bail to answer at the Court of General Sessions....At Jefferson Market, Mr. MOORE, a contractor for street-cleaning in the Eighteenth Ward, appeared before Justice LEDWITH and preferred a charge against THOMAS FITZSIMMONS, a laborer. It appears that FITZSIMMONS applied to Mr. MOORE for work, and on being informed that there was no vacancy, threatened Mr. MOORE, saving that if he did not find employment for him (FITZSIMMONS) he had better move out of the Twelfth Ward, where he dwells. The accused told Justice LEDWITH that be made the threat as a joke, but the Justice failed to see the point of the joke.

At the Tombs, PAUL KAYSER, of No. 528 Pearl-street appeared before Justice HOGAN, and complained that JOHN MEYERS, of Philadelphia, having taken lodgings with him at No. 15 Bowery, left on Saturday morning with $200 of his money, which he had concealed under his pillow before sleeping, MEYERS was apprehended by Policeman FOLLIS, of the Cedar-street Police Station, and committed in default of $1,000 bail. ....Officer LUCAS, of the Fourteenth Ward, arrested JOHN WELSH while in the act of stealing $200 worth of wearing apparel from Mr. JAMES MC LARNEY's dwelling, at No. 24 Spring-street. Justice HOGAN committed the prisoner for trial.... WILLIAM ROBINSON, of Deposit, Delaware County, N.Y., was taken into custody, yesterday, by patrolman GEARY of the Third Ward, and Mr. MICHAEL MILLMORE, of No. 224 West Forty-first-street appeared before Justice HOGAN and made affidavit that RUBINLON and another person entered his store to purchase three pieces of silk, and that ROBINSON's companion took the silk out under pretence of exhibiting it to his wife, but did not return. Whereupon the deponent caused the arrest of ROBINSON. Justice HOGAN committed the accused in default of $500 bail to answer at the Court of General Sessions....At Jefferson Market, Mr. MOORE, a contractor for street-cleaning in the Eighteenth Ward, appeared before Justice LEDWITH and preferred a charge against THOMAS FITZSIMMONS, a laborer. It appears that FITZSIMMONS applied to Mr. MOORE for work, and on being informed that there was no vacancy, threatened Mr. MOORE, saving that if he did not find employment for him (FITZSIMMONS) he had better move out of the Twelfth Ward, where he dwells.

The body was eventually found on the rocks of the Riffelhorn, a rugged,dangerously slippery hill of serpentine rock, only a short distance from the Riffel Hotel. Mr. WILSON had mounted this rock with some of his friends in the morning, taking the proper precautions of having guides and a rope with them. He must, in the absence of his companions, have climbed up it again in the evening without rope or guide, lost his hold in coming down, and fallen backwards on his head.

House-building in New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/14/archives/house-building-in-newyork.html,House-building in New-York,"We are glad to learn that the business of house building in this city has fairly begun, and is assuming considerable dimensions. Stores down town, residences up town, and houses in the suburban localities, are being erected with something like ante-war activity. Judging by present appearances, and by what is now going on, we should think that all of the old inhabitants of Church-street will get rooted out this year, and in place of the houses which have so long disgraced the locality, it will be lined from end to end with such immense wholesale warehouses as now are found in its lower part. Beside the residences being built in the upper part of town, houses have been going up in Jersey City, Hudson City, and many of the other towns on the East and North Rivers. As a consequence of this, and partly from another cause, it is not now so absolutely hopeless to find a place of shelter in the city as it has been for the last year or two. There are now such things as advertisements of houses to let, some of them, too, at reasonable prices, and many of the house agents can show quite respectable lists of vacant houses of one sort or another. The other cause, to which we referred above, is the fact that within the last two months part of the great body of Southerners, who have made New-York City their residence during the war, have now returned to their own homes in their own States. Tens of thousands from the border and other States found here safety, quiet and every sort of social enjoyment, while the localities to which they belonged were ravaged and harassed by war; and the ruin that overtook the cities of the Southern seaboard sent to this metropolis tens of thousands more. Latterly these have been flocking back to such. States as Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky, and to such cities as New-Orleans. Mobile, Savannah and Norfolk, and, in fact, to all the cities and States of the South. We rejoice to see New-York populous, prosperous and cosmopolitan; but it was impossible to urge people to stay among us with such crushing rents as have lately been ruling.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'House Building in New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'House Building in New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3e6ddee6-e555-5981-9e8b-fbd329331721,371,nyt://article/3e6ddee6-e555-5981-9e8b-fbd329331721,

SHERMAN's wonderful march, more complete and enduring than that furnished by the newspapers. The enterprise of Messrs. HARPERS has placed them first in the field, and they offer in the present work the true history of an achievement destined to occupy the pens of historians and military tacticians long after this generation has passed away. The advantages of Major NICHOLS' position were great, and he has made the best use of them in this spirit-stirring narrative. His personal connection with Gen. SHERMAN commenced at the fall of Atlanta, and he served on the staff of the commanding officer for the entire succeeding campaign, which terminated so decidedly and gloriously for the national armies. The work naturally falls into three divisions: I. The March to the Sea; II. The Campaign of the Carolinas; III. The Surrender and the End. The materials from whence it is drawn are the daily journals of the author, noted down at the time -- whatever might be the circumstances of the command -- and consequently preserving the freshness of first impressions of the scenes that passed in ever-shifting panorama -- serious, tragic, or comical -- before the eyes of the army. Even on another continent the sights that greeted the advancing heroes could hardly be more strange than those presented by the new country, the astonished population -- suddenly exposed to the shock of novel influences -- and all the circumstances connected with the unexpected blow at the vitals of the Confederacy, the effects of which were seen at once to be fatal to its pretensions. While the great qualities of the commander claim the highest acknowledgment, his penetrating glance that at once pierced the weak spot of the enemy, and the quick, comprehensive mind, fertile in combinations and expedients to take advantage of it -- the meed of praise must be shared with his army, a body of men that deserved such a General as they have been favored with, to lead them. The campaign, as a whole, stands alone in history, and was conceived and executed more in the spirit of an antique Roman than that of a modern commander, and its happy results were commensurate with the heroism of the attempt. Maj. NICHOLS' book is illustrated with an excellent military map, showing, at a glance, the route and disposition of each army corps that made up the great moving column. The wood-cut illustrations give some amusing inside views of Southern peculiarities and institutions. An appendix superadds to the personal narrative what may be called the Documentary History of the Campaign, including the official returns and reports of the Commanding Officer, Engineer, Commissary, Quartermaster, &c. To insure the sale of this work a brief account of its contents is all that is necessary, or we are very much mistaken in our idea of the tastes and tendencies of the American people.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEW BOOKS.; THE STORY OF THE GREAT MARCH: DIARY OF GEN.

It commenced a mile east of Notre Dame College, and swept through the centre of the town, and to a distance of ten miles. Roofs and chimnies of many substantial structures were struck off, and many frame building ruined. Trees and shrubbery were torn up by the roots. The Court-house, a large brick building, was unroofed. One of the churches was also unroofed. Several large brick buildings in course of erection in the business part of the town were leveled to the ground. Hundreds of residences shared in the general damage.

Their action, in the first steps, has, in every case, been discreet, temperate and conservative. They have adopted the wise policy of interfering as little as possible with those things which enter into the character, history and institutions of each State, which were established in other times and are adapted to existing conditions. In one direction they must build anew, and radically, but in others they find the result of much valuable work, which only requires to be let alone. Belonging to the States which they have been appointed to temporarily govern, these Provisional Governors have entered upon their duties with a knowledge of the people and of the local laws and necessities which is of the highest advantage to them, and the fruits of which have already appeared in their measures and messages. While unequivocally loyal in every action and word, they do not unnecessarily stir up popular prejudices, or bear about the mien of conquerors.

"Recently, Capt. HEDDEN and Sergt. WEBB, of the Sixteenth Ward, learned that one HENRY THOMBSON, or ANDREW WISEMAN, of whom they had heard as an old counterfeiter of twenty years' experience, here and elsewhere, was engaged in the manufacture of spurious fractional notes in this city, and they concocted a scheme to capture both him and his gang. The story of this scheme is as follows: Sergt. WEBB, assuming the garb of a drover, and the name of George H. Cooper, took lodgings at the Tontine Hotel, on the southwest corner of Broadway and Howard-street, and thence addressed a note to WISEMAN, at No. 126 Forsyth-street, stating that he had heard that spurious bank notes were sold by WISEMAN, professing that he desired to purchase a quantity for use in making his purchases in the West, and begging WISEMAN to visit him at the Tontine, and exhibit samples. This letter was mailed early last week. The Sergeant did not expect WISEMAN to bite instantly, but presumed that he would send a confederate or subordinate to take observations in and around the Tontine; so, therefore, he strove to act well his part as an inexperienced drover, and so well did he sustain the character that he had the gratification of being frequently cautioned by the policemen of the Eighth Ward, and informed by them that if he was not more careful some of the Broadway statues that lounge in the neighborhood of Howard-street, would yet pick his pockets. The ruse succeeded, and at length, by representing to WISEMAN that pressing business would force him to depart for the West, Saturday, he succeeded in arranging for an interview on Friday morning, and at 10 o'clock WISEMAN went to the hotel accompanied by one FRANK BAKER, who gave his occupation as a gambler. No sooner, however, had they entered the Sergeant's room than several officers pounced upon them. WISEMAN and WEBB ran for the same window to leap thence, but the latter manoeuvred his retreat so dexterously as to cut off that of the would-be fugitive. Thus the two men, WISEMAN and BAKER, were secured; but in order to play out their parts, WEBB and his two friends were also handcuffed, and taken in irons to the Twentieth-street Police Station.

That system now hardly deserves the name. From one end to the other it is full of unjust inequalities and absurd anomalies. It is a piece of incongruous patchwork made up at different times, in Congress, without the light of experience, and for the most part by mere novices, and rendered all the worse by the multifarious and often-times fantastic decisions of the various commissioners of internal revenue. Perhaps it is as good as could reasonably be expected in a period of war, when the actual necessities of the government, present and prospective, were entirely uncertain, and the great concern was how to keep the armies in an effective condition from day to-day.

Dr. Burroughs' Letter,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/15/archives/protection-to-witnesses-in-courts-the-harris-farce-once-more.html,Dr. Burroughs' Letter,"The eminent Christian scholar and divine, Rev. Dr. BURROUGHS, of Chicago, has written to the Christian Times a statement of the trial of MARY HARRIS, for the murder of his brother, in Washington, in which he alludes with feeling, but without acerbity of language, to the treatment he received from the opposing counsel while on the witness stand. He remarks: ""For me, to sit in a crowded court-room and hear myself assailed by men like VOORHEES and HUGHES, with such epithets as 'hound,' 'perjured wretch,' 'doomed to eternal infamy,' and the like, is not the most pleasant amusement; but worse things might be."" The honorable instincts of Dr. BURROUGHS have forbidden him from quoting the most of the foul language which was applied to him by the two Western pettifoggers whom he names on the occasion referred to. It was more disgraceful than anything we remember before an American court, although it was quite in keeping with the other parts of the ridiculous burlesque upon law which Judge WYLIE permitted to be enacted in his presence, and which has cast lasting disgrace upon an American Court of Justice. It was assuredly bad enough, and shocking enough, however, that a pious, upright, devoted, learned, honored clergyman, against whom no charge was pending in the court, and who appeared simply as a witness to the truth and in behalf of public justice, should be vulgarly roared at as a ""hound,"" ""perjurer,"" ""wretch,"" and even worse, merely because the lawyers on the other side thought they could thus inflame the passions of the jury and prejudice the course of the law.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Protection to Witnesses in Courts The Harris Farce Once More.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Protection to Witnesses in Courts The Harris Farce Once More.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/04000895-b392-5a17-87e7-599b6023615e,396,nyt://article/04000895-b392-5a17-87e7-599b6023615e,

The real cause of the resignation, as narrated in well-informed circles at the capital, is that Mr. HARLAN, Secretary of the Interior, (of whose department the Patent Office is a bureau,) insists upon appointing the subordinates of Mr. HOLLOWAY in his bureau. To this Mr. HOLLOWAY objected when he found his most efficient officers were about to be dismissed; and upon the Secretary's persistence, the Commissioner of Patents tendered his resignation. This the President refused to receive; but Mr. HOLLOWAY thought that justice to himself would only permit his retention of office upon the condition he originally set forth. So, after remaining in place some weeks at the President's request, he has again offered his resignation, which being peremptory, it is understood will now be accepted. It may not be generally known that prior to entering upon political life, Secretary HARLAN was a Methodist clergyman, and he is very rigid in his requirements.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Commissioner of Patents.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Commissioner of Patents.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5c982061-7ddd-5f4a-ae33-7cdcaf79efec,171,nyt://article/5c982061-7ddd-5f4a-ae33-7cdcaf79efec,

The latter was directed by MURGO to take the establishment to the stable.

COLLEY, in Willow-street, Hoboken, disappeared from her home, and although inquiries were made in every direction, no tidings of her whereabouts could be obtained until about 8 o'clock on Sunday evening. Mr. COOLEY, who was recently a captain on one of the Southern steamers, arrived home on Sunday, and learning of the unaccountable absence of his sister-in-law, left home about 8 o'clock for the purpose of making further inquiry for her in New-York. Upon arriving at the ferry-house, foot of Barclay-street, Mr. COOLEY met the girl on the bridge, and in reply to his inquiry as to where she had been, she replied that she had been staying with her sister in Brooklyn, which statement he knew to be untrue, as a messenger had been sent there on Friday. He said nothing further upon the subject, and the two returned home. While crossing the river to Hoboken, ELLEN held her handkerchief to her mouth and Mr. C. observed her make a motion as if in the act of throwing something out of the window, and heard a splash in the water. The family spent the evening together, during which ELLEN informed a younger sister that she had taken some laudnum, with the view of poisoning herself, which fact was communicated to Mrs. COOLEY, but she and her husband supposed the statement was a fabrication. The inmates of the house subsequently retired, but about 1 o'clock yesterday morning Mrs. C., feeling apprehensive that her sister might have swallowed poison, proceeded to her apartment and found her sleeping soundly, and apparently not under the influence of any drug. Mrs. C. again visited the girl's room about 5 o'clock yesterday morning, and found her lying asleep in the same position that she had left her, and, feeling somewhat alarmed, had Dr. CHABERT called in. Upon examination the Dr. stated that she was under the effects of laudnum, and was past recovery.

Jenkins' Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/15/archives/pleas-for-crime.html,Jenkins' Case,"-- There is frightful immorality in the plea of palliation which has been put forward in behalf of the Phoenix Bank defaulter -- and which has even found newspaper advocates -- to the effect that JENKINS was in some measure excusable for his plunderings because his salary was not large enough. It is said, or at least insinuated, that, as a man who gets but $1,500 a year cannot live in style, he is morally excusable in surreptitiously appropriating the balance he needs from the strong box of those who employ and underpay him. It indicates the looseness of commercial morals that prevails in certain quarters, when we find a long article in the financial columns of a journal published in a great business community like New-York, declaring that the ""Mercantile Bank, the Phoenix Bank, and other similar affairs which have been hushed up within the last two years, are the legitimate fruits of a system which compels men to work for a less sum than is required to keep them comfortably in the social position which they occupy;"" and asking such questions as this: ""Is it wonderful that some of these clerks are tempted to be dishonest, troubled as they are to keep soul and body together in these paper-money times, from inadequate paper-money salaries, paid to them by bank managers who are heaping up riches for their banks and themselves from the use of the bank's gold and funds in huge speculation?""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PLEAS FOR CRIME.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PLEAS FOR CRIME.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abaa9bf2-4f3f-5f48-bf45-1d0b87d529c8,358,nyt://article/abaa9bf2-4f3f-5f48-bf45-1d0b87d529c8,

True, the presence of a force of police, numbering 125 officers and men, had its preventive influence; but apart from that, the crowd was an American ball player's crowd in its love of order and decerum, and not the least display of rowdyism which has characterized some of the assemblages on other occasions -- such, for instance, at the Poughkeepsie boat race, -- marked this interesting event.

Railroad Cars; Wonderful Invention,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/15/archives/eureka.html,Railroad Cars; Wonderful Invention,"That stout, leather-headed old fellow, John Bull, has at last found out how to permit railway passengers to communicate with the guard. Thus it is: Place in each car or apartment a small clock-like glass face. Now, if a passenger wants to ask the guard for a chew of tobacco, all he has to do is to ram his (the passenger's) fist through the glass, grab a small handle which he will find there, give it a smart twist, and that sets free a current of electricity, and the lightning strikes the guard's bell, and then the bell rings, and the guard walks along the train, pops his head into each one of the sixty or seventy compartments and asks, ""Vot's hup?"" Before the train reaches the next station, if it is not too near, he has the pleasure of offering his paper of Solace to the tobacco-lacking, glass-clock-face-smashing passenger. But, indeed, this invention surpasses in asinine folly anything on record, not even excepting the doings of the Wise Men of Gotham. Here goes an express train, running forty miles an hour; an axle breaks, and in ten seconds half the train is in ruins, and a hundred passengers are killed.

The faith of some of our countrymen in the ""divine institution"" is so profound, that they are unwilling to live in a land where it is not established. Such devotion is certainly calculated to excite admiration; it is a rare thing in the history of the human race. But we advise them before forsaking their native land for Brazil, to make a contract with fate that negro slavery shall be eternal in that empire. For if, after getting there, they find an agitation for its abolition, and if before they are well settled down, they should find that it is actually in process of extinction, where, oh! where will they then move to?

We are assured the charge is utterly groundless. The Collector of that port certifies that, so far from there being any ""excitement,"" as alleged, he never, either officially or otherwise, even heard of it; and to the same effect certify the Consuls. The Collector further certifies that he believes the libelous report to be the criminal work of a secret enemy of the official charged. The Minister resides in Caraccas, nearly 100 miles from Puerto Cabello, and we are assured on the very highest authority that he never introduced, or attempted to produce, an article into that port, either contraband or free; and that the first he ever heard of the ""great excitement"" spoken of was when he saw it in the New-York papers. He has no doubt as to the author of the letter, or the motives that dictated it. He is known to be a bitter secession sympathizer, an enemy of the Minister, and of the government he represents.

Prisoners Furnished with Communication with Friends,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/16/archives/a-suggestion-promptly-complied-with.html,Prisoners Furnished with Communication with Friends,"Some weeks since we alluded to a very distressing case that had occurred at the Tombs. A poor woman, leaving her fire children at home -- one of the little ones being a nursing babe -- went to a neighboring grocery to make some purchases. The proprietor of the store suspected her of a design to steal his cabbages, and caused her arrest on suspicion. A ready policeman escorted the protesting prisoner to the Police Court, and the Justice, on complaint of the groceryman, committed her to the Tombs for trial at the Court of Special Sessions. Three days elapse before the case is reached on the crowded calendar of the court; and, meanwhile, the wretched woman finds herself entirely cut off from communication with her friends. True, the prison rules permit her to employ a messenger, authorized to run errands for persons in her case; but alas! she has not the wherewithal to make his feet move nimbly, and, perforce, must mope, disheartened, in her cell, awaiting the ""law's delay,"" under the dread consciousness that her husband and children are ignorant of her misfortune, and in painful anxiety concerning her disappearance. This story was told to us as an instance of the hardships which oftentimes were endured by prisoners, both innocent and guilty. We at once invoked the Commissioners of Charities and Correction to devise means for redressing this cruel wrong, and prompt heed was given to our request. The outrage was scarcely known ere the relief was applied. For three weeks past a printed notice has been posted in each cell of the City Prison, to the effect that any inmate who may desire to communicate with family or friends, will be supplied by the keepers with paper, pencil, envelope and postage stamp. It is a great satisfaction thus to chronicle the success of a plea made on behalf of the outcast and unfortunate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Suggestion Promptly Complied With.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Suggestion Promptly Complied With.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2770c5d7-4045-5882-84a4-f887acd89e94,316,nyt://article/2770c5d7-4045-5882-84a4-f887acd89e94,

"Hoboken; Owens, Ellen; Investigation",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/16/archives/the-suicide-of-a-young-girl-by-poison-in-hoboken-a-mysterious-case.html,"Hoboken; Owens, Ellen; Investigation","The inquest on the body of the young girl, ELLEN OWENS, who died early Monday morning at the residence of her sister, Mrs. F. COOLEY, at No. 813 Willow-street, Hoboken, from the effects of poison, took place yesterday afternoon at Oddfellows Hall, before Coroner AVERY and a jury. It appears that on Thursday noon last Mrs. COOLEY sent the deceased on an errand to New-York, and requested her to return home by 4 o'clock that afternoon. It appears that the girl ELLEN proceeded to the ferry, where she met an acquaintance of hers named ANNA MYER. The latter, at the request of ELLEN, introduced her to one of the deck-hands on the ferry, whom she stated she was crazy to get acquainted with. They crossed the ferry back and forth three or four times, and, landing on the New-York side, proceeded to the residence of ANNA MYER's sister, in Greenwich-street, where they remained until about 5 P.M., when they again went on board the ferry-boat to chat with the two deck-hands, and, after crossing the river several times, the girls took a stroll up to the Elysian Fields; remaining there until between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, and again going on board the ferry-boat, crossed the river a number of times; then left, and walked up Sixth-avenue, over into Broadway and into Fifteenth-street, between Eighth and Ninth avenues. At this time it was very late, and ELLEN complaining of feeling very unwell, the two sat down upon the front steps of a house, when ANNA MYER urged her to go in, stating that she was acquainted with the woman who resided there. ELLEN declined to go in or to have anything done for her, and they accordingly sat upon the steps about two hours. They then started to go to the house of ANNA's sister, and, after proceeding about half way, and ELLEN feeling worse, they sat down for an hour, when it became daylight, and the girls went down and crossed the river a number of times, in order to have a chat with the two deck bands. The ferry trips were repeated two or three times during the day, and toward night ANNA MYER left her companion and went home. ELLEN remained on the boat until it was laid up for the night, when her new-found lover, MIKE PEER, urged her to go home. She consented to go, provided he would accompany her; but, after proceeding up town a short distance, she refused to go home, and all of MIKE's arguments and entreaties failed to change her mind, and finally, at her request, he accomplished her to the Elysian Felds, where they remained until between 10 and 11 o'clock. MIKE again endeavored to induce the girl to go home, to which she consented, but subsequently refused, saying that she was afraid her sister would scold and beat her, and declaring that she would return to the Elysian Fields and sleep there until morning. MIKE PEER dissented to this, and said he would rather remain up all night than have her expose herself in that manner. She then said if he would go with her, she would go down and remain at the ferry-house until morning, and then would return home. PEER went down to the ferry-house, and watched over the girl until 3 A.M. Saturday morning, and then went home, got his breakfast, and returned an hour later to go on duty. When the boat commenced its trips at 5 o'clock, ELLEN went on board, and sailed back and forth until about 8 o'clock, when she went ashore, and that was the PEER saw of her until he heard of her death on Monday. Where the girl spent her time from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, when she was found on the ferry bridge by her brother, there is no evidence to show, and her movements during that time are an entire mystery. The above are some of the facts elicited at the inquest.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Suicide of a Young Girl by Poison in Hoboken.; A MYSTERIOUS CASE A LOVE AFFAIR A BOARDHOUSE FOR LADIES IN FIFTEENTH-STREET CORONER'S INVESTIGATION."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Suicide of a Young Girl by Poison in Hoboken.; A MYSTERIOUS CASE A LOVE AFFAIR A BOARDHOUSE FOR LADIES IN FIFTEENTH-STREET CORONER'S INVESTIGATION."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/39152523-6516-5d0e-95e6-235c629d85cf,3819,nyt://article/39152523-6516-5d0e-95e6-235c629d85cf,

"Atlantic Cable, the Lost",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/16/archives/the-telegraph-goue.html,"Atlantic Cable, the Lost","We have hoped almost against hope that some good fortune would ultimately bring through the great Atlantic cable. That hope is gone. We have news direct from the fleet as late as the 6th instant, by an arrival at Heart's Content, (name of mockery!) whereby we learn that the cable broke on the 2d, the day the signals to Valentia failed.

NATHANS, the bounty-broker, who figured so conspicuously in the Second District Provost Marshal's office, and on whose testimony Supervisor CHESHIRE was convicted of accepting presents and sentenced to the Penitentiary, was brought before Judge DAILEY yesterday morning, to answer to a charge of grand larceny, preferred by one of his victims in the bounty-business. The complainant is THEODORE LEWIS, who resides at No. 27 Hamilton-avenue, and he alleges that on the 24th of last September, he went to the office of the Second District in Grand-street, E.D., for the purpose of enlisting in the army. After an examination by the Surgeon in charge, he was pronounced disqualified, and was about leaving the office when he was accosted by NATHANS, who told him that he would see him through. He was then taken into a private room and supplied by NATHANS with a strange suit of clothes, and in this garb was again sent before the Doctor, who this time ""passed"" him. When LEWIS received his bounty-money, he found it $50 short and demanded of NATHENS the reason why, when he was told that he had to pay that amount for his (NATHANS') trouble. Having no means of redress at the time, LEWIS waited until he arrived home a few days ago, and entered the complaint above stated. NATHANS gave bonds to answer the charge on the 20th of September.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4d7999e7-e04e-5c23-9999-8292b874c6b1,242,nyt://article/4d7999e7-e04e-5c23-9999-8292b874c6b1,

He had listened to Capt. HEDDEN's appeals for more men and heard the well-grounded complaints of peace-loving and worthy residents of the ward until it had become painfully manifest to him that in that region of New-York there was danger that thieves and outlaws who adroitly cover their tracks might inaugurate a reign of terror. He had no men to spare; for the Metropolitan force, strong and trustworthy as it is, is yet lamentably deficient in point of numbers. Therefore, he bade the officers in that slum of the city, exercise the greatest vigilance, and never hesitate to capture a thief and defend themselves at all hazards. The reign of terror which was apprehended appears to have been by no means a myth; for in the testimony which was given yesterday, before Coroner COLLIN, by Mr. JOHN FOX, and which we reproduce below, shows that he, if no other resident of the Sixteenth Ward, was ""afraid to say anything,"" lest the outlaws who infest that region should waylay and murder him.

American Commanders-in-Chief,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/16/archives/the-anglosaxon-element.html,American Commanders-in-Chief,"-- We talk at random a great deal about the Anglo-Saxon race. Look at the names in the list of our American Commanders-in-Chief, from the first commissioned by Washington, in 1791, down to the present time. Here we have Gen. ARTHUR ST. CLAIR, a Scotch Celt; ANTHONY WAYNE, an Irish Celt; JAMES WILKINSON (Saxon or Gothic;) HENRY DEARBORN, a Welsh Celt; JACOB BROWN, a Welsh Celt; ALEXANDER MCCOMB, an Irish Celt; WINFIELD SCOTT, Scotch; GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, Scotch; H.W. HALLECK, Saxon; U.S. GRANT, Scotch. Thus we have eight out of the ten Commanders-in-Chief of our armies during the last seventy-five years, whose origin is no more Anglo-Saxon than it is Tartar.

The people of New-York are reduced to no such extremity. The daily revelations of Wall-street alone suffice to satiate the most ravenous craving for novelty, and unless a brake is applied, ere long the city will be turned topsy-turvy, and no man will be left to record the fate of his fellows. Of late, while the mere police force has been actively engaged in tracking thieves and arresting murderers, our more active detectives have discovered among the employes of sundry moneyed institutions a looseness of living and recklessness of expenditure which argued badly for the soundness of the principles on which those institutions were managed, and indicated a laxity of espionage or proper watchfulness on the part of the managers. The case of JENKINS is still fresh upon the memory of the public, its terrible revelations of fast life and secret speculation are not yet entirely told, and while a surprised and troubled community are canvassing the possibilities of other exposes, like a clap of thunder from a clear sky comes the following",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WALL STREET PANIC.; Tremendous Forgeries on WellKnown Firms.MILLIONS OF MONEY INVOLVED.Edward Ketchum Discovered tobe the Forger.FAILURE OF HEAVY HOUSES IN CONSEQUENCE Statements of the President of the Bank ofNew-York, Morris Ketchum and Charles Graham.Whereabouts of Ketchum---He Buys a Bag and Jams $60,000 in It.GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE STREET.

Convention of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/16/archives/maniacs.html,Convention of,"The omnibus-load of fossils formerly known as the Maine Democracy, yesterday went through the motions of a State convention. PILLSBURY spoke, and said he ""hoped that President JOHNSON would receive the assurance of fifty thousand men in Maine, good and true, who would seek to stay up his arm so long as he sustained the ark of the covenant."" Precisely what PILLSBURY means by the ark is not clear, but we suppose it is a sort of metallic coffin, containing the ""principles"" of the late Democratic party. There were 574 delegates to this convention. Last year it was held in Augusta, but as the population of that city was not large enough to furnish delegates from all the towns, it was wisely decided to move the concern to Portland, and the result is any required number of delegates, and Aroostook was fully represented. BION BRADBURY, once a candidate for Governor, thrust a platform into the convention. The platform thanks God that fighting is over; cherishes the memory of the dead who have, &c., &c.; honors the living, &c., also; wants a ""bloody and barbarous spirit"" banished ""from our midst"" (at the request of LINDLEY MURRAY, we guess;) wants the government to go its utmost length to restore ""constitutional relations between itself"" (mark the phrase,) ""and the late revolted States."" The fifth resolution is a mangled quotation from JEFFERSON, with the usual platitudes about ""equal and exact justice,"" and other things. Further, a splurge on the ballot; next, equal taxation; then, to get back from the government all the money advanced to prosecute the war; next, and very polite, ""banishing narrow considerations,"" we go for ANDREW JOHNSON. Why? Because he is ""returning to first principles, in refusing to accept gratuities."" J.

It appears, first, that the police required time to ascertain precisely where the sheat was printed, and, secondly, no citizen took it upon himself to prefer a complaint upon which they could proceed, without fear of being tripped by shrewd and well-paid counsel. Thus matters stood with this beastly publication, until last week, when several citizens of high respectability appeared before Superintendent KENNEDY, and made formal complaint setting forth the fact that this print had made its way into families, and was corrupting our youth of both sexes. The Superintendent having, meanwhile, learned whence the paper came, assured the gentlemen that measures should be taken to suppress The Town, and, accordingly, yesterday morning, when the packages which come to and through this city from Boston were due. Detective Officers MCDOUGAL and GILMORE entered the New-Haven Railroad Station at Twenty-seventh-street, and seized the entire edition of more than ten thousand copies, in packages, which were addressed thus: THOMAS W. TIMPSON, No. 29 Ann-street, New-York City. Paid -- F. -- (150.) JOHN BARRY, No. 162 Nassau-street New-York City. Paid -- F. -- (50.) JOHN FLANNIGAN, No. 23 Ann-street New-York City.

LEEMAN, Philadelphia. C.O.D. -- ($121 02 -- (13.) JOHN O. PARKER, No. 379 F-street, Washington, D.C. C.O.D. -- $19 50 -- (17.) The figures in parentheses are supposed to indicate the weight of the packages, and not the number of papers contained therein. It has been ascertained that The Town is printed in Boston, and that the imprint is changed for as many copies as are required in New-York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities. If the constabulary police of Boston tolerate the sheet there, they may as well inform the publishers that they cannot hope again to get it into or through New-York; for our metropolitan police have resolved that it shall not be circulated here or taken through the city. The thing probably costs the publishers three cents a copy, and is sold at wholesale for $7 50 a hundred; retail price, ten cents a copy.

In the very nature of its care and control over the national currency it must continue to be so. Mr. JAMES L. ORR, of South Carolina, once the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and (for a rebel) a fair and able man, is reported to have said, since the war ended, that the South was not beaten in the field, but in the Treasury. He is not far out of the way. The greenbacks of the United States practically prosecuted the war, and by their prompt support to our gallant armies in the field, won the crowning victory over the great and formidable insurrection against the government. If the present time should fail adequately to acknowledge this service, impartial history will be sure to render it immortal. To the firmness of the Secretary of the Treasury in 1861-62, and the prompt and able support with which he was seconded by Congress, in establishing this legal tender currency, in place of relying upon bank loans and the caprice and cupidity of great financiers (so-called) and capitalists of the Atlantic cities, is due the perseverance of the government to the final and triumphant end, against incompetent Generalship and repeated defeats in the field in 1862 and the early part of 1863. The crisis of this currency was in the Summer and Fall of 1864, when faction and disloyalty at the North joined hands with treason and rebellion at the South, to stamp the war a failure and to supersede the war administration of Mr. LINCOLN. It bravely withstood the shock of a Presidential canvass, unparalleled for personal and party bitterness, and unequaled for the direct and sinister support which the opposition derived from the New-York Gold market, and after this trial and the subsequent fall of Richmond, came out vindicated before the world as the right arm and strong arm of the government in backing up our brave armies through all the vicissitudes of their trials to the crowning triumphs of the war in April, 1865.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Currency Vicious Attempts to Create Distrust.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Currency Vicious Attempts to Create Distrust.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BANKS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c9b769f-a8e7-53f2-9e19-058e5dfd5c7c,1488,nyt://article/6c9b769f-a8e7-53f2-9e19-058e5dfd5c7c,

It appears that the sum total is likely to disappoint those sanguine people who expected New-York to put Paris to shame and challenge London to an even contest within the next decade. We shall be quite satisfied if the result shows five instead of thirty per cent. increase since the last census. Of course, the increase has been, in fact, about in equal ratio with the previous five years, but the people are no longer residents. The want of houses, and especially the enormous charges for rent have driven us forth into the country. We swarm over three other counties of our State; we make up whole villages and cities in New-Jersey, and even invade distant Connecticut. There are hourly and half hourly trains on a dozen railroads; there are a score of horse railways piercing the suburban regions in every direction; there are a hundred steamers that make regular trips to adjacent points, besides twenty-five ferries that merely cross the rivers. Not less than one hundred and fifty thousand business men and working men and women come to and leave our city on every secular day; and these people represent in their non-resident but really New-York families, a population of a third of a million. Ask for our increase, indeed? Why, we radiate from Sandy Hook to West Point, from Trenton to New-Haven, from Port Jervis to Patchogue. And when a complete enumeration is made over a circle of seventy miles diameter, we shall know where the really vast increase of our people is bestowed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Nonsense About the Census.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Nonsense About the Census.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Census', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89b0f3a4-ebf0-5b75-a02a-88a6ebbde136,286,nyt://article/89b0f3a4-ebf0-5b75-a02a-88a6ebbde136,

Madame Rumor immediately said that MUMFORD had fled the city, taking his plunder with him. Madame Rumor, however, was at fault, for MUMFORD had not left the city.

Bu ler in Court","In Re the Estate of Andrew J. Butler, deceased. -- Quite an excitement was created yesterday in and around the Surrogate's Court, in consequence of the attendance of Gen. Butler under circumstances which led to the impression that he was in contempt of court, and would be severely reprimanded if not punished by fine and imprisonment, when he should make his appearance before the court. It seems that the General was, during the latter part of 1864, appointed the executor of the will of his brother, Col. A.J. Butler. Parties most interested in having the will of the deceased Colonel proved, have been most assiduous in trying to secure the attendance of the General, and in having him file the proper inventories. The case was put off from time to time by the Surrogate, for the purpose of accommodating Gen. Butler, until it was found necessary to summon him in the usual way. The time fixed in the summons for him to appear and file his inventory was the 28th of July ult., and the summons was served on the 20th, eight days before. On the 28th the General did not appear, but had a representative in court who had the matter adjourned to the 8th inst. On the day last named another adjournment was effected until yesterday, on account of the inability of the General to attend. Considerable excitement was created in certain circles by the report that Gen. Butler had not only not filed his inventory, but that he did not intend to do so, and hence, that being in contempt of court a heavy fine and imprisonment awaited him.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Gen.

The communication has excited no little comment, particularly from the animus which it betrays, and will probably precipitate the movement already contemplated to procure a reorganization of that court."" If so, all good people will rejoice. Under Judge WYLIE's active supervision and management this court did its utmost to cover the American judiciary with infamy in the trial of MARY HARRIS. During that shameful episode the Hall of Justice was made a perfect bear-garden, where decency was trampled under the hoofs of counsel who meant to and did blackguard the prosecution out of court. And in doing this, they were protected and indirectly encouraged by Judge WILDS; he permitted a latitude of abuse on one side that might have disgraced the tribunal of Judge LYNCH, while every attempt to reply was literally at the risk of being summarily put down. So openly partial to the defence was the course of Judge WYLIE, that at last the public prosecutor practically threw up the case; and why should he not, when, before his closing argument was finished, he was assured by the Bench, in almost so many words, that the jury were going to acquit the prisoner? The reader may ask what has this to do with negro schools? Not much, directly; but the eruption of WYLIE in this school matter adds another argument -- if any were needed -- for the reorganization of the court suggested as probable in the dispatch above quoted.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THAT WASHINGTON JUDGE AGAIN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THAT WASHINGTON JUDGE AGAIN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3fadf0b6-c242-55e1-838d-a63e01a59c51,273,nyt://article/3fadf0b6-c242-55e1-838d-a63e01a59c51,

"ARREST OF AN ENGLISH BURGLAR -- HE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE AND IS SHOT. -- Wednesday morning, about 5 o'clock, as Officer RING, of the Hoboken Police, was about returning home from duty, he saw a stranger, with a large bundle in his possession, coming from the plank walk leading across the meadows to the hill, and making his way toward the ferry.

While thus engaged, the man suddenly sprang up, and making his exit, ran off up the street, pursued by the officer. After an exciting chase through several streets, without any perceptible advantage on either side, and as they passed from Meadow-street into First, the fugitive was observed to throw something over the fence. Capt. DAVIS then fired a shot over his head, to which he paid no attention, when he fired a second time, the ball taking effect, when the fellow halted and staggered up to the fence for support. He was then conveyed to the station-house, and Dr. TUTRIL was called in, and upon examination it was found that the ball struck over the center of the shoulder blade and glancing forward lodged in the muscles of the shoulder, where it still remains, the Doctor being unable to extract it.

MEYERS is alleged to have been one of a gang of four outlaws, who first knocked WEIRICH to the pavement and then robbed him. Justice MANSFIELD declined to take bail for the prisoner, and committed him for trial....JOHN GRAHAM, JOHN BARRY and CHARLES PETERSON were arrested by Policeman ROBERT CONNER for stealing 100 pounds of sugar from the ship Young America, moored at Pier No. 46 East River. The prisoners, on Wednesday night, rowed a boat up the East River, and having made fast to the ship, went about the work of loading the sugar as coolly as though they had been employed by the owners. The three were committed for examination... Officer GEORGE E. TOWNS took JOHN HAYWOOD into custody for entering LEOPOLD LEEMAN's jewelry-store, at No. 54 Allen-street, and stealing a dozen watches. Mr. LEEMAN stepped out at about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, leaving his wife in the store, and HAYWOOD stepped in, seized the watches and fled, but Mrs. LEEMAN's cry of ""Stop thief!"" attracted Policeman TOWNS' attention, and the thief, after a sharp chase, was captured. This prisoner also was committed without bail....Justice DOWLING, at the Tombs, committed JAMES TAYLOR in default of $2,000 bail to answer the complaint of Mr. ORLANDO C. FORSYTH, Jr., Claim Agent, alleging that recently TAYLOR entered his place, and, pretending that his name was JAMES ALLEN, that he had been sergeant of Company A, Tenth Maine Volunteers, and the government owed him $409 25, sold his alleged claim to the complainant, and received $388 79 therefor. A day or two thereafter Mr. FORSYTH discovered the omission of ALLEN's signature to two essential papers, and, on meeting him yesterday, desired him to attach his signature to the documents; but ALLEN repudiated the entire transaction, saying that his name was TAYLOR, and not ALLEN. TAYLOR was arrested yesterday by Policeman LAMLEIN, of the Fourteenth Ward, and committed in default of $2,000 bail....On Wednesday night, Mr. PAUL GREENSMITH caught HENRY BURKS with a black leather bag, containing $600 worth of silk goods, which he had stolen from Mr. ARCHIBALD P. BACHMAN's silk net manufactory, at No. 103 Franklin-street. BURKS had burglariously entered the store through a rear window. He was committed for trial. ....Officers MCCARTHY and FLANNIGAN apprehended GEORGE ANDERSON, and found in his possession $100 worth of silk and cotton goods that he had stolen from Messrs. WOODWARD, ANDERSON & CO.'s warehouse, at No. 41 Worth-street, which he had entered through the scuttle on the roof. This prisoner, also, was committed....Officer LYNG, of the Twenty-sixth Precinct, while on duty at Pier No. 34 North River, observed a suspicious-looking man coming off the Hudson steamer Nuhpa, and on searching him found two fine Marseilles bedquilts and a long linen tablecloth, rolled up tightly and secreted under his coat. He was taken back to the boat, and the Captain (POWERS) fully identified the property as belonging to the steamer. The Captain then went before Justice DOWLING, and he made complaint against the prisoner, who gave his name as GEORGE MARTIN, aged 20, waiter. He was committed for trial, in default of $500 bail.... Justice LEDWITH, at Jefferson Market, committed JAMES JAMESON, whom Policeman THOMAS LINDSAY, of the Broadway police, had arrested, upon complaint of Mr. HIRAM HITCHCOCK, of the firm of HITCHCOCK, DARLING & STEVENS, for stealing a white Marseilles counterpane from the Fifth-avenue Hotel. The prisoner, whose attire is seedy genteel, confessed, and said that, being without money, he had taken a room at the Fifth-avenue Hotel, and packed the counterpane in his valise, intending to pawn it for a sum sufficient to pay his expenses to Boston, and that on reaching that city he intended to remit the value of the counterpane to the owners. ....Mr. FREDERICK MORNING, of No. 549 Second-avenue, having been with a crowd witnessing a hostile encounter between canine quadrupeds, in Fourth-avenue, between Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth-streets, on Wednesday night, lost a gold watch and chain, and accused CHARLES ECK of the theft.

Why might it not have been sent directly North just as well? Can Major ECKERT tell us? Possibly some electrical law which the scientists under the Major's control have not yet promulgated prevents the currents from running northward as readily as they do in the opposite direction. We should like to be informed upon another point. What rule is observed in forwarding the ""private commercial"" dispatches which shut off the press from the use of the telegraph in the Southern States?

Scholars of the Country and the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/18/archives/the-agitators-and-the-scholars-of-the-country-their-share-in-the.html,Scholars of the Country and the War,"It has been said, and with some truth, that the original Abolitionists -- that is to say, the men who made emancipation the supreme public duty -- contributed very few fighting men to the war. There was no change in this respect after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President LINCOLN. The liberation of the slaves thereby became directly dependent upon the success of the war, and yet the absolute Abolitionists kept out of the war as generally as before. They gave it best wishes, and many of them wrote and spoke for it with great zeal. But they did not ask for muskets, and go to the front where more men were greatly needed. One looks almost in vain upon the list of officers, and upon the muster rolls of the rank and file, for any of the names that used to figure in the abolition gatherings. This is an indisputable fact The mental and moral constitution which predisposed and fitted these men to agitate with words, without limit or reserve, somehow made them shrink from the bloody fray.

To Southern States,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/18/archives/emigration-to-the-southern-states.html,To Southern States,"The Southern States undoubtedly offer very tempting fields to young men of energy and enterprise; fields, in some respects, more tempting than any which the West ever offered. The pioneer work is done. The general features of the country are known. Roads are constructed, railroads are built; and though for a time demolished, are being very rapidly put in running order again. The inconveniences usually attendant upon settling in a new country, the long and dreary journey in the emigrant wagons, the uncertain explorations, the rude life in a log hut, the contests with wild beasts, and sometimes savage tribes, the at first unpaid toil of clearing the forest and breaking the sod, the remoteness from market -- all these and other difficulties with which the Western and the Californian settler has had to contend, the Southern settler will avoid. The country to which he goes is known. He may study its geography before he leaves his home. He may travel by rail almost if not quite to his chosen farm. He will find upon it a comfortable dwelling, or the means accessible to build one. A sufficiency of his land he will find already cleared. His first year's industry will produce a profitable crop, and the railroad and the steamboat are close at hand to convey it to the best markets of the world. In the history of America, never has there been promised such speedy returns to energy and enterprise as are now proffered in the Southern half of the Union.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Emigration to the Southern States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Emigration to the Southern States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ce22936b-b829-575a-b35f-918f6ba13604,532,nyt://article/ce22936b-b829-575a-b35f-918f6ba13604,

A grand contest was anticipated, of course, and hence the large attendance of people, but not even the knowing ones in base ball matters dreamed of such a result as marked the match, the majority fully expecting the champions to carry back the trophy by a score of at least two to one, inasmuch as the Mutuals had achieved such a triumph over the Eurekas in their game with them, and as the Atlantics had defeated the Mutuals by a score of 40 to 28, it naturally followed that they would he expected to beat the Eurekas still worse. But base ball, as we said before, is an uncertain game; and, as it proved in this instance for the Atlantics, instead of defeating their gallant adversaries by a score of 2 to 1, thought themselves fortunate in being able to return home with the trophy by a score of 21 to 20 -- those being the total figures at the close of the game.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUT-DOOR SPORTS.; An Exciting Base Ball Match at Newark The Champion Atlantics Nearly Defeated A Large Concourse of Spectators.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUT-DOOR SPORTS.; An Exciting Base Ball Match at Newark The Champion Atlantics Nearly Defeated A Large Concourse of Spectators.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2b907acf-d86b-53fb-a80c-d3f1235a549d,680,nyt://article/2b907acf-d86b-53fb-a80c-d3f1235a549d,

Will these Conservatives undertake to conserve the spirit of slavery, though compelled to abandon its form? Will they leave the way open for legislative enactments that will only be a dilution of the old black codes? Will they proceed upon the principle that the colored race are to be kept in a state of subordination, and made the subject of peculiar restraints and exactions? It is just here that the North will particularly watch the action of the Mississippi Convention, to which we referred in yesterday's TIMES. It will be taken as the great index whether or not the restoration of the Southern States to their constitutional relations will be soon effected. The government, anxious as it is to hasten this end, can make no concession here. It is bound by the most solemn obligations to take care that the race which remained true to it when all around them were recreant, and which was transferred into another condition of social existence to suit its own military and other purposes, should not suffer by the change. It is under a most sacred guardianship of these helpless people, which it cannot give up if it would. What is more, the sentiment of the Northern people is just as firmly fixed upon this moral necessity for securing complete protection for the freedmen. Their Senators and representatives in Congress, if the occasion comes, will pronounce this sentiment with an emphasis not to be mistaken, and will give it any practical application the occasion may demand.

In the first flush of the excitement and dismay which followed the earliest developments in the KETCHUM forgeries, the shares of the leading railroads of the country were forced off the hands of the panic-stricken holders -- whether for investment or on speculation -- at a reduction in prices varying from 3 to 12 per cent., as compared with the rates current at the close of last week. A partial recovery from this extreme depression has since been noted, but it is only a partial, and, by no means, an assured improvement People have not regained confidence in the stability of the stock market for any other than government securities, which, through all the explosions of the week, have remained ""as firm as a rock;"" and have been sought after with an eagerness proportioned to the progress of distrust in other financial and commercial values.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STABILITY OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STABILITY OF GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/50c59ced-7413-553b-9314-8d05ed6381bd,431,nyt://article/50c59ced-7413-553b-9314-8d05ed6381bd,

It is alleged that the accused decoyed the little girl from the vicinity of her home on Thursday afternoon, and induced her to accompany him to the house No. 104 Leonard-street, New-York, where he had hired, a night or two previous, a furnished apartment. Here he gave the child some beer and wine to drink, which had the effect of partially stupefying her, after which he attempted to outrage her person, but the girl screamed when she discovered the nature of his intention, and REEVES, the keeper of the house, went up stairs to ascertain the cause. BAREHR met him at the door and quieted his apprehensions with a plausible story that the child was his cousin and wanted to go home; but as she lived in the country, he could not take her there until the following day. This quieted REEVES' suspicions, and he withdrew. The villain then renewed his attempt upon the girl, when she again raised an outcry, and REEVES at once called in Officer BARRETT, of the Sixth Precinct, who proceeded to the room and demanded to see the child. Upon seeing the officer, she at once disclosed the facts, when BARKER was taken into custody and was locked up for the night Ascertaining from the child that she had been abducted from near Hoboken, officers were sent over yesterday to make inquiries, and, her story proving correct, the prisoner was brought to Jersey City and committed for examination.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73625deb-9a9f-5029-a566-edd9a0fadc56,553,nyt://article/73625deb-9a9f-5029-a566-edd9a0fadc56,

Connecticut Championship Match,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/19/archives/billiards-the-match-for-the-connecticut-championship-hubbell-still.html,Connecticut Championship Match,"Just one year ago the first State Billiard Tournament was held in Connecticut; and on that occasion Mr. GERSHOM B. HUBBELL, a fine amateur billiardplayer, succeeded in vanquishing all competitors, and was awarded the champion's cue. Since that event Mr. HUBBELL has been called on four times to prove his right of title, and on each occasion has vindicated himself handsomely. His first challenge was from M. WOOLAHAN, an excellent professional player. This match was played on the 17th of September last. G.W. HUNT, Esq., the Superintendent of the Housatonic Railroad, was the next to suffer defeat at HUBBELL's hands; their match came off on the 21st of February last.s Mr. M.H. HEWINS, another professional, then challenged him, and the game was set for May last; but HEWINS being ill when the time came around, he forfeited. HUBBELL was next challenged by RALPH BENJAMIN, of Bridgeport, one of the veteran professors of the science of billiards. In fact some fifteen or eighteen years ago BENJAMIN was considered one of the best players in the country. He will be remembered by the older billiard community, as a contestant of MICHAEL PHELAN, in a match at the French carom game, which was played in Philadelphia, on the 30th of December, 1859. On that occasion PHELAN gave him the odds of three points in sixteen, and won nine games out of eleven, taking the purse of $2,000. Since that time BENJAMIN has been engaged in the business in New-York, San Francisco, Virginia City and at Bridgeport, at which latter city he now keeps rooms. He declined entering the Tournament; but when it appeared that no other person in the State could vanquish HUBBELL, he determined that the cue should come to Bridgeport; thus he challenged the champion, and the game was played at Allyn Hall, in the City of Hartford, on Wednesday evening last.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BILLIARDS.; The Match for the Connecticut Championship Hubbell Still Holds the Cue.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BILLIARDS.; The Match for the Connecticut Championship Hubbell Still Holds the Cue.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Billiards', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8e7ede48-0704-51e0-94a8-9269f0a546b0,1369,nyt://article/8e7ede48-0704-51e0-94a8-9269f0a546b0,

Then every stage was watched with the closest attention; every temporary disappointment saddened all hearts, every successful advance was hailed with delight. When finally the tidings came that the cable was laid and in perfect order, and the fact was verified by messages actually received from England, an excitement followed altogether unexampled in the history of our people. The whole breadth of the land was moved to transports of rejoicing. There was a spontaneous universal jubilee. Even the soberest particpated in it. Our very churches resounded with anthems and prayers of thanksgiving. The announcement with which that eventful week closed, that the communication was lost, was received with general incredulity. It was too painful to be believed. When the truth forced conviction, every man and woman received it as a personal misfortune, and a heartfelt sorrow everywhere prevailed. Now, on the other hand, the whole enterprise, though involving for greater labor and cost, and far more complete in all of its securities and facilities, has been regarded by our people generally with a feeling closely bordering upon absolute indifference. A passing inquiry or a chance remark has been the only token that the popular mind had knowledge of the work.

The subject is also one largely affecting the future welfare of the community. The right education of a child consists in the drawing out or cultivation of its inate moral, mental and phisical attributes. These are placed in the order of their real importance, but in elucidating the subject, their position will be inverted, and parents are advised to turn their attention first to the physical branch of education. Through the gates of the senses children are constantly receiving instruction, either for good or evil, and those lessons which are not specially appointed, are usually best learned and longest retained. For these reasons the material circumstances surrounding children are of primary importance. Perfect cleanliness and strict order, as well as beauty and harmony, should be the lesson first instilled by the appearance of the school itself. One of the very best guides to parents in the selection of an academy for their children is the observation of the order and decorations of the room in which their sons and daughters are to receive their daily instruction.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Private Schools.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Private Schools.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Private Schools', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/211a60ad-b1ea-5503-a07a-8e4ce709dcca,824,nyt://article/211a60ad-b1ea-5503-a07a-8e4ce709dcca,

Some fire-eating warriors, not yet content with the blood and desolation of four wretched years; some puzzle-headed patriots, well-intentioned but with confused ideas, whose political catechism contained but one article of faith, repeated always like SCIPIO's Carthago est delenda at the end of every opinion, to wit, that the Monroe Doctrine must be preserved, and not only preserved in our minds, but jabbed into MAXIMILIAN's with a bayonet's point; in fine, some gallant young officers eager to win their spurs, or to add a star or two to their shoulder-straps, or, at least, to impart fresh lustre to those they already wore -- all these looked longingly for a war on the Rio Grande.

At the outset it concedes that a rate of two per cent., instead of one, on all commodities sold would be requisite; and, further, that this would probably amount to eight, ten or twelve per cent. of an increase of price to the consumer, through intermediate profits. But then, it asks, ""is not this equally the case with excises levied on home manufactures, and with duties imposed on foreign importations?"" Now, we hardly expected anything so weak as this from our able cotemporary, in view of the fact that the TIMES has taken strong grounds against the excise duties on home manufactures; while the tariff is looked to chiefly, if not solely, as a resource for meeting the interest and principle of the national debt. Besides, when one advocates a radical revolution in finance, it is not enough that his system be ""equally"" defective with that already established. It must, be free from such defects, else why make any essential modifications at all? Clearly it would be only leaping out of the frying-pan into the fire.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Proposed Tax on Sales.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Proposed Tax on Sales.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'COMMERCIAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/64e2b9d2-c422-55f0-8e57-4f087a015d5f,1234,nyt://article/64e2b9d2-c422-55f0-8e57-4f087a015d5f,

JOHN MCKEON and SIDNEY H. STUART, appearing respectively for the Phenix Bank and CHARLES BROWN and GENEVIEVE LYONS, two of the many persons who are alleged to have had guilty knowledge of JENKINS's peculations, summed up before Justice LEDWITH, yesterday afternoon, at Jefferson Market Police Court; but the Magistrate's decision was not rendered, as he required further time to investigate the evidence. Mr. STUART contended that not a particle of evidence had been adduced to establish any relationship between his clients and the $300,000 defalcation, and that they should therefore be released from constraint; and Mr. MCKEON quoted the books to show that where there was reasonable ground for suspicion that a person had been concerned in an offence against the statutes it was the Magistrate's duty to hold that person for examination.

ANDREWS, of a $5 bill of the Leroy Bank, New-York, a water-proof coat worth $18, and his hat. It appears that ANDREWS, who was recently employed at the Brooklyn Navy-yard, had procured a situation in Philadelphia, and was on his way thither. He came over to Jersey City about 6 P.M., yesterday, for the purpose of taking the cars for Philadelphia, where he met the accused (with whom he had formerly been on a gunboat) and two of his companions. After conversing for some time together, HIGGINS insisted that ANDREWS should not go until he had paid him the balance of some borrowed money. ANDREWS replied that he had only $10 with him, but said he would send it on within a fortnight. HIGGINS was not satisfied with this, saying that he should not leave in the cars unless the debt was paid and intimating that by saying the words ANDREWS would be whipped by the two companions of the accused. The latter then proceeded to the ticket office and while in the act of handing a $5 bill to the agent the prisoner snatched the bill from his hand and also seized his water-proof coat and his hat and started out on the sidewalk followed by ANDREWS, when the companions of HIGGINS made a vigorous attack on ANDREWS, but he managed to ward off their blows and only sustain some scratches about the face, and in the meantime HIGGINS made his escape. The officers being attracted by the large gathering of people that had assembled, came up, and learning the state of affairs, proceeded to the residence of the accused, took him in custody, and recovered the coat; the hat having been snatched away from him in the melee by a woman, and who restored it to the owner. After the prisoner was taken down to the cells he stated to Officer DEVINE that the $5 bill was in possession of his sister. The officer proceeded to the house, but the woman denied all knowledge of it, but said they would go out and borrow $5. One of the women went out and after a short absence returned and handed the officer $5, which ANDREWS identified as the one that had been taken from him.

The latter of these evils has, to some slight extent, been mitigated in a few localities, but in only a few. Adulteration is an evil, a crime, which can be guarded against by all. The little instrument called the lactometer ought to be adopted by every household, and it is so simple that none need be deceived by their milkman. A small glass tube, with a bulb at one end, and containing a few shot, constitutes the whole affair. The bulb placed on water, sinks, tube uppermost, to the bottom; on pure milk it floats or is but partially submerged. If the ""milk"" is half water, the bulb will sink to half the length of the tube, and so on. There is no reason why lactometers should not occupy as honorable a place in the kitchen as the measure or the scales.

OERTEL representing scenes of the war so happily over. Mr. OERTEL spent three months in Virginia, with a Rhode Island Cavalry Regiment, early in the war, and these pictures are the fruit of sketches then made. Mr. OERTEL's unusual skill in the expression of movement, has found ample scope in the treatment of the subjects he has chosen -- the Stampede and the Virginia Turnpike. In the first, a herd of stampeded cattle is making a blind, pell-mell rush for nowhere in particular, crowding and trampling each other in utter fright and disorder, no doubt to the great dismay of the unhappy drivers, but affording the satisfied artist a fine opportunity to display his vigorous drawing and effective color. In the second picture a number of vicious little mules are making desperate efforts to drag a heavy army-wagon up a narrow road, rendered next to impassable by frequent rains and the passage of army trains. The drawing and individualization of these animals are admirable, and exhibit close observation and a facile pencil. These fine pictures, by far the best war-pictures yet exhibited in New-York, belong to Mr. DOYLE, of Providence. They are, we understand, the first of a series representing army life in its various phases, which Mr. OERTEL has in contemplation. The value of such a series, showing, in a manner which no mere ""word-painting"" can, the living realities of our great war, is beyond, expression.

No people similarly situated have ever been so leniently and generously treated in the history of nations. Every honest Southerner (and we should hope the majority are still honest) knows this. And every honest Southerner knows also that the greatest crime as well as the greatest folly the late seceded States can now be guilty of, is to set up further pretensions in conflict with the constitutional enactments of Congress, and the settled policy and the decrees of the Executive.

At the bow and stern of each boat have a roller, over and under which the cable alternately should pass to find its ocean bed. These boats could not sink under any circumstances, and their buoyancy and flexibility would prevent undue strain upon the cable, even in the heaviest sea; while the prososed reeving under and over the rollers would of itself furnish a natural check or brake by which the cable would be governed, and made to pass out at an almost uniform rate. If, by any possibility, the cable should part, it would only be necessary to cut the boats adrift, and the lost end, thus effectually buoyed, could be recovered without difficulty.

Many of these officers have been rendered unfit for immediately entering again upon the ordinary business of life, or for scrambling for a livelihood amid the competitions of the day. Some have lost an arm, others a leg, others have been partially disabled, physically, in other ways, while yet their intellect remains vigorous, and all their mental faculties perfect, and while their general manly character and ability have been greatly developed and enlarged by their experiences in the field. There are many desirable positions in the gift of the government, at home as well as abroad, which might be offered to such men. There are important diplomatic positions like that given to Gen. HOVEY, and higher posts still, and there are also scores of consulates which would be gratefully accepted and ably filled by numerous brave and patriotic officers of character and ability.

The revelations of the police court in the case of JENKINS have had their effect upon the portly presidents and the bland directors of our banking institutions, and the result will duubiless be that many a gay and dashing teller will rusticate for a few weeks in the country, while his confiding friends and sureties will quietly pay down hundreds of thousands of dollars, that the bank credit may be maintained and the public be reassured. There is no use in trying to hide these things -- defalcations, like murders, will come out. The president and directors of very bank in the city, so far as our observation extends, are mortal and extremely like other people. If in the course of their earnest examinations last week they discovered losses, thefts, abstractions and defalcations -- and some of them did -- their first thought was to keep it from the public. So, only in confidence each man told his particular friend, and from lip to ear the word has passed through the street until the farce has become too ludicrous for serious mention.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE STOCK EXCHANGE.; Our Bulls and Bears Who and What they Are.

"Williamsburgh, Officer Shot by Burglar",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/21/archives/williamsburgh.html,"Williamsburgh, Officer Shot by Burglar","CONFLICT BETWEEN BURGLARS AND THE POLICE -- ONE OF THE OFFICERS SHOT. -- Two desperate burglars operated pretty extensively in the Nineteenth Ward early yesterday morning, but were finally discovered by the police and only escaped after an exciting chase and the shooting of one of the officers. The first house they are known to have entered was that of DANIEL BRIDGE, NO. 112 Hews-street, where they stole a gold watch and chain valued at $90, $67 in gold coin, and $7 in paper money, the property of H.C.HODGDON, a boarder in the house. They then visited the residence of G.W. HAWKINS, Penn-street, between Lee and Bedford avenues, and obtained a gold watch and chain and $36 in money. The entrance was made through the second story window. The residence of GEORGE D. HUBBARD, Bedford-avenue, near Penn-street next received their attentions, but here they alarmed the family and made off without obtaining any booty. One of the inmates put his head out of the window and gave an alarm after the burglars had left. This attracted the notice of Officer PETER HUNT, of the Forty-fifth Precinct, who immediately started in pursuit, but he failed to come upon them. Some time after this Officer SMITH came across them in Bedford-avenue and immediately gave chase, but lost sight of them at the corner of Clymer-street and Lee-avenue. Officer CHICHESTER fell upon them in Sixth-street, between South Eighth and South Ninth streets, and when he approached one of them, who was just coming out of a yard, the fellow discharged a pistol at him, hitting the buttons on his coat. CHICHESTER then closed upon him and received another shot, which shattered the two fore-fingers of his right hand, one of which he will probably lose. The officer then discharged his Derringer at the burglar with his left hand, but missed him. The fugitive then encountered Officer W. BELL, who was unarmed, but that officer made a pass at him with his locust, which, however, was dodged. The burglar then attempted to shoot him, but his pistol snapped, and the officer thus escaped. The fellow finally managed to escape in the darkness, which was unusually intense at the time.

The fire originated in Messrs. T. BAXTER & R. MCVOY's ship joiner's shop, on the second floor of No. 204 South-street, and was first discovered in a heap of shavings near a hearth on which one of the workmen -- Mr. ANDREW RIKER by name -- was preparing a pot of glue. The loft being [???]lled with combustible materials, the flames flashed through the second story as though they were in a powder magazine, and the workmen barely escaped with their lives, and so speedily did the fire leap through the building, that when the firemen reached the scene within ten minutes of the first alarm, the upper stories were enveloped, and the windows of Messrs. S. ADAMS & F. WEST's rigging loft, on the fourth floor, were belching forth dense volumes of black smoke, which indicated that the fire had reached the tarred shipping furniture and become uncontrollable so far as the building at No. 204 South-street was concerned. The firemen, therefore, made no effort to save this place, but bent their energies to the saving of adjoining property. This was no holiday task; for by 1:30 o'clock the fire had entered VANDYKE's Hotel, in Catharine-street, and the intense heat had sprung and burst an iron shutter on the rear of Mr. J.J. HICKS' bonded warehouse, at No. 401 Water-street, thus giving admission to fire there. In this building, also, the flames spread with great rapidity, and soon baffled the fire machinery that had been brought to bear. But in Mr. E.G. KLEIST's Steamboat Hotel, on the northwest corner of South and Catharine streets; Mr. WILLIAM W. MONK's store, at No. 205 South-street, and Messrs. L.E.P. SMITH & CO.'s warehouse, at Nos. 397 and 399 Waterstreet, all of which buildings were on fire at 2 o'clock, the firemen were more successful, confining the flames to several small rooms, and at length extinguishing them utterly.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FIRES.; Disastrous Conflagration in South-street Loss over Six Hundred Thousand Dollars.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FIRES.; Disastrous Conflagration in South-street Loss over Six Hundred Thousand Dollars.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1099a6f1-a5f4-5a6f-9650-ceb5b99c4614,1003,nyt://article/1099a6f1-a5f4-5a6f-9650-ceb5b99c4614,

Halstead Thrown Over Rocks","About nine o'clock on Saturday night, as a young man named FRANK HALSTEAD, residing in the vicinity of the Five Corners, Hudson City, was passing down the long line of steps leading from the public grounds on Mount Pleasant, Bergen Hill, to the plank walk across the meadows in the rear of Jersey City, he was set upon by two highwaymen, who knocked him insensible with a club, robbed, and then threw him over a ledge of rocks, where the poor man lay for several hours in an unconscious state, in a terribly bruised and lacerated condition, caused by falling upon a pile of sharp and jagged stones, the refuse from a quarry. The facts of the case are as follows: About six o'clock on Saturday afternoon, young HALSTEAD, who is a nephew of ""Uncle TOMMY WELDON,"" who was the owner of Mount Pleasant until it was recently purchased and fitted up for a public resort, and who had resided on the place with his uncle for a number of years, called upon his friend, MICKY FREE the pedestrian, whom he invited to accompany him up to the old homestead to see how it looked since it had been fitted up for a public resort MICKY accepted the invitation, and the two spent a couple of hours at the grounds, during which young HALSTEAD treated those present liberally with lager, getting a couple of five dollar bills changed to pay for it, and talking somewhat in a boasting manner of being worth a considerable amount of money. At the time a stranger sat near the company, but took no part in their sociable chat. About 8 o'clock MICKEY FREE returned home and retired for the night, HALSTEAD concluding to go home to the Five Corners by a shorter route. About 9 o'clock the citizens along Newark-avenue, at the outskirts of Jersey City, were startled by piercing and repeated cries of murder in the direction at the foot of the stairs leading to Mount Pleasant, and search was instituted, but no person could be found who knew anything of the matter.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Man Waylaid, Robbed and Thrown Over a Ledge of Rocks.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Man Waylaid, Robbed and Thrown Over a Ledge of Rocks.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/88d75a2b-cbfc-5cdd-b65a-75bb93cc7aed,693,nyt://article/88d75a2b-cbfc-5cdd-b65a-75bb93cc7aed,

Have the police no power over the rascally crew? Surely they have, and they ought to exercise it, at least to the extent of requiring every one of these blatant and impertinent scamps to remain on his box until his services might be required.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/22/archives/rescued-from-drowning.html,,"-- An instance of daring and manly rescue from drowning occurred off the beach at East Hampton, Aug. 9, which should be recorded in honor of the parties who promptly rendered so efficient service in the hour of danger. A little son of Mr. H.F. PHINNEY, of Irvington, N.Y., aged 10 years, was bathing and learning to swim, in charge of WILLIAM DUNN, who was a strong swimmer and quite fond of little FREDDY, having been many years in Mr. PHINNEY's employ. While swimming at a short distance from the other bathers, the little fellow, who was suddenly and unconsciously carried out by a current, exhausted his strength in endeavoring to combat it, before he was noticed, and was sinking, when his younger brother, seeing it, screamed to DUNN, who instantly swam out, seized the boy who was still vainly trying to keep to the surface, kept his head above water with one hand while swimming with the other, but, owing to the current, could not get in, and becoming exhausted, called for help. Mr. JAMES ROBERT FULLER, only 17 years old, (son of Rev. Dr. FULLER of Middletown, Conn.,) seeing their danger, promptly swam quite a distance to them and took the boy on his shoulders, while Mr. JOHN VAN BUSKIRK, of Washington, and Mr. ROBERT WYNKOOP, of Syracuse, N.Y., swam out and brought in DUNN, who in his determined efforts to save the boy had become helpless, and being a large man, gave his rescuers a heavy task, although he had worked bravely until almost exhausted. Mr. FULLER is said to have rescued another lad from drowning, who broke through the ice last winter. All the parties, although much fatigued, were speedily restored. The whole affair was so sudden and brief, that the parents, who were on another part of the beach, were not aware of the danger until the parties reached shore. -- Sag Harbor Express, Aug. 17.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RESCUED FROM DROWNING.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RESCUED FROM DROWNING.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b29f8f97-544d-59de-8eab-45c1848c1780,321,nyt://article/b29f8f97-544d-59de-8eab-45c1848c1780,

Without any Southern urging, Congress, of its own accord, by an almost unanimous vote, passed its resolution for an amendment of the constitution, guaranteeing perpetual inviolability to slavery in the States. Had it been clear that the South would have been thereby appeased, Congress would have bound itself and its successors to place no restrictions upon the extension of slavery into the Territories, and to abide by all the extra-judicial principles of the Dred Scott decision. It is difficult to say what it would not have done in the way of propitiation to avert the war. To have stopped the war after it began, the government at any time during the first twenty-one months -- up to the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation -- would have saved slavery as it was, and all its old constitutional rights, barring, perhaps, the assumed right of extending itself into the Territories. Even afterward, up to the very last stage of the war, the rebellion, by agreeing to throw down its arms at once, could have got terms. This is implied in all that President LINCOLN said and did in connection with the attempted peace negotiations at Niagara Falls, and in connection with the conference at Hampton Roads. Of course these terms would have been limited; yet had the right spirit been displayed by the South, they might have embraced provisions whereby emancipation would practically have been made gradual, or perhaps, even some compensation given for the loss of the slaves. The anxiety of the government to stop the dreadful effusion of blood, and the immense drains upon the Treasury, would have impelled it to do the utmost for peace, short of a positive sacrifice of the Union and of emancipation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Is the South Still to be its own Worst Enemy?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Is the South Still to be its own Worst Enemy?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c03685ac-3773-51a2-9158-369a09e86ab1,1290,nyt://article/c03685ac-3773-51a2-9158-369a09e86ab1,

LEE, Pastor of the Genevan Presbyterian Church, Gates-avenue, Brooklyn, a few days since met with a very serious accident in Maine, which came near proving fatal. The circumstances, as narrated by the members of his church, are as follows: Mr. LEE was on a visit at Portland, whither he had gone to escort his wife and family to Brooklyn; and while at Portland he joined a party of friends in an excursion to Peak's Rocks. While moving from crag to crag in this wild and romantic region, he missed his footing and fell into the gorge beneath, striking his head upon some sharp-pointed rocks in his fall. He was taken up insensible, and in this condition was speedily removed to the ferry-boat en route to the house of his friends. While on the boat a surgeon was met with, who applied bandages, and thus stopped the flow of blood. Arriving home, the aid of several of the best physicians was called into requisition, and a consultation ensued. They pronounced the case as almost hopeless, and proceeded with a surgical operation, in the course of which they removed several pieces of the skull, and discovered that the membrane over the temple (the region of injury) was not penetrated. During the operatioa Mr. LEE somewhat recovered his consciousness, but all recollection of facts, locations or faces was entirely gone. His physicians pronounce the case as extremely hazardous, and express the belief that, if he should recover, his intellectual faculties will be so impaired as to preclude the possibility of his resuming his pastoral functions. Mr. LEE's family and congregation are deeply affected by this sad blow. It was but a week or so since Mr. LEE was garroted and robbed in Beekman-street, losing his gold watch, gold studs and some $50 in money. Mr. LEE has been made to feel most singularly the force of the old saying, that ""troubles never come singly.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Dreadful Accident to a Brooklyn Clergyman.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Dreadful Accident to a Brooklyn Clergyman.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'ACCIDENTS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e7b12df6-3daa-58ea-8984-5189b89c04a0,323,nyt://article/e7b12df6-3daa-58ea-8984-5189b89c04a0,

The young woman made the following statement: She said that she was married to a young man in Alexandria, Va., and lived for some time happily and contented, and with a good prospect for the future. Her husband, however, became neglectful of her, grew debased in his actions, and finally, to add to his other base deeds, committed a rape on a young girl. About the same time he removed his wife to a house of ill-fame; she being ignorant of the character of the house, but soon discovering what kind of a place it was, she left and applied for and obtained a divorce. In the meantime, he was arrested for committing the rape and was sent to prison. The woman then procured employment in Philadelphia, but in a short time was induced by a man with whom she became acquainted to give up her business and live with him. After awhile he also deserted her, and she then formed the acquaintance of a brakeman on the Camden and Amboy Railroad, who paid her fare from Philadelphia to New-York. In the latter city she obtained a situation in a concert-saloon, where she receives five dollars a week and pays seven dollars per week for her board. On Sunday morning she came to Jersey City on the arrival of the owl train to meet the above-mentioned brakeman, who, after obtaining refreshments for himself and her at Myers' saloon, in Exchange-place, conducted her to the car, in which she was found by the police, to stay until morning. In the car, when they arrived there, were the three young men who were arrested, they, it appears, sleeping there every morning after the arrival of the train, and consequently refused to leave. While wrangling about the right to the car, a half dozen of rowdies who had followed the couple from the saloon, entered the car and forcibly attempted to ravish the person of the female. A disturbance ensued which was overheard by the police, when they made a descent upon the parties. The brakeman was one of those who fled on the approach of the officers, but the three young men belonging to the train remained and were taken into custody, but on the examination yesterday afternoon, as above stated, were released.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4c3db91-b43b-5069-931d-833a7ec1cf64,491,nyt://article/f4c3db91-b43b-5069-931d-833a7ec1cf64,

A number of persons declared that they had seen at least a hundred men swimming across the river, some of whom reached the Long Island shore, while others sunk midway in the river, sending up piteous appeals for help. It was also stated that the fire was the result of a conspiracy, and that some of the keepers had been thrown into the flames, and, of course, horned to death. On inquiry in the proper quarters, our reporter ascertained that about 7 o'clock last night a fire broke out in a building on Blackwell's Island used for miscellaneous purposes. The building was an old one, three stories in height, about 100 feet in length and 40 in depth. One portion of it was used as a wash-house, another as a blacksmith's shop, and another for the manufacture of shoes. It was located near the water, between the Penitentiary and the warden's house. In the wash-house were about 800 suits of penitentiary clothing. It was here the fire broke out, and it is supposed to have been caused by one of the washerwomen throwing her pipe among clothing. All that is known is that Mr. KEENE, the Warden, closed the building at the usual hour, and soon afterward the fire broke out. The engines on the island, under the direction of Mr. KEENE, were soon at work, drawing an abundant supply of water from the river, but the flames quickly destroyed the entire building and contents. Commissioners BELL & NICHOLSON arrived soon after the fire broke out, and strong guards were placed around the Penitentiary and other buildings, and also at the landing places, so that any effort on the part of the prisoners to escape during the excitement would have been fruitless. A number of firemen arrived from New-York and Brooklyn, and rendered efficient service in working the engines.

The water with which Brooklyn is supplied is very good indeed, but it may be safely said that our own Croton has no superior either in this country or Europe. In fact, compared to the water with which the great City of London is supplied, Croton water is purity itself.

Stocks; Customs on Gold,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/23/archives/united-states-stocks-customs-in-gold.html,Stocks; Customs on Gold,"Less than ten months ago the croaking against the public debt was so great, in certain partisan and semi-secesh quarters, and the doubt thrown by the same parties upon the ability of the government to raise a sufficient sum in gold from its customs revenue to pay the gold interest on the funded debt of the United States, so persistent, that the Treasury Department deemed it proper to move with extreme caution in its funding process. A thousand millions of funded debt, involving about $58,000,000 annual gold customs, for the support of its interest, was looked to as a prudent maximum. At that time, Sept. 30, 1864, the sum funded was $923,085,941, and the gold interest thereon $54,608,445. There was even then no good reason to doubt that seventy-two millions gold customs would be collected for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1865. The policy of Mr. FESSENDEN, however, was to err on the prudent side. When Congress convened in December, he had barely reached the limit of a thousand millions. Before he left office, about the 1st of March, seeing that his customs would exceed his calculation on $72,000,000 -- the actual result proved eighty-six millions -- he resolved to increase the sum total to $1,100,361,241 -- statement of March -- at an annual charge in gold of $64,016,631; and at about this figure it remained through the whole negotiation of the 7:30 currency loans, under Mr. MCCULLOCH.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'United States Stocks Customs in Gold.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'United States Stocks Customs in Gold.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1f45fd4c-fe88-5bde-a509-c7773f649394,964,nyt://article/1f45fd4c-fe88-5bde-a509-c7773f649394,

Bittman,"Yesterday afternoon Coroner GOVER impanneled a jury at the Delancey-street Police-station, and proceeded to make an investigation concerning the riot which occurred at about 1 o'clock on Sunday morning last, at the intersection of Delancey and Ridge streets. A great multitude of citizens of the Thirteenth Ward were interested spectators from the beginning to the close of the investigation, and when the jury returned, at nearly 9 o'clock, with a verdict censuring the Metropolitan Fire Commissioners for tardiness in organizing the Paid Fire Department, the audience greeted the verdict as one eminently fit to be made. We publish below the substance of the voluminous testimony which was taken, omitting only those portions that are mere repetitions. The gentleman who published a card in yesterday morning's TIMES, alleging that the Thirteenth Precinct Police were not on the ground until the fiercest of the fighting had been done, may observe that although the witnesses nullify each other's evidence on other points, they yet agree on the one point, that the police were in at the beginning, and fought like brave men until they had won a substantial victory. Further remark concerning the conflicting and unsatisfactory testimony which was given by the members of the contending fire companies is hardly necessary, since it can be seen at a glance that each company, to use the firemen's vernacular, had ""put up a job"" for the other. It may be remarked, however, that the jury, which was composed of a most respectable and intelligent class of our citizens, evidently tossed this chaff aside as worthless, and probably argued in this wise: These companies are striving to outswear each other; they have had their fill of rioting, and the Metropolitan Police have come out of the contest victors; the injured are mainly ""bunkers"" and ""runners,"" a class of citizens that we do not care to encourage; the testimony does not fasten the riot upon any person in particular, and we might as well drop the case hereby making such suggestions as may tend to prevent a recurrence of these disgraceful scenes.

"DEATH OF A CHILD UNDER PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES -- A DOCTOR AND A DRUGGIST INVOLVED. -- On Saturday morning last, an infant named IDA M. WATSON, whose parents reside at No. 1 Third-street, E.D., died under circumstances which induced its friends to notify Coroner BARRETT. An inquest was accordingly held last night at the residence of the child's parents. The following facts were elicited: Deceased had been suffering from whooping-cough, and Dr. JOHN A. BRADY, of South Sixth-street, near Fourth, was called in to attend to it. Ho gave a prescription, which was compounded at the store of Mr. WATSON, corner of Fourth-street and Broadway. The medicine consisted of six powders, one of which was to be taken every four hours. The first powder given the child caused it to vomit and purge, and when the time came for the second dose to be taken, the ladies attending only gave half a dose. This immediately made the child worse, and from that time until its death it was in great pain. Previous to its death Dr. BRADY was sent for, and he asked to see the powders given. When he saw them he said they were all wrong. A lady in the house then took them to the store of Mr. WATSON and stated what the doctor said. Coroner BARRETT then went after these powders, and the box which he received from the druggist was last night shown to the lady who administered to the child during its illness, and she swore positively that the label upon it was different from the one on the box which contained the powders used; she also swore that the powders in it were smaller and of a different color. The clerk who put up the prescription swore directly to the contrary. Further testimony was taken, but it was of a conflicting character. The coroner stated to the jury that he had ordered a post mortem examination in the case, but the gentlemen whom he sent to perform it, merely made an external examination, and reported to him that the child had died from natural causes. This was not satisfactory to the jury nor Coroner BARRETT, and an exhumation will take place to-day, for the purpose of a thorough internal examination. There are some very bad features in this case between the doctor and the druggist, but a thorough and satisfactory examination will take place and be laid before the public.

The accused gave his name as GEORGE GLADWIN, is about 32 years of age, a carpenter by trade, and has been in the United States Army. He is a very ordinary-looking man, but his operations prove him to possess much shrewdness and commercial ability. It appears that, about ten days ago, GLADWIN called at the New-Haven Post-office, and asked for the letters of Mr. TROWBRIDGE, a gentleman doing business at No. 16 Long Wharf, in that city. Several letters were given to him, among which was one containing a draft drawn on the Manhattan Company, of this city, by Messrs. BURDICK, FRISBEE & CO., brokers. No. 93 Wall-street for $3,996 76. The draft was dated Aug. 12, 1865, and was made payable to the order of Mr. TROWBRIDGE. GLADWIN immediately came to this city, bringing with him a fascinating woman, whom he calls ""EMMA,"" to relieve the monotony of the journey, and enjoy the good fortune which he supposed was in store for him in this city. The couple engaged rooms at the St. Nicholas Hotel, and GLADWIN deposited the stolen draft in the hotel safe for safe keeping. The next day, however, he withdrew it, and going to the jewelry store of Mr. THOMAS KILPATRICK, corner of Duane-street and Broadway, selected two beautiful gold watches and chains, a diamond breast-pin, pearl sett, ring, &c., valued at $1,200. He offered the abstracted draft in payment and said that if Mr. KILPATRICK preferred, he could take his bill out of some railway bonds which GLADWIN had in his possession. After making inquiries, Mr. KILPATRICK became satisfied that the draft was genuine, and received it, giving the accused the difference between the face of the draft and the amount of his purchase. The merchant deposited the draft in his bank for collection. On reaching the bank of the Manhattan Company, the indorsement of ""H. TROWBRIDGE,"" on the back of the draft, was pronounced a forgery. The bank officers placed the matter in the hands of Capt. JOURDAN, of the Sixth Precinct, giving him a description of GLADWIN. It was subsequently learned that the criminal had returned to New-Haven with his frail companion, and Officer WOOLDRIDGE was dispatched after him. The detective proceeded cautiously with his task on reaching New-Haven. He soon learned that GLADWIN had offered, a valuable watch for sale to a man named BRADLY, and a strict watch was kept on his boarding-house. The forger was arrested on Monday evening by Officer WOOLDRIDGE, and all of the jewelry he had purchased from Mr. KILPATRICK was recovered. The prisoner was brought to this city yesterday afternoon.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; ARREST OF ANOTHER FORGER.

About two hundred thousand square miles of the Atlantic Ocean are covered with our glorious ensign, which three gigantic fellows are flinging to the breeze; and on the opposite corner half of Mexico, the whole of Lower California, and a big slice of the Pacific Ocean are sunk beneath an imprint of rainbow hues, which declares the wonderful kaleidoscope before us is ""H.H.

What that has to do with the fight maybe a question, but there is truth in it, notwithstanding. We are not in possession of the doings or plans of the commissioners, but we are inclined to think that they have been too easy with the bitter elements opposed to them, and that a little more severity would have advanced the public interests. It is undeniable that there still exists a powerful element that means to make the new organization inefficient and odious. It is the duty of the commissioners to meet boldly and crush out this element Only yesterday a citizen of most responsible position and judgment assured us that this disorganizing opposition was so strong that he feared every fire might be a disastrous conflagration, and that the new department necessarily a little timid and not yet in good working order, would be quite driven from the field by the truculent opposition of those who mean, by any means, fair or foul, to get back their old political power.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Firemen's Fight."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Firemen's Fight."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c4d9ccd3-8e87-55ee-83b9-3aa7080f243d,394,nyt://article/c4d9ccd3-8e87-55ee-83b9-3aa7080f243d,

To judge from the fearful array of physiological miseries daily set forth in this connection by our neighbor, reinforced by thronging letters of nervous correspondents, who have detected in this new box of Pandora the source of all the mysterious diseases with which they have, for indefinite periods, been afflicted, one would infer that there is no fleshly ill, from elephantiasis to a gum-boil, which a ride in one of these city cars is not competent to produce. Of course, by a singular, but well-defined law of human sympathy, a thousand sufferers hereupon start up-wriggling, scratching and twisting -- all affected by one or another of the symptoms described in ""your valuable journal,"" and all tracing their sorrows to the same nefarious cause. The town swarms with protesting invalids, who now distinctly remember absorbing scald-head by fundamentally mistaken confidence in ""reeking cushions,"" imbibing fistula and carbuncle from the infectious atmosphere, and qualifying for long and lively proficiency on the Scotch fiddle, by incautious contact with the hand-strap.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'USES AND ABUSES OF CITY CARS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'USES AND ABUSES OF CITY CARS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0a4f6809-ee69-593e-bf0f-3dc25c9e0a86,419,nyt://article/0a4f6809-ee69-593e-bf0f-3dc25c9e0a86,

Notwithstanding the repeated denunciations of Fenianism by many priests and high ecclesiastical dignitaries in this country and in Ireland, and notwithstanding that Fenianism is virtually included in various of the categories of bodies authoritatively condemned from Rome, there are still members of the order who claim that it or its objects have the sanction or the tacit permission of the Church. It has been thought worth while, therefore, to have the question definitely and finally set at rest for the benefit of the faithful and as a warning to the contumacious. We call the special attention of the Fenians to the fact and to the missive, that so they may speedily put their consciences and their conduct in order. And we desire to direct to this important document the attention not only of the ""Fenian Brotherhood,"" but also of the recently organized ""Fenian Sisterhood,"" the ""circles"" of which are actively holding their meetings in these times. We are sure that though the Brotherhood may prove stiffnecked, the Sisterhood will have some regard for their souls and the warnings of the Church, through the sacred congregation.

Preparations extensive, and of the most elaborate nature, are making for the approaching season, and ere long the graceful baton of MARETZEK will wave in front of the lights, and to the inspiring orchestral harmonies, the superb array of artists, whose names and fame have been given in the TIMES, will make melodious the vast expanse. Singular as it may seem, Mr. MARETZEK has undertaken to run his own machine this Winter. He has conceived the insane project of managing his own business, and has announced that fact in startling phrase to the gaping multitude. No manager has ever done so much for art in this city as MARETZEK. His promises have ever been fulfilled, his artists were as he announced, his seasons were memorable in the pleasures of his patrons, and his integrity has yet to be questioned. Of the several artists who are now here, or will be in the course of a few days, many are established favorites already. The name of MAZZOLENI is a host in itself; those of ZUCCHI, KELLOGG, BELLINI, PHILLIPS, are familiar as of those most popular; the strangers will sing for themselves. If they are good, no detraction can injure them; if bad, no puffing assist them. The programme for the season will shortly be published. We can only state at present that there is every prospect of a brilliant season.

On the night in question Mr. COOPER closed his manufactory at 6 o'clock, but returned at 9 o'clock in the evening, bringing with him a large watch-dog, which he left in his place as a precautionary measure against thieves. Before he went home, Mr. COOPER noticed a person watching the premises, who had visited his place on pretence of purchasing goods. Mr. COOPER, however, thought but little of the matter at the time. On entering his manufactory the next morning, the circumstance was brought to his mind, by discovering that his premises had been entered by burglars, his two safes opened and robbed of diamond jewelry and silver-ware, valued at $13,250. The watch dog lay dead on the floor, having been killed with strychnine which the thieves had administered to him. The room was in a disordered condition, the boxes and papers which had contained the goods being strewed over the floor. The robbery was immediately reported to the detective police and to Capt. JOURDAN of the 6th Precinct Police. Detective ELDER and Capt. JOURDAN obtained a description of the man who was near his place on the night of the burglary, from Mr. COOPER. The officers were also informed that about a month ago the man called on him, and said he wished to sell a hundred ounces of silver which he had brought from California. Mr. COOPER said that he was not in the habit of buying goods from strangers, but if he would bring a specimen of the silver he would look at it. The man left, but returned in about two weeks, when he said that he would not sell the silver, but wished to get some goods made up from it and asked to look at some samples. Mr. COOPER opened his safe, and exhibited some fine goods to the stranger, when the latter said that he would have his wife look at them before ordering any goods. He then left, and was not seen again until the evening of the 16th inst. From the description of the man given by Mr. COOPER, Detective ELDER and Capt. JOURDAN became satisfied that the burglar was an old offender named DAVID BARTLETT. In company with Roundsman MCDONNELL, of the Sixth Precinct, the officers succeeded in arresting BARTLETT in company with a young man named WM. COLEMAN. CATHARINE MALOY, a little girl living at No. 117 Amity-street, and a boy named EDWARD O'FAILE, identified the prisoners, and said that they saw them at the side entrance of Mr. COOPER's manufactory on the night of the burglary, attempting to open the door. The girl asked the men what they wanted, when BARTLETT said they were waiting for a man to come down stairs. On going into the building she could find no man, and when she came down stairs the men moved away, saying they would wait for him round the corner. She then left, but in a short time heard the dog bark, and saw the gleam of a light in Mr. COOPER's place.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DIAMOND ROBBERY.; Thirteen Thousand Dollars Worth of Diamonds and Silver-Ware Stolen.

The Actives had out their strongest team, and were in fine trim for play. The Atlantics, however, were minus the services of PEARCE, PRATT and SID. SMITH, their catcher, pitcher and right fielder, two of them being sick and the others in Philadelphia. They had good substitutes, however; but owing to bad judgment in placing their field, the nine did not play up to their mark at all, the game being marked by alternate good and bad play throughout the match. The Actives were weak at left field and short field, though they had good men in these positions, but they did not play up to their mark at all. The decisions of the umpire were thoroughly impartial, and though he had several close points to decide upon he was very correct in all cases, though the partisan portion of the crowd did not seem to think so. It is surprising to see how like boys some men will act when their prejudices are aroused.

The English, when shut out from our Southern ports, went busily to work to find or raise cotton in all the countries of the world that were adapted to its production. The Cotton Supply Association distributed seed wherever there was a prospect of its growing, and furnished, on easy terms, steam plows, steam machinery, and improved agricultural implements. But the latest report of the result of these operations is not encouraging. Much is expected, but little has been realized, from Turkey. Egypt gives promising returne; but there is trouble from the decrease in the production of grain. There were hopes of increasing returns, in future years, from the Arab districts of Syria, the regions bordering on the Persian Gulf, the southern parts of Asia Minor and adjacent regions; and there were both hopes and prospects in Greece, Italy, Central and South America, the West Indies, Australia, Natal and various parts of Africa. Disappointment came from India, for although the supply had not diminished, it had not increased; nevertheless, it was, beyond all things, expedient for British interests to foster the cotton trade of India.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Rivals in Cotton-Raising.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Rivals in Cotton-Raising.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7e171547-5733-5604-aae1-cd0aaebdb421,372,nyt://article/7e171547-5733-5604-aae1-cd0aaebdb421,

Rents and Gen. Turner,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/25/archives/strange-work-for-the-military.html,Rents and Gen. Turner,"-- It seems that, from one cause or another, there is a scarcity of houses in Richmond. A portion of the city was blown up, and another portion burnt down when the late Confederate Government fled from the place. Negroes have flocked into the city, since that memorable exodus, by the thousand. Speculators and enterprisers of every degree have rushed thither by the hundred. And the place to-day is full and more than full. Rents, therefore, are high; some say exorbitantly high. Every effort to make the landlords reasonable -- according to the tenant's notion of reasonableness -- has failed. And in the emergency, we see it reported, the aid of Gen. TURNER and the military has been invoked. We have no notion that Gen. TURNER will pay any attention to this invocation. But it would not be altogether out of place if he should read a short lecture on common sense to the foolish people who have appealed to him in this matter. They may conceive that they are aggrieved in not finding sufficient house accommodation in Richmond; but they have no right to seek to make the military authorities ridiculous, and Gen. TURNER should frankly tell them so.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STRANGE WORK FOR THE MILITARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STRANGE WORK FOR THE MILITARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e85dd0a8-bf9a-5a22-bec9-358deeccca35,200,nyt://article/e85dd0a8-bf9a-5a22-bec9-358deeccca35,

Mr. SCHADE stated that as his associates for the defence had retired, he was left alone to manage the case, and he therefore asked that there be a postponement for eight days, in order that he might become better acquainted with the subject, and prepare for the defence. Col. CHIPMAN stated the reasons why there should be no further postponements, remarking that the gentleman was already fully informed of the theory of the prosecution. The court overruled the request for postponement. O.S. BAKER, Esq., volunteered for the defence, and is therefore associated with Mr. SCHADE. The prisoner put in several pleas why he should not be tried, denying the jurisdiction of the court, and insisting the charges ought to be quashed. The court overruled the pleas of the counsel for the prisoner, and proceeded to trial. Among the witnesses examined was Col. GIBBS, who commanded the post at Andersonville. He said that WIRZ had exclusive control of the prison. The prisoners were crowded so close as to remind him of an ant-hill. He gave a circumstantial account of the discipline and the disgusting condition of the prison, and remarked that one of the rules was that whoever crossed the dead line should be shot. Dr. JOHN C. BATES, ex-rebel, who was a physician at the prison, another witness, gave a long and interesting account of that place, and the shameful treatment to which the prisoners were subjected, stating as his opinion that with proper care, the lives of seventy-five per cent. of those who died might have been saved.

He asserted, for example, that Mr. FORBES, ""as soon as he obtained the contract, transferred it to Mr. GARDNER, (whom he calls his agent,) of the Providence Steam Engine Works, who took it with all its conditions and assumed all its guarantees,"" and that consequently, ""Mr. FORBES never had any pecuniary interest in it;"" while it appears from the statements of both Mr. FORBES and Mr. GARDNER, as well as from the records of the Navy Department itself, that not one word of this is true; and the same flagrant hardihood of assertion characterizes everything that Mr. ISHERWOOD says of Mr. FORBES.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Algonquin Contest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Algonquin Contest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/37472cad-fc10-55bb-80de-d5153414006d,641,nyt://article/37472cad-fc10-55bb-80de-d5153414006d,

At the age of 18 he began the publication of the Pennsylvania Inquirer, in Second-street, above Carter, and he continued its publication until a few years since, when its title was changed to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Since 1835 he had been engaged in the publication of Bibles and other works, and he was known as the most extensive publisher of quarto and family bibles in the United States.

Its opponents, however maintain that in its actual operations it is the most unfair; that it being impossible for assessors to arrive at a knowledge of persons' incomes with any degree of certainty, their word must be accepted by the officers, giving fraud or falsehood every advantage over honesty and veracity. There is probably no locality in the country where instances cannot be found going to substantiate this charge. Then, it is alleged that such a mode of taxation is necessarily accompanied with more or less inquisitorial proceedings, and the exposure of private affairs to the public gaze. Especially is this the case when men's incomes, as returned to the assessors, are published in the newspapers.

At length two gentlemen of seeming leisure entered the station-house and coolly became seated near the Coroner, and that officer imagining them to be willing jurors, passed over the book. The gentlemen were, however, obtuse; they could not perceive the neuter pronoun; they could not see it in that light. They were, they said, reporters. That was precisely the reason why they should act as jurors, the Coroner adnded, because, said he, ""I want an intelligent Jury.""

Even the close of the late war was almost dreaded by some, from fear that the spirit of our people, which had been stung by foreign insolence, might break through all restraint for the purpose of taking vengeance upon those who had been its enemies in the days of adversity. When all these perils had passed away with time, it was attempted to get up a new excitement on the Mexican question; and by false rumors as to our movements and as to French movements on the line of the Rio Grande, by stories of impending collisions and of gigantic preparations for hostilities, the timid have until lately been kept in a state of constant apprehension, and the sensation mongers have grown fat (or rather lean) by their successes.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Peace with All the World The Altered Tone of Public Opinion Abroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Peace with All the World The Altered Tone of Public Opinion Abroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2aa8eb39-84f9-5fa1-8d47-8cfdb420faef,542,nyt://article/2aa8eb39-84f9-5fa1-8d47-8cfdb420faef,

MORRIS, whose mother keeps a boarding-house at No. 83 York-street, Jersey City, took place before Justice CUTTER, yesterday forenoon, in the presence of quite a number of spectators. The little girl, who is rather short for her age, thick-set, quite pretty, and evidently innocent and unsophisticated, gave her testimony without reserve, whether it bore against or in favor of the accused. She testified that on Saturday evening last, while her mother was gone to Washington Market, and others of the family were out on the front door-steps, WILBUR called her into his room in the back parlor to partake of some water-melon, after which he took liberties with her person, and then laying her on the bed, violated her person; that he told her she must not tell any one, and she promised not to. He then put her out of the back window, on the piazza, so that her mother would not see her come out of the room. She did not tell her mother until the next afternoon, when she complained of injuries. On the cross-examination the witness testified that just previous to leaving the room, her mother came in there, and witness hid behind the bed until she went out. The witness was then questioned with the evident intention of showing that the little girl had been sent in the room by her mother, and told how to act, but the effort failed. Mrs. MORRIS was placed upon the stand, and testified as to the complaints of injuries received, which led to the discovery of what had occurred. On the cross-examination of witness, the prisoner, through his counsel, asked Mrs. MORRIS if she did not tell a young woman boarding in the house that prisoner was a nice man, and that she placed him in the back parlor in order that she could visit him in his room. Mrs. MORRIS very indignantly denied that she had made any such remarks. A son of the witness, greatly excited, exclaimed, pointing toward the prisoner: ""If I had a pistol I would blow your d -- n brains out, young man."" This assertion caused quite a sensation, but the countenances of the spectators indicated a verdict ""would serve him right."" Dr. HADDEN, being called, testified that he had examined the person of the girl and found every indication that her person had been violated. The prisoner, upon examination, said that he was 47 years of age, a resident of Jersey City; was born in Saratoga County, N.Y., and had nothing to say touching this charge, except that he was not guilty. He was then committed to the county jail to await trial.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c8741c0f-364f-5248-af37-18998d0556dd,575,nyt://article/c8741c0f-364f-5248-af37-18998d0556dd,

"Jersey City Club, Removal of House",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/28/archives/newjersey.html,"Jersey City Club, Removal of House","A SAILOR SHOT BY THE MATE OF A SHIP -- THE MATE MISTAKEN FOR A NEGRO AND THREATENED WITH LYNCH LAW. -- A Portuguese sailor named SMITH, while conducting himself in a mutinous manner on board the ship Abodeen, lying at the foot of Third-street, Hoboken, was shot and wounded in three places on Friday, by the mate of the ship, NELSON VALIN, a swarthy-visaged individual, who would be readily taken for a mulatto. It appears that the Captain of the ship supplied VALIN with money, with instructions to pay off and discharge the men, and then went away, leaving the ship in his charge. According to VALIN's statement, he paid the sailors the money due them, and they went away. Subsequently SMITH came on board, somewhat intoxicated, and said that he wished to get his luggage, and the mate told him to go forward and get it. In a short time SMITH came aft, and, claiming that a pair of shoes were missing, said that he wanted to look in his (the mate's) state-room. The mate allowed him to look in the state-room, but would not allow him to overhaul the things, and ordered him out. Presently. SMITH returned, accompanied by a shipmate, and demanded the, privilege of searching the state-room, which the mate declined to allow, saying that he was responsible for everything on board the ship, and if SMITH attempted to enter the cabin he would shoot him. SMITH advanced, when he fired three times, two of the balls taking effect in the thigh, and a third in the abdomen, the last wound being unintentional, as he only wished to prevent an assault by wounding the man. A report soon spread along the docks amongst the longshoremen, that a white man had been shot by a negro, and in a few minutes an excited crowd gathered in the vicinity, and the cry was raised to kill the ""nagur."" At this juncture, Special Deputy Sheriff REED went on board the Abodeen, and, unobserved, conveyed VALIN in a small boat around to another dock, where they landed. VALIN then proceeded before Recorder AVERY, and delivered himself up.

The introduction of religion into secular affairs is certainly in bad taste, savors of hypocrisy, besides being an infraction of one of the great commandments of the sacred law. To really devout minds this impingement upon the priestly function has a strong odor of cant.

Loose Method of Issuing,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/28/archives/loose-method-of-doing-important-busi.html,Loose Method of Issuing,"NESS. -- A case is reported in our local news this morning which shows how an excellent law bearing upon the security of human life has been evaded, and also exhibits the very lax manner in which the business of issuing burial certificates is conducted by the City Inspector's Department. Some days since a man under the influence of mania a potu jumped from the window of his room to the street below, and suffered injuries which resulted in his death before the lapse of many hours. To shield the family of the wretched man from the disgrace consequent upon a public exposure, the physician of the deceased made out a certificate that the death was occasioned by a ""fall."" The undertaker demurred that it would be impossible to procure a burial permit upon such a certificate. Thereupon the plastic and kind-hearted doctor (whom it is impossible to believe ignorant that the matter clearly came under the category of a Coroner's case) filled up a new blank with the unpleasant words mania a potu, and the complaisant undertaker at once made arrangements for a plain and quiet funeral. The burial took place, but the corpse was not long in the grave before the circumstances became publicly known, the remains were exhumed and the Coroner opened an inquest, developing these facts, which are themselves suggestive enough of the ease with which deeds of evil may be hidden from the light, and show a palpable violation of the law which seeks to hedge human life with proper safeguards.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOOSE METHOD OF DOING IMPORTANT BUSI-', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOOSE METHOD OF DOING IMPORTANT BUSI-', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/58fca133-9cb3-5645-b2a1-43a5f0d2a920,446,nyt://article/58fca133-9cb3-5645-b2a1-43a5f0d2a920,

Anecdote of a Cotemporary,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/28/archives/notes.html,Anecdote of a Cotemporary,"-- One of our neighbors printed on Saturday, an account of an alleged wonderful cure of dumbness brought about by extravagant indulgence in secale antiquum, adding, with characteristic simplicity, that he does not know whether that means ""corn or rye whisky."" With the help of Ainsworth's Latin Dictionary, we are enabled to assure him that ""secale"" means ""rye,"" and is the botanical name for that much abused vegetable; but we don't expect everybody to have an Ainsworth. The incident, however, reminds us of a story, and here it is: About fifteen years ago, when the Temperance furore was at its height in this State, our good friend of the ""secale antiquum"" was the grand champion of total abstinence, not only in theory, but (to his honor be it said.) in practice; and he made his influential journal so conspicuously virtuous in this regard, that nine in ten of all his country readers were ready to swear that every man on the paper, from A No. 1 to Zed, was a rampant cold-waterite and went to church three times-and-a-half every Sunday, besides Thursday night. One day, in a ponderous leader on his favorite hobby, the Governor betrayed his innocence of tippling by writing that on a specified occasion certain persons had been ""drinking brandy, whisky, champagne, and Heidsick."" The morning on which this lapsus something was printed, found us (the writer was there) in a grand chuckle over the Old Man's blunder in saying ""champagne and Heidsick."" Most of us had known Charles Heidsick in the shape of sick headache too often to forget him in a hurry. In our seven-by-nine editorial room, which held us all in those days, we laughed hugely over the mistake. There was the future Assistant Secretary o War, keen, sarcastic, imperious, setting on his tall bench with his everlasting green shade over his eyes, saying good things, one-third sweet and five-thirds bitter; there was the then incipient Ulysses, the far-traveled, but not such an unconscionable liar as the Trojan humbug; there was the gentlemanly Professor, rotund and dignified, yet ready to shake his glasses out of their golden frames at a number-one joke; there was the relator; there was the quiet man of all work, who is at this present annoying a sixth of the city by sending in Uncle Sam's tax bills; there was, lastly and greatestly, the courteous and important moneyman, a good fellow, a gourmand by education, and perhaps coming as near as any other of us to the ""awful example"" for the Old Man's homilies. So we sat and haw-hawed over the leading editor's mistake, until that veritable individual appeared, his crumpled hat perched on his coat collar, his thin, flaxen hair half covered with the pages of a smashing leader written before breakfast, and jammed into the hat instead of the pocket, his hands full of letters and papers in most admired disorder; and his whole self slouching in with the lurch peculiar to him alone, his clear, child-like face and innocent eyes beaming with that mild, inquiring look, that overcomes malice and almost dissipates prejudice. Conspiring to confound the Old Man, who had so often confounded us for lesser sins, we put forth the gourmand as our spokesman, and he, in English remarkable for its mathematical precision, (his mind was commercially constructed,) rallied the chief upon the ridiculous mistake he had made in representing ""Champagne"" and ""Heidsick"" as distinct tipples, and then we felt victorious and again we guffawed. Looking around upon the crowd in his quiet way, and (as Hamlet, senior, scented the morning air) seeming to scent the morning cocktail, the champion of teetotalism crushed us under this quiet reply: ""Now, did I? Waal, I reckon, I'm the only writer on this paper who could make such a blunder."" We subsided. And down to this day, it would appear that the Old Man is oblivious of the commonest distinctions in the catalogue of potables.

Atlantic Cable; Dr. Russell's Account,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/28/archives/the-official-account-of-the-atlantic-cable.html,Atlantic Cable; Dr. Russell's Account,"-- We do not know that Dr. RUSSELL, in his official account of the attempt to lay the Atlantic Cable, which we published yesterday, has added much to the stock of information previously given to the public here. His account, however, is admirable from its bringing into the foreground certain minute points, which throw no little light upon the nature and cause of the immediate failure. One of these points we take to be the unwieldiness of the Great Eastern. The straining which the cable must have undergone in the mere process of turning the big ship when the discovered defects of insulation required the hauling in of the line was evidently sufficient to account for the ultimate fracture. The hauling in, it will be noticed, required that the cable should be attached to machinery fitted up on the bow of the boat. And on the three different occasions, the 24th and 28th of July, and the 2d of August, when this work had to be gone through, to remedy repairs, there was extreme difficulty in regulating the paying-out while the vessel was being wheeled round in her course; so as -- on the one hand -- to prevent the strain from becoming excessive, and on the other, to keep the cable from abrasure by contact with some projecting section of the vessel under water. It seems, from Dr. RUSSELL's account, that this repeated transfer of the cable from the stern to the bow of the Great Eastern -- even when the hauling-in machinery worked with moderate satisfaction, was a most perilous operation, and vastly more perilous than it would have been in a smaller vessel.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE ATLANTIC CABLE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/850b81fe-0b64-5c25-bf1d-02c2f729850b,479,nyt://article/850b81fe-0b64-5c25-bf1d-02c2f729850b,

Referring to the admirable discipline and management which prevailed on board the steamer City of Glasgow on the recent occasion of her destruction by fire, our correspondent points out that the seamen employed on first-class British steamers are tried and experienced hands, most of them long attached to the vessel. In the case of American steamers of the same class, they are manned anew almost every trip. The hands are prepaid and overpaid, and an inferior class of seamen, as a general rule, are found in the service. There is no question -- humiliating as the confession is -- that we are still far behind in this essential feature of the merchant service. It needs complete reform before we can take our legitimate place in mercantile marine enterprise. The discipline and experience acquired by the large body of men discharged from the navy ought to form a good basis for a thorough improvement. It will be a shame and disgrace to us if advantage is not taken of the opportunity to make a thorough revolution in the service.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR MERCANTILE MARINE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR MERCANTILE MARINE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/536f5011-c5e6-5fdc-9683-59ea9d5770b0,200,nyt://article/536f5011-c5e6-5fdc-9683-59ea9d5770b0,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/29/archives/notes.html,,"-- It has often been said that the English language is preeminently conspicuous for its power of strong expression, for exaggerated objurgation, and a capacity of swear far beyond any other known tongue. We have tried it (mentally) and found it wanting; in fact, its utmost is ridiculously tame and ineffective when applied to the inexpressible abomination that smites and disgusts and sickens the senses of those unfortunates who pass in the Hudson River Railway cars the infected locality of Fortieth-street, or thereabouts, on the Eleventh-avenue. Precisely what this awful stench comes from we do not know, and if trustworthy legs and a decent regard for the sense of scent do not fail us we never mean to know. Rather than endure that -- whatever it is -- again, we should prefer to go to Albany by way of Boston. We have heard that the offence arises from a boiling establishment; but where on or under the earth anything can be found to boil that will give out such -- well, we can't begin to describe it -- we cannot imagine. Any even half civilized community, excepting this, would sink, blow up, burn down, or in some way abate such an awful thing. But we are too civilized to be decent. Those uncountryfied people who suppose that this concern -- whatever it is -- is a place where living skunks are pressed to death for their oil, are mistaken; such an establishment alongside of this would be like Farini's renowned cologne manufactory beside the sweetness of the Rhine at that city, as described by the sensitive but spiteful author of the ""Ancient Mariner.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee6010a6-3c07-5b78-a289-7203dd0302bd,1152,nyt://article/ee6010a6-3c07-5b78-a289-7203dd0302bd,

"Archibald, British Consul N. Y. Report on Trade",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/29/archives/effects-of-the-civil-war-in-america.html,"Archibald, British Consul N. Y. Report on Trade","Mr. ARCHIBALD, the British Consul at New-York, has just issued an interesting commercial report, which concludes with the following general reflections: "" The termination of the civil war will, in its turn, produce effects on trade and industry similar in their nature to those caused by the outbreak of the war. With the depreciation of the currency, prices of commodities advanced in a corresponding ratio at first following slowly the rising premium on gold, until overtaking it, they have now, with hardly an exception, far exceeded the proportionate rate. For a time after the commencement of the war trade was paralyzed and all was stagnation. Now that the industry of the country must be changed from a state of war to a state of peace, a temporary derangement and consequent paralysis will ensue. If the pacification of the States in insurrection, and the removal of the elements of discord can be effected within a reasonable period, the national credit will be maintained and general confidence be restored. The vast amount of paper money issued by the government will be lessened by gradually withdrawing it from circulation, in exchange for the bonds which already, from the effect of continued military successes, are in increased demand, both in Europe and this country. There will, of course, be fluctuations -- fiftful and violent changes -- but prices must as a general rule, decline with the reduction of the currency, until the specie value be reached, when trade will move on in its accustomed channels. How soon -- within what number of years -- this will be accomplished is a matter depending on so many important political conditions that it is impossible at present to form any satisfactory opinion. The energy which has, especially within the last year, been displayed in bringing the war to a close -- the determination of the people to reestablish the national authority throughout the whole extent of the Union -- and the readiness evinced on all sides to submit to the heavy taxation, in order to provide for the payment of the interest on the national debt, cannot fail to hasten the period when the resumption of specie payment should take place. On the other hand, [the report was written about the time of Gen. LEE's surrender,] until more of the temper of the Southern people is known, notwithstanding the failure of their attempt at independence, and while the confiscation and other punitive measures are retained in force, it would be unsafe to count on a state of absolute peace and the benefits to result from it. Should order and tranquillity be reestablished in the South, a vast trade would spring up with that section, in which employment would be found for the present redundant government paper currency, provided the State and national banks be restricted in their issues. The great debt which the civil war has created will assimilate the United States in one respect to European nations, namely, in the existence and permanency of a heavy public debt. That it will not be repudiated (as many during the uncertainties of the civil war apprehended) there can now be very little doubt, but, with the vastly increased amount of public expenditure which must henceforth be provided for, the payment of the interest of the debt will be found a heavy burden, especially taking into account the greatly augmented amounts of State and municipal debts which must be provided for at the same time. Still, the vast resources of the country, and in particular the mineral wealth of the Pacific States and intermediate territories, which are only now beginning to be developed, may, under practical management, be made available at an earlier period than is now supposed for the reduction of the principal of the national debt."" The abrogation of the reciprocity treaty, Mr. ARCHIBALD reports, is decidedly disapproved of by the boards of commerce, and by the principal American cities, with the exception of Philadelphia, as well on the seaboard as on the Canadian frontier.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EFFECTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EFFECTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6dab566-fcba-5b34-8f86-0eea3d29bb58,668,nyt://article/f6dab566-fcba-5b34-8f86-0eea3d29bb58,

Address to Troops","The position and strength of the contending parties in Peru remain unchanged, or nearly so. Slowly and steadily each is mustering its forces for the decisive battle. The condition of the Revolutionists has been bettered by the seizure of the new gunboat Union. The Union, on her way to Callao, touched at Valparaiso. While there, all the influence of the traitors to constitutional law and authority in Chili was brought to bear upon Capt. GRAW to induce him to proceed to Arica and hand his vessel over to the rebels. Gen. CASTILLO, Minister from Peru to Chili, with most shameful treachery, joined in the demand, bringing the weight of his official position upon the question. Capt. GRAW yielded to these demands and went to Arica. Gen. CASTILLO also has gone to Arica, where he assumes command of the revolutionary squadron. Such painful infidelity is a fitting counterpart to the disgraceful seizure of the Amazonas and murder of Admiral PANIZO. The rebel frigates Amazonas and America were at last accounts at Iquique. The intentions of the rebel chiefs in regard to a naval attack upon Callao are not known. In Callao a strict look-out was being kept up for their appearance. The rebels hold Pisco, the port adjacent to the Chinchas, and it was reported that they proposed to make it a port of entry for the guano ships, preventing by their navy all other vessels from loading. They have established such high rites for provisions at Pisco, in order to get funds, that the business of some American merchants is threatened. A boat's crew of 17 men with a launch from the St. Marys, under command of Lieut. ROLANDS, was dispatched from Callao on the evening of July 27, in tow of the P.S.N.

Like a the other pictures of this series this photograph is taken from a likeness painted by Mr. DODGE. His extraordinary skill in this branch of art has enabled him to produce a portrait remarkable for its perfect naturalness and life-like accuracy. Many portraits of the late President, while endeavoring to convey the grave expressions of his countenance, have deepened that expression until the general effect has become suggestive of dullness rather than otherwise. Mr. DODGE has avoided this great mistake, and, while doing full justice to the serious and dignified aspect of the face, has preserved that depth and vivacity of the eye which was so strikingly evident to those who were admitted by Mr. LINCOLN to his most intimate companionship. In fact many of Mr. LINCOLN's friends, both in Washington and elsewhere, to whom this likeness has been submitted, pronounce it the most satisfactory portrait of our late President that has been issued.

Boston and New-York; New Line Between,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/30/archives/notes.html,Boston and New-York; New Line Between,"-- Providence papers make a note of a proposed new line between Boston and New-York. They say that contracts have been completed between the Naptune Steamship Company, the Providence, Warren and Bristol Railroad Company, and the Boston and Providence Railroad Company, for the establishment of the line by way of Bristol. The Neptune Company will furnish first-class side-wheel steamers, to be constructed with special reference to this service, that they may be entirely secure in the roughest weather. These boats the Company have already contracted for, and work upon them has commenced. The Bristol Railroad Company have awarded the contract for the extension of wharf facilities at Bristol, and that work is also progressing. This job embraces about four thousand cubic yards of masonry, and fifty thousand cubic yards of earth embankment, and its completion will afford ample water accommodations in one of the finest harbors in the world. The Boston and Providence Company are now building a number of first-class, modern passenger cars for the line, and a powerful locomotive will be at once put under contract. The steamboat train between Boston and Bristol will be a ""lightning express,"" to go through over the Seekonk branch in one and a half hours. It is proposed to make this exclusively a passenger route, and to combine every advantage that can contribute to its safety, speed and elegant comfort. Passengers will arrive in Bristol from Boston so as to make the transfer to the boat by daylight, in the Summer season, and will be able to get supper before they leave the bay. Passengers from New-York will have a good night's rest, and yet arrive in Boston in season for the earliest trains for the North and East. The new line is to go into operation on the 1st of June next.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d909bda7-5dbc-555b-810d-5b6fa029d5e4,898,nyt://article/d909bda7-5dbc-555b-810d-5b6fa029d5e4,

Nobody in this community doubts that he has committed the State Prison offence of forgery. Yet there is a general feeling that he will escape a felon's punishment -- a common belief in the future verification of his own reported words, that ""it would be all settled in a few days, and in six months he would walk Wall-street as coolly as he did before the transaction."" The presumption is that money and social influence will somehow manage to extricate him from the law. The result of the legal proceedings which have been commenced against him will be generally taken as a test of the strength of the law. New-York justice will be on trial as well as KETCHUM himself. If it does not adjudge him to be a forger, and sentence him accordingly, it will itself be pronounced, by general verdict, to be a vile counterfeit.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Will He be Punished?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Will He be Punished?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e71fdc22-d2bb-5216-9503-2518aacb2e5c,832,nyt://article/e71fdc22-d2bb-5216-9503-2518aacb2e5c,

Gen. THOMAS, a member of the court, said he understood the prisoner had been handcuffed while in prison. He could see no necessity for such rigid treatment, especially as the prisoner is always attended by guards. Col. CHIPMAN explained that the handcuffing was at the instance of the counsel for the accused, as on the day counsel deserted him, him said he would never again appear in court, and as the prisoner seemed to meditate suicide. Mr. BAKER now saw no necessity for handcuffing the prisoner, and presumed that the continuance of it arose from misapprehension, and would not be repeated from anything heretfore said by the prisoner's counsel. Col. PERSONS, at one time commanding the past at Andersonville, showed that WIRZ was assigned to the prison by Gen. WINDER, and had full charge of it. The witness had subsequently prayed the Judge in the neighborhood to abate the nuisance, but was obliged to abandon the case at the instance of Gen. COBB.

"Returned Soldiers, Work for",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/31/archives/work-for-returned-soldiers.html,"Returned Soldiers, Work for","-- There is in Berlin and other continental cities an organization on the principle of the London Shoeblack Brigade, the members of which are known as Dienstmaenner, or errand men. They are uniformed, systematically governed and distributed, like a police; and they are guaranteed, under proper security, to be honest and faithful in the performance of duty. Veterans from the army have the preference among the candidates for admission to this corps; and it is mainly disabled veterans who avail themselves of the privilege. Indeed, the discipline of punctuality and obedience obtained in a military life is peculiarly fitted to prepare them for this employment. The errand-men carry messages, packages, &c., from and to all parts of the city and suburbs. They are not allowed to refuse any proper errand simply because it is not to their taste, nor to charge for their services more than the regular prices, the tariff of which is determined by the Board of Supervision, according to the distance, time and labor involved in each class of cases. We remember being highly amused, many years ago, at a scene in Berlin, between a professional shoe-black and a professional errand-man. The boy had summoned the old veteran, and ordered him to go forthwith to the remotest suburb of the city, and buy him a new blacking-brush, at the same time placing in his hand the smallest fee allowed by law for the service. In vain the old man protested that there were blacking-brushes to be had round the corner, that the commission given required a journey of seven miles, that it was a case not contemplated by the law, &c. Young Germany stood on his rights, and made the servant of the public know his place.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WORK FOR RETURNED SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WORK FOR RETURNED SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5bdccfe7-bd08-5849-8022-3fcf8d0df196,383,nyt://article/5bdccfe7-bd08-5849-8022-3fcf8d0df196,

After volubly impressing upon all who would hear him his intense respect and veneration for the only true Church, and his love for her ministers, (those who could convey the coveted lands of course being meant,) he culminated in a brilliant idea. He had somehow learned that the Spanish Catholics were very partial to the prefix ""San,"" and he knew that it meant ""Saint;"" so, winding up a speech intended to be eulogistic of all the saints in the calendar, he said: ""Now, venerable fathers and laymen, allow me to propose that, on this memorable occasion, we add one more to the brilliant galaxy of sacred names in this beautiful land -- one more saint to the glorious list that honor the Golden State; I propose, Sirs, that this mountain on which we are now standing be hereafter and forever known as San Diablo."" It is recorded that the worthy fathers were for a moment in doubt whether to be indignant or pass ""Saint Devil"" off as a joke, and the question was never fully settled; but the ambitious sponsor, somehow or other, never got the land, and would always insist that the priests were a stupid lot of humbugs.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-08-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8ce946a-af1d-5b80-8314-a92be753984e,804,nyt://article/a8ce946a-af1d-5b80-8314-a92be753984e,

The Mutuals were short of four of their first nine -- WANSLEY, ZELLER, MCMAHON and PATTERSON -- but had very good substitutes. The Actives, on the contrary, were never in better trim for play, and made the best display of batting and fielding they have exhibited this season, with the exception of their game with the Athletics in Philadelphia. The game opened favorably for the Actives, and they held their advantage till the sixth inning, when the game turned, and the Mutuals took the lead. But the Actives afterward rallied, and at the finish of the ninth inning the game was a tie -- 19 to 19. The tenth inning both drew a blank; on the eleventh, the Mutuals scored three and the Actives two -- the Mutuals winning by the score of 22 to 21.

CARME before an American audience, at Cooper Institute, in April last, he issued a series of challengee to the following purport: First, to play any man in America a match at the three-ball French game; second, the same at the four-ball American game, push-shot omitted; third, for the American championship, according to the established rules. In the challenge it was expressly stipulated that the two first games were to be played on a second-sized table, of the manufacture of Messrs. PHELAN & COLLENDER, and with balls 2 5-16 inches in diameter. After considerable time hod elapsed, Mr. PHELAN, whom M. CARME had delegated to act for him in the matter, received a note from the editor of Wilkes' Spirit, stating that the challenges had been accepted by DUDLEY KAVANAGH, who was then champion, and requesting that Mr. PHELAN would appoint a time to put up forfeit, &c. This was promptly responded to by the latter, but owing to the absence, at intervals, of both parties from the city, they had no meeting until about the 1st of July. On this occasion Mr. PHELAN waited on Mr. WILKES with a written agreement, in which all the details -- size of table, and everything else necessary -were stipulated. On reading the portion in regard to the dimensions of the table, Mr. WILKES remarked that as he was not a billiard player, and as another gentleman was about to be appointed in his stead to act for KAVANAGH, he preferred that the portion referred to should be stricken out and left to future arbitration. This was agreed to, and on putting up the forfeit, ($1,500 -- $500 on each match,) Mr. PHELAN called a witness to the stipulation, that in case the other party insisted that a second-sized table should be of the same height as a full-sized table, then there was no match made and no stake forfeited. Thus the affair remained until within a week, when a gentleman called on Mr. PHELAN, with a note from Mr. WILKES, stating that the bearer had been appointed to act for KAVANAGH in the matches made between the latter and M. CARME. Of course Mr. PHELAN denied that such matches were made -they were undoubtedly in the course of negotiation, and as a forfeit had been put up should all the other conditions be complied with, the first game would be played on the 5th of October; therefore, while it was desirable that the arrangements should be completed at an early day, he (Mr. PHELAN) was determined that they should be carried out in exact accordance with the original proposition, or not at all.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Billiards.; THE CARME-KAVANAGH MATCHES A SCREW LOOSE FOX AND DEERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Billiards.; THE CARME-KAVANAGH MATCHES A SCREW LOOSE FOX AND DEERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Billiards', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d20b5bcd-045e-56a0-ae4c-69cc95d53d22,704,nyt://article/d20b5bcd-045e-56a0-ae4c-69cc95d53d22,

Crossings and Obstructions,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/08/31/archives/barclaystreet-travel.html,Crossings and Obstructions,"-- The police authorities have recently laid the community under an obligation by increasing the police force at the crossing of Fulton-street and Broadway. We now call their attention to another locality where the foot travel is equally difficult and dangerous. The crossing from the Hoboken Ferry to Barclay-street is an undertaking of frequent terror to hundreds of passengers. There are two policemen always stationed there, whose duties are performed, as is apparent to all, in the most zealous and judicious manner, but they have enough and too much to do at the crossing proper, and cannot possibly attend to the interval between West-street and the ferry gate, which is crowded with vehicles, hackmen, wagons from the steam pier next door, and a miscellaneous crowd. After the passengers cross to Barclay-street, there is another difficulty. The sidewalks at and beyond the south corner of Barclay and West streets are choked up by a crowd of loafers, salesmen, barrels, baskets, boxes, &c., none of which have any business there, and the removal of which would allow the main crossing from the ferry to be cleared in much quicker time than at present. At Washington-street there should always be an officer, or at least at crowded hours of the day, and another should be stationed at the Greenwich-street crossing. The daily narrow escapes at these two places are very numerous. The thousands who, night and morning, have to storm these crossings, and crowd at a snail's pace through the sidewalk labyrinth in Barclay-street, between West and Washington streets, would hail the presence of more police force with real delight.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BARCLAY-STREET TRAVEL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BARCLAY-STREET TRAVEL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-08-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6cd806c-f00c-584f-b9b5-b65ee6840673,267,nyt://article/d6cd806c-f00c-584f-b9b5-b65ee6840673,
