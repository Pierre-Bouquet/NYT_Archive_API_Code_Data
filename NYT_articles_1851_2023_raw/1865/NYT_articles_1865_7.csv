Volunteer Committee; Report of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/01/archives/the-record-of-the-volunteer-committee.html,Volunteer Committee; Report of,"-- The array of figures presented in the interesting report of the Volunteer Committee is too formidable to be grasped in a cursory survey. But one or two salient facts may be noticed. The city and county contributed to the national army 116,382 men. Of these, 53,544 were raised without any bounty. The average of the terms of service was nearly two years and a quarter; and the average cost per man for those who received bounties, hand-money, and expenses of equipment, and Family Relief Fund was $463 80. The bounties amounted in all to $9,317,612; the premiums to $552,715. The expenses converted with the payment of bounties appear to be excessive -- $724,064 -- but, perhaps, all this outlay may have been necessary in keeping the Enlistment Bureau in operation. The expenses not connected with bounties reached the gross sum of $6,918,281; making the grand total expenditure no less than $17,512,673. A portion of this has been reimbursed from the National Treasury and by the State; and a claim is held for settlement, which, with the actual repayments, according to the report, will reduce the net outlay by the city and county, to $14,577,214. Whether the expenditure has been characterized by discretion and economy, it would be impossible to gather from the bald tubular statements before us. But this much is apparent, that no community in this or any other country ever taxed itself voluntarily in support of a national war with the same ungrudging liberality.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE RECORD OF THE VOLUNTEER COMMITTEE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE RECORD OF THE VOLUNTEER COMMITTEE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38a56dde-1424-51ed-a5a9-1aed3e7dd1ff,247,nyt://article/38a56dde-1424-51ed-a5a9-1aed3e7dd1ff,

One of the arguments most strongly urged by the advocates of immediate and universal freedmen suffrage, is that without this regulation, a vote in the South will have twice the political power of a vote in the North. While, under slavery, the Southern vote, cast by the white man, carried three-fifths more power than a northern vote, it would now, they say, carry five-fifths more.

City Inspector's Annual Tour of the Streets,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/01/archives/condition-of-the-streets-city-inspector-boole-lays-by-the-shovel.html,City Inspector's Annual Tour of the Streets,"The City Inspector and several gentlemen connected with his department, accompanied by the representatives of the press, yesterday made their annual tour of the city to inspect the condition of the streets, so far as relates to their cleanliness. The party first visited the eastern side of the city, passing through Frankfort, Dover, Forsyth, Water, Rutgers, Baxter, Pitt, Broome, Mulberry, Bleecker, the Bowery, and First and Second avenues, and thence passed to the west side for the purpose of inspecting the swill-milk establishments and the abattoirs in Thirty-ninth-street. The route taken included the very worst portions of the city, so far as cleanliness is concerned, and where the rate of mortality ranges the highest. Dover-street, one of the first visited, was found to be quite as clean as Broadway is at the present time, notwithstanding the fact that the inhabitants are principally poor people. From Dover-street the party passed into Water-street, with its low groggeries and dance-houses, sailors' boarding-houses and junk shops. This street, from the constant traffic passing through it, is in very bad condition. The holes worn in the pavement allow the accumulation of stagnant water; but this can hardly be laid to the account of the City Inspector. Water and filth will accumulate in these holes in defiance of all efforts to keep the streets clean. From Water-street a visit was paid to Roosevelt-street, Oliver, Market, Gouverneur and Grand streets. The pavement in the last-named street is also in bad condition, and small pools of stagnant water were occasionally to be met with. Pitt-street was one of the dirtiest streets visited, but it is only fair to say that the filth appeared to be principally garbage, which had been thrown out very recently, and was not in a state of decomposition. Baxter-street was somewhat similar. The upper part of First and Second-avenues is occupied by the large iron firms, who appear to think that they have a prescriptive right to that portion of the streets in front of their premises. It is almost needless to say that, in front of these establishments, there were mounds of earth and ashes which render the streets in parts almost impassable. Those who place these obtructions there ought to be compelled to remove them forthwith. The western part of the city was next visited. A passing gl[???]ce was afforded at the swill-milk establishments, and at the bone and fat-boiling establishments in Abattoir-place, leading from Thirty-ninth-street. The gutters in Abattoir-place are filled with green stagnant water, and the fumes from the establishments are sufficient to sicken anyone coming within a mile of them. Fortunately, this neighborhood is not thickly populated; but will it be believed that similar establishments exist in Elizabeth-street, surrounded by crowded tenement-houses? In this street is a fat-boiling house, belonging to one of the wealthiest firms in the city, the fumes from which establishment are sufficient to nauseate the strongest stomach. The City Inspector has repeatedly called the attention of the Mayor and the Common Council to these nuisances, having no power whatever to remove them himself; but, from some cause or other, no action has ever been taken in the matter.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONDITION OF THE STREETS; City Inspector Boole Lays By the Shovel and the Broom.

KIRKMAN, about eighteen months since, was fearfully burned while in the discharge of his duty at the old Bell Tower, which caught fire while he was arranging his lights. His injuries, although severe, have not prevented him from the performance of his duties faithfully since his recovery. The minority of the board express an intention of resigning, in consequence of what they characterize the heartless action of the majority in this matter. The facts in connection with this affair are stated as follows: A short time since there was an election for Clerk of the Board, (salary $500,) and the then incumbent found a majority of one against his reelection. (The board consists of five members.) A bargain, it is asserted, was then entered into with one of the majority, who agreed to vote for the reelection of the old clerk, (a man named DONEVAN,) provided the bell-ringers were removed and friends of his put in their places.

The torpedoes were placed on board of the United States torpedo-steamer Naubuc, which sailed from the Navy-yard on Tuesday, and anchored below Governor's Island, where the tests were made, in the presence of the following distinguished gentlemen: Rear-Admiral Gregory; A.A. Low, Esq., President of the Chamber of Commerce; Capt Bythssa, of H.B.M. Navy; Capt. Kichkin, Engineer in the Russian Imperial Fleet; Capt. Mordier, of the French navy; Commodore Ringgold, Capt. Warden, Chief Engineer Wood, the inventor, and others. Shells were exploded at the depth of 15 feet, and one from the bow, in the usual shape of a buoyant percussion shell, containing a charge of 60 pounds, which raised a large column of water, submarine shells, &c. This torpedo was exploded about one-quarter of a mile from the vessel, near Governor's Island, with terrible effect. The tests were most gratifying and successful, there being no failure in any case, the time occupied being but a very few minutes, dearly demonstrating the efficiency and destructive power of these torpedoes.

The Eckford nine opened play with some very lively batting, something quite in their old style, while their fielding was excellent after the first inning, in which they had not their in-field as well placed as in the succeeding innings. The Newark party did not get well into their work until after the fifth inning, when the nine began to display the ability they evidently possess, their opponents having but little to boast of in regard to superior play, either in batting or fielding, as the score shows, for though in the first five innings the disparity in the score did not speak favorably for the Newarkers, in the last four innings the score showed a marked degree of improvement, the Eckfords only obtaining four runs. Several fine fly catches were made on both sides, but the best were taken by the Eckfords.

Admits that Slavery is Dead; in Favor of Free Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/01/archives/two-live-kentuckians.html,Admits that Slavery is Dead; in Favor of Free Labor,"Gov. BRAMLETTE evidently does not belong to the Mallory school of fossils. He has his eyes open, and instead of butting his brains out against the solid facts of the day, he recognizes them, and governs himself accordingly. He very plainly tells the people of Kentucky that slavery is dead, and recommends that they at once proceed to install free labor in its place. This is sound sense. He does not stop to mourn over the dear departed, nor to quarrel with the manner of the taking off, but goes cheerfully to work to ""bury his dead out of his sight,"" stow away the emblems of mourning, and urge his people to take their proper place in the ranks of the regenerated States. The Governor was more than kind to ""the institution"" during its mortal illness; but now that all is over, he presents a conspicuous example of common sense as well as loyalty -- an example that the bats, of whom Mr. MALLORY is such an excellent specimen, would do well to follow. It should also be noted that the sometime head and front of rebellion in Kentucky, Gov. BERIAH MAGOFFIN, has come out emphatically for free labor; he, too, has taken a deliberate look at the defunct institution, and counts it past doctoring -- its eyes are set. MAGOFFIN was one of the loudest and most active of the pro-slavery zealots, and did, perhaps, more than any other Kentuckian to drive that State into the secession conspiracy. The failure was from no fault of his, for he worked with almost superhuman energy to achieve success. When such high priests in the Southern ranks come over to the side of freedom and loyalty, we may reasonably look for an early stampede of their so long deluded followers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TWO LIVE KENTUCKIANS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'TWO LIVE KENTUCKIANS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc5b9332-95c6-5b5b-840e-300cf1c779cf,298,nyt://article/cc5b9332-95c6-5b5b-840e-300cf1c779cf,

Last year, the records of the coroner's office showed that no less than three hundred interments of unknown people had been made at Potter's Field. This is an appalling and a shameful fact Scarcely a day passes that we do not report some unfortunate ""found drowned,"" and the publicity thus given by the journals to such events, has been the sole opportunity afforded the friends of missing persons for gaining information. A small and very inconvenient dead-house at Bellevue Hospital has been hitherto the only place of temporary deposit for those dead taken from the rivers and out of the streets, and often it has been absolutely necessary to remove remains from this over-crowded receptacle before a reasonable time had elapsed to claim or recognize them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A MORGUE TO BE ESTABLISHED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A MORGUE TO BE ESTABLISHED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e32de669-8adc-56a3-a6ec-85931804d721,291,nyt://article/e32de669-8adc-56a3-a6ec-85931804d721,

It is marked by very full legal knowledge, and by a clear application of legal principles to the several branches of the topics discussed. Mr. KIRKLAND deems it important to carry into full effect the law of treason, in the cases of the leading agents of the rebellion, and that confiscation and disfranchisement should be inflicted as just penalties upon large numbers who acted with them. Concerning the other branch of the subject, Mr. KIRKLAND maintains that the rebel States have never been out of the Union, and that the constitutional rights of the States must be maintained inviolate. He holds that the National Government has no control over the question of negro suffrage, and that this matter may be safely left to the future population of the rebel states.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Hon.

"The members of this healthy and hearty society gave their annual ""Pic-nic and Summer Night's Festival"" at Lion Park, on Thursday last. Lion Park is located on One Hundred and Tenth-street, between Eighth and Tenth avenues. It is approached most, readily from the first-named thoroughfare, where the care are always to be found. Mr. PAUL FALK has recently become the lessee of the park and its surroundings. He has constructed an open-air concert hall of huge dimensions and elegant design. There is nothing like it in America. Here, then, twice a week, concerts are given under the direction of Mr. THEODORE THOMAS, and here, too, all the first-class German festivals take place. It would be difficult to imagine a more delicious spot. Occupying very high ground it possesses the great advantage of being always cool. At night-time, when it is lighted up with innumerable gas-lamps, the spectacle is almost fairy-like. This was especially the case on Thursday last, when, in addition to Mr. FALK's preparations, the members of the Arion Society exerted themselves to make their festival and the place in which it occurred beautiful. The hall and grounds were decorated with variegated lamps, arbors, evergreens, &c. The exercises commenced early in the afternoon, and terminated late the next morning. They included a grand vocal and instrumental concert, under the direction of Mr. THEODORE THOMAS; a series of comic processions -- satirizing the political and social events of the day; a fine display of fireworks, and lastly, but not leastly, a grand ball. The best of temper prevailed. Nothing indeed could have been more orderly or enjoyable.

Brackett and Briggs Horse Cruelty Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/02/archives/atrocious-cruelty-a-horse-to-trot-from-boston-to-portland-in-one.html,Brackett and Briggs Horse Cruelty Case,"About two weeks ago, Mr. EDWARD BRACKETT, of this city, mode a wager of $1,000 that his horse Lyon would trot from this city to Portland in one day -- that is, between the hours of sunrise and sunset. The animal is a black gelding, large and thin in flesh, weighs come ten hundred, stands sixteen hands high, is a little over ten years of age, and was raised in Maine. Since the race was arranged, it has excited a good deal of speculation among horse men in this city and vicinity, and considerable money has been wagered on the result, those well acquainted with the endurance of the animal being perfectly willing to invest their stamps in his favor. The horse was to go to harness, and it was expressly stipulated that he should travel the old stage road to the Forest City, the distance being computed to be about 116 miles. The attempt to drive a horse this distance in a single day, over a rough road, is, we believe, unprecedented, although several noted matches against time are fresh in our memory. Two or more horses in this country have accomplished the feat of trotting 20 miles in one hour, and a few years since a man undertook to drive a horse 100 miles in 10 hours, on one of the Long Island racing courses. The animal went some 98 or 99 miles well inside of time, but fell dead on the track with the feat so nearly accomplished. Mr. BRACKETT's horse had some minutes more than 15 hours to do the 116 miles, and previous to starting the odds were that the feat would be accomplished. Lyon was put in training ton days ago, and up to the day of the race easily did his exercise of Sixty miles per day.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ATROCIOUS CRUELTY.; A Horse to Trot from Boston to Portland in One Day The Animal Dies Near the End of his Journey.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ATROCIOUS CRUELTY.; A Horse to Trot from Boston to Portland in One Day The Animal Dies Near the End of his Journey.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Boston Post', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a2c8d7f-beb5-5726-8b37-56769d988c82,706,nyt://article/6a2c8d7f-beb5-5726-8b37-56769d988c82,

Mr. SHERBURNE SOMERBY, of Portsmouth, accompanied with another team, and Mr. CHAS. KIMBALL and a friend in a wagon with Wilton Maid, a sorrel mare, 850 pounds, as far as Portsmouth. The animal reached Portsmouth at 10:45, an average of nine miles an hour. Here he was sponged and refreshed and started again at noon. The poor animal was within six miles of Portland, with an hour and a quarter of time left, when he suddenly showed signs of great exhaustion, fell and died. This horse has been several times lately driven as much as 75 miles a day, merely for exercise, and it is thought that with an half hour's rest this side of Portland he might have gone through in time. He was worth several hundred dollars. There were, beside the original bet of $1000, many subordinate bets, pending in different quarters. The horse was 14 years old. We hope a similar cruel feat will not soon be attempted.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b13f485-228e-5b25-a960-d4f898288f02,1544,nyt://article/6b13f485-228e-5b25-a960-d4f898288f02,

Schutzen Corps left for Bremen,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/02/archives/international-rifle-festival-departure-of-the-newyork-schutzen.html,Schutzen Corps left for Bremen,"Yesterday the steamers Matlaman and Chicopee sailed from the dock of the Bremen Steamship Company, at Hoboken, and rushed forth into the river laden with a dense mass of perspiring humanity, green-clad riflemen and good wishes generally. The occasion of this very general exodus from New-York heat and dust was the sailing of a deputation of skilled marksmen from the New-York Schutzen Corps, delegated to represent the sharpshooting fraternity at the second grand Bremen rifle march. The New-York organization, it will be remembered. distinguished itself in the early part of June last, when the three days' festivities in Jones' Wood pretty conclusively demonstrated that there were good marksmen enough in the number to represent worthily the tolerably large fraternity of riflemen. The rapid manner in which the Schutzen Corps heartlessly demolished a large double headed Austrian eagle that had been erected as a target, was proof sufficient that they would have a fair chance at winning some of the laurels destined to grace the brows of the best marksmen. The Bremen Festival will commence on Sunday, July 16, and will come to a close on Sunday, July 23. None will be allowed to compete for the several minor prizes but members of the German Sharpshooters' Union and individual guests. These last, even, will be excluded from the competition for the two principal prizes. Upon the grounds will be erected a ball-room, an immense dining-room and a telegraph office. A daily journal will be published from the 13th inst. to the 24th, giving all information relative to the progress of the match. Dancing and instrumental concerts, by the band of the Hanoverian Hussars, will be features of the daily exercises. Riflemen from all parts of the world will be present, including this, the delegation from New-York, and representatives from St. Louis, Louisville and Milwaukee.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'INTERNATIONAL RIFLE FESTIVAL.; Departure of the New-York Schutzen Corps to Take Part in the Bremen Shooting Match.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'INTERNATIONAL RIFLE FESTIVAL.; Departure of the New-York Schutzen Corps to Take Part in the Bremen Shooting Match.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fe3383a2-c6c2-5536-bd16-3fdcadb82e04,1227,nyt://article/fe3383a2-c6c2-5536-bd16-3fdcadb82e04,

The question was as to whether they would disband at once or not, but it was finally decided to hold on until the 1st of August, by which time, we hope, the new commission will have got things in working order. There is not a very pleasant feeling in the old department on account of the causeless abuse and slanders of certain public journals; but we urge upon the old firemen the wisdom of doing their duty to the very last.

If the enterprise is intended to furnish new proofs of the genius of Mr. THOMAS NAST, that intention is fully realized. The title-page, whether as a specimen of drawing, perspective, power of caricaturing is equal to the best efforts of JOHN LEECH or RICHARD DOYLE, whose works are as well known here as in Europe. But if wit, without unkindness, humor, without coarseness, criticism, without favoritism, be aimed at, number 2 of Mrs. Grundy must be a great improvement on number 1 before the object be reached. Dress reform is too trite a subject with which to fill a couple of columns. It may be well enough to acknowledge the existence of other languages than our own, but there was no need for Mrs. Grundy to be pedantic. There is too evident a personal feeling in the criticism Miss HOSMER, and the writer on art has surely an eye to some envied rival. Mrs. Grundy's title-page is a magnificent piece of art.

The official statement does not differ materially from the verbal report brought hither a few days ago by the delegates. In one item of the agreement, the colonists have struck even a better bargain than they could have anticipated. The purchase-money of the Hudson Bay Company, which will probably reach the sum of ten or twelve million dollars, is to be guaranteed by the Home Government, as well as the loans necessary for building the fortifications. All the forts are to be supplied with their armament, absolutely at the expense of the British War Office. And the Lords of the Admiralty have come under a promise to supply, when occasion shall call for it, a naval armament on the lakes. This implies that the Provincial canals are to be enlarged to admit the passage of larger craft than can use them now.

He retired from business in 1830, and has since that time devoted himself mainly to the care of his real estate here, and to the active and laborious supervision of his large farm at Jerusalem South, on Long Island.

The rates are high enough to please the stockholders -- doubtless. They are probably high enough even to satisfy the purposes and subserve the interests of general stock operators in New-York. A pound sterling a word -- nothing less than twenty words counted -- to and from Great Britain; a guinea a word to the Continent of Europe; and twenty-five shillings sterling a word to connecting points in Asia and Africa ought to pay if the line works at all. The Company being sensible that their tariff is framed to suit the purses of a select circle of patrons, apologize for it, on the ground that they only want a select circle of patrons. Just so. But we doubt, whether the circle is not made a fraction too select by this remarkable scale, to give public satisfaction. At the rate at which the electricians reckon their ability to transmit messages -- which is eight words per minute, the line can be made to transmit four million words a year. It takes but little reckoning to sum up what this would bring in the way of revenue. At one pound sterling a word, the directors, by their own admissions, must calculate on an income of $20,000,000.

Yesterday, Engine No. 8 threw out a banner with the inscription, ""Apartments to let -- Inquire of Jack Perry"" -- meaning JOHN H. PERRY, one of the Fire Commissioners. Last night a special meeting of the Board of Representatives was held at Firemen's Hall, HENRY M. DIXON, President, in the chair. A communication was presented from the Fire Commissioners, notifying the board of their action in disbanding the companies heretofore published. On motion of Mr. SHIELDS, Hose No. 8, the board refused to receive the communication. A committee of five was then appointed to wait upon Mayor WOOD to protest against the action of the commissioners in removing KIRKMAN and AMES, the crippled bell-ringers. The following gentlemen comprise the committee; -- James Stack, Engine No. 1; Charles P. Dower, Engine No. 13: George Bond, Engine No. 6; Michael Shields, Hose No. 8, Wm. Johnson, Hose No. 9. Mr. JOHN GACONY, Secretary of the Board, then moved that a committee, consisting of one from each company, be appointed to draw up resolutions expressing the sense of the department regarding the action of the commissioners on the disbandment question. This motion elicited a warm and interesting discussion, in the course of which Mr. JOHNSON, of Hose No. 9, stated that when he asked a certain commissioner to vote for the opponent of DONEVAN, he was told that if he did so, his company would be disbanded, and his company was disbanded. Mr. DIXON, the President, left his chair, and spoke at length on partisan feeling injuring the department, but the committee was finally unanimously appointed. The nominees of the commission who appeared before Mayor WOOD for confirmation as bell-ringers have not received his indorsement, and he told one of them that he thought he was better calculated for a prize fighter than a bell-ringer.

"Detective Officer RICHARD FIELD, of the Fifth Ward, reached town at 8 o'clock last evening, having in custody the negro WM.H. CALHOUN, the murderer of Dr. WM. MURPHY, of No. 372 Canal-street. CALHOUN, who is scarcely darker than a native West Indian, is an athletic and well-formed negro, of about 45 years of age. On the day of the homicide, he had indulged in deep potations; indeed, he had hardly drawn a sober breath from the time of his liberation from the Jefferson Market Prison, where he had been incarcerated for fighting with his wife -- a white woman -- only a week previous. Befogged with gin, he resented a remark which Dr. MURPHY addressed to him, and a clench followed, resulting in a mortal thrust of a butcher knife, penetrating Dr. MURPHY's neck. CALHOUN fled, and Patrolman LENZ took the wounded man to the New-York Hospital, where he died four days thereafter, on the 28th ult. An inquest was held by Coroner GOVER, and the jury rendered a verdict against CALHOUN, and thereupon the Coroner gave Capt. PETTY a warrant for the arrest of the murderer. The negro's whereabouts were unknown until Friday last, when Capt. PETTY ascertained that immediately after the stabbing, he had taken passage in the steamer Metropolis, for Newport, and that there he had engaged as waiter on board the new steamer Newport. Officer FIELD was sent at once to capture him. He reached Newport at about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning, and on going aboard the new steamer, learned that CALHOUN was asleep in the ""glory hole,"" or forecastle. He was called thence, ironed, taken to Newport jail, and there hold until yesterday forenoon, when Officer FIELD embarked with him for this city.

CALHOUN, the murderer of Dr. WM. MURPHY, of No. 372 Canal-street. CALHOUN, who is scarcely darker than a native West Indian, is an athletic and well-formed negro, of about 45 years of age. On the day of the homicide, he had indulged in deep potations; indeed, he had hardly drawn a sober breath from the time of his liberation from the Jefferson Market Prison, where he had been incarcerated for fighting with his wife -- a white woman -- only a week previous. Befogged with gin, he resented a remark which Dr. MURPHY addressed to him, and a clench followed, resulting in a mortal thrust of a butcher knife, penetrating Dr. MURPHY's neck. CALHOUN fled, and Patrolman LENZ took the wounded man to the New-York Hospital, where he died four days thereafter, on the 28th ult. An inquest was held by Coroner GOVER, and the jury rendered a verdict against CALHOUN, and thereupon the Coroner gave Capt. PETTY a warrant for the arrest of the murderer. The negro's whereabouts were unknown until Friday last, when Capt. PETTY ascertained that immediately after the stabbing, he had taken passage in the steamer Metropolis, for Newport, and that there he had engaged as waiter on board the new steamer Newport. Officer FIELD was sent at once to capture him. He reached Newport at about 4 o'clock on Sunday morning, and on going aboard the new steamer, learned that CALHOUN was asleep in the ""glory hole,"" or forecastle. He was called thence, ironed, taken to Newport jail, and there hold until yesterday forenoon, when Officer FIELD embarked with him for this city. The prisoner was held in the Fifth Ward Police-station last night, and is to be delivered to Coroner GOVER this morning. CALHOUN's wife is now in prison for drunkenness.

The public fully appreciated the moral grandeur of the festival. The all-pervasive sentiment, finding its expression in public utterances and private merrymakings, was profound gratitude at the happy issue of the terrible ordeal through which the nation has just passed victoriously. This feeling of gratitude, though dominant, was tempered, nevertheless, by the saddened memories which must cling for long, long years to the epoch of the rebellion. There was devout joy at the salvation of the country, redeemed from the dark stigma of slavery, and established on surer and better foundations as the land of a free people, whose right to self-government has been vindicated before the world, and whose success finds a response of thankfulness in the hearts of the down-trodden and oppressed among all peoples.

If the Federal Government were, as it soon may be, in the hands of the Democratic party, we think Harper's would change its opinion. If Congress and the President were to say to the Southern States --you must disfranchise every loyal man in your borders and return every negro to slavery, as a condition of readmission, Harper's Weekly would deny their right to impose any such conditions, even if they did ""deem them necessary to the public safety."" The hypothesis is, perhaps, an extreme one; but it tests the principle involved. The government has not the right to make its ideas of the ""public safety,"" the sole and exclusive guide of its action in dealing with the Southern States.

Assassins; the Verdict Against,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/07/archives/the-verdict-against-the-assassins.html,Assassins; the Verdict Against,"The justice of the verdict in the case of the conspirators if the 14th of April is such as to command the approval of the whole country, and what is of high importance in this instance -- of history. Of the eight culprits, who were under trial before the Military Commission, four (HERROLD, ATZEROTH, PAYNE and Mrs. SURRAT) are condemned to death, the sentence to be carried into execution this day under military authority; and of the remaining four, three (O'LAUGHLIN, ARNOLD and MUDD,) are condemned to hard labor for life in the penitentiary, while SPANGLER, is to be confined for six years. There will doubtless be some who, at first view, will consider the sentence, upon the four persons last-named, altogether too lenient. Their complicity in the great crime of the age was proven beyond all question, and the sentiment of inexorable justice would seem to demand the highest penalty upon every one who had any share in it. But the simple fact that the verdict as a whole, and in each of its parts, was pronounced by a board of high military officers, who patiently gathered and collated all the facts, weighed all the evidence, and listened to all the arguments of counsel on both sides, -- who had ample time for deliberation, and who appreciated their great responsibility; and the additional fact that the finding of the commission has been approved in all its parts by the President, will modify any such opinion that might hastly be formed, and will tend to convince every one that substantial justice has been the result of the trial, even though it has been tempered with mercy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Verdict Against the Assassins.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Verdict Against the Assassins.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/31da59e5-4a1f-5377-8cae-456f90c2759a,564,nyt://article/31da59e5-4a1f-5377-8cae-456f90c2759a,
"Illinois, Central, Prices in",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/07/archives/before-and-after-the-war.html,"Illinois, Central, Prices in","In a populous district of Central Illinois, before the war broke out, potatoes were to be had for 12 1/2 cents a bushel, chickens 10 cents apiece, eggs 5 cents a dozen, butter 6 cents, beef from 4 to 6 cents, mutton from 4 to 5 cents. Potatoes are now sold in the same district at $1 50 per bushel, chickens at 40 cents apiece, eggs 25 cents a dozen, butter 40 cents, beef 20 to 25 cents, and mutton 15 to 20 cents. Some allowance, doubtless, has to be made in this comparison for the growth of the marketing town, and the consequent increase in the number of consumers at the market. But when allowance is made for such increase, the fact that the price of potatoes is to-day twelve-fold what it was five years ago, in a fine agricultural district, is not a healthy sign. The great fear with reflecting people is, that war prices may become chronic with us. There can be no reason for this as applies to articles of home growth and home production.

But in Virginia, on the other hand, the land-owners are combining to keep out Northern immigration, by agreements to make no sales to men from the North. This spirit not only exists among the old Secessionists, but seems to infect a portion at least of the so-called loyal people of the State. Gov. PEIRPOINT's legislature refused to incorporate a company which had been formed to buy and sell unemployed land, for the furtherance of immigration from the North, although the Governor himself had recommended the measure in strong terms.

Once he was at Mrs. SURRATT's in company with them. He called with SURRATT and ATZEROTH at the tavern in Surrattsville, and left the two carbines and ammunition which were taken away from the tavern by him and BOOTH on the night of the assassination.

There can be no doubt whatever of his guilt.

The Gazette gives this sketch of his life: ""The life of Dr. GRUNDY was one of great activity in the ministry, to which he dedicated himself at an early age. He was a native of Kentucky and a graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary. His first settlement as a pastor, we believe -- at least it occurred early in his ministerial career -- was at Maysville, Kentucky. There he labored zealously and effectively for many years, until, because of the decline of the city, the field became too contracted for his acknowledged abilities, and he was prevailed upon to accept a call from the Second Presbyterian Church at Memphis, Tenn. There he labored until the rebellion broke up the relations between himself and his church. He refused to relinquish his attachment for the Union, and this fact, although he took no active part against the rebel cause -- which, of course, he could not do while within the rebel lines, and surrounded by rebel bayonets -- caused him to be driven from his church. Be remained at Memphis, however, preaching most of the time in a public hall, without compensation, until that city was occupied by the Union forces. Soon thereafter he was called to the pulpit of the Central Presbyterian Church of this city, and at the same time he received a call from Chilicothe. He finally accepted the former, and about three years ago he was installed as pastor of that church, where he has since labored earnestly and successfully.""",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Obituary.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a202d2a-971d-5364-8063-c7796cd819a0,462,nyt://article/6a202d2a-971d-5364-8063-c7796cd819a0,

The reasons then adduced were fair, and so acknowledged to be by the public. Not only was gold at 250, but there had been a terrible drouth, burning up everything green on the face of the earth. Now, however, all the causes for high prices have disappeared, and it is quite time that the price be reduced to the old rate, six cents a quart. The price paid to farmers by even first-class dealers, is, we understand, five cents per quart for the pure article. There is hardly any of this sold by retail pure, but on the contrary from 20 to 40 per cent. of water and salt is added according to the conscience of the dealer. Of course there are ways of detecting the adulteration, no less than there are methods of forcing down the price. We would counsel the milk trade to lose no time in the matter, since we are daily urged to print letters advocating total abstinence.

It was entirely unheralded by fame of any kind, without even a preface or introduction to explain the plan of the author. By its own merits the book made its way, and succeeding volumes only deepened the general conviction that an acute and powerful mind, rich in the acquired learning of the subject, was engaged in the investigation of a path, already beaten by the tracks of many inquirers, but still open to fresh and startling developments from the critical acumen of the nineteenth century. The principal characteristics of Mr. FROUDE's history are the independence of his views and the accuracy of his narrative of facts. His researches are confined, on principle, to the original authorities now for the first time, in many cases, rendered accessible through the increasing liberality that no longer condemns to dust and worms the records and archives that contain the true history of the past. The space of time included in these volumes is brief in duration, extending from 1528, the year when the divorce of HENRY VIII, from his wife CATHARINE was broached, to 1536, when the execution of ANNA BOLEYN concluded what may be called the first act of the Reformation; that great drama, the turning point of mediaeval and modern history, involving interests that still shake the solid foundations of the social world. Mr. FROUDE's reading of the character of HENRY VIII, is a new one, and startling from this very originality. It is, however, so fortified in every step, by contemporary documents and authentic testimony, that an ordinary reader is forced to acquiesce in many of his conclusions; and it is an undoubted fact that the rehabilitation of ""Bluff King Hal"" has made rapid progress since his cause was undertaken by an advocate of Mr. FROUDE's ability. A glowing and hearty sympathy with the nascent spirit of Protestantism and its martyrs, lends a charm to these volumes. The story of these ""first Paladins of the Reformation"" has never before been told in such weighty words. The connection of English, history with the transactions of the continental kingdoms, is another point brought out with great freshness and originality in this history. The condition of the people, the effect of monastic establishments, and their bearing on society, and many other subjects overlooked by prior historians, can only be studied in Mr. FROUDE's book. Two more volumes (to be issued this Fall) will complete the reign of HENRY VIII.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""NEW BOOKS.; HISTORY OF ENGLAND FROM THE FALL OF WOLSEY TO THE DEATH OF ELIZABETH.

The Emperor takes the radical ground that education must not only be open to all, but that, with respect to elementary education, it must be free of charge while attendance is made compulsory. As to religious education, he leaves that entirely with the priests, considering that ""the less the State meddles in religious matters, the more faithful it is to its mission."" This, it must be confessed, is advanced ground for an Austrian Prince to occupy. And looking to the positive disregard of the ecclesiastical party which is shown in the issue of this State paper alone, we can hardly wonder that the Prince's agent at Rome has left the Vatican under the severe displeasure of the Pope. Stranger things have happened than that the Liberalists of Mexico should seek for a constitutional government under MAXIMILIAN.

"-- A YOUNG LADY KILLED BY A STROKE OF LIGHTNING. -- A correspondent of the Hartford Post writes from Collinsville, Ct.: On Sunday morning, about four o'clock, a severe thunder shower passed over this section. The house of Dr. B.A. KASSON was struck by lightning, and his daughter, JOSEPHINE KASSON, aged twenty-three years, was instantly killed. Her sister, two years older, was sleeping with her, and although severely burned and injured, will probably recover. The father hastened to the relief of his daughter DORA, who was in great distress, and after getting her easier reached over to the back side of the bed, putting his hand on the shoulder of JOSEPHINE to waken her, saying, ""Come, your sister is hurt,"" and was horror-struck on finding her dead. He immediately placed the body on the kitchen floor before an open door, and commenced the application of cold water, hoping to resuscitate the body, but all his efforts were fruitless. While attempting to restore the daughter to life, the lightning struck again in the door-yard, passing down a tulip tree, tearing off fragments and scattering them over the ground, and temporarily stunning the Doctor by the explosion. There were only Dr. K. and his two daughters in the house at the time, Hundreds of people were visiting the scene of the disaster during the day. There was no lightning rod on the house, and it is difficult to tell where the fluid first hit the house; its track is visible in various places on the corners and angles of the main house and L part. From appearances, the electric current branched off in different directions. One branch went down the corner where the girls slept, and when opposite the bed, passed inside, striking the young lady near the ear, then down the back to the hips, and then passed to the sister. The skin was lacerated on both of them. One branch of the fluid passed down the tin conductor to the bottom, then tore off some boards, passed through under the stone step, plowed two small furrows in the earth, leaving two holes where it disappeared. This makes not less than five times that lightning has struck buildings within a few years in that neighborhood.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/08/archives/sad-casualty.html,,"-- A YOUNG LADY KILLED BY A STROKE OF LIGHTNING. -- A correspondent of the Hartford Post writes from Collinsville, Ct.: On Sunday morning, about four o'clock, a severe thunder shower passed over this section.

While at its present rate, or at any great valuation above the issues of legal national currency based on public credit, there is with every day's expenditure a large and unnecessary addition made to the public debt; for our current expenditures and aggregate permanent indebtedness are greater by just so much as the purchasing power of currency is less than that of gold. If, in the future, we pay our debt in coin, we shall have to disburse as many gold dollars as we run in debt paper dollars; and should the principal of our debt become a permanency, the burden of the annual interest upon it (the greater part ultimately payable in coin) will, of course, be proportioned to its magnitude, which is increased in the ratio of the depreciation of government paper. The question affects the entire community, also, in their daily ordinary affairs; for it is impossible to have a stable, definite and satisfactory regulation of the prices of the necessaries of life, and the prices of labor, while the purchasing power of the legal currency, as compared with that of coin, is liable to such perturbations and irregularities as we have been and are still suffering from.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Fluctuations in Gold.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Fluctuations in Gold.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Gold', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/53224e02-76a3-5bf0-bf05-aacd85184fdf,1122,nyt://article/53224e02-76a3-5bf0-bf05-aacd85184fdf,

Outbreak with and Stirring up of Strife,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/08/archives/stirring-up-strife.html,Outbreak with and Stirring up of Strife,"-- An evening cotemporary having reached the conclusion that a casus belli is ""an event but too probable in the complicated relations and still unsettled questions"" between the United States and Great Britain, proceeds to illustrate the numberless grievances of a minor kind, of which we have reason to complain, and which will tend to embitter the coming struggle. These minor grievances include what some nameless writer said, two years ago, about the Southern Confederacy in the Journal of Mental Science; what another nameless writer said more recently in the Tory Quarterly Review; and what still another said in Blackwood's (Tory) Magazine. As a specimen of what we ought to treasure up in view of the coming war, we are reminded that one of these Tory writers recently informed the British public that ""the deciduous cypress is a native of the Confederate States of America.!"" This was bad enough, no doubt. It showed that the British Tory writer recognized the spurious Confederacy -- a very malicious act on his part certainly. But does it not occur to the New-York journalist, that when he condescends to go into a revival of such rubbish as this -- rubbish uttered in nine cases out of ten by nameless, brainless, and utterly irresponsible individuals -- that he is making more both of them and their stuff than they are worth? We don't think it need aggravate our people, beyond all power of self-control, even if some scientific bummer, writing for a British periodical, did declare the deciduous cypress to be a Confederate plant. It only showed that he was thinking more of the history of the rebellion, than of natural history, when he wrote.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STIRRING UP STRIFE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STIRRING UP STRIFE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/87e26586-53e1-5a97-8832-041f6f695d01,501,nyt://article/87e26586-53e1-5a97-8832-041f6f695d01,

Thousands of widows and orphans, whose natural protectors have fallen in the war, are imploring for relief. The fund from which the county has supplied a pittance to this much-to-be commiserated class is completely exhausted, and it is estimated that not less than ten thousand helpless women and children are now without any means of support whatever, except such as is derived from public charity. The number of beggars in our streets, many of them children of tender years, has greatly increased within the last few months. The Five Points House of Industry, and similar institutions, are filled to repletion. Our citizens should consider the fact that these widows and orphans have a claim upon them which cannot be disregarded. The lives of their natural protectors have been sacrificed in the defence of the country, and they can rightfully demand something in return. They ask but food and shelter or the means whereby they may obtain them.

Funeral and Corporation Job,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/08/archives/working-a-job-under-difficulties.html,Funeral and Corporation Job,"-Some weeks ago a resolution went through the Common Council to print 25,000 copies of a report of the official proceedings in this city on the occasion of the funeral of President LINCOLN. The resolution was broad and indefinite enough to have comprehended the history of man from Eden to Tammany Hall, and it would have been entirely feasible to have made such ""report"" one or fifty volumes, one hundred or one hundred thousand pages. The Mayor very promptly vetoed the ""job,"" on the ground that, instead of furnishing the public with a historical memoir, the Aldermen intended to lay out a large amount of public money on ""piles of printed lumber, never to be read, seldom consulted, and destined eventually for the paper-mill."" But did the members give it up so? Not a bit. The veto having laid over the designated time, was squelched by the Aldermen a few days ago. The resolution is now before the Councilmen; at first they were going to rush it through at railroad speed, but some twinges of conscience impelled them to pause, and the matter has gone to a committee -- a course which usually indicates either that the subject is to be burked outright, strangled by a refusal to report, or ""arranged"" by proper conference with persons supposed to be interested. We cannot, of course, predict the fate of this grand paper-spoiling job; but there can be little doubt that it is to go through, and that the lumber-rooms in the attic of the City Hall will in time be filled with such useless stuff as that forgotten report of the Obsequies of HENRY CLAY -- (when the funeral pall was divided by the City Hall soldiery and made into coats for their friends) -- of which many thousands of copies were got rid of by the fire on the occasion of the Atlantic Cable celebration. To be sure, the newspapers have long ago given to the people everything worth knowing concerning the late President's obsequies from the White House to the grave, and most people would consider an attempt, at this late day, to make money out of our great misfortune, a matter of bad taste, to say the least; but it seems that a job is to be perfected, and neither Mayor's vetoes nor respect for public opinion are likely to interfere.

The evidence upon which these sentences are based was, it is generally admitted, most conclusive -- so much so that in at least one case, the lawyer for the accused attempted no other defence than an argument that his Southern fanaticism convinced the wretch that he was doing right. Indeed, the chief argument for the defence in all the cases was a denial of the jurisdiction of the court. The fate of the condemned will excite little sympathy in any respectable community in any part of the world. Those unenviable natures that could rejoice at the fate of President LINCOLN and mourn the death of BOOTH as a martyr and a hero, win, no doubt, grieve for the miscreants just condemned at Washington.

The evidence upon which these sentences are based was, it is generally admitted, most conclusive -- so much so that in at least one case, the lawyer for the accused attempted no other defence than an argument that his Southern fanaticism convinced the wretch that he was doing right. Indeed, the chief argument for the defence in all the cases was a denial of the jurisdiction of the court. The fate of the condemned will excite little sympathy in any respectable community in any part of the world. Those unenviable natures that could rejoice at the fate of President LINCOLN and mourn the death of BOOTH as a martyr and a hero, win, no doubt, grieve for the miscreants just condemned at Washington. But among right-minded people, there can be out one opinion as to the justness of the punishment which has overtaken BOOTH's accomplices.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Assassins and the Canadians.; HOW THEIR PUNISHMENT IS REGARDED.

"-- About a year ago, Miss Dr. MARY E. WALKER, it will be remembered, was captured in front of Gen. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON's army, in Tennessee, and sent to Richmond. After being incarcerated for a considerable period in Castle Thunder, she was released, much to the gratification of those who do not believe in the imprisonment of females except upon very aggravated charges. Since then we have heard nothing of her until we saw her yesterday upon Broad-street, clad in a blue coat with military buttons, and a very long skirt, a pair of nicely-fitting blue pants (not like the dandies now wear,) and gaiters, which fitted so as to display a pretty foot. As she passed the Powhatan Hotel she was followed by a number of colored school boys and girls, and by the time she reached Seventh-street, her retinue in number would have done no discredit to a lieutenant-general. Ladies congregated upon the corners, and men and boys stopped along the sidewalk to comment upon the novel appearance of a lady in uniform. At the corner of Sixth and Broad streets, as she turned to go through the market, she was stopped by the provost-guard, who asked her by what authority she appeared upon the streets in the garb in which she was attired. She replied, ""By what authority do you make the inquiry?"" Guard -- ""By order of the Provost-Marshal."" ""Then give him my compliments and tell him I will call upon him.""

The East River Steel Works, which lately employed one hundred men, are now running only two days in the week, with an average of about ten men. The medium quality of cast-steel has been reduced from twenty-two to eleven cents per pound, from which government taxation in various shapes takes off nearly two cents. Three large steel-making establishments, in or near this city, have been closed for the present, namely, the Montauk Steel Works at Mott Haven, the National Steel Works in Forty-second-street, and the New-York Steel Works on Staten Island. At least three hundred men have thus been thrown idle. The steel men complain the more about this depression, inasmuch as they did not previously advance prices with the upward movement in gold. Thus, while by the rise of exchange, English file steel was selling for thirty-five cents, the American article was selling for twenty-one cents per pound. It is now offered at fourteen cents. By the revised tariff, the rate of duty on steel was fixed at $45 per ton, in gold, but of this it is estimated that $32 per ton, in currency, are paid back in taxes, which are piled on the top of one another.

The Tories have to keep up their party discipline. The Carleton Club has to do its duty by Church and State in any, and under all emergencies. In view of the approaching General Election, the party has to press into the field as many candidates as it possibly can, even in constituencies where the most moderate kind of Whigism prevails, and where moderate Whigs run no risk of being defeated by radicals. All of this must be done in view of the contingency of Lord PALMERSTON's being compelled to submit to the rapidly growing infirmities of age. In that event, it is important that Lord DERBY should have a strong Conservative phalanx of supporters at his back. But it is at the same time perfectly consistent with all this, that an understanding should exist whereby the venerable Premier should be allowed to hold his place as long as his physical strength will permit.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'British Party Politics A Tacit Understanding Between Whigs and Tories.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'British Party Politics A Tacit Understanding Between Whigs and Tories.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/781c6131-dd31-5f4b-a9bb-2596f4f1788a,1026,nyt://article/781c6131-dd31-5f4b-a9bb-2596f4f1788a,

S., Launch of","The United States screw steamer Madawaska, 17 guns, was launched yesterday at 9:33 A.M., at the Brooklyn Navy-yard. Long before that hour the buildings, wharves and avenues in the vicinity of the splendid man-of-war, were crowded with ladies and gentlemen, naval officers of high rank and sub-officers, in all numbering not less than 10,000 souls. Although it was expected the launch would take place according to the announcement, between 8 1/2 and 9 1/2 o'clock, yet the wind and the high water rendered it advisable to wait, as it was feared the vessel would swing around too suddenly in the stream. At the appointed hour, as the last prop was being removed, the accomplished and youthful daughter of the designer and builder of the craft, Miss DELANO, supported by six maids of honor, dressed in white, and waving the Star Spangled Banner, advanced to the bow of the vessel, and as the craft gave the first perceptible motion toward the water, the bottle of champagne was broken across the bows, and the vessel duly christened by the name she now bears. She glided so gracefully into the water that there was not so much as a splash heard. Loud huzzas followed for the red, white and blue, and it was the universal opinion that there never was a more successful and beautiful launch.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NAVAL MOVEMENTS.; Launch of the Madawaska.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NAVAL MOVEMENTS.; Launch of the Madawaska.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96548412-2469-5bee-837b-ff2670b3f7a2,465,nyt://article/96548412-2469-5bee-837b-ff2670b3f7a2,

Of course, a tax rising from three to six per cent. upon new work, and two or three per cent. upon repairs cannot fail to enhance prices. In the very nature of things a tax of six per cent. laid upon manufactures at the fountain-head, is equivalent to eight or ten per cent. before they reach the consumer. The tax paid is so much capital invested, if not directly in work or materials, yet indirectly it has to be applied, in order that the business may he carried on. Interest, risk and profits must be calculated upon the sums thus paid out, precisely as if paid for wages or raw materials. But this is not all. It happens that the law has been so construed that scarcely a commodity reaches the consumer without being taxed more than once -- in some fabrics, indeed, the collector levies thrice a 6 per cent. rate before they pass into the retailer's hands, making the aggregate equivalent to 25 or 30 per cent. Let us take a few examples: Cotton pays two cents per pound in the raw state. A manufacturer spins it into yarn, on which 6 per cent. is assessed. He sells the yarn to a weaver, who works it up into table-covers, bed-spreads or common muslins, whereupon the tax-gatherer calls again and demands 6 per cent. more. From the weaver's hands it may pass into those of the printer or dyer, who will be called on to contribute a third 6 per cent., in addition to the original levy of two cents. It would he stating a truism rather than a truth to say that these exactions are exceedingly oppressive; that their counterpart is not to he found in any other country professing to be civilized and enlightened. They are part of those burdens voluntarily assumed by the people to pay the bill of costs of a most expensive war, while it was being waged.

"The To[???]s contains a complete description of the Taureau, a steam ram built on a new system, and lately launched at Toulon. The Taureau presents a fo[???]ridable appearance, due more to its from than to its size. The impression produced is that of an impregnable fortress; it is neither pretty nor light, and its beauty consists in its formidable appearance. The construction was commenced in 1863, and it was Admiral BOUET-WILLAUMEZ, at that time Maritime Prefect of Toulon, who, by permission of the Minister of Marine, prepared the plan of an iron-plated steam ram for the defence of the seaports. Its utility was incontestible, and it became more so after the attacks on Charleston and Fort Fisher. The Taureau draws so little water that she may be concealed close to the shore while waiting for an enemy to enter the harbor, or she may take a position in shallow water where it will be impossible to follow her. Her prow terminates in a point, and this point is armed with a kind of massive bronze cone, which serves as her spur. It is with this spur that this heavy ram, driven at a speed of twelve to fourteen knots an hour, by machinery of 500-horse power, can strike and split a ship. The Taureau is, moreover, supplied with two screws, which enable her to turn in a very small space, and with the greatest facility. She can consequently in a moment present her front to an enemy, whatever her position. Let it be supposed that an iron-plated frigate has forced the entrance to the port of Toulon, and is attacked by the ram. The latter can turn in a small space at a speed of twelve knots an hour, while the frigate, moving at that speed, must describe a circle of 600 yards in diameter. Under these disadvantageous circumstances it will be difficult for the frigate to avoid the shock of the ram. The latter can further avail herself of one large gun which she carries. Her facility of evolution will enable her to place herself in any position. She may, for example, attack the frigate by approaching her stern, and thus avoid her broadside. This large gun -- the only one the Taureau carries -- weighs twenty tons. This ram is intended not only to do buttle in the harbor and defend its entrance, but likewise to pursue a ship when she has been driven out of it. Her powerful artillery will enable her to attack an enemy on her arrival and pursue her in her flight at such a distance that it will be impossible for a frigate to return her fire. In a word, the new ram, with her formidable spur and her heavy gun, is a very terrible instrument of war, and no less efficient for defence. The Taureau has but one deck, which is plated with iron from one end to the other. The sides of the hull are likewise plated with iron the full length, from three feet under the water line to the deck. The deck and the sides form, as it were, an iron box, safe from any shot that may be fired at it. It is in this iron box that the machinery is placed, and the entire crew during an action, except those in the tower. The deck of the Taureau is covered over its entire length with a cylindrical ball-proof dome. The surface of the dome is so inclined that it is impossible to walk on it; it will consequently be impossible to capture it by boarding.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/10/archives/the-new-french-ironclad.html,,"The To[???]s contains a complete description of the Taureau, a steam ram built on a new system, and lately launched at Toulon.

"The correspondent of the Epoque (says the Paris correspondent of the London Star) announces the opening of the Closerie des Lilaos, and describes the dancing there as characterized by more frantic vehemence than is to be seen even at one of the winter...  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/11/archives/miscellaneous-social-immorality-in-france.html,,"The correspondent of the Epoque (says the Paris correspondent of the London Star) announces the opening of the Closerie des Lilaos, and describes the dancing there as characterized by more frantic vehemence than is to be seen even at one of the winter bals de l'Opera. Mabille, or the Chateau des Fleurs, are, according to his account, bals d'ambassade, or prefectorial entertainments, when compared to the Closerie. It is chiefly frequented by the students ofthe Quartier Latin and their proteges. That the homeless young student should spend his unoccupied evenings in such frightful orgies is to be deplored, but there can be but one feeling of disgust and reprobation for the women of rank and high position who consider it ""the thing"" to visit such scenes pour sencanailler, as they express it -- a new term which will be vainly sought in the pages of the Academy dictionary. One hears of ambassadresses and clever women too, whose intellectual powers are of no mean order, leading a party of the most aristocratic members of Paris society to St. Germain for the purpose of spending a day in the woods, and of having a dejeuner at the celebrated resturant. There, by their perfect imitation of the dress and manners of the Anonymas of another world, they attract a mob under the windows where they are breakfasting. The mob, mistaking them for those they so faithfully copy, assail them with shouts of derision and a storm of epithets not usually applicable to their class. To propitiate the angry crowd, a fair princess appears on the balcony, and sings Theresa's well-known canzonette, ""Rien n'est sacr-r-e, pour un sapeur-r-r,"" so perfectly mimicking that personage's intonation and gestures that the song is rapturously encored. What is the result, even to these leaders of fashion in their own exclusive circle? They are known by nicknames from which any delicately-minded woman would shrink, such as canaillette, chopinette, dindonette, and many others, which, as they have appeared in an article of one of the reviews of the day, I betray no confidence in repeating, the names all bearing personally on the fair and youthful marquises and comlesses, on whom they are bestowed. The husband of a lady holding a high position in society was lately absent on business connected with his court. To pass the time of his absence a course of dancing was arranged, and in the ambassador's salons might be seen twice a week, the peculiar spectacle of the young aristocracy of the day learning the celebrated cancan, under the able tuition of a serene highness. But your probable remark is, ""These things have nothing to do with English visitors to Paris. That they have is precisely the cause of my alluding to them, and I take the opportunity of once more protesting against the practice which is gradually spreading to English ladies of the highest respectability, and even rank, allowing their curiosity so far to conquer their sense of propriety as to visit these public places of entertainment. I was present lately at the Eldorado, when, in consequence of THERESA's refusal to sing, a scene took place such as at once attracted crowds of police to the spot. To my infinite disgust I heard the remarks of some French gentlemen present on the fact of the number of English young ladies brought there by their parents, and I could but admit the criticisms made on the circumstance to be perfectly justified. As long as the delightful Concert Musard is open in the Champs Elysees, no excuse exists for lovers of music in the open seeking elsewhere that recreation.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; SOCIAL IMMORALITY IN FRANCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; SOCIAL IMMORALITY IN FRANCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-07-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11e96a70-e741-55a0-bc5f-cd03be914ead,1821,nyt://article/11e96a70-e741-55a0-bc5f-cd03be914ead,

Merchants in Charleston and elsewhere who were formerly extensively engaged in business express their determination to proceed North and settle old accounts as soon as they can make proper arrangements, and they very generally declare that in time they will be able to satisfy the holders of claims against them, provided they are not hampered with premature law processes in their efforts to get on their feet again. At present they stand amid the wreck of their former fortunes, but they are neither discouraged nor hopeless. They recognize the new order of things, and their new position and responsibilities, and with what they have been able to gather from the general wreck, are seeking once more to reestablish themselves in the various vocations and pursuits of life.

The story is, briefly, as follows: On the evening of the 5th, Miss SARAH E. BOYD, then a marriageable daughter of Mr. JAMES BOYD, of No. 97 Henry-street, went out with JOHN PARE, a boarder at her father's house, and in the Broadway Theatre they met JOHN and THOMAS ARMSTRONG, brothers, with whom the young couple were mutually friendly, and between the second and third acts, THOMAS ARMSTRONG took the young woman out, as PARE and JOHN ARMSTRONG supposed, to an ice-creamery. But the roguish twain eschewed the ices and went straightway to the dwelling of a worthy clergyman and were made one flesh. Then, not caring to see the ""old folks,"" they toted off to Tottenville, and thence to the seaside, where they tarried until yesterday morning. Mr. BOYD, meantime, had caused the arrest of young PARE and JOHN ARMSTRONG, and Justice SHANDLEY had committed them to answer for abduction.

Coles; Coles, Capt., on Turret Ships","Another of those periodical letters with which Capt. COWPER COLES favors the world at pretty regular intervals, through the columns of the London Times, has just appeared. Our readers will remember that Capt. COLES has become famous in England by having advocated a plan of constructing vessels which the Admiralty did not accept, and which caused him, therefore, to be continually puffed by the opposition journals and magazines as an ill-used patriot. This breeze of popularity has been constantly fanned by the Captain's own letters, which appear from time to time in the public prints. It was the advent of the American monitors, however, which plucked Capt. COLES from oblivion, almost by the hair of his head. The great and memorable Parliamentary panic which ensued on the iron-clad battle of the Monitor and Merrimac brought out Capt. COLES, who instantly claimed to be the inventor of the ""cupola"" system of iron-clads. It is, of course, perfectly well known that he was not the inventor, but the American excitement served to bring him into a notoriety he has always since enjoyed. Perhaps it is in gratitude for this favor that he now drops his term ""cupola"" for the American word turret, and that the article in question is headed ""Turret Ships."" The material thing itself he long ago borrowed from us -- dropping the wretched ""cupola,"" fit only for guns of very low calibre, and taking up the American cylindrical turret -- and it was proper the name should follow.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Monitor-Building in England Capt.

The play, in its purpose and effect, is a glorification of dull husbands. John Mildway, the hero, wades quietly on the stilts of prudence to heights which fiery indiscretion in vain attempts to scale. At first it is a little tiresome to find this worthy devoting himself to green paint, and regarding that inadequate artistic effort as a moral virtue. Then, too, the ostentation with which he goes to Manchester, without kissing his very pretty wife, is apt to breed a feeling of contempt. If Captain Hawksley were not such ""an unaccountable scoundrel,"" he would certainly, at this period of the evening, win the sympathies of the audience, if not of Mrs. Mildmay. But his unconquerable desire to ""bilk"" every one deprives his other actions of gallantry, and we are not sorry when John comes down upon him with an overwhelming amount of common sense and other legal documents, and so brings him to shame and a dungeon.

Railway Racing Over,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/13/archives/a-pleasant-little-excitement-for-those-who-like-it.html,Railway Racing Over,"Between the western end of the Erie Railroad tunnel, at the Palisades, and the bridge over the Passaic at Newark, is a stretch of five or six miles of salt meadow, level as a floor and tenanted by nobody in particular except musquitoes, many of whom weigh from two ounces to half a pound. Over this meadow run, or rather lie, two railroad tracks -- the Morris and Essex -- emerging from the tunnel, and the New-Jersey, coming from the deep cut below Hudson City. These tracks for three or four miles run side by side, not more than ten feet apart -- both are double. Over each road pass about forty trains per day, so that cars are pretty thick. Both roads seem to be as well managed as roads generally are, and very few accidents occur. But we set out to mention a little scheme just entered into for the diversion of their passengers, by way of keeping them awake in these sleepy afternoons. It is this.; When Morris and Essex gets a sight of New-Jersey around the spur of the hill west of the tunnel, be puts on steam so as to get up about sixty miles an hour; if course New-Jersey is not to be bluffed, and he jerks open the throttle-valve and spins along all he knows how; now the firemen cram in the fuel, and the safety-valve hisses spitefully; a little pause at Hackensack Bridge, over we go at slow pace, and then comes the fun. The trains rapidly near each other, and now are side by side; passengers can almost shake hands; the cars sway to and fro, the steam hisses, the whistles scream, women get nervous, men become anxious, the speed is fearful; when, to pile up the agony, down the return track plunge two other trains engaged in the same lively business -- racing across the meadows. For an instant the four trains are all in a heap, confusion and bewilderment overcome the helpless passengers, and the more nervous begin to faint or scream for help. We have been there, and although pretty well hardened with many thousand miles of railroad travel, we are still not ashamed to say that we think racing of trains that run not more than three or four yards apart is much more exciting than enjoyable. One may get into Newark or New-York live minutes sooner, perhaps, in consequence of this headlong speed; but if a wheel should break or a rail give way, when four such trains are passing, a hundred persons might be killed. Suppose we take a little more time over the meadows; and particularly suppose that each engineer runs by his own tables, and lets the other chap paddle his canoe on the same principle.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Pleasant Little Excitement for those Who Like It.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Pleasant Little Excitement for those Who Like It.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7bb25b8d-7a1a-5c5f-a6d3-4560393f990a,463,nyt://article/7bb25b8d-7a1a-5c5f-a6d3-4560393f990a,

View of South American Republics; Gen. Sickles' Views of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/13/archives/the-south-american-republics-gen-sickles-views-of-their-condition.html,View of South American Republics; Gen. Sickles' Views of,"During an interesting interview with Major-Gen. SICKLES, since his return from South America, we were particularly edified by his description of the fatal operation of the doctrine of State rights, as developed under the inspiration of the Cal[???]oun school of politicians and applied in the several South American Republics. Our own people may gather admonition and instruction from their experience. According to their theory, the relation of the Federal Government to the States is one of entire neutrality. Take the Republic of Colombia: If a revolution or insurrection occurs in any State, the Federal Government cannot interfere, either by a military or a civil authority. When a revolution has effected a change in the government, it is obligatory upon the Federal Government to recognize whatever State authority exists de facto in consequence of such revolution. The Senators in Congress are called Senator Plenipotentiaries from the various districts they represent. These Senators, when a revolution takes place before their terms of office expire, retain their positions for the time for which they were elected -- because they are deemed the representatives of the sovereignty, and not of the successful party for the time being. Their ideas as to the tenure of office are equally striking. The presiding officer of the Senate, corresponding with our Vice President of the republic, is elected once a month! The Speaker of the House is chosen for the same term. The Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court holds his office for a single term of court. Suffrage is universal, including negroes. Emancipation has produced great changes in the social and political status of the blacks. They are eligible to all employments or professions, civil or military. Black doctors attend white patients; black lawyers have white clients, and argue cases before white judges, and white lawyers argue cases before black judges, one of whom presided last year as Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic. He is both learned and accomplished. Several officers of distinction and high rank in MOSQUERA's revolution, which terminated year before last, were blacks who commanded white and black troops brigaded together. The Indian race is similarly embodied together with the blacks, and are soon holding seats in both branches of Congress, and in the different State Legislatures. The facility with which revolution is inaugurated and ended, was illustrated on the 5th of the March last in Panama. Between dinner and tea the government of the State was changed. A battalion of regular troops s[???]ioned there as the conservators of order, were induced to take part in the movement for a new government by some of the residents, who were dissatisfied with the existing administration. They ""sounded"" the Colonel to know what he thought, but finding that he was opposed to the scheme, they quietly imprisoned him, together with several of the other commanding officers who concurred in his objections. [???] themselves under the [???] of those who were [???]y to their cause, they deposed the State au[???] [???] [???]n [???]ted as Governor a well-known [???] [???], JIL COLUNGE, [???] [???]ly [???]. [???] as ""Hall Columbia."" COLUNGE is [???] [???]ed, and has made a marked improvement [???] condition of affairs s[???] is election. He would not be el[???] [???] any [???]e in this country, [???] a n[???]. The deposed Governor, being a [???]r of Congress elect, and having [???]nju[???] the as[???] of a United States ship-of-war for a [???] [???] his personal [???]ty was [???] in da[???], presented to [???] [???] [???] State, [???] [???] [???] the Federal Government. Thus being the [???] [???] in [???] revolution [???] [???] presented by Federal troops, he [???] that, as he had been [???] from power by Federal troops, he should be reinstated in the same manner. This novel question was gravely considered at the Capital, but it was finally decided that as the troops acted without orders and in defiance of the authority of their officers, and as the rule of constitutional law in the government was imperative, that the Federal Government could in no case interfere with the order of things in any State, the de facto government of JIL COLUNGE must be recognized!! Gen. SICKLES entertained COLUNGE on board his vessel, the Huntscille, and found him a most agreeable gentleman. He is popular with the people. The inhabitants looked upon our struggle with amazement. They at first regarded the endeavors of the National Government to put down insurrection in a dozen States, by the aid of Federal troops, as entirely inconsistent with the republican theory; and this view for a time made the Liberal party of South America unfriendly to our cause. The ""Conservator"" party, which was anti-republican, was, of course, against us. Our only friends there, for a long period, were a few enlightened men, who, by residence and observation in our country, had obtained some correct views of our system. Chief among these was that gitted statesman, the President of Columbia, MURILLO. As our struggle proceeded, and the great ideas upon which it was based were better understood in South America, as well as in Europe, a wholesome change of sentiment was observed. Its progress cannot be better illustrated than by the scenes in Bogota when the news reached there of the surrender of LEE and his army and the final triumph of the Union arms. The President ordered his artillery to the Grand Plaza, and a national salute was fired in honor of our triumph. A regiment of infantry ran up the American flag and saluted it. Congress adjourned, and most of its members, together with the Cabinet ministers, made visits of congratulation to the American Minister, Mr. BURTON, and to Gen. SICKLES, who was temporarily sojourning there. In the evening many houses were illuminated; bands of music were sent by the Secretary of War to the residences of our representatives, and played our national airs to an admiring crowd of many thousands assembled in the streets; thus giving to this Spanish city, far away in the Andes, the appearance of a town in the United States.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS.; Gen.

The drama is constructed with all Mr. BOUCICAULT's well-known skill, and the dialogue represents that gentleman's and Mr. HOUSE's ability in the use of words. The story of the piece is is by no means intricate, but we lack time, writing at midnight, to even faintly sketch it. In the main, it is the old Irish legend of the peasant protecting the rebellious and proscribed lord of the soil and nearly getting to the gallows for his pains. In the present case there is a complication, involving the simple love and troth of Arrak, the heroine. She offers the protection of her root to the McCeul and promises not to divulge the fact for three days. The presence of a stranger in her cottage is discovered by Michael Feeney, the informer and villain in of the peace, and on the day of her wedding to Shaun, the post, he divulges the secret, which leads to an uneasy rupture. The best ""sensation"" of the play is here. Shaun finds his bride overwhelmed with the suspicious of her neighbors, and the accusations of Feeney amounting almost to evidence of her guilt. To save her honor he deliberately asserts a falsehood, and says that he was the man who took shelter in the cottage. Hereby he becomes involved in a supposititious robbery which attaches to the real individual. It is impossible to follow the plot at greater length. It is framed effectively and affords abundant opportunities for stage manager, artist, machinist and carpenter. The difficulties in the way of production are so many that every allowance ought to be made for a first night. Fortunately, however, allowance was unnecessary. No contretemps occurred. The performance, nevertheless, terminated at a late hour.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-07-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4ebdea4-5f79-51df-8921-795ce78658d9,686,nyt://article/f4ebdea4-5f79-51df-8921-795ce78658d9,

For the sake of the reputation of the place, and in compliance with the wishes of the very best and most respectable people there, our correspondent passed by the disgraceful demonstrations personal to himself in silence; he was hospitably and courteously treated by the respectable portion of the population with whom he came in personal contact, and as the efforts of the few rowdies to do him personal violence utterly failed, there is no cause for giving the circumstances in detail, which would only add to a load of odium already too great for the people of the locality to bear -- for it so happens that the respectable people of a place always have to bear the blame of the derelictions of a few, and Gettysburgh is no exception to this rule. But it seldom happens that the conductors of the weekly village paper are so ignorant and dishonest as to incite mob violence upon a gentleman who happens to be visiting their village upon a national occasion.

The bulk of them all are truly loyal, and accept the new order of things in all its fullness. There are no more earnest anti-slavery papers in all the country than those we get from New-Orleans, Mobile, Vicksburgh, Memphis and Nashville; and we can say nearly as much for those from the cities of the Atlantic States, as Savannah, Charleston, Wilmington, Raleigh and Norfolk. But we cannot speak so well for the daily papers issued at the late rebel capital, Richmond. They seem to be afflicted with the mollygrubs. They have not the hearty, vigorous, progressive, unconditionally loyal spirit that we find, for example, in those of Memphis. They are not only fault-finding and atrabilious, but often insolent and dictatorial. The strong hand of military power has had to interfere with two of them within a short time, and all of them need an amendment in their character.

There, well educated people can read the most tempting promises of WALLACE, STUART, WOOD and BARNUM; the passer can learn where to buy the fragrant ""Sozodont;"" the infirm can ascertain the whereabouts of the nearest crutch factory or pill shop, and the stranger need go no further to find a cure for every ill. We have seen elderly men from the country pause in amazement in front of that lofty fence; we have seen thimble-riggers avail themselves of the unfeigned curiosity of their victims beneath its very shadow; we have seen itinerant boot-blacks cease for the moment in the practice of their vocation as the wheezing sounds from the inclosure burst out upon the silent Park. Small boys who avoided that corner after dark in years gone by, who tore numerous trowsers in their subsequent attempts to climb up and peep over, who regarded it in maturer years as a disgrace to the city, are now full-grown men, taxpayers in the county, who are much interested in the tearing down of the fence, and wonder each year if that ""infernal job will ever be completed.""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE COUNTY COURT HOUSE.; A Curious Bit of History---Its Origin, Progress and Prospects.

They will comprise two large stone powder magazines, each about one hundred and fifty feet by fifty, a structure for general stores two hundred and fifty feet by sixty, and an immense shed, of capacity sufficient to cover 800 cannon with their carriages. These will be of all sizes, from the light boat howitzer to the ordnance of greatest calibre now in use on any of our Western gunboats.

Ecclesiastical Affairs in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/15/archives/ecclesiastical-affairs-in-italy.html,Ecclesiastical Affairs in,"The recent attempts to restore amicable relations between the King of Italy and the Pope appear to have definitely failed. The vacillation which has so long distinguished the Councils of the Vatacan, in all matters embracing ecclesiastical policy, bas again been exhibited. A few weeks ago it was announced, almost with the weight of official authority, that His Holiness had consented that the incumbents of the bishoprics he desired to erect within the Kingdom of Italy should take the oath of allegiance to VICTOR EMANUEL and promise obedience to the laws of the State over which he rules. To the mere secular mind, this demand on the one side, and the consent on the other, would appear to be mere matters of form, to be quietly disposed of instanter. But matters seem to be arranged differently at Rome. The Papal authorities now desire to recede from so reasonable an engagement as that into which they are reported to have entered, and wish to be allowed to appoint their bishops in a foreign State without any stipulations. It is an endeavor in fact, to reenact in the Kingdom of Italy the course pursued in England some years ago, when the latter was coolly cut up into numerous archiepiscopal and Episcopal-Roman Catholic districts, and appointments were made to each. A few old women, of both sexes, took the matter dreadfully to heart, and Exeter Hall, for a few months, exuded high-power Protestantism from every brick of its pious walls; but the majority only laughed. This contemptuous tolerance did its natural work, and divested what was an encroachment of all power for harm. A great Protestant community like that of England could afford to take this course, but the position of VICTOR EMANUEL is one which must utterly forbid his permitting any such an arrangement within his dominions. He can tolerate no imperium in imperio. -- either he or the Church must succumb, and the experience of the past, on the nunnery and similar questions, can lead us up to a very safe insight as to which power will ultimately prevail. The King has the best of the game, and he not only knows it, but possesses the resolution to take the fullest advantage of his position. Even the stern resort to excommunication has been clearly thrown away upon this intractable sovereign, who will persist in thinking for himself. He judiciously resolves to have no part in any half measures. Aut Cesar, aut nullus. He must be sole, acknowledged, and undisputed head of his own State, or the dioceses shall remain vacant.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS IN ITALY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS IN ITALY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Italy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eba6b9f7-6d34-54b4-b781-22778e9858a7,483,nyt://article/eba6b9f7-6d34-54b4-b781-22778e9858a7,

Prof. Liebig on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/16/archives/beef-tea.html,Prof. Liebig on,"-- The waste of beef in making beef tea is enormous. 62,000 lbs. a year are used in one London hospital alone; and if any head of a household, where there has been long illness, will just sum up the addition to the Butcher's bill in the shape of beef tea meat, he will be able to form some notion of the quantity used, and (many of the doctors are beginning to tell us) more than half wasted, throughout the country. At the present price of meat this is a very serious matter. It is LIEBIG's theory that in beef tea, properly made, you get all the nutrive part of the beef, and leave nothing but a worthless mass of bouilli behind. The British Medical Journal, on the other hand, asserts that fibrine is absolutely insoluble in water, and that a dog fed on beef tea dies as soon as one who gets nothing but mere water. If this be true, LIEBIG is as great a romancer in his way as the cook who, when asked by his noble master what use he could find for some thirty hams for one dinner, replied, ""I shall put them all into no bigger as my thumb."" We believe the safest way for the patient is to drink up that red meaty sediment which the ""purists"" so generally strain out. The fact is, LIEBIG's pint of tea, made from a pound of beef, yields by evaporation less than half an ounce of solid matter; and though we cannot admit that this ""represents the whole nutritive matter contained in the pint of fluid,"" (for do not gases feed us?) the result is certainly startling. The Medical Journal makes two suggestions -- first, cat the bouilli, which, of course, can only be done by a stomach capable of digesting boiled beet; next, use more wine and less, beef tea in fever cases and the like. Wine is seldom rejected by the feeblest stomach, and it contains all the elements of the blood -- alkalies, iron, albumen, traces of most of the acids; besides, wine by itself will support life for a very long time. We heartily agree with this latter suggestion. Wine, by all means, for sick poor as well as for sick rich. But how, if you please, are middling folks to get it? Where is the parson, for instance, to buy it for his poor and for himself? Madeira is not; port is not -- i. e., not within the means of ordinary people. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has, they say, given us cheap claret; but will he make his gift doubly precious by telling us where we may obtain it sound? -- Pall Mall Gazette.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BEEF TEA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BEEF TEA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/136f8ffe-cd25-52fc-81db-b000ab5b3c1e,454,nyt://article/136f8ffe-cd25-52fc-81db-b000ab5b3c1e,
Central Park and City Railways,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/16/archives/central-park-and-the-means-of-getting-there.html,Central Park and City Railways,"-- It is everywhere accepted as a fact that the Central Park is an institution indispensable to the city. All classes of our population find within its limits healthful, elevating, humanizing enjoyment. It is the pride of the rich and the delight of the poor. Its music on Saturday afternoon is the event of the week to countless thousands who are released by the early closing of stores and factories for a few hours' recreation from toil and drudgery. In behalf of this large class we again implore the managers of the city railroads for proper accommodation. It is not far wrong to state that each company transports on Saturday afternoons to and from the Park at least six thousand extra passengers, thus adding the handsome sum of $360 to its ordinary receipts. For this liberal patronage there is no compensating return. The management of the railroads is apparently actuated by a sordid and niggardly spirit. The money is received, and the railroad people don't care a rap how many women and children are crushed and how much clothing dystroyed in their closely-packed, badly-ventilated cars. It is simply heartless on their part to compel visitors returning from the Park, fatigued by their afternoon's exercise, to stand upon the platforms of the vehicles and cling precariously to the abominable straps which dangle inside, all through the tiresome down-town journey.

None will, it is hoped, more regret this conduct than the companies themselves, when they think seriously over the matter. Whatever their opinion of the recent change in the department, they have a duty to the public to perform, the neglect of which is fraught with the gravest consequences. The fact that the fire is reported as incendiary involves the character of these companies in a manner which they cannot fail to perceive. In refusing to combat the wicked designs of incendiaries, they, in effect, give them the most efficient aid in their power. Of course, the new department will be at work in due course; and those members of the old one, who oppose it by endangering the lives and property of their fellow-citizens, will, if not wise in time, make a record which themselves will not care to remember or to see remembered.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REFRACTORY FIRE COMPANIES AND INCENDIARISM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REFRACTORY FIRE COMPANIES AND INCENDIARISM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d234c61-b7af-5432-bdb2-8dd695480f36,173,nyt://article/5d234c61-b7af-5432-bdb2-8dd695480f36,

BROWN, of Georgia, has been universally regarded as one of the most impracticable and obstinate of State Bights men, but the address which he has just issued to the people, who have so long recognized him as their Chief Magistrate, shows pretty conclusively that his recent compulsory trip to the North has made him somewhat more tractable. He very frankly tells those whom he addresses that the people of the North do not raise any question about the policy of abolishing slavery -- that they regard it already as a thing of the past. He advises the Georgians to acquiesce in this decision, and adds that, as he does not mean to give any counsel which he is not willing to follow himself, he shall hereafter treat his own slaves as free, and give them part of the crop, with such other wages as may be agreed upon. This is sensible in Gov. BROWN, and he should receive full credit for his candor. There is one inconsistency, however, which his address reveals. While he advises the citizens of the State to take the amnesty oath, he states that he has not yet subscribed to it himself. As the doughty Governor has set so good an example with regard to his slaves, he certainly cannot refuse to furnish the people with another excellent precedent by taking the oath.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gov.

"-- A young man has just been sentenced to imprisonment for six months by the police court of Lille for vagrancy, whose career of crime is one of the most extraordinary ever developed before a court of justice. PERNET was born in Paris twenty-four years since, and at the age of fourteen he committed a homicide. At eighteen he was sentenced to imprisonment for five years for robbery at Bar-le-Duc. He was only eight days in the House of Correction in that town when he escaped. He was captured and again committed, but he shortly escaped a second time. After his fifth escape from prison in France he was sentenced to twenty years' hard labor, and embarked for Cayenne at the beginning of the year 1864. Five convicts escaped from Cayenne last year, and PERNET was their leader. He assumed the command of the frail boat in which they risked their lives. They had just quitted the land when they were perceived and fired on by the guard on shore, but escaped without injury. After tossing about for fourteen days and nights, nearly starved to death, they reached a British settlement. The inhabitants, mistaking them for shipwrecked seaman, treated them with the greatest kindness. They remained some months in the settlement, when PERNET and one of his comrades, tired of the monotonous life, embarked for Spain, where they committed a robbery, and supplied themselves with a considerable sum of money and a quantity of good wearing-apparel. Pursued by the police, they took refuge in Corsica, where they passed themselves for merchants, having large establishments in Spain. Having money in their pockets and being respectably clad, they acquired some friends, and led for a time a jovial life. Their cash was soon expended, but PERNET, nothing abashed, announced that he had lost a pocket-book containing 100,000 francs in bank-notes and valuable securities, and had it proclaimed by the public crier through the streets of Ajaccio, offering a reward of 10,000 francs for its recovery. The stratagem succeeded; for their acquaintances, taking compassion on the pretended Spaniards, placed their purses at their disposal, of which they availed themselves sparingly. They were shortly afterward accused of a robbery of plate at the hotel where they lodged, and fled. They next appeared in Italy, where PERNET passed for a government engineer, and his companion acted the part of secretary. They were detected, but again contrived to escape. The month of March last found PERNET in London, but British air did not agree with him, and he embarked for France, and arrived at Boulogne on the 15th of that month. He was then completely destitute, but he made the acquaintance of a charitable person in the coach between Boulogne ane Lille, who afforded him some assistance, and would have procured him employment, but he declined the offer.

"-- Judge RUSSEL, yesterday, sentenced two young scoundrels who had been convicted in the Court of Sessions of robbery in the first degree, under very aggravated circumstances, each to twenty years' incarceration at Sing Sing Prison. For this action His Honor deserves the thanks of the community. The offence of highway robbery has been remarkably prevalent of late -- almost as frequent as it was about ten years since. At that time Judge RUSSEL was on the bench, and in spite of the clamor in certain influential political quarters, ostensibly on humane grounds, against the severity of his dealings with ""garrotters,"" he persisted in imposing long sentences upon them -- in one case sending a convict to the State Prison for forty years. The wisdom of this course was soon apparent. The crime of highway robbery suddenly ceased, and the salutary lesson then enforced required the lapse of a decade to efface it from the remembrance of rogues of the foot-pad class.

The party takes with it 15,000 headboards to mark the resting-places of those brave men; and this fact will, doubtless, suggest the thought to every mind, that a movement should at once be inaugurated to erect a monument which shall hand down to future generations the memory of that noble army of martyrs which passed through such privations and suffering to seal with life itself their devotion to the sacred cause of liberty.

The corpse was taken to the Nineteenth Ward Police Station, and a Coroner was notified.

British Sympathy with his Fall,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/16/archives/the-apotheosis-of-jefferson-davis.html,British Sympathy with his Fall,"Circumstantial details of the comical scene at Irwinsville, Georgia, on the capture of his late Excellency, J. DAVIS, have been reported in England, and John Bull's comment thereon is that he does not see where the laugh comes in. America, at the North, is flooded with caricatures of the unhappy fugitive. Cork minstrels have vied with the more legitimate branch of the histrionic profession in reproducing the force enacted at Irwinsville before the foot-lights, with such interpolations us a playful fancy suggests. Newsboys have hawked metrical versions of the same ludicrous event about the streets, in their penny-apiece ballads, Press and platform have found matter for many a jest therein; and private wit, satire or hearty good-humor, all over the country, are still busy with the fruitful story. This lighter commentary, however, has not prevented grave accounts, elaborate descriptions, hot discussions, and many official reports and documents from giving importance to the capture. America, at the South, meantime, has been hanging her head over the chief of the chivalry, and feeling very much vexed, if not at the conduct, at least at the unhappy plight into which JEFF's sardonic demon of misfortune has got him.

Toads found in Rocks,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/16/archives/geological-toads.html,Toads found in Rocks,"At a recent meeting of the Manchester Geological Society, Mr. JOSEPH DICKINSON, one of the inspectors on mines, called attention to a paragraph copied from a Newcastle paper, respecting a living toad which was alleged to have been found embedded in a block of magnesium limestone stratum near Hartlepool. It was said that Mr. TAYLOR, the incumbent of Hartlepool, an eminent local geologist, had pronounced this wonderful toad to be 6,000 years old. This was the second paragraph of the kind that had gone the round of the Manchester papers. The first paragraph was relative to a live toad said to have been found at St. Helena embedded in the coal. Knowing the owners of the colliery where the discovery was said to have been made, he wrote to them for particulars, and they sent over the collier who had discovered the wonderful reptile, which the man brought with him all alive in a piece of cannel coal. He took the man to Mr. PLANT, at the Peel Park Museum, and full particulars were given as to how, when, and where the toad was found. Mr. PLANT examined the specimen, and said there could be no doubt the man had made the hole himself and put the toad into it. The men said such a hole could not be made, but Mr. PLANT said he knew an ivory carver who could make a much better one. Mr. PLANT wanted to break the coal asunder, having, by inserting his finger, distinctly felt the chisel marks, but the collier hastily objected, and also refused to go with his discovery to Dr. ALCOCK, of the Natural History Museum. He (Mr. DICKINSON) quite agreed with Mr. PLANT that the specimen was manufactured. He had never met with a toad underground himself, nor had any of his many friends connected with the mines. Mr. AITKEN produced some photographs of the Hartlepool toad. Mr. PLANT corroborated Mr. DICKINSON's account as to the St. Helens toad, and added that the collier tried every way to prevent him putting his finger into the hole, saying that the toad's bite was poisonous. [Laughter.] He (Mr. PLANT) however had no difficulty whatever in recognizing, both in the St. Helens specimen and in the Hartlepool photograph, our old friend, the British toad, which was to be found under our hedges at any time. It had been stated that the recently-found Hartlepool specimen had no mouth, but that was a remark resulting from ignorance. Toads often breathed with their mouths closed, the air escaping through the pores of the skin. Since the appearance of the paragraph to which Mr. DICKINSON called attention, Rev. Mr. TAYLOR had denied uttering any such nonsense as that the toad was 6,000 years old. Mr. GREENWELL said it was remarkable that no living things but toads were found imbedded in rocks. [Laughter.] The President (Mr. A. KNOWLES) said a learned society in Paris experimented by inclosing toads in a preparation to see how long they could live without air; some of them lived twelve years, but the covering was broken open every six months. The meeting generally received the tale of the toads with amused credulity.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEOLOGICAL TOADS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GEOLOGICAL TOADS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'TOADS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7fa9645-8706-5711-ad5a-f8e1f8238803,529,nyt://article/b7fa9645-8706-5711-ad5a-f8e1f8238803,

"-- A startling tragedy was enacted at Nashville, Ill., on the Fourth. A German farmer named JACOB MEIER had employed two men named WHITE and MCGREADY to assist him during harvest. The two laborers declined to work on the Fourth and asked for the money due them, which MEIER refused to pay, as he was disappointed by their determination not to work. After this, which occurred in the field, the two men repaired to MEIER's house and ordered his wife to tell them where his money was concealed. Upon her refusing they began torturing her with boiling water from the stove. Upon her persistently refusing to produce the money, one of the men brought in an iron wedge from the yard and beat her on the head until he had killed her. To prevent the murder from becoming known the men then set fire to the house, and securely locking the doors and fastening the windows, went directly into the woods a short distance off. The smoke was soon seen issuing from the house, and one of the neighbors saw the dead body of MEIER's wife on the floor. The atrocious murder caused great excitement, and the people turned out in every direction to seek for the perpetrators. The next day WHITE was caught on his way to St. Louis. He had traveled about twenty-five miles on foot, and had fallen asleep on the side of the road. He was taken back to the village, where he made a confession of all that had occurred. About 6 o'clock the same evening it was determined to lynch him. He was given a few moments to prepare himself for death, when a rope was placed about his neck and he was hung to a tree in view of the ruins of the house where the cruel and brutal murder was committed.

"-- The Berlin correspondent of the London Times says in a recent letter: ""In many parts of Western and Northern Germany the value of land is from three to five times what it was thirty years ago. House property, too, has risen immensely in towns of any importance and size. A Berlin house which in 1847 would have fetched 20,000 thalers, to-day could not be bought for less than 40,000 to 60,000 thalers. Other prices have gone up in proportion.

Meat was about half as dear; rent but a third or a fourth of the exorbitant rates exacted now-a-days. Ladies and gentlemen, both from the heightened standard of respectability and the increase in the price of apparel, before the change came on, could cover their outer selves very decently at a third part of the expenditure now incurred as a matter of course. Labor commands double the sum in the market, being at the same time as much in demand as to have created a social revolution in the relations between employer and employe. Domestic servants especially have been pleased to assume the independent manners of 'helps.' Agricultural laborers -- the bite noire of the country -- gradually emerge from their old humility, going off to America by thousands, or casting wistful glances on 'the land of the free,' 'the republic of the plowman.' As regards the peasantry, being all independent, and many of them proprietors to a large extent, they have been diretly and materially benefited by the new state of things. Upon the whole, and in comparison with the straightened circumstances of what now appears the olden time, prosperity is more general, even in the smaller towns and villages, than the homely habits and garb surviving in those places would seem to indicate.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/16/archives/foreign-items.html,,"-- The Berlin correspondent of the London Times says in a recent letter: ""In many parts of Western and Northern Germany the value of land is from three to five times what it was thirty years ago.

Ladies and gentlemen, both from the heightened standard of respectability and the increase in the price of apparel, before the change came on, could cover their outer selves very decently at a third part of the expenditure now incurred as a matter of course. Labor commands double the sum in the market, being at the same time as much in demand as to have created a social revolution in the relations between employer and employe. Domestic servants especially have been pleased to assume the independent manners of 'helps.' Agricultural laborers -- the bite noire of the country -- gradually emerge from their old humility, going off to America by thousands, or casting wistful glances on 'the land of the free,' 'the republic of the plowman.' As regards the peasantry, being all independent, and many of them proprietors to a large extent, they have been diretly and materially benefited by the new state of things. Upon the whole, and in comparison with the straightened circumstances of what now appears the olden time, prosperity is more general, even in the smaller towns and villages, than the homely habits and garb surviving in those places would seem to indicate.""",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-07-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ecf339ff-8f55-5866-af41-97dac8497c2d,2268,nyt://article/ecf339ff-8f55-5866-af41-97dac8497c2d,

The concomitants of the festival, such as the hearty fraternization of all concerned in it and the generous hospitality extended by the Singers of this city to their vistors from all the other cities, are also admirable. Then the actual doings, lesser and larger, thus far, such as the great torchlight procession of the societies on Saturday night -- the joyous reception of the delegations from abroad and the magnificent song of welcome with which they were saluted in the City Hall Park at midnight -- the floral decorations at their headquarters and at the chief places of German resort -- these, with the grand sacred concert last night at the Academy of Music, in which over two thousand well-trained singers took part, have been the prominent incidents of the festival up to this time, and all of them have had the profound feeling as well as the superficial impress of the beautiful.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The German Singing Festival.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The German Singing Festival.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'GERMAN', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1281228d-212c-50c6-89a2-57d63ebd1426,694,nyt://article/1281228d-212c-50c6-89a2-57d63ebd1426,

Trade Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/17/archives/the-detroit-convention.html,Trade Convention,"-- RECIPROCITY AND ANNEXATION. -- The Detroit Convention came to a unanimous conclusion in favor of the renewal of the Reciprocity Treaty. As the whole question of definitely terminating or reviving the Commercial Convention of 1854 turned upon details, the affirmation of the Detroit Conference, perhaps, amounts to less than the supporters of reciprocity may imagine. But the apparent unanimity at Detroit at least shows that there is a disposition among our commercial men to continue trading with the provincials on something like fair terms. Whether our neighbors will relish these terms, as we interpret them, is a matter not at all apparent just yet. The most elaborate speech delivered at the convention appears to have been that of Hon. JOSEPH HOWE, of Nova Scotia, which we reproduce this morning in other columns. That gentleman's statements and arguments on a variety of incidental questions, such as the fisheries, the frontier smuggling trade, the neutrality of the colonists, and their thorough devotion to the British Crown, will be found entertaining enough, if not instructive.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DETROIT CONVENTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DETROIT CONVENTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'DETROIT', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/14834924-752e-5a16-a5ee-7a6917ffe2c9,247,nyt://article/14834924-752e-5a16-a5ee-7a6917ffe2c9,

Until this stock was used up, the mill-owners found an ample demand for every pound of yarn or cloth they could produce, at war prices. At a later period, in consequence of the rise in wages, the scarcity of raw cotton and the excise duties imposed, the business ceased to be prosperous; and at one time a majority of the spindles in the North were standing idle, though coarse cotton yarns sold at from $2 to $2 50 per pound. The scale has once more turned in favor of the cotton interest. With a plentiful supply of the ""floculent fibre"" coming forward, and a market almost completely bared of certain fabrics, there is now understood to be quite a brisk demand for yarns at from 75 cents per pound upward, according to quality. In the mills of New-England and New-Jersey, we believe no decline in wages has yet taken place, or if any, the reduction is inconsiderable and local. Cotton goods of all kinds have stiffened in price, since the late upward turn in the gold market.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY NO.

United Service Petroleum Company Case Resumed,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/18/archives/the-united-service-petroleum-and-mining-co-further-examination.html,United Service Petroleum Company Case Resumed,"Messrs. HENRY C. BANKS, WILLIAM BOIES and Assistant District-Attorney GUNNING S. BEDFORD, Jr., for the people; and Ex-Judge SIDNEY H. STUART and Mr. DAVID DUDLEY FIELD, Jr., for the defendants; Col. WILLIAM D. MANN and DANIEL STRATTON, Jr., founders and managers of the United Service Petroleum and Mining Company, appeared before Justice DODGE, at Jefferson Market Police Court, yesterday morning, and Mr. GEORGE D. KELLOGG, late Secretary of the company and complainant against MANN & STRATTON, was examined at length. A comprehensive history of this oil speculation has already been published in the columns of the TIMES. It appears that Col. MANN, who had served in the army and formed an extensive acquaintance among the officers thereof, tiring of the service, resigned and came to this city, where he opened an office for the sale of patent accoutrements, etc., and meeting DANIEL STRATTON, Jr., of Ohio, a person who had some kind of title to certain lands in the petroleum regions, he concocted the scheme of the United Service Petroleum and Mining Company, and used his acquaintance with army officers in introducing the scheme to the public. Precisely how much land MANN and STRATTON owned or purchased, or pretend to own does not as yet appear, the investigation not having yielded this interesting fact; but whether they owned a foot or an acre, or even the six hundred and odd acres which their flaming prospectus advertised, it matters not, since they appear to have been quite as successful in selling stock as though their oil fields had been indeed the diamond gulches of Golconda. They pretended to have $60,000 capital; their working capital was $15,000, and they actually sold shares representing $60,000. Nearly one half of this sum is believed to have been paid in, and is supposed to be in the hands of MANN or his agents at this moment. Hence the suit. The gentlemen who purchased stock in the United Service and Mining Company desire to exchange their certificates for the money which they have disbursed, and they think that if Justice DODGE holds MANN and STRATTON to answer a criminal charge, (the allegation is false pretence,) these persons may restore a portion of the money. In the following testimony the reader may find such facts as were drawn out by the counsel for the defence, yesterday. The counsel for the people will examine this witness on Friday morning next, and then further developments may be expected.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE UNITED SERVICE PETROLEUM AND MINING CO.; Further Examination Before Justice Dodge.

Atlantic Telegraph; Tariff and Traffic Arrangements,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/18/archives/the-atlantic-telegraph-tariff-and-traffic-arrangements.html,Atlantic Telegraph; Tariff and Traffic Arrangements,"We publish to-day the official statement of the tariff and traffic arrangements of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. They differ, apparently, in no material respect from those reported previously in abstract, form. In the official statement now, given to the public, the directors, however, take especial care to have it understood that, even at the proposed extravagant rate of charges, they will come under no responsibility whatever for the correct transmission or the safe and prompt delivery of messages intrusted to them. Those who make use of the line at one dollar a letter -- five letters being reckoned a word -- will thus have the cheerful excitement of counting on the chances of the ultimate disposition of their dispatches. Weeks may elapse before they ascertain whether their messages have gone to Jericho or to the bottom of the Atlantic. Or if, in accidental cases, the proper address is discovered without unnecessary delay, and the message is delivered, then will follow the pleasant excitement of speculating on the errors of transmission -- which the directors are candid enough to anticipate, and for which they utterly refuse to be held responsible. Thus, says Mr. Secretary SAWARD, in behalf of the company, ""Nor will they (the directors) consent to be liable for any sum whatever, under any circumstances whatever, as damages or otherwise, for loss accruing from errors, mistakes, delays or other causes in respect to any message intrusted to them."" We dare say it is all right -- if the company can make this style of doing business pay them. At the rate of one dollar per alphabetical letter, the sender of messages may be presumed to be rather careful as to what he writes -- how his message is worded -- who he sends it to -- where the intended recipient lives -- and what faculty that happy individual may have of interpreting and correcting messages, so as to avoid ""loss acruing from errors, mistakes, delays, or outer causes."" If those who are to patronize the telegraph have not made up their minds for all this, then they will not be able to blame the Directors for not having forewarned them. The luxury of asking, through the cable, after a relative's health in London or Paris, at the respective rates of twenty pounds sterling, or twenty guineas, may be indulged in -- but with some draw-backs, it may be perceived. For instance, your neighbor Jones may send a message to his London partner to take half a million of Five-Twenties, at the London rate. If that message should go to your relative, in place of an inquiry after his health -- both might suffer some inconvenience. Or Jones and his partner might suffer still more inconvenience, and loss as well. But the company would have incurred no responsibility, beyond applying your two hundred-dollar check to their own account.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Atlantic Telegraph Tariff and Traffic Arrangements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Atlantic Telegraph Tariff and Traffic Arrangements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/202299e9-3833-51bc-a44d-bd518b48e131,706,nyt://article/202299e9-3833-51bc-a44d-bd518b48e131,

So far as slavery is concerned, it is now a relic in the deadest sense, and it seems that polygamy also is preparing itself for death. Speaker COLFAX, and a number of other prominent gentlemen, have recently passed through Utah, and while at Salt Lake City had a conference with the Prophet BRIGHAM YOUNG, in the course of which Mr. COLFAX remonstrated earnestly against the barbarous institution of polygamy. The Prophet said in reply that it was no essential part of Mormonism; that it did not exist in the early days of the Mormon church; that it was not enjoined in the Book of Mormon, and that if the Lord were to give him a revelation that it should be stopped, he would cheerfully enforce the divine injunction.

Returning; Hospitality to,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/19/archives/hospitality-to-returning-regiments.html,Returning; Hospitality to,"The City of New-York, true to her reputation for generosity, has done a good work, during the past six weeks, in making the troops returning home to be mustered out of the service heartily welcome. We had simply, before the beginning of the ""homeward march,"" to call attention in the TIMES to the propriety of raising a fund for the purpose of supplying fruits and luxuries to the faithful men who have been enduring with heroism the hardships and rough fare of the field, when the benevolent and wealthy people of the city promptly opened their purses and contributed handsomely to this object. Col. COLYER, the State Agent, has been the almoner of at least $9,000 in cash, voluntarily offered, which has been used in purchasing berries and watermelons, providing coffee and cigars, and expended in other judicious ways, to cheer the hearts of the brave veterans, and testify in the most emphatic manner the. esteem and good will of the people toward them. Not the smallest item of this expenditure has been the cost of the music, without which the march of the soldiers through the city would have been cheerless as a funeral, and with which every regiment has expressed a delight more enthusiastic even than is drawn out by the liberal supply of the good things which rejoice the inner man of those so long accustomed to hard tack and salt junk. Thus far, during the past few weeks, upward of 25,000 men have been lodged, fed and hospitably entertained at the New-York State Agency, in their transit through the city. No troops bound for any portion of the State have been allowed to pass on their homeward journey without some material testimony of this sort of the high appreciation felt for their services. Not only the rank and file, but the officers have been cared for, which frequently is as much a duty as providing for the men; because the officers very often come home without funds, and fully enjoy a good meal after the long abstinence from decent food, incidental to traveling, and the peculiarities of the military service.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Hospitality to Returning Regiments.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Hospitality to Returning Regiments.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0cbaec02-264a-5214-bc38-8915c934d1b5,514,nyt://article/0cbaec02-264a-5214-bc38-8915c934d1b5,

Barnard, and the Chambers and Special Term of the Superior Court. For this reason the death of Ambrose L. Jordan, Esq., was not announced in Court as is usual when the death of an eminent member of the Bar takes place. In the Chambers of the Supreme Court however, after a little routine business had been finished, Mr. Levi S. Chatfield, late Attorney-General of this State, arose and with much emotion announced Mr. Jordan's death. He said substantially, that in making a motion that the Court adjourn, he did it with feelings of the deepest sorrow. An old, honored and respected member of the legal profession was dead. AMBROSE L. JORDAN died on Sunday last, in the 77th year of his age. The speaker had known him well for very nearly half a century. In 1812 Mr. Jordan came to the County of Otsego, where he was actively engaged in the practice of his profession until the year 1823 or 1824, when he removed to the City of Hudson, this State. During ail the years of his professional career in Otsego County, and after his removal further east, he was well known to the speaker. From the beginning of his professional life he had admired his honest simplicity of heart am exhibited in his daily life; his uprightness of purpose, as manifested in his dealings with his clients, and his uniform kindness and urbanity as displayed toward his opponents during the heat of debate and during protracted trials. He was one of ""nature's noblemen,"" a genuine specimen of a man as well as a lawyer. He was the contemporary of such eminent jurists as Kent, Tallcott, Spencer, Thomas J. Oakley, (who died the Chief-Justice of the Superior Court of this city,) of Samuel Stevens, B.F. Butler, George Wood and others, nearly all of whom, are now in their graves.

Brown, of New-York, and the Stranger, of Poughkeepsie, came off at the latter place yesterday. The race was over a distance of five measured miles.

Neither party rowed in their old boats yesterday. New and splendid vessels had been constructed for each, the Brown's crew pulling in the Samuel Collyer, the Stranger's crew pulling in the Floyd T.F. Fields, both vessels being named after the principal backers of the contestants. The crew of the Collyer was composed of DENNIS LEARY (stroke) JOHN BEGLIN, JAMES H. BEGLIN, and BERNARD BEGLIN (bow.) As the George J. Brown crew they have made themselves famous by their numerous victories in the regattas at Boston, Worcester, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, Albany, New-York, Troy and other places.

The defendants were seamen, and on arriving in port were given in charge of the United States Consul and sent to the United States for trial. Considerable evidence was taken, and the facts elicited point strongly to the prisoner CLARK as the perpetrator, although there is no direct testimony to that effect. During the examination, it was also shown that the seamen were most inhumanly treated by the officers of the vessel. One of the men, called DANIEL, a Norwegian, was beaten with belaying pins and ropes two or three times a day, till at last, in a fit of despair, he jumped overboard and was drowned. This was about a fortnight before the murder.

The facts of the case seem to be that CHICHESTER and the young lady kept company together, about nine months since, and an estrangement between them arose in consequence of some scandal, originated by Miss BUGBY's lady friends. The persistent scandal-mongers not only broke up the company of the young people, but also goaded the unhappy girl into the position of an attempted murderess. She acknowledged to the Justice that the officer never harmed her, and expressed the belief that she had been deceived in regard to him. The moral character of Officer CHICHESTER is attested to by all his fellow officers, and that of the young lady is irreproachable.

The real cost of the national establishment has, of course, been diminishing daily and greatly for the last ten weeks, or ever since the disbandment of the army, the diminution of the navy, and the breaking up of the Provost-Marshal system was commenced; but for the same reason, the expenditures have been at their highest. We suppose that more than half a million men have been dismissed from the public service since the capture of JEFF. DAVIS, and many of the soldiers had three, six or nine months' pay due, all of which they received before getting their discharge. Many of the large contracts, also, have come to a close, and the accounts been settled by the government.

The course of the trial, from its beginning to its close, has been followed with very great interest throughout the country. It was not because the incidents of the crime were of any very extraordinary character; or that the public or social position of either of the parties was eminent; or that the counsel on one side or the other were of marked distinction; or that there was any expectation that any new principle would be settled by it, or that the verdict would be other than what it has been.

In these cases the subjects of the outrage found themselves abroad in the streets, under perfectly legitimate circumstances, at a late hour, without a male protector, and hurrying homeward in great trepidation. They were roughly taken into custody, their explanations were unheeded, and they were subjected to the indignity of a night's detention at the station-house, because, forsooth, an ignorant policeman choose to suspect them of being common bawds. A man of ordinary discernment, in these instances, would have discovered at a glance that such suspicion was groundless. We know that in a body of policemen, numbering at least two thousand, it is quite possible that a few idiots may contrive to receive appointments; but we trust, and have reason to believe, that the Metropolitan Police Commissioners will dismiss at once every patrolman who shall make such flagrant and unhappy mistakes.

Although there are many exceptionable remarks in that speech -- remarks elicited, doubtless, by the temper of Gov. PERRY's audience, we do not think there is anything to excite a suspicion of the Governor's loyalty, or of the perfect good faith with which he purposes to act in his official capacity. It is rather surprising to hear a South Carolina mountaineer like Mr. PERRY -- to say nothing of the delicate office he holds -- declare that ""in all history there is not a more perfect model of a pure and great man, (save WASHINGTON,) than ROBERT E. LEE."" One would have supposed that a fitter subject for eulogy might have been found by an official who has gained his present position upon the faith placed by the Executive in Mr. PERRY's solemn disclaimers of any sympathy with secession or its advocates.

At noon the party proceeded to the Union Ball-ground, Brooklyn, and at 2:45 began play in a match with the Resolute Club. The Resolutes, on this occasion, had a majority of their nine out, and played one of their best games, both in the field and at the bat. The display on the part of the Lowell nine was excellent in regard to batting, and their fielding, considering the high wind which prevailed, was, in many respects, praiseworthy. There is evidently first-class material in the club, and the practice they will have during their visit will greatly develope it. All who witnessed their play were impressed with the fact that they are as gentlemanly and intelligent a party of ball-players as ever visited the city.

CHAIRMAN: This public meeting of the citizens of Greenville is one of deep humiliation and sorrow. A cruel and bloody war has swept over the Southern States. One hundred and fifty thousand of our bravest and most gallant men have fallen on the field of battle. The land is filled with mourning widows and orphans. There is scarcely a house in which there has not been weeping for some loved one lost. Three thousand millions of dollars have been spent by the Southern States in carrying on this war. And now we are called upon to give up four millions of slaves, worth two thousand millions of dollars more. Our country has been ravaged and desolated. Our cities, towns and villages are smouldering ruins. Conquering armies occupy the country. The Confederacy has fallen, and we have been deprived of all civil government and political rights. We have neither law nor order. There is no protection of life, liberty or property. Everywhere there is demoralization, rapine and murder. Hunger and starvation are upon us. And now we meet as a disgraced and subjugated people, to petition the conqueror to restore our lost rights.

The contest was resumed at 12:50, BRYAN and CASSIDY taking their places at the bat again. As both were in good trim, and in play another fine display at the bat was looked for, but after a few overs had been received from HALLIS and KIDD it was at once seen that the increased liveliness of the ground had proportionally improved the bowling and great care was needed in defence off the wickets. HALLIS especially being well on the spot all the time, and bowling very wickedly. BYRON had played him neatly for a couple of single's, when on facing KIDD he gave a chance to BULLIS at slip which was of course taken, and BYRON retired for the splendid total of 75, the highest made in this country for many years past, HUDSON's 85 being the only one that has excelled it for the past nine years. After he had retired, the other wickets soon followed, the interest in the match being pretty much ended, the last wicket going down for 184. At 1:40 NEWMARK went to the bat for the second time, and 76 had been added to their score when the innings closed, thus requiring New-York to go in again for 4 runs, which they obtained before a wicket bad fallen, the final result being then settled with ten wickets to fall.

This intelligence has already reached us from persons who have recently come from the great grazing State. The practibility of driving sheep such a great distance has been fully proved by experience. Three years ago, large droves of sheep were driven to this city from the Rio Grande, and the sheep arrived here in better condition than when they left. They are driven across a country which, at this season of the year, is one great, rich meadow, with frequent ponds of fresh water and salt lakes and marshes, and thus, by easy marches and careful herding, arrive here in much better condition than the poor, imprisoned, crowded inmates of steamboats and flatboats which get nothing to eat on their voyage but dry hay. What is thus done with sheep, may also be done with beef cattle; and these droves of sheep, at least, will prove the avant courriers of like droves of the fine, fat and deliciously flavored beeves from the musquit pastures of Texas. The disbandment of the armies will throw a great many people into this business, and herding and cattle driving promises to be one of the most flourishing occupations in the Southwest. Its success and increase will produce two effects of great value and importance to our city. The first is the augmentation of the wealth and great development of the resources of a State with whose progress and advancement our city is closely identified; and the second is the assurance that our markets will be well supplied with the great essentials of subsistence, at reasonable prices. These prices ought to be lower than in any other city in the Union, as no other community will have so easy and cheap an access to so great a source of supply. The greatest need now of New-Orleans is cheap subsistence, which will offer temptation to emigration, and encouragement of labor and industry, and prevent that great obstacle to our city's progress in population and wealth, to wit: the expensiveness of living, and the consequent tendency of certain classes of our population to remove to other parts of the country, where, though their labor may not be so remunerative, the cost of living is so much lower.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CATTLE FROM TEXAS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CATTLE FROM TEXAS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the New-Orleans Picayune, July 11', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'July', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e96ff58e-f92b-5b14-b3b5-1f9361cac6e3,467,nyt://article/e96ff58e-f92b-5b14-b3b5-1f9361cac6e3,

These people make all the money they can, but they can no more control the prices of the articles they deal in than they can reverse the movements of the tides, or make the trunk of a tree grow into the earth instead of out of it. Prices are permanently controlled by the law of supply and demand, and the Editor of the TIMES would be about as sensibly employed in abusing the chickens for the present scarcity and dearness of eggs, as to berate the milkmen and butchers for the price of milk and meat. One would suppose from reading the TIMES that all the butcher-boys and old women who owned cows had entered into an oath-bound conspiracy to rob the people of this fair realm. It is quite absurd to complain of high prices. The tremendous debt we have incurred in this war settles that question for the present generation.

Of Sheep last week there were 13,215, and this week there are 17,500. In sheep, also, there is a slight rise. Now there are, every one knows, a set of men who intercept the droves and flocks, and thus interpose a speculative price before they can reach the consumer.

DIX has closed his labors as commander of this department, and has been succeeded by Gen. HOOKER. During the period of Gen. DIX's semi-military labors here, he has so acted and so borne himself as to command the profound respect of the entire body of our citizens. The appointment, in the first place, was one peculiarly fitting. Gen. DIX not only had a national reputation as a statesman and administrator, but his long public career in the city and State had at once made him widely known to our citizens, and thoroughly familiar with our local affairs. His bearing and action as commander of the department have been singularly free from assumption, from arbitrary and dictatorial conduct and from intemperate measures; and have been characterized by dignity, suavity, and a spirit of moderation and conciliation. There have been many difficult cases and questions to deal with, such as the St. Albans raiders, the Lake pirates, the rebel incendiaries, the drafts and innumerable matters of administration; but Gen. DIX has dealt with them in such a manner as to secure at once popular satisfaction and the approval of the government; and in but one instance (viz: his order to pursue the raiders into Canada) has his course been modified by the President. Prior to administering the affairs of the Department of the East, with his headquarters in this city, Gen. DIX was in command of the Middle Department, with his headquarters at Baltimore; and the energy and wisdom he has displayed here were also of the highest efficiency and value then and there. Prior to that time again, in more strictly military service at Fortress Monroe, he approved himself a true soldier. In short, from the time of his ever-memorable order at the opening of the war, to shoot upon the spot any man who tore down the American flag, until the close of the rebellion, our distinguished fellow-citizen has done himself honor by honoring his country.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

Her appearance being that of an invalid who had long suffered under chronic infirmity, and as she had but a pittance to spare, Mrs. WORCESTER thought it not prudent to admit her; but at length she was prevailed upon to take the stranger in, and a room was assigned her under the pseudonym of MARY BROWS.

Taking a cramped but not unpleasant room on the third-story, the unknown locked herself within, and there, reticent and pensive, sat from dawn until dusk, and admitted only the female physician to whom she had come in her extremity. But even to this woman, to whom she must unavoidably communicate something of her history, she revealed nothing beyond the fact that the man to whom she gave her trust in girlhood bad within eight years frequently placed her in the hands of physicians whose names she declined to disclose, and that this was her seventh errand abroad to seek temporary shelter under a stranger's roof. She had never been guilty of infidelity to the man who ought to have made her a wife, but as he had persistently refused to acknowledge the paternity of her offspring, it had thus often become necessary to destroy the evidence of her imprudence. Who this man is, where he dwells, and what are his pecuniary circumstances and social standing, his faithful, unfortunate victim only knew; but that he is a person of opulence does not seem probable, since the poor woman had only $30 when she first appeared at Mrs. WORCESTER's, and her habit, though rich and fashionable, was yet far from such as the mistress of a man of wealth might be supposed to wear, She had no jewelry, not even a ring.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; DEATH AT A PRIVATE LYING-IN HOSPITAL.

Significant Eagerness for; Statistics of from Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/21/archives/the-significance-of-the-eagerness-for-pardon.html,Significant Eagerness for; Statistics of from Europe,"The pressure of rebel Generals, rebel Congressmen, rebel officials of all sorts upon the President for pardon strikingly shows the slight hold their cause had upon their moral convictions. There is such a thing as facing exile or even death itself sooner than renounce principle, or bend the knee to its enemy. History abounds with instances of men who staked their all upon some great revolutionary effort for the good of their country; who did not suffer even the most crushing defeat to shake their devotion, and were proud to testify it by courting any extremity of fate. Such men have gone to the scaffold, or lain immured for years in subterranean dungeons, sooner than recant their principles, and put themselves in the position of suppliants before the power they had combatted. Often, when even no terms whatever were imposed, when a complete unconditional pardon was tendered, all grace has been spurned. Eight years ago the French Emperor proclaimed an absolute amnesty to all the proscribed enemies of his dynasty. He required no oath, attached no condition. Yet there are hundreds who, like VICTOR HUGO and LOUIS BLANC, prefer to live in perpetual exile from the France they love so well, rather than discredit their principles by taking any boon from an imperial hand. From every oppressed nation and nationality in Europe, there are exiles in this country, who are here solely because they consider that fidelity to their principles requires it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Significance of the Eagerness for Pardon.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Significance of the Eagerness for Pardon.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Pardons', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6c768062-85b3-5b4e-805c-91fbbd2ed897,1119,nyt://article/6c768062-85b3-5b4e-805c-91fbbd2ed897,

Brooklyn Navy-yard frauds,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/21/archives/brooklyn-news-the-navyyard-frauds-charge-of-swindling.html,Brooklyn Navy-yard frauds,"-- HOW WORKMEN ARE EMPLOYED AND WHAT THEY DO. -- An interesting state of facts was developed yesterday before United States Commissioner NEWTON in relation to operations in the Navy-yard. Some time since JOHN MAXON, JOHN R. MARSDEN, WM. MCDERMOTT and FRANCIS RILEY were arrested on the charge of defrauding the government by carrying off several thousand dollars worth of manufactured material. They all occupy prominent positions in the mechanical departments of the yard. JOSEPH ANDERSON, of No. 137 South First-street, E.D., was the only witness examined. His testimony shows that he was employed in the pattern shop under MCDERMOTT and MARSDEN in 1861, and continued until 1864 or 1865, (he is not certain what year,) when he was discharged. When he commenced work MCDERMOTT was master boiler-maker, and MAXON master pattern-maker. MARSDEN came there in 1861, in place of MCDERMOTT. Witness was employed in making patterns for machinery, and also in making four book-cases and three tool-chests. He commenced this work in the Fall of 1863, and they were finished in the Summer of 1864. The material used in their manufacture was mahogany and black walnut. The book-cases were gothic finished, sash-doors, carved and otherwise ornamented. Each case had four sections which, when put together, made a case 8 feet high, 5 feet wide and 20 inches deep. They were manufactured in the top loft of the pattern-shop, in a room on one end of the building which had been partitioned off before the cases were commenced. The room was 14 by 12 feet in extent. Previous to this time the room had been accessible to all the workmen, but after the work on the drawers was commenced it was kept locked by direction of Mr. MCDERMOTT. The time employed in manufacturing the book-cases was about two years, several men being occupied on them. The actual time occupied was about one year. MARSDEN and MCDERMOTT were in the habit of visiting the rooms, and the latter gave directions every time he came. The materials for the cases came from the lumber-room attached to the pattern shop. It was of the best quality. The screws were procured from the office of the pattern shop. No nails were used. Two of the cases were of mahogany, and two of black walnut. During the time witness and another man, named NOYES, were working on the cases the door was kept locked. Access was gained by knocking three times on the door. While witness was working in the room nothing else but the cases were made there. Received $2 50 per day from the government. Beside witness, two men, named HARRIS and SEYMOUR, or SEAMAN, worked on the cases. HARRIS did the carving, at which ho was engaged six months, and SEYMOUR put the locks on and did other work on the drawers. Three tool chests were made at the time the cases were made. They were of black walnut. Some three weeks were spent in their manufacture. They were worth $75 each, without the tools, and were afterwards fitted up with tools such as mechanics seldom use, because they are so costly. Witness saw two of the chests in MARSDEN's office, and one was taken down stairs. The book-cases cost from $500 to $600 each. They could have been made outside for from $300 to $400. All work costs more in the yard than outside. Sometimes a man gets a hint (the witness testified) not to do more than he can help. On his cross-examination, witness acknowledged having also made a tool-chest and small work-chest for himself. The three tool-chests were made for Messrs. MARSDEN, MAXON and MCDERMOTT. The above is the substance of Mr. ALEXANDER's testimony.

Building in New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/21/archives/houses-and-housebuilding-in-the-city-of-newyork.html,Building in New-York,"The Commercial Chronicle takes up the subject of house-building, and the great want of houses in New-York for business people of small incomes, and mechanics and others with limited wages, upon which we have frequently written of late. We think, however, it makes a great mistake in arguing that what are needed most are small houses, to be occupied by single families. Houses of such a character are perfectly adapted to small towns, or to the suburbs of large cities, where there is room for unlimited expansion. But in a great city like this, located on a small island -- in a place where land is of such great value -- in a community where time is of so much importance -- in a society where there is such a great proportion of industrious but poorly-paid workers -- it would neither be convenient nor profitable to have large spaces covered by small, ""self-contained"" cottages. The population of our island is now over a million, and by 1880 it will almost certainly be three times as great; and to accommodate this vast mass of human beings decently and economically, we must have blocks of compact yet commodious houses, of from three to five stories in height. Those who are worst off for accommodations now are small traders and mechanics and others, whose earnings are from twelve to twenty dollars a week. Even at the cheapest rates possible for rents on this island, considering the price of real estate, the cost of labor and material, and the value of capital, those people, in single families, could not afford to rent even small cottages; and yet we see no reason why there should not be provided for their use commodious, ample, wholesome apartments, in which families could be reared in health, virtue and intelligence.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Houses and House-Building in the City of New-York.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Houses and House-Building in the City of New-York.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8eb3f0d7-5150-5527-b2e0-f3a116ac1da5,763,nyt://article/8eb3f0d7-5150-5527-b2e0-f3a116ac1da5,

While he accorded every praise to the North for their conduct in reference to the abolition of the slave-trade, and for granting to all nations the right of search, he did not believe, as many good men did both in this country and on the other side of the Atlantic, that the emancipation of the slaves was pronounced for the benefit of the slaves themselves, but as a measure intended to harass the South.

"A decision has recently been rendered by Judge DENIO, of the Court of Appeals, to the effect that this city is not liable for damages to property caused by the elements in districts where sewers have not been constructed by the authorities. The leading case bearing upon this subject was brought before the Kings County Circuit Court some three years since. The plaintiffs were JOHN H. MILLS and ISAAC DEAN, who brought an action against the City of Brooklyn, to recover $2,500 for damages to building owned by them on the corner of Franklin and Putnam avenues. The trial took place before Judge SCRUGHAM and a jury. It appears that the building was Hooded on the occasion of several violent rain storms in the Fall of 1861, and was considerably injured. It not being practicable to carry out the permanent plan of sewerage in the vicinity, a temporary sewer was built in April, 1851, which proved insufficient to carry off the immense volume of surface water that flows down Franklin-avenue after a heavy rain. The plaintiffs based their claim upon the negligence and improvidence of the city authorities in not providing a sufficient sewer, an act of the Legislature empowering the Water Commissioners to frame and fill a general system or plan of sewerage for the whole city, which should be the ""permanent plan"" of such sewerage, and according to which the whole work should be done. A verdict in favor of plaintiffs was rendered. The case was carried to the General Term of the Supreme Court, and the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed, the opinion being given by Judge LOTT. An appeal was then made to the Court of Appeals, and the judgment of the lower courts was reversed, the Chief Justice giving an elaborate opinion, in which, after reviewing all the points in the case, he declares that the city is not responsible for the want of judgment upon which the system of sewerage was devised, or for the insufficiency of sewers laid.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/21/archives/the-sewerage-question-in-brooklyn.html,,"A decision has recently been rendered by Judge DENIO, of the Court of Appeals, to the effect that this city is not liable for damages to property caused by the elements in districts where sewers have not been constructed by the authorities.

At a meeting held in Detroit, in connection with the recent convention, it will be remembered, Mr. POTTER laid himself open to a charge of excessive candor, by declaring that if the Reciprocity Treaty were not renewed, the colonists would soon begin to perceive the advantages of annexation. Nothing could be truer than Mr. POTTER's observation. But, although that observation was accompanied with many kind words and apologies for the Canadians, it has excited so much consternation in political circles that petitions are being sent round for signature in Montreal, demanding a government inquest into Mr. POTTER's conduct.

"On Tuesday evening, Detective Officer GEORGE W. ELDER apprehended one JAMES THOMSON for picking a gentleman's pocket at the box-office at Niblo's. THOMSON, who is otherwise known as ROGERS, was taken to Police Headquarters and searched, and in his possession was found a card that had manifestly been torn from a trunk, inscribed, ""Mrs. JOSEPH BRITTON, Baldwin House, Lake Mahopac, N.Y.

The prisoner was questioned concerning this card, but he held his peace, and Detective ELDER was forced to seek information in another quarter: but this, happily, he soon obtained from a gentleman who had seen THOMSON riding out with two females that seemed suddenly to have donned new dresses of the latest fashion. Having obtained this clue, the detective officer visited one LIZZIE DIXON, in Thompson-street, and one IDA CLARK, in Wooster-street, and found in their rooms the contents of Mrs. BRITTON's trunks, and the females confessed that the same had been given them by THOMSON.

The facts are thus stated: The barber is a man of some property, and has heretofore borne a good character in the town; but, early one morning last week, he so far forgot himself as to seize the lady alluded to in the rear of his house, where she had gone for a pitcher of water, and endeavored to make her submit to his embraces. He did not succeed in his effort, however, and the lady immediately stated the circumstance to her husband. He then advised with his neighbors as to what course to pursue in the matter; but before they came to any conclusion, news of the transaction spread throughout the town, and some eighteen or twenty young men visited the barber's shop and carried him to the outskirts of the town. After some little delay a pail of tar and a bag of feathers were procured, when the offender was divested of his clothing and completely covered with that garment of lawless fame known as ""a coat of tar and feathers."" It is believed that the man received no further injury. A gentleman in the town, sympathizing with the barber, offered $100 for the apprehension of the young men, but he has been threatened with a like visit, it is said, for his interference.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dc196d1c-13eb-532f-9545-164c465dd4eb,431,nyt://article/dc196d1c-13eb-532f-9545-164c465dd4eb,

He was talking with a friend, when SULLIVAN approached in an inebriate condition, which drew a taunting remark from WILSON. SULLIVAN thereupon made a violent assault upon him, and WILSON, picking up a brickbat, struck him in the head with it, following it by striking him several times with a fence paling, fracturing his skull in several places and battering his face, disfiguring him in a terrible manner. The wounded man died almost instantly. WILSON was arrested.

WEBB, Esq., at the foot of Sixth-street, East River, which has excited no little wonder in naval circles, as well as in the minds of people generally. When first projected, it was supposed and hoped that it would be completed in season to take part in the capture of Charleston or Mobile, or teach those mysterious Richmond rams, which were always going to do such great things, a salutary lesson in naval warfare. With his usual sense of the fitness of things, the projector and builder christened her the Dunderberg -- a name at once expressive of her formidable qualities, and sonorous, national and historical. Dunderberg, as our readers probably know, is the name of the mountain near West Point, at the foot of which Capt. KIDD is popularly supposed to have sunk his piratical craft, laden with gold and rigged with ""curses dark,"" and where, in later years, a massive iron cable was stretched across the Hudson to prevent the ascent of British ships-of-war.

We see no reason why the latter mark may not be adopted without injury or risk. All accounts represent that an absolute submission to the National Government prevails everywhere throughout the South. There is not the least guerrilla warfare among the whites, nor the fear of any; and not the slightest sign of a violent disposition has yet appeared among the blacks. There is, indeed, great disturbance of industry, and a certain extent of civil and social disorganization, but nothing that calls for military interposition.

Our own view, at the first blush, is, that such an elevated viaduct -- light as the structure is -- would be objectionable on Broadway. But if the feasibility of the enterprise were made otherwise certain, there would be means of finding right-of-way on less thronged and important thoroughfares. It is claimed by the author of the present device, that a road such as he proposes -- extending from Madison-square to Bowling-green -- can be built in four months, and built without disturbing the traffic on any portion of the streets through which the line passes.

To them the publishers have joined the author's ""Lectures on Translating Homer,"" making it a complete collection of his miscellaneous writings. Mr. ARNOLD is the eldest son of Dr. THOMAS ARNOLD, of Rugby, and bids fair to become as celebrated a man as his father. As a critic he stands alone amid writers of the day, and brings to his task a delicacy of discrimination, vigor of thought, and fascination of style without a parallel in cotemporary literature. He is one of the severest denouncers of the provincial spirit dominant in English writers, as well as in the social life of the nation, and hesitates not to shock its dearest prejudices, while inculcating greater breadth of view and catholicity of treatment. As a volume for Summer reading -- weighty in actual substance, but light and sparkling in manner, sufficiently attractive to enchain the most ordinary reader, and solemn enough to afford subjects for the meditation of the most cultivated -- we know no recent work that can compete with it.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ESSAYS IN CRITICISM.; By MATTHEW ARNOLD, Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. 12mo.Boston: TICKNOR & FIELDS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ESSAYS IN CRITICISM.; By MATTHEW ARNOLD, Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. 12mo.Boston: TICKNOR & FIELDS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/216e628f-86c4-5457-a8a5-ba0d0e385b5b,190,nyt://article/216e628f-86c4-5457-a8a5-ba0d0e385b5b,

Dr. BAXLEY has seen much, and has, accordingly, much to tell. His style, however, has a certain official ponderosity about it that is not attractive. We are not aware what part of the country he comes from, but his opinions, freely expressed, in rather a sermonising style, have a smack of the old Southern flavor about them, that now seems, to say the least, out of date. We hear much of Puritan persecution and intolerance, and bitter denunciation of the missionary proceedings in the Sandwich Islands. A labored defence of negro slavery in tropical countries is also undertaken by the author. His professional pursuits give special value to many of his remarks and observations on hygiene, medical geography, &c.

Hackmen and their Charges; Letter from Capt. Brackett,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/24/archives/hackmen-and-their-charges.html,Hackmen and their Charges; Letter from Capt. Brackett,"We publish elsewhere a communication from Capt. CHARLES N. BRACKETT, ""Captain Twenty-sixth Precinct,"" respecting hackmen's charges. We know all about the law, which Capt. BRACKETT is so industrious as to quote for our instruction. What we have had to complain of is not the law, but the practice. This we mentioned in previously referring to the subject. The law is, that you may be carried a mile for two shillings, York money; and for that sum you may take a moderate-sized trunk along with you. The practice is, you can't ride any distance at all under a dollar. The hackman's first inquiry has reference to your destination; the second bears upon the money consideration. If either answer disagrees with his inclination, he refuses to serve you. This was precisely the case with the gentleman who asked, on Sunday, the 16th, to have his trunk taken from the corner of Spring-street and Broadway to the Hudson River Railroad station. One hackman after another demanded the same fare -- $3 -- for the service. The intending traveler had no means of compelling them to go on the errand for less. No law that we know of would empower even Capt. BRACKETT himself to make the hackman do the required service. Where, then, is the practical benefit of the tariff which is supposed to regulate the charges of these cabmen? Everyone knows that not one traveler in ten thousand can find cab and conveyance for a mile at the reasonable charge of 50 cents.

Pauperism; Reform Needed,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/24/archives/southern-pauperism-and-paupersimperative-need-of-reform.html,Pauperism; Reform Needed,"We spoke the other day of the great reductions in expenses that are now being made by several departments of the government and in various branches of the public service. There is one matter concerning which it is quite time that we had some efficient action. We refer to the system that has sprung up since the war, of issuing government rations to destitute or needy persons of both sexes, and of all colors, throughout the cities and States of the South. The system grew in magnitude as our armies made conquest of larger and larger spaces of the Southern territory, and since the close of the war it has assumed absolutely appalling proportions. Its operation begins with Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac river, with the cities of Norfolk and Alexandria, in the East, and extends to the uttermost bounds of the republic in the Southwest. In the Mississippi Valley it commences, on a large scale, we believe, somewhere about the latitude of Knoxville, Nashville, Memphis and Little Rock, and reaches across the cotton States to the coast. There are large cities like Mobile, where, incredible as it may seem, three-fourths of the white population and one-fourth of the blacks, live from day to day upon the rations issued to them from the government storehouses. It is true, that owing to the late great fire, the number in that city is exceptionally large; but there are many Southern localities in which we are supporting from a fourth to a half of the entire people, and, judging by the statements in our Southern exchanges, we should think there were not less than one hundred towns and cities in the South, in each of which from two to ten thousand individuals are fed on public rations. As soon as a military post is established in any locality, the needy applicants for relief present themselves, and the poverty-stricken country folks also rush into the towns as beggars, whenever they hear the news. The bulk of the recipients fancy they have a perfect right to this bounty; and we have heard of cases in which they watched the weighing scales and scanned the bushel measured, with a sharpness that could not be surpassed -- delivering maledictions upon the heads of the functionaries if they failed to give satisfactory weight or measure.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Southern Pauperism and Paupers--Imperative Need of Reform.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Southern Pauperism and Paupers--Imperative Need of Reform.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8dd381bd-e5f5-5fcb-90f6-4408143797d3,1000,nyt://article/8dd381bd-e5f5-5fcb-90f6-4408143797d3,

Thus far the Whigs, under Lord PALMERSTON, have apparently gained nothing. The Tories have lost six seats, but these cannot be counted as absolute Whig gains. JOHN STUART MILL, for example, can hardly be regarded as a Ministerial accession. And it is doubtful even whether THOMAS HUGHES (""Tom Brown"") can be ranked in the Ministerial lists. The governing party, moreover, (they are called Liberals by courtesy,) have had some of their underlings rejected, and most righteously, we believe. Among others of the small official tribe rejected, we note the name of Lord BURY, Treasurer of the Queen's Household -- a young man, known here as an official in the neighboring provinces, and son-in-law of the late Sir ALLAN MCNAB, of rebellion notoriety. One of the PAGETS, too -- whether CLARENCE or ALFRED, it is not stated -- figures among the rejected. CLARENCE is Secretary of the Admiralty, and a good-tempered placeman. ALFRED is an officer of the Queen's hoosehold, and is chiefly known by having made one laughable speech, in connection with the arrival of the Princess ALEXANDRA in England, and of having broken down in attempting to make a second. Col. WHITE, who is likewise one of the rejected Whig officials, was member for Kidderminster. And as for Mr. FREDERICK PEEL, he is an Under Secretary, and the son of his father. No one ever supposed he was fit to be anything but a Whig placeman, and it seems the electors of the burgh of Bury think he is not even fit for that.

BRYAN REILLY, a member of Engine Company No. 2, was dangerously shot, and Officer WILLIAM L. WALLACE, of the Seventh Precinct, while endeavoring to quell the disturbance and disperse the mob, was brutally beaten, and will probably be unfit for duty for a long time. It is alleged that THOMAS SHIELDS, proprietor of a saloon in the neighborhood of the affray, who was drunk and disorderly at the time, instigated the affray. He was arrested after a desperate struggle, and taken to the station-house. The officers were compelled to use their locusts freely to conquer him. Capt. JAMEISON, of the Seventh Precinct, made a report to Inspector CARPENTER, from which it appears that Officer WALLACE was the first to reach the scene of disturbance, when he was instantly surrounded by a mob, and was compelled to fight his way out, or run the risk of losing his life. During the melee a pistol was discharged, the ball from which took effect in the right side of REGAN REILLY. The latter was taken to the New-York Hospital for treatment yesterday morning. SHIELDS was arraigned at the Essex Market Police Court on a charge of assaulting and beating Officer WALLACE. A commitment was made out for the accused, and while Officer WALLACE was taking SHIELDS to the cell, the latter turned and struck the officer in open court, and afterward kicked him while lying helpless on the floor. The magistrate required SHIELDS to give additional bail in the sum of $500 for the second assault. RICHARD WALTERS, of No. 27 East Broadway, became bondsman for SHIELDS. It being found that REILLY could not live, Coroner COLLIN yesterday went to the Hospital and took his deposition, as follows:",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Essex Market Before Justice Shandley.; SHOOTING IN THE SEVENTH WARD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Essex Market Before Justice Shandley.; SHOOTING IN THE SEVENTH WARD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-07-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4b047768-8b69-5d9e-be62-d8c918096367,920,nyt://article/4b047768-8b69-5d9e-be62-d8c918096367,

"At every meeting of the Police Commissioners for the trial of police cases, complaints are made by parties who have been arrested without cause and even on the most frivolous pretexts. These arrests, are, of course, made by officers who are insufficiently acquainted with their duty, but they are none the less annoying to the parties arrested. A case occurred a few days ago, in which the stupidity of a policeman was sufficiently exemplified. An intoxicated soldier entered CROOK & DUFF's dining-saloon, in Park-row,and becoming very noisy was politely requested by the Superintendent, Mr. NASH, to be quiet. Shortly afterward the man produced some clams from his pocket and taking up a plated ivory-handled table-knife proceeded therewith to extricate the bivalve. Mr. NASH seeing that the man would not listen to reason, took hold of him by the shoulders and put him out on the sidewalk, the man still retaining his hold of the knife. Mr. NASH then grasped his hand and endeavored to take the knife from him, and in so doing the man fell on the sidewalk. A policeman, THOMAS MURRAY, of the Second Precinct, at once came up, declared that the soldier was badly hurt, and that Mr. NASH must accompany him to the station-house. Mr. NASH accordingly went to the station-house and related the whole affair to Sergeant LATTY, who ordered the officer to take the case to court. In this the Sergeant only did his duty, as he had no power to release an arrested person without an order from a Police Magistrate. On the case being brought before Justice DOWLING, he merely inquired whether the man was drunk, and on being assured by Mr. NASH that he was, he at once ordered him to be locked up, and told Mr. NASH that he was at liberty to return to his duties.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/25/archives/an-undiscriminating-policeman.html,,"At every meeting of the Police Commissioners for the trial of police cases, complaints are made by parties who have been arrested without cause and even on the most frivolous pretexts.

The amount of the debt on the 1st of August may, perhaps, be twenty-eight hundred millions, or a little more. The authority for borrowing money on long loans will be exhausted with the last series of seven-thirties. There remains of this loan to-day, untaken, forty millions or less. At the close of the loan it is probable that the whole remainder will be taken up in large sums, as heretofore. There will be no new loan till Congress shall authorize one, and, meanwhile, it is supposed that the Treasury can meet all demands upon it by the current revenue, and without calling too rapidly upon the national banks for the public deposits.

"BROADWAY THEATRE. -- That quaint old specimen of dramatic artifice called the ""Soldier's Daughter,"" was played here last night for the purpose of introducing Mr. SEDLEY SMITH to the audience. The gentleman is a favorite with our Boston friends, and enjoys the metropolitan distinction of being the father of one of our most charming comediennes -- Mrs SEDLEY BROWN. In the stormy part of Governor Heartall, Mr. SMITH appeared only to moderate advantage, but with sufficient emphasis and discretion to demonstrate the value of his addition to the company. Such characters, in truth, are no longer attractive on the stage, and in real life they never existed. ""You lie, you scoundrel,"" is a vigorous form of speech, reminding one of the editorial columns of a contemporary, but its too frequent repetition is aggravating. There is hardly anything else to fall back upon. The inevitable nephew was played carefully but somewhat tamely by Mr. G.D. CHAPLIN, and the wearisome poor gentleman, (""the dear friend of my dead brother,"" guggle, guggle, et seq.,) with the thin breeches and thick skull, who, it is plain to everyone, could be more easily touched with a kick than an idea, this vaporous creature was personated by Mr. HAMBLIN -- a gentleman who is struggling bravely and conscientiously with the difficulties of his profession. Miss KATE REIGNOLDS was a good Wiaow Cheerly. She is, indeed, excellent in all that she undertakes, but shines particularly in comedy; even in this sort of comedy, with its intense verbosity and artificial plumping of silly sentences.

"Williamsburgh, Highway, Third-street in Afternoon",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/25/archives/brooklyn-news.html,"Williamsburgh, Highway, Third-street in Afternoon","HIGHWAY ROBBERY. -- Yesterday afternoon a man aged 70 years, was walking along Fourth-avenue, near Third-street, Gowanus, when he was met by two young fellows, who accosted him and asked what time it was. While the old man was getting his watch out -- the process being rather slow -- one of the fellows ""turned him over,"" and the other took his watch, a silver one, for which he had paid £10 sterling, in London. His pockets were rifled, and only five cents and a bunch of keys were found. The money was appropriated, but the thieves were magnaminous enough to let him retain the keys. Sergeant MATHEWS and Officer SCOTT, of the Fiftieth Precinct Police, being informed of the occurrence, pursued the fellows, and officer SCOTT nabbed one of them, who is known by the name of Butcher MORSE.

The laws of civilized warfare must be vindicated; and some expiation must be exacted for the most infernal crime of the century. The guilt is of that character which it is impossible to cover by any legal perversion, or by any denial of the evidence. The laws of war, which require that prisoners should not be put to death, and shall be spared all needless suffering, are as distinctly set forth by all the standard authorities on the subject, and as universally recognized by Christian nations as any principles of public law. The fact that the prisoners in the hands of the rebels were subjected to unnecessary cruelties, which, in thousands of instances, resulted in death, rests upon proofs that exclude all possibility of doubt. Even if, in the spirit of extremest charity, it be allowed that the meagreness of the rebel commissary stores was such that the prisoner depots could barely be furnished with a sufficiency of wholesome food, there were other deadly cruelties than starvation, for which it is impossible to plead any such necessity. Nothing can be said in mitigation of the stripping of our prisoners of the apparel required for their warmth, of refusing them fire, of withholding pure water, of selecting miasmatic sites for places of confinement, of making those places mere pens, without roofs or any shelter whatever from the scorching suns of Summer, and the pelting storms of Winter; or any of the other hundred forms of maltreatment, all calculated to kill by inches. Give the rebels the benefit of every possible excuse in connection with their straitened means, and other peculiar circumstances, and yet the fact stands that thousands of Northern soldiers are buried under Southern soil who to-day would be rejoicing at home had they received, we will not say such treatment as did the rebel prisoners in our hands, but the treatment the rebels could have given, had they been disposed, even had their disadvantages been ten times greater than they were.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Justice Upon the Murderers of the Prisoners.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Justice Upon the Murderers of the Prisoners.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PRISONERS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/408bfc3d-50b0-5145-85af-d2fbf4f4ca6e,1220,nyt://article/408bfc3d-50b0-5145-85af-d2fbf4f4ca6e,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/26/archives/newjersey.html,,"LARGE FIRE NEAR BERGEN TUNNEL. -- About 12 o'clock on Monday night a fire was discovered in the extensive cattle pens, formerly occupied also for slaughtering purposes, belonging to the Erie Railroad Company, and situated near the western debouchment of the Bergen Tunnel, at a place called West End. The area covered by the sheds was very large, and sufficient to accommodate temporarily a considerable number of cattle, prior to their transfer to the cattle-yards on Bergen Hill and other depots. About the centre of the area was a very extensive building, which also sheltered cattle, and which was formerly used as the main slaughter-house. Owing to the combustible character of the buildings -- the wood-work being, in some instances, almost saturated with grease -- the flames spread with great rapidity, and soon enveloped the entire property. The fire caused a brilliant light and attracted the attention of the fire companies of Union Hill, West Hoboken and Jersey City, who hastened to the assistance of their Hudson City brethren. All efforts to subdue the flames, however, were unavailing until some adjoining buildings were torn down, when the progress of the fire toward the neighboring dwellings was stayed. The fire occurred on the identical spot made notorious as the scene of the tunnel riots four years ago, and the rioters were addressed by the Priest and Mayor from the platform upon which cattle were landed preparatory to being sent to the pens. The loss is estimated at from $15,000 to $20,000, on which there is no insurance.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW-JERSEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6e17f6e5-044d-507e-a705-f47ce9e1c844,256,nyt://article/6e17f6e5-044d-507e-a705-f47ce9e1c844,

Honors to the Brave at,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/26/archives/honors-to-the-brave.html,Honors to the Brave at,"The celebrations that are being held by some of our great colleges, in commemoration of those of their graduates who fell during the war, and in honor of those who have done service and survived it, deserve commendation, and their example ought to be followed by all the institutions of learning in the land. That at Harvard last week, of which the TIMES yesterday contained a full and admirable account, was altogether the most imposing that has yet taken place. It showed, so far as it went, and we know that the record in every other case would be essentially the same, how noble has been the patriotic attitude and practical action of the scholarship and intellect of the republic during its late crisis. It disposes of the wicked statement of the Copperheads that those who were learned and well-to-do contented themselves with urging others to rush to the battle-field, while they devoted themselves to selfish ease. The simple facts that out of 2,400 living graduates of Harvard (including the aged, sick, absent and all,) over five hundred voluntarily entered the service of the country, and one hundred of them fell in it, (not counting the wounded and sick,) furnish a sufficient answer to all the falsehoods and sneers about the matter. Ten fell at Gettysburgh, said Gov. ANDREW; seven fell at Antietam; five at Fredericksburgh, five at Cedar Mountain, five in this struggle, and as many more in that; and every arm of the service, military and naval, was represented; every rank, from Major-General to private, from Gen. WADSWORTH, who fell in the Wilderness, to private EMERSON, who fell at Chancellorsville. At this commemoration alone there were present twelve distinguished General officers who had graduated at Harvard, and, in the true democracy of New-England, they shared the honors of the day with those of their fellow-graduates who had done service as privates in the ranks. ""God knows,"" exclaimed RALPH WALDO EMERSON, ""God knows these scholars and idealists had no fury for killing their old friends and countrymen;"" but ""they exchanged the black coat for the blue,"" because of their all-dominating devotion to their country.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HONORS TO THE BRAVE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HONORS TO THE BRAVE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/81373b6c-c262-5a3a-a9f2-2873cbdce7fd,454,nyt://article/81373b6c-c262-5a3a-a9f2-2873cbdce7fd,

Speeches,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/26/archives/soldiers-and-orators.html,Speeches,"It is pleasant to hear a soldier tell of his battles and a victor recount his triumphs. But we fear that the friends of Gen. SHERMAN, in the West, will not add to his fame by compelling him to deliver public speeches at the rate of two or three a week. We have published a number of these speeches, and yesterday we gave quite a lengthy one, which he delivered at St. Louis a few days ago. As is natural, they relate mainly to his own exploits in the war. During its progress he was bitterly averse to the correspondents who attempted to follow him and chronicle his deeds; and we judge now the reason was that he considered them ignorant as to the real part he played in the conduct of affairs. That part, it would seem, has been much greater than ever was heretofore supposed. Even in the earliest stages of the war, before GRANT had achieved a single victory, Gen. SHERMAN told HALLECK privately that the ""perpendicular"" of the rebel line in the southwest was the Tennessee River, and that it would have to be broken ""physically by a perpendicular force."" And so he goes on, narrating circumstances of the subsequent great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley, showing, at every step, how little these people know who attributed their success to the genius of GRANT.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SOLDIERS AND ORATORS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SOLDIERS AND ORATORS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c375a69f-4ec4-591a-a114-89f4cf3619f7,271,nyt://article/c375a69f-4ec4-591a-a114-89f4cf3619f7,

Capital and Labor; their Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/26/archives/capital-and-labor.html,Capital and Labor; their Meeting,"We are glad to see that the workmen at different trades and handicrafts are meeting together extensively to discuss their interests, and are taking council one with another. The question of wages, the question of hours of work, the question of apprenticeship, the question of the relations of labor and capital, and other questions, temporary and permanent, will all be helped to a satisfactory solution by wise discussion, and by a comparison of views and notes on the part of all concerned. We think it would be well if those Societies and Unions which are composed mainly of the working craftsmen, would secure the attendance at their meetings of those who are employers, ""bosses"" and capitalists. Many misunderstandings would thus be prevented, many mistakes corrected, many theories tested at both ends. It seems from the proceedings of some of these societies that many of their members cannot get out of their heads the notion that capital is everlastingly and necessarily at war with labor, that employers are the natural enemies of the employed, and that it is the duty of one to organize for perpetual resistance to the other.

"A foreign cotemporary says: It is not many months since one of the most eminent of living microscopists expressed his conviction that in the production of object glasses with one twenty-fifth of an inch focus, the microscope had reached its utmost attainable limit of perfection.

"Keystone, of Philadelphia, vs. Eckford",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/27/archives/outdoor-sports-base-ball-keystone-vs-eckfordan-exciting-game-at.html,"Keystone, of Philadelphia, vs. Eckford","Truly is base ball an uncertain game, and seldom has there been a more striking illustration of the fact than was afforded in the contest between the above clubs, which took place on the Union Ball Grounds, Brooklyn, yesterday, the result being the success of the Keystones by a score of 18 to 16, the game being one of the best contested, and most exciting matches of the season. Both clubs had fine teams to represent them, and both appeared to be in excellent condition for play, the Eckfords opening play in brilliant style at the bat, obtaining no less than thirteen runs in their first innings. This done, the spectators seemed to consider the defeat of the Philadelphians, and knowing, as we did, how difficult it is to beat a club like the Eckfords, with such an advantageous lead to start with, it ready did seem as if the Keystone were fated to meet with defeat in every game. But in base ball, no game, however bad it looks, can be considered lost until the last innings has been played and the result declared, and apparently the Keystones entertained the idea that this was so, for they pluckily went to work, and played one of the best up-hill games we have seen for a long time past. The game was not so much lost by the Eckfords as it was won by the Keystones. If there was any weak point of play on the Eckford side, it was in the very inaccurate pitching, which, but for the fine catching, would have led to a worse defeat. On the Keystone side these two positions were admirably attended to, the fielding at second base being a feature of the game, three splendid catches marking the Keystone play in this position.

"-- Mr. W.H. RUSSELL's account of the condition of the Great Eastern, with her full freight and supply of coals on board, is not flattering. The entire load is full twenty-five thousand tons, and with that she is alarmingly deep in the water, besides presenting the appearance of sagging amidships. We do not know that these symptoms are mitigated by the repeated delays in starting. By the Scotia, yesterday, whose news comes down to the 16th inst., we have no assurance that, up to that date, the Great Eastern had even left the Nore. Before she could make Valentia Bay, and get the cable spliced, we fear the end of the month will be found rapidly approaching.

The entire load is full twenty-five thousand tons, and with that she is alarmingly deep in the water, besides presenting the appearance of sagging amidships. We do not know that these symptoms are mitigated by the repeated delays in starting. By the Scotia, yesterday, whose news comes down to the 16th inst., we have no assurance that, up to that date, the Great Eastern had even left the Nore. Before she could make Valentia Bay, and get the cable spliced, we fear the end of the month will be found rapidly approaching.

From the evidence thus far elicited, it appears that the deceased, in company with Mr. ROBITAELLE, living in Thirty-first-street, near Second-avenue, another man and two young women had been to the Fenian Pic-nic at Jones' Woods. They returned in a small boat, and landed at Allen's Point, foot of Fifty-fifth-street, and entered the public house, where they partook of refreshments. Another boat-load of men from Jones' Wood soon entered the place, one of whom accused SMITH and his companions with stealing a pair of oars. Without awaiting an explanation, a murderous assault was begun on SMITH and his male companions by the new-comers. One of his assailants knocked SMITH down, and drawing a knife or other sharp instrument, inflicted three terrible wounds on the back of his neck, a severe gash across his throat, besides several less serious wounds. SMITH sprang to his feet, with the blood gushing from his wounds, and ran about one hundred and fifty feet, when he fell to the ground and expired. The murderer then attempted to take the life of POBETAILLE with the same weapon. The latter received one dangerous wound on the right side of the neck. Officers CLARK and HEILMAN, of the Nineteenth Precinct, succeeded in arresting two men, PETER CARLEY and FREDERICK HOOKER, the former a boiler-maker, and the latter a boatman, on suspicion of having committed the murder. HOOKER made a desperate resistance, and could not be arrested until Officer HIELMAN had discharged his revolver at him. The prisoners were taken to the station-house and locked up. Yesterday afternoon, Coroner COLLINS began an investigation on the body of the deceased, which was not concluded last evening. It will be resumed at 1 P.M. to-day, at the Nineteenth Precinct Station-house in Fifty-ninth-street.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BRUTAL MURDER IN THE NINETEENTH WARD.; A Party Attacked while Coming from the Fenian Pic-nic.

Securities; Renewed Activity in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/28/archives/renewed-activity-in-government-securities-ties.html,Securities; Renewed Activity in,"-The apprehensions of impending stringency in the money market, so prevalent a week ago, having completely subsided, because of the unyielding confidence of the people in the solvency and uprightness of their government -- which practically means confidence in the energy, enterprise and honesty of the people themselves -- national securities have recovered from the depression with which last week closed so gloomily. Prices of all the gold-bearing bonds have rallied materially under a marked improvement in the demand on both home and foreign account. The Scotia, at this port early on Wednesday, brought liberal fresh orders for the national six per cents, especially the 5-20s, together with advices that all the large shipments of the bonds from this side, made prior to the first of the current month, had been speedily absorbed by the investment demand in London and Frankfort at generally firm and buoyant prices. The latest London quotations for the 5-20s by the Scotia, were (in specie) 71 1/2@72, which, with gold at 145, are equivalent to 115 7/8@116 [???]/8 in the New-York market. The purchases of this special class of bonds on foreign account within the past three days, exceed three million dollars, including a snug lump of one million dollars taken for Germany on Wednesday. The renewed foreign demand for our government bonds promises to keep down the adverse balances of our foreign trade, which, on last week's imports into this port, as against the exports from the port, were against New-York to the tune of over five million dollars in currency value. The shipments of the bonds on a liberal scale will prevent any material outflow of specie, and tend to check the inflation of the premium on gold coin, which an influential clique of operators are indefatigably laboring to stimulate -- using, for this nefarious purpose, mounds of borrowed money, gross misrepresentations of the wants and resources of the National Treasury, and an extensive assortment of similar false pretences.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RENEWED ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.; TIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'RENEWED ACTIVITY IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.; TIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1994799d-4ece-5370-8829-d6f8b76b2707,326,nyt://article/1994799d-4ece-5370-8829-d6f8b76b2707,

Vernon","This great trial came off, according to arrangement, on Tuesday afternoon, but, owing to the various severe tests, it was not concluded until Wednesday afternoon. The trial has been the most interesting of any that has over taken place in this country. The great mechanical improvements in all the first-class machines rendered it necessary to make the trial a severe one, and the work laid out by the committee was of a character never attempted before in any country. The ground selected was at West Mount Vernon, on the Harlem Road. Twenty acres of the bottom-land along the banks of the Bronx River was held in reserve for the trial. The first trial was in a piece of seven acres. The grass was very heavy, mostly blue grass and red top. This piece had been several times overflowed within the last month, and it would have been with great difficulty that a man with the old-fashioned scythe could make much headway in the grass. The machines, in their order of numbers, were set at work at 2:30 o'clock, going entirely around this plot. No. 1, the Clipper machine, made the first round. The ground moved over was very undulating and rough. The machine frequently settled in mudsloughs and water, so as to hide one-half of the machine; but still it worked on. In cutting around, it was required to stop and start, without backing, in the heaviest and worst tangled grass, and in every instance it performed its work. All the machines that followed were required to do the same work. They were the Buckeye, Monitor, Union, Two-in-one, Harvester, Hubbard, and a one-horse Clipper. Two or three of these machines failed to accomplish all that was required by the committee. This experiment occupied the afternoon, and was witnessed by nearly 2,000 persons. Further tests of the machines were postponed to 8 o'clock Wednesday morning.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AGRICULTURAL.; Great Trial of Mowing-Machines for the Gold Medal of the American Institute.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AGRICULTURAL.; Great Trial of Mowing-Machines for the Gold Medal of the American Institute.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1dff54dd-a8c9-539d-9fd9-bb5869e814ac,903,nyt://article/1dff54dd-a8c9-539d-9fd9-bb5869e814ac,

Both recently agreed to turn their skill to some account, and consummated a bargain, by which one should achieve a reputation, and the other (who is of a mercenary disposition) money. The agreement was that both should travel frequently on the East River ferry-boats, and when a good opportunity presented itself, one was to ""accidentally"" fall overboard, while the other was to heroically plunge in and rescue him.

Seven-Thirty Loan; The Close of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/28/archives/the-close-of-the-great-seventhirty-loan.html,Seven-Thirty Loan; The Close of,"All of the great Seven-Thirty has now been marketed. The three series of notes into which the Loan was divided were as follows: The first series, of $300,000,000, bearing date Aug. 15, 1864, and now quoted at par and interest; the second series, also of $300,000,000, bearing date June 15, 1865, and now selling in this market at 99 3/4 a 99 7/8, adding interest; and the third and final series of $230,000,000, bearing date July 15, 1865, and just closed out at par and interest. These three series of notes make a grand aggregate of $830,000,000, all disposed of within a single year, in the home market, exclusively, and at par. Under the direct supervision of the Treasury Department, between the beginning of August, 1864, and the 1st of February, 1865, a period of six months, the sales of the first series of the loan reached $130,000,000, or a weekly average of $5,000,000. Late in January, 1865, Hon. WM.P. FESSENDEN, then Secretary of the Treasury, reappointed Mr. JAY COOKE general Loan Subscription Agent of the department, the duties of which position he had demonstrated his eminent fitness to discharge during the process of marketing over five hundred millions of the Five-Twenty Loan, the popular precursor of the emphatically more popular Seven-Thirties. Mr. COOKE formally assumed charge of the Seven-Thirty Loan on the 1st of February, and promptly revived the admirable sub-agency system, which he had organized during his first official connection with the national finances. Between the 1st of February and the 26th of the current month of July, Mr. COOKE's agent, acting under his personal supervision, sold $700,000,000 worth of Seven-Thirties, thus running up the daily average rate of sale to within a traction of $5,000,000, or equal to the weekly rate of distribution, under the Treasury management. Never, in the history of nations, was such an enormous amount of money raised for public use, with such extraordinary rapidity and success, as in the instance of the great Seven-Thirty Loan, which is now all in the bands of the loyal people, and deemed by them the most desirable security ever issued by the government. The notes of the loan have been more widely distributed than any previous issues of the Treasury Department, with the solitary exception of the famous greenbacks. And, it is safe to say, that wherever, in the remotest section of the country, any spare greenbacks awaited on opportunity for reliable and profitable investment, the Seven-Thirties found them out, drew them forth, and swallowed them up, to the advantage, present and prospective, of all interested parties.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Close of the Great Seven-Thirty Loan.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Close of the Great Seven-Thirty Loan.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6aabbe18-ddfe-5fa8-9bb1-b50d2b043fc9,430,nyt://article/6aabbe18-ddfe-5fa8-9bb1-b50d2b043fc9,

WILLIAM JAY, of Bedford, N.Y., late of the headquarters staff of the Army of the Potomac, resigned his position after the closing review at Washington. Col. JAY, who, at the outbreak of the rebellion, was about completing his studies in the law school of Columbia College, was in April, 1861 appointed by Maj.-Gen. JOHN E. WOOL a volunteer aid. In August of the same year he was commissioned by President LINCOLN under the act of Congress authorizing ""aid-de-camps,"" and was the first officer of that corps with the rank of Captain -- the next appointed, in September, having been Capt. LOUIS PHILIPPE D'ORLEANS, Comte de Paris, and Capt. ROBERT D'ORLEANS, Duc de Chartres, whose gallant services under Gen. MCCLELLAN have an historic significance. Capt. JAY was assigned successively by the War Department to the staffs of Major-Gens. WOOL, GEORGE W. MORRELL, and GEORGE G. MEADE, and served under the last named commander, then in charge of the Fifth Corps, at Chancellorsville. When Gen. MEADE became Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Potomac, Capt. JAY was temporarily assigned to the staff of Major-Gen. GEORGE SYKES, at the request of that officer, who succeeded to tue command of the Fifth Corps, then famous for its force of regulars, and served with him at Gettysburgh and other battles to the close of the Mine Run campaign. Recalled to the staff of the Commanding General in April, 1864, he continued with Gen. MEADE throughout the memorable campaign that commenced with the crossing of the Rapidan and ended with the surrender of LEE. The conferring of brevets having been authorized by Congress in 1864, Capt. JAY was in that year breveted Major by President LINCOLN for his conduct in the field; and again, on the 15th June, 1865, by President JOHNSON, Lieutenant-Colonel, to rank from the 9th of April, ""for gallant and meritorious services during the recent operations resulting in the fall of Richmond and the surrender of the insurgent army under Gen. ROBERT E. LEE."" Maj.-Gen. MEADE, in addressing the War Department on the 25th May, 1865, after approving of Col. JAY's resignation, added: ""I deem it due to this officer's distinguished services to express officially my approbation of his gallantry and zeal, and the intelligence he has ever displayed since being under my command."" Col. JAY is a son of JOHN JAY, Esq., of New-York, and a grandson and namesake of the late Judge WILLIAM JAY. -- Army and Navy Journal.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Lieut.-Col.

SINGULAR CASE OF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. A man named EDWARD DEADAN was discovered in Washington Park about 3 o'clock yesterday morning lying on the grass and laboring under great pain.

His groans had attracted the attention of some citizens in the neighborhood who went to his relief. They found him bleeding profusely and soon ascertained that he had been stabbed. Officers GRIFFIN, BOONE and WHEATON, of the Forty-fourth Precinct Police, came up some time thereafter, and the injured man was conveyed to the City Hospital. The physicians found that he had been stabbed nine times in the left breast, all the punctures being within a space of about three inches in circumference. DEADAN who was perfectly conscious stated that He was a native of Philadelphia, and 30 years of age; that he came to this city for the purpose of procuring employment but had not succeeded; he had only $150, and desiring to save that, concluded to sleep in the Park instead of procuring lodgings at a hotel. While lying on a bench two men came up; one struck him and the other inflicted the stabs, when they robbed him of his money. He described the men very particularly, their height, dress and color of hair. Capt. WADDY made arrangements to arrest certain parties who had been seen in the Park during the night, but before he could accomplish his object he paid a visit, on invitation, to the injured man. His wounds had been probed, and it was ascertained that they were of so serious a character that his death might be expected any time. The physicians could give him no hopes whatever. Being fearful that he had not long to live he made a statement altogether different from that made but a few hours previous, and which was to the effect that he had been a soldier, and, having no home nor relations, did not know what to do with himself, and so resolved to commit suicide; that he had not been assaulted or robbed by any one, but that he inflicted the stabs with his own hand. The knife with which he cut himself was found in his pocket. It was very bloody. There appears to be no doubt but that the last statement is the correct one. He was in a very precarious condition last evening.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.; FIRES AND ROBBERY. THE FURMAN-STREET DISASTER. THE NAVY-YARD INVESTIGATION.

Shenandoah in Arctic Seas,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/29/archives/flourishing-state-of-the-pirate-business-in-the-arctic-seas.html,Shenandoah in Arctic Seas,"Lord RUSSELL will have an early opportunity of putting in practice his considerate purpose of hospitality toward one at least of the pirates still afloat. The latest report of the Shenandoah comes to us by way of San Francisco, where a whaling vessel (the Milo) arrived on the 20th instant, with the crews of some ten of our whalers, destroyed by the pirate in the Arctic seas during the month of June. At the date of the Milo's parting with the Shenandoah, that enterprising craft had the prospect of a healthy business before her. There were some sixty of our whaling fleet within reach of her; and the total destruction of the whole of them was a matter more of certainty than speculation. After that job shall have been fairly completed, and if nothing further of a promising character turns up in the same quarter, the pirate can return to a British port at Hong Kong or Vancouver's Island, laden with her stealings. At any of these ports -- being those of the only nation which still extends hospitality to the pirates -- the Shenandoah may take one of two different courses with perfect safety. She may, according to Lord RUSSELL's dispatch, be disarmed and sold for the benefit of her enterprising owners, or she may get her supplies as she would have done before the war closed, and then, for the last time -- Lord RUSSELL is liberal enough to determine -- she may sail out under the twenty-four hours rule, should any United States vessel be in the some port at the time of her departure.

This outspoken advocate of extortion is fitly answered by two correspondents, whose letters we place side by side with his. If ten cents for a short-measure quart is a reasonable price, how comes it that a number of the wealthiest families in New-York, residing in the best parts of Twenty-first, Twenty-second and Twenty-third-streets, have been able by combining together to get the best Orange County milk supplied to them for eight cents, or twenty per cent. less than they paid before the agitation was commenced in these columns? Then again, what has the advocate of high prices to say to the fact stated by another correspondent that the milkmen buy from the farmers by the ""dry measure"" quart and sell by the wine measure, making nearly a pint extra on every quart?

The war was nearly over before an adequate system of taxation was adjusted and put in operation; and even yet it is by no means effectively applied throughout the country, for the simple reason that it takes time to get the great machinery in working order. Yet the results thus far are beyond all previous calculation, and promise to be far better every week in the future. The receipts from taxation are now about a million of dollars a day; and the Internal Revenue Bureau at Washington estimate that they will fully equal this figure for the next three months. Judging by the returns being made in this city, we should think that a much higher estimate for the whole country might be made. The receipts from import duties also are very heavy, being at this port alone, at this time, at the weekly average of two millions four hundred thousand dollars. It is true that this very fact is taken advantage of to damage the public credit, but for this the law provides a very simple and effective remedy. So satisfactory is the working of these two great engines of national revenue, that it was semi-officially announced from Washington yesterday that ""the Secretary of the Treasury is of the opinion that, owing to the continued reduction of the expenditures of the government, the Treasury can be kept in an easy condition by receipts from the usual source of revenue, and meet all requisitions which can be properly made upon it until the meeting of Congress.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Revenues.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Revenues.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dca33ce6-929a-5642-b074-e66f75c6ce52,459,nyt://article/dca33ce6-929a-5642-b074-e66f75c6ce52,

"Paris Exhibition of 1867, Report of Com.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/30/archives/miscellaneous-the-paris-exhibition-of-1867-curious-literary.html,"Paris Exhibition of 1867, Report of Com.","The Moniteur publishes a report from M. DUMAS, President of the Municipal Council, to the Imperial Commission of the Universal Exhibition, in the name of the Committee of Construction. The document gives an historical sketch of public exhibitions in France from the commencement of the century, and then proceeds to inquire what space should be assigned to the building destined to receive the objects to be exhibited in 1867. The London Exhibition of 1851, received 14,000 exhibitors, and 96,000 square metres of space; that of Paris in 1856,24,000 and 112,000 respectively; the second of London, 27,000 and 120,000; and the coming exhibition will propably receive the articles of 30,000 persons and require 140,000 square metres of superficies. The report examines the several plans proposed for the building to be erected in the Champ-de-Mars, and states that the one decided on will consist of a ground floor only, with an exceedingly large space all around for approaches and other accommodation. The two exhibitions of industrial objects and of the fine arts will take place in the same building, all the foreign members of the commission being unanimous on the advantage of that course. A Paris letter in the Independance of Brussels gives the following particulars respecting the proposed exhibition: ""This immense edifice will be about 500 metres in length, and 400 in width. The form proposed is elliptical, or rather that of a parallelogram, with a semi-circle added to each end. The arrangement will allow all the industrial and artistic productions of the different countries to be distributed in lines, resembling those of a spider's web. Besides two great passages, one from the Pont d'Iena, the other facing the Ecole Militaire, a number of sectors, or raddii, cross the concentric galleries, the largest of which, nearest the circumference, is devoted to machinery, and the one nearest the centre, to the fine arts. In the midst is to be a garden, which will permit the visitors to go into the open air without leaving the precincts of the building. After the gallery of fine arts, which may be said to terminate inside the construction devoted to the exhibition, comes an annexed space, leading immediately to the garden, and presenting the history of human ingenuity of all ages and nations, by means of specimens of the different instruments man has invented to facilitate labor. The passage leading from the middle of the palace toward the Pont d'Iena will, moreover, have a peculiar interest; being preceded by a sumptuous vestibule, which forms the interior of the facade, it will be nothing less than a gallery devoted to the plastic history of the earth, as well by geological sections as by landscapes, completing this instructive exhibition. The palace will be connected with the Seine by a cutting through the quay at the Pont d'Iena; visitors will pass under a light bridge made expressly to lead to the salon. The river itself will be utilized, and will become an aquatic hall of the exposition, at the same time as a means for arrivals by water. Buoys, anchors and naval apparatus of all kinds will here be exhibited in their proper element. Such, I believe, are the arrangements already decided. There is also what may be called the fancy part of the project, which is not definitely fixed, and may be modified or even abandoned. The Palace of Industry only occupying about one-third of the Champ-de-Mars, it has been suggested to transform the rest into a kind of park, in which the public would not only find cafes, restaurants, &c., but also cabinets intended for correspondence, an electric telegraph, a small theatre for plays in all languages, a conversation-room, a model farm, a specimen of a camp, and even an observatory. In this part, and close to the outer walls of the palace, will be placed the boilers of the steam engines for working the machines in the great gallery at the end, as it is not thought prudent to have the boilers inside the building.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; THE PARIS EXHIBITION OF 1867.

This train ought to have waited until the Indian express had passed, but the station-master allowed it to proceed, thinking it would have time to pass over the portion of the railway with a single line before the other reached that point. The contrary, however, occurred, and the two trains -- one proceeding at the rate of 25 and the other nearly 50 miles an hour -- came into collision with a terrible crash. The first carriages of the Marseilles train were smashed to pieces and heaped on each other, and the driver of the Indian mail train was killed. The catastrophe took place in the open country, and at a distance from any town, and the wounded persons lay for three hours before any surgical assistance could be obtained. The scene was most horrible; the fragments of the carriages, exposed to the burning rays of the sun; the greater part had their legs or thighs crushed. One unfortunate young woman about to become a mother had both her legs broken, and with her last breath gave birth to a child. The agent who was accompanying one of the trains had both his legs cut off and died on the spot.

"Yesterday morning the Bishop Wainright Memorial Church, corner of Waverley-place and Hammond-street, was crowded by a large audience, assembled on the first Sunday after the death of the rector, to listen to a discourse from Rev. WILLIAM C. WINSLOW. After the usual services in the Episcopal form, and the singing of the hymn, ""There is a Land of Pure Delight,"" the preacher discoursed from the text, ""God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death,"" &c. After an eloquent exposition of this portion of Scripture, and agraphic description of the condition of the redeemed in Heaven, Mr. WINSLOW spoke of our Saviour as being the chief and greatest attraction of Heaven. ""The Lamb is the light thereof,"" was quoted and vividly represented. The speaker passed to the presence of our friends in Heaven as being among the heavenly attractions, ""they make Heaven richer and earth poorer.""

This was in 1854. About that time, mainly in order to secure the election of the aforesaid Mayor and certain of his henchmen as Aldermen, there was formed the infamous secret society, since known as ""The Ring."" This society, following the illustrious example of the Mozart Napoleon, jobbed out the laws and franchises of the city to the highest bidders, and sold their votes for and against affairs of public concern with equal facility to political friend or foe, except in cases of great party moment. That Ring is as perfect to-day as ever. It seems to be the veritable serpent with his tail in his mouth by which the ancients symbolized eternity. The Mogul is in a foreign land, but his ""moral effect"" still guides and controls the oath-bound gang of thieves who prey upon the long-suffering tax-payers and tax-earners of this city.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Tax-Payers Having Danced, Will Now Have to Pay the Piper.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Tax-Payers Having Danced, Will Now Have to Pay the Piper.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3d972062-42ef-58c4-a74c-ab143a29b9db,826,nyt://article/3d972062-42ef-58c4-a74c-ab143a29b9db,

The powers of the Common Council, though still extensive, are gradually becoming more circumscribed. Within a few years past the Legislature has taken out of their hands the care of emigrants and paupers, the control of the police force and the Fire Department, and now the cleaning of our streets is superintended by a commission.

Whenever his native land is in an extremity of misfortune, or whenever its fortunes begin to brighten, he springs to the front, sword in hand, and rushes, as the case may be, upon those whom he considers the authors of its ruin, or upon those who are attempting to rescue it from destruction. It seems to make comparatively little odds to him. He belongs constitutionally to the remarkable order of men who have dominated Mexico for the last forty years -- ambitious, revolutionary, scheming and selfish, ever proclaiming liberty and always trampling it under foot, ever, as he claims, attempting to rescue his country, and always plunging it into profounder and more hopeless anarchy. For the last ten years SANTA ANNA has been an exile, and during that period he has seen the government of Mexico upset half-a-dozen times. He has seen the Liberal party give way to the Priest party, Republicanism give place to Imperialism; but through all the changes, there has been no cessation in the war and bloodshed which had been continuous during the thirty-five years of his previous public life in Mexico.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mexico The Reappearance of Santa Anna.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mexico The Reappearance of Santa Anna.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9ba80d1c-6a5c-55b4-bfc3-b5de3447aef8,906,nyt://article/9ba80d1c-6a5c-55b4-bfc3-b5de3447aef8,

The unfortunate man, it appears, left letters behind him, giving as a reason for his act, the difficulty or impossibility of finding employment. It is just possible that this declaration -- made under such fearful circumstances -- may create an unwarrantable impression among those who live at a distance. There may be peculiar crafts in which the supply of skilled labor is, at this moment, superabundant. But as a rule, no industrious, steady and honest mechanic need go long in search of employment -- least of all one who, like this unfortunate man, had lived a long while in the city. The high price of provisions, the scarcity of dwellings, and the terrible rate at which municipal taxation increases, make it a harder job than it ought to be for working-men to make both ends meet.
