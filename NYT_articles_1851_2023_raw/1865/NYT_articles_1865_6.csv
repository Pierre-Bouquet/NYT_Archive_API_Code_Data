SHERMAN yesterday bade farewell to the gallant armies that have followed him from victory to victory over a field almost as wide as our country. In plain, blunt, soldier-like words he briefly alludes to the leading features of their career, rejoices over the glorious termination of their work; hopes and believes that as they have been good soldiers they will be equally good citizens; warns them against filibustering temptations, and closes by saying that if the day should come when war should once more be inevitable, ""SHERMAN's army"" would be the first to reassume the arms they are now laying down, and stand foremost in defence of the government of their country.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/068f89ae-0819-5836-98c3-5be01f3e35c8,336,nyt://article/068f89ae-0819-5836-98c3-5be01f3e35c8,

"Morse, Calvin S.; Particulars",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/01/archives/brooklyn-news.html,"Morse, Calvin S.; Particulars","THE SUICIDE ON BOARD THE NORTH CAROLINA. -- An inquest was held yesterday with the view of inquiring into the death of CALVIN S. MORSE, who committed suicide on board the United States receiving-ship North Carolina on Saturday night last. A number of witnesses were examined, from which it appears that deceased had formerly kept a saloon in a questionable neighborhood in Washington, D.C., and becoming tired of his associations there, both male and female, and especially the latter, he sold out and came to New-York. He subsequently shipped in the navy as a landsman, and, in consequence of his intelligence, was assigned to a position in the Paymaster's office, which position he filled with satisfaction to his superior officer. For some days previous to the fatal deed, it was noticed that he was troubled in mind, and from some expressions it was understood that he believed himself implicated in the assassination of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. On the day previous to putting an end to his existence he asked several to feel the region of his heart, and one or two accommodated him, and by that means he evidently ascertained the exact location of that organ. After retiring to his room he shot himself through the heart with a pistol. No one on board appears to have heard the report and his dead body was not discovered till morning. Among his effects were letters from Senator FOSTER of Connecticut, and Senator HARRIS of New-York, urgently recommending him to an appointment on the Government detective force. Also, several letters from a female named LOUISE M. WESTON, of Washington, D.C. After the evidence had concluded the jury retired. The majority brought in a verdict that deceased came to his death by deliberately shooting himself with a pistol while laboring under temporary abberation of mind. The verdict of the minority of the jury was to the effect that deceased came to his death by a pistol-shot wound, but for what motive unknown to them. Coroner LYMAN accepted the majority verdict, and the jury was discharged.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/216ea29a-8e02-5d66-a69c-15b80ffec450,867,nyt://article/216ea29a-8e02-5d66-a69c-15b80ffec450,

It is true that the people have already mourned, as no people ever mourned before for the loss of a leader. It is true that the hand of Providence, in permitting the dreadful blow, has everywhere been recognized. Yet all that has been expressed hitherto has been the natural prompting of each individual heart. The manifestation of feeling has been purely popular -- the same, differing in degree only, as that which has so widely displayed itself in other lands. The nation, in its national capacity, has yet to signalize its sense of the bereavement, and to bow itself humbly before high Heaven.

He has, in short, turned author, like his imperial master; modern instead of ancient Home being his theme. He predicts the perfect liberation and unity of Italy, as the certain result of French intervention. If he could predict as much for the country that supports him as the result of imperialism, he would do more to earn his wages. PERSIGNY's plan for Italy is to perfect the reconciliation between the Papacy and VICTOR EMMANUEL, and then set on foot a scheme for the purchase of Venetia.

"The attendance at the Seventh-street M.E. Church, yesterday, was quite large, the pastor of the church, Rev. F. BOTTOME, acting as chairman.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/02/archives/the-seventhstreet-me-church.html,,"Rev. Dr. CROOKS, on being introduced, repeated part of Mr. LINCOLN's farewell address, delivered at the time of leaving his homo in 1861, and part of his last, inaugural, and then said, that between those two extremes, separated from one another by four brief years, there was condensed a career, probably the most remarkable of any occurring during our entire history; one whose closing calamity was so touching as to be felt to the very verge of civilization. We were assembled to express, as well as we could, our conception of that calamity, and to draw some lessons from the mysterious providence which has befallen our nation. There was, evidently, a function to be performed by our great men in society; so great that we regard it as an inexpressible calamity when God takes from the nation the man by whom it was to be performed. A new theory had arisen, and it might be designated as Caesarism. It assumes that great men are the representatives of Providence, and have a divine right to rule; that they are the Messiahs of the human race, and men rejecting their counsels are as criminal as were the Jews who rejected the Divine Son of God. It followed, as a corrollary of this theory, that a great man was a law to himself, and he was bound to obey nothing but his own impulses. Were constitutions in the way of his destiny, then must they fall and be trampled under foot. To such men institutions were but fictions, and to them God had given the promise of restoration, and the duty of the world was to submit to their will. It was a singular coincidence, that just the hour which had given us a clear exposition of Caesarism was the hour which completed the career of the lowly ABRAHAM LINCOLN, whose life was a refutation of this monstrous error, whose whole career was a demonstration of its falsity, and a typical manifestation of human character. While the Emperor NAPOLEON, under the guise of national history, was teaching the world its error in rejecting his predecessor -- his great model, while, at the same time, one of England's greatest historians was presenting to us the career of FREDERICK the Great, the king who rejected the vain babblings of men because he was infinitely raised above them, the lowly, the loving, the upright, the conscientious ABRAHAM LINCOLN, who was a refutation of this fake syllogism, appears and passes over the stage of human history, drawing to him all the eyes of mankind and followed to his grave by the tears of the whole world. No Caesar ever received such triumphal honors; no Caesar was ever so bewailed; none ever drew such tributes from mankind as civilization hastened to place upon the lowly tomb of ABRAHAM LINCOLN. We, then, had an opposite, a contradictory theory of the functions of great men. It was that great men are the exponents of the people -- the guardians of the trust reposed in them by a people concious of its destiny and able to attain it. Under the former theory the Caesar represented only the man; under the latter one the leader represented the people from whose bosom he came. A Caesar would acknowledge no law but his own impulses; a true leader would recognize the people as the source from which he sprang, that all just government is of the people, and by the people and for the people. Mr. LINCOLN had some principles which we did not then appreciate. His first axiom was, ""The American people must save themselves."" The second was a fitting complement of the first, ""The American people can and will save themselves."" He had not the vanity or ambition of a great deliverer, and no act of his suggested any attempt in that direction. He only wanted to know the duty of the hour, and was fully resolved to know it. Believing that with the people the solution of this great problem rested, knowing that they would at last decide the course which was wise to be chosen, listening ever to their voices, he was, consequently, slow, but he was slow because it was his province; nay, it was his principle ever to keep step with the people. He would never move forward until they were ready to move with him, and when he did advance there were millions to meet him, and as their footsteps rose and fell the very earth was shaken. It was that that gave our President his wondrous power. The heart-throbs of ABRAHAM LINCOLN were those of the whole American people; the feet of ABRAHAM LINCOLN were those that moved forward twenty millions of loyal citizens. His was not the power of a Caesar, not the power that gives, from the recesses of the heart, plans which none can know, but the power which drank in its inspiration from the hearts of the common masses, and this inspiration seemed next to that which came from Heaven for all them in the way of duty and of truth. In some respects he cast aside all the time-honored precedents of his position; not merely a few chosen political guides, but the every-day men were intimate with him. He was not above being counseled and he was counseled. Whenever before did ministers have such an audience as the President of the United States? The merchant, the farmer and the plain laboring man, all had access to that lowly mind. He debated questions with the nation and was the only President who ever fairly and frankly did so; and showed most clearly that while receiving impressions he was likewise giving them. A philosopher has told us that if every man had a window in his breast the world would see strange things, but God did make one man thus, and every man [???] the lines, yet only one lesson: ""Duty to God, duty to the people, with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God give us to see it."" Like all great men, Mr. LINCOLN had a large humanity and was the finest [???] character. Though marshaling armies to decide the destiny of the nation, he never forgot the under humanities of life. In one corner of his desk he kept somehow works tending to show the humorous side of the struggle through which was were passing, and when worn out by toil he would indulge in a genial laugh. It was never heard that JEFF. DAVIS ever burst out in a wholesome genial laugh. When appealed to on the tender side of his nature, the appeal never came in vain. His head was now among the stars, and",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SEVENTH-STREET M.E. CHURCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SEVENTH-STREET M.E.

There is, with the exception of JEFFERSON DAVIS himself, not one of the Southern politicians who is more deserving of attention at the hands of the officers of the law than this Georgian worthy. He was Secretary of the Treasury in 1861, and was one of the original plotters of the rebellion. So far from resigning his office, however, when he determined to take part in it, he deliberately remained in it, and used the powers it bestowed on him for the destruction of the government, thus committing double perjury. With ample funds in his hands, he deliberately failed to pay the interest on the public debt, and the credit of the United States was only saved from receiving a disastrous and disgraceful shock, by some merchants of this city coming forward and voluntarily advancing the required amount. We believe there is not to be found in the political history of any country an example of greater baseness and perfidy than this of COBB's; and what makes it all the worse is, that he had the audacity, after perpetrating it, to come to New-York, and brag of it openly, in the faces of the people whom he had swindled and outraged, announcing that ""the whole thing"" -- meaning the national government -- ""was gone up.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Howell Cobb--His Rank Offence.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Howell Cobb--His Rank Offence.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Cobb, Howell', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/629a6bce-68c1-557a-b297-173f269f1a53,566,nyt://article/629a6bce-68c1-557a-b297-173f269f1a53,

They are careful not to let their readers know that the assassination plot was intended to include not only President LINCOLN, but Mr. JOHNSON, Mr. SEWARD, Mr. STANTON and Gen. GRANT. The best answer to this special pleading are the words uttered by JEFF. DAVIS himself, at Charlotte, on receiving the news of the assassination. Instead of expressing the horror and indignation which a really ""high-toned and gallant gentleman"" would have felt at such a crime, he complacently remarked: ""if it were to be done it were better that it were well done."" Subsequently, in reply to a fear expressed by BRECKINRIDGE that the assassination might be unfortunate for the South, he said: ""Well, General, I don't know; if it were to be done at all, it were better it were well done; and if the same were done to ANDY JOHNSON, the beast, and to Secretary STANTON, the job would then be complete.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PLEA FOR DAVIS IN ENGLAND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PLEA FOR DAVIS IN ENGLAND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9a97775b-8764-5efc-8e67-64af58aacdb8,242,nyt://article/9a97775b-8764-5efc-8e67-64af58aacdb8,

Microscopist; Entertainment to Soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/03/archives/entertainment-at-the-soldiers-depot.html,Microscopist; Entertainment to Soldiers,"Prof. STARR, the microscopist, gave a tree exhibition to a large number of Union soldiers, at the depot in Howard-street, on Wednesday evening. This is the second entertainment that the Professor has given at this place within a few weeks, entirely free of charge. The exhibition was on this occasion rendered doubly interesting by the introduction of a novel and most exciting feature, entitled the ""Combat of the Water Demons,"" in which two of the most fearful and voracious microscopic monsters were put into the same cage, when a battle immediately ensued, surpassing in fury anything ever witnessed in the bloody arenas of ancient Greece or Rome. After a prolonged struggle, in which the wildest paroxysms of rage were manifested, the engagement was suddenly terminated by the introduction of the aquatic tiger, a most uncouth and horrible shape, which devoured both of these tiny yet terrible gladiators in the twinkling of an eye. This water tiger, the only specimen known to exist, was captured by the Professor, and has been regularly fed by him every day for years. Of all the misshapen, colossal forms exhumed by the geologists, we have yet to see anything half so curious and ugly as this tiger. Under the Professor's powerful instrument, his alimentary canal becomes transparent throughout its whole length, and the spectators can easily see him swallow pieces of food apparently as large as their heads. Prof. STARR, as is well known, has the largest and costliest oxy-hydrogen microscope in this country, and the series of microscopic acquariums which be exhibited, some of them teeming with incomputable millions of the most mercurial and beautiful of creatures, and others swarming with innumerable myriads of voracious and terrible monsters, form a collection not equaled by any other in the world. Prof. STARR is a native of this city, the son of one of her wealthiest and most esteemed merchants, and has spent his whole life and a handsome fortune in the pursuit of this favorite science. He is not only a patriotic and benevolent man, but a humorous one; and our brave boys retired to rest feeling that they were indebted to him for one of the most wonderful, instructive and laughter-provoking entertainments that they had ever witnessed.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Entertainment at the Soldiers' Depot."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Entertainment at the Soldiers' Depot."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a8350eca-746a-5954-82c8-4bb79c9a6069,373,nyt://article/a8350eca-746a-5954-82c8-4bb79c9a6069,

Retains Bullet in Head for Six Weeks,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/04/archives/a-singular-case-an-officer-retains-a-minie-ball-in-his-brain-six.html,Retains Bullet in Head for Six Weeks,"A case of unusual interest, showing extraordinary tenacity of life, has recently come under our notice. It is that of a man living for six weeks, with a minie ball, weighing one and a quarter ounces in his brain, and after the ball was removed being fully restored to consciousness, with his intellect unimpaired and his physical powers perfect. Lieut. THOS. W. CHANDLER entered the service with the First Long Island Volunteers, in the early part of the war, and served without injury until the 25th of March, 1865. After the recapture of Fort Steadman on that day, our picket line was advanced on the whole of the left. In this advance the Lieutenant received a gunshot wound in the left temple which penetrated the brain. The surgeon in charge of the Division hospital probed the wound; finding the ball had entered the brain he made no attempt to remove it, concluding that Lieut. CHANDLER was fatally wounded. After remaining in the hospital for several weeks, Lieut. C. desired a furlough, but was informed that he would die on the road. After a couple of weeks more he was allowed to return to Brooklyn. On his arrival the brain was oozing from the wound, and the depression showed a fracture of the cranium. He placed himself under the charge of Dr. J.G. JOHNSON, who opened the wound, and after elevating depressed portions of bone, found the bullet pressing in upon the brain firmly wedged by the portions of the skull which had been driven in on the brain. With considerable difficulty the ball was removed, covered with brain, on the 8th of May. The brain oozed from the wound for several days, but is now healed, and Lieut. CHANDLER is able to go around. Rev. Morgan D[???]x has visited him, and expressed great surprise to see him and the result. The case has excited great interest among the surgeons who have seen it. Lieut. CHANDLER resides at No. 65 Prospect-street, Brooklyn, where he will be happy to satisfy any incredulous that it is possible to have an ounce and a quarter minie ball in the brain for six weeks, and still survive.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A SINGULAR CASE.; An Officer Retains a Minie Ball in his Brain Six Weeks Dr. Johnson Extracts it and the Officer returns to Duty.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A SINGULAR CASE.; An Officer Retains a Minie Ball in his Brain Six Weeks Dr. Johnson Extracts it and the Officer returns to Duty.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5d8597b7-359d-5443-9b7a-bb90939991bb,411,nyt://article/5d8597b7-359d-5443-9b7a-bb90939991bb,

"Colenso, Bishop, on African Missions",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/04/archives/bishop-colenso-on-african-missions.html,"Colenso, Bishop, on African Missions","At a recent meeting of the Authropological Society in London, a paper was read by Right Rev. J. W. COLENSO, D.D. Bishop of Natal, on ""The Efforts of Missionaries among Savages,"" and an unusual amount of interest was displayed upon the occasion in consequence of the previous discussion which took place upon the paper by Mr. WINWOOD READE. Dr. COLENSO commenced by saying that there were some observations made on that occasion which he much regretted; but he felt that the question of missionary work among the savages was one which had been very properly raised. It was, he thought, very desirable to have the question discussed from a layman's point of view; and he was too well aware, from his own observation and experience, that some of Mr. READE's strictures were far from being undeserved. Mr. READE's account of the corrupt habits of native converts -- that ""every Christian negress whom he met with was a prostitute, and every Christian negro a thief"" -- to whatever extent it might have been justified by the facts which fell under his observation, must be supposed, of course, to apply especially to that part at Western Africa in which he had spent five months of his life. He presumed, however, that there were some outward signs on which Mr. READE must have based his judgment, and that in certain cases which came more immediately under his eye there was great dishonesty among the men and great immodesty among the women. But admitting this, it would be only fair to suppose that this state of things might possibly be exceptional upon a coast where the slave-trade, with all its abominations, had so long prevailed, and was still notoriously more or less extensively practiced; where, consequently, whatever good instructions might he given by the missionaries, or whatever good examples might be set by the better class of white residents, laymen as well as missionaries, must have been to a great extent neutralized by the vicious conduct of others. He conceived, therefore, that Mr. READE might have been unfortunate in having had the immediate neighborhood of the slave coast as the only locality in which he had an opportunity of examining into the ""Efforts of Missionaries among Savages."" Having no personal acquaintance, however, with that coast, Dr. COLENSO confined his remarks chiefly to the savage tribes of Southeastern Africa, among whom his lot had been cast, and to the mission-work which was carried on among them. He refrained from making any comments on the religious views of Mr. READE, and, in like manner, claimed to be held singly responsible for any which he himself expressed on this occasion. He contended that in spite of many serious drawbacks, some inevitable, some capable of being remedied, the ""Efforts of Missionaries among Savages"" had been a great blessing to them, and he was not afraid or unwilling to look the truth in the face -- to have the work scrutinized and its defects pointed out from a layman's point of view. He could not, he said, sympathize with those who argued that to save one human soul was a sufficient return for spending any amount of money, and sacrificing any number of lives, because it assumed that the soul in question was in danger of being lost -- that is, as such persons mean, eternally lost -- that the Father of spirits had left it to be decided by the caprice, or zeal, or the greater or less measure of selfishness of one or more of u[???]poor mortals, whether our brother's soul could be eternally saved or eternally lost. Now, this he did not believe; and he did not think other persons really believed it, for, if they did, would they ever spend a penny on themselves which they could possibly avoid spending? The right reverend prelate quoted opinions expressed by Rev. Dr. MCNEILE and by the Record newspaper, in accordance with this view, and he assumed, by the cheers which greeted the speech of Rev. Dr. MCNEILE, that, incredible as it would seem, the sentiments were really indorsed as those of the Church Missionary Society itself, by the large meeting, including His Grace the Primate of all England. Three years ago, he said, he was ridiculed by some of his critics for supposing that any great body of educated persons in England believed in these days in the literal accuracy, nay, the Divine infallibility, of every historical or scientific statement of the Bible. Yet such ridicule had been answered by the astonishing fact that eleven thousand clergy of the Church of England had set their names to a declaration of their belief in that very doctrine, as well as in that of the endlessness of future torments, while the two Archbishops have openly declared their adherence to those views. It seemed to be equally incredible that any great body of educated men should believe that every heathen who dies without the ""knowledge of Jesus Christ"" must be doomed to suffer endless torments. The persons who maintained that doctrine could not possibly believe it, or they would be intensely wretched during every moment of their lives. Dr. COLENSO read the following statement of a missionary who, speaking of the heathen, said: ""They would perish like those heathen; and their children, about whom they thought so much, would twine about them like creepers on a gnarled oak, and they would burn -- burn -- burn on forever. Every hour, yea, every moment, they are dying, most of them without a knowledge of the Savi[???]r. On whom, now, rests the responsibility? If you fail to do all in your power to save them, will you stand at the judgment guiltless of their blood?"" A heathen child, after having embraced the gospel, said to him, ""How long have they had the Gospel in New-England?"" When told, she asked with great earnestness, ""Why did they not come and tell us before?"" And then added, ""My mother died, and my father died and my brother died without the Gospel."" Here, she was unable to suppress her emotions. But at length, wiping away her tears, she asked, ""Where do you think they have gone?"" He, too, could not refrain from weeping, and, turning to her, inquired, ""Where do you think they have gone?"" She hesitated a few moments, and then replied with much emotion, ""I suppose they have gone down to the dark place -- the dark place. Oh, why did they not tell us before?""' It wrung his heart as she repeated the question: ""Why did they not tell us before?"" They had all heard, he supposed, of the old Bulgarian chief, who, when told that his father and mother and all the ancestors of his tribe were burning in hell-fire, declared that he would rather go and burn with them than live in such a gloomy heaven with so inhuman and unjust a being as this God -- a very Moloch -- whom the missionary spoke of. He had heard substantially the same uttered from the mouth of a Zulu; and did not hesitate to say that, on this particular point, the ideas of that Teuton and that Zulu were far more orthodox -- far more truly christian -- than those of such a missionary, trained, though he may have been, in schools of Christian theology. He rejected, then, utterly the employment of the argument that without our missions the heathen would be eternally lost, as a reason for not taking any account of the weight of gold and silver which was thrown into the treasury of missions. But it was said, Ex nihilo nihil fit. Multiply the work of one missionary as much as they pleased, and it would still amount to nothing, or next to nothing. The results of missionary labor among savages were infinitesimally small; and an army of 10,000 teachers, though laboring for 25 years, would do little to raise a savage race from its barbarism. But societies in England must be fed, and reports, therefore, must be sent; and accounts of little details, which nobody would think of chronicling as incidents worthy of notice in any parish in England, must be forwarded by the missionary as tokens of his own activity. Before a sweeping judgment was passed, either on such reports or on the ""Efforts of Missionaries,"" it might be well to consider more closely some of a missionary's primary difficulties -- at least, when entering upon a comparatively new field of labor. It was a great defect in our present system of missions, that the missionaries generally were not practical men; that they had no knowledge of any practical science, such as that of medicine, or of any mechanical art, or even of agriculture. They were mostly mere theologians, interpreters of Scripture, or teachers of catechisms or creeds. This was a very serious drawback upon such missions as ours, and was not easily remedied, because so few of the English clergy were practiced in any of those arts and sciences, which, however desirable, are not absolutely needed for their ministry in England. Yet the advantage resulting from the possession by a missionary of medical science or practical skill of any kind was incalculable, still more when the two were united in one person. It might be supposed that it was enough that some subordinate should have such qualifications, and the missionary merely superintend his work and devote himself to the higher duties of his spiritual office. But this was a mistake, in such a case as that of the Zambesi mission, where the whole party was plunged into the centre of South Africa, far away from the bounds of civilization. Great evil was also caused by those who insist, in their teaching of the heathen, upon the absolute infallibility of the Scriptures -- a doctrine which happily is not held or taught by our national Church. Yet there are missionaries, and even missionary bishops, who, while holding their offices by letters patent from the Queen as Bishops of the Church of England, still violated their duty to the Church of which they were ministers, by misrepresenting its teaching on this point, and by laying down this doctrine to the ignorant heathen as the positive teaching of that Church itself, which, as we now know distinctly, it is not. The course which the great body of missionaries had taken on the question of polygamy was a very serious impediment to the progress of the work. Here, again, without any authority from the Church of which they are ministers, there are many of the missionary clergy, and even Bishops, of the Church of England, who had laid down the law that every convert admitted into the Christian Church should put away all his wives but one, if he had more than one before baptism. It would be reasonable if they said, ""You need not be baptised at all; you may be good men without being formally received into the Church, as there have been good men of old who were never baptised, and who had more wives than one, yet lived faithful lives. It was writin the Bibe of the Polygamist Abraham, from the mouth of Jehovah himself, 'I know him that he will command him and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah to do justice and judgment;' and you, with your many wives, must try to do the same. As a Christian, you cannot take more, but you must not be false to those you have already taken, and to the obligations you have already contracted lawfully, according to your own native customs. You must not, in the selfish hope of saving your own soul, commit an act of wrong to any of your wives and children."" Having referred to some of the principal defects which might and ought to be remedied in the missionary proceedings of the present day, Mr. READE would probably admit, on consideration, that his censures were really valid chiefly in reference to such defects. But if so much difficulty, necessary or accidental, attended the work of missions, why engage in fact was unique in the history of the British colonies. Yet, after all, there would be room for the missionaries. Among these youths so taught and trained, there would be some whose hearts would be touched with the divine desire to be themselves the teachers and educators of their brethren, not only as regarded the things of this life, but as regards the life to come. And the native community itself, thus raised from a lower level, would desire to hear the message of life from the lips of these teachers.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bishop Colenso on African Missions.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bishop Colenso on African Missions.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b82522b3-3fb2-5b52-afe3-402cbd4eeb55,2155,nyt://article/b82522b3-3fb2-5b52-afe3-402cbd4eeb55,

"Homer's Iliad, Earl of Derby's Translation",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/05/archives/new-books.html,"Homer's Iliad, Earl of Derby's Translation","There are many books that obtain a large share of notice on account of the circumstances of their origin and the sources whence they spring. There are a few that command attention from their intrinsic merit. And there are a still smaller number that legitimately combine both classes of attraction. Among them, Lord DERBY'S Homer undoubtedly takes rank. That the Lord STANLEY of the past generation, whose Parliamentary triumphs, both as the ally and adversary of Sir ROBERT PEEL, are cherished as the choicest traditions of statesmanlike eloquence -- the conservative leader of our own day, the Lord DERBY, a power in the State, dignified, irascible, gouty and imperious, should, when approaching his seventieth year, be able to devote time and scholarship sufficient for an undertaking that cost the youthful energies of POPE seven years of anxious and absorbing labor, is of itself enough to cause his work to be estimated among the curiosities of literature. But when this arduous enterprise turned out to be satisfactorily accomplished -- when running through the long list of translators, from the days of Queen ELIZABETH to our own, Chapman, Hobbs, Pope, Cowper, Sotheby, Newman, &c., competent authorities -- nay, the universal voice of modern criticism pronounces that this new version has no equal in all that relates to a faithful presentment of the old Grecian in our modern tongue -- it must be admitted that it is scarcely possible to conceive a book putting forth greater claim to consideration than this does. The noble author's object, as stated by himself, was simply ""an attempt to transfuse into an almost literal English version something of the spirit as well as the simplicity of the great original."" How happily this end has been attained, a perusal of the version will show. It may be luxuriously studied in the elegant edition published by Mr. SCRIBNER -- a specimen of bookmaking as a technical art that need fear no comparison with the English original. All the history, and much of the theology of the ancient world, goes back to Homer. To offer to his countrymen a rendering of the mighty lines of Homer, faithfully reproducing the easy flow and majestic simplicity of its great original, is a service that will outlive the transitory triumph of politics, and assure the name of Lord DERBY a place among the benefactors of his age and nation.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1745fa6c-dd23-5c95-898e-8a71c66a69ca,823,nyt://article/1745fa6c-dd23-5c95-898e-8a71c66a69ca,

Debt and the Tariff; Revenue and the Public Debt,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/05/archives/the-tariff-and-public-debt-the-official-statement.html,Debt and the Tariff; Revenue and the Public Debt,"The present Funded Debt and Customs Revenue policy which took shape and may be said to have been founded in the Act of Congress, of Feb. 25, 1862, has worked successfully, and been faithfully administered by Mr. CHASE and his successors through three of the most trying and eventful Fiscal Years in the Nation's history. In the Act referred to and in all subsequent Loan Acts authorizing five or six per cent. Funded Stocks, all such stocks of the United States are recognized as gold-bearing, in the same high sense as before the War, and before the Legal-Tender Act, both as to principal and interest. The demand Treasury Notes receivable for Custom-house dues then outstanding were also recognized as gold-bearing, and have since been paid off accordingly. The old Funded Debt since then maturing has also been paid off in Gold. And the Gold Interest upon all our Funded Stocks has been uniformly paid in Gold, and frequently paid in advance by way of qualifying the large Custom-house demand for Gold in the open market. To these objects the Customs revenues, which are demanded by the Act of 1862 to be paid exclusively in Gold, were specifically pledged, and have proved for the three years not only equal to this important charge upon them in Gold, but have also borne the Currency Interest upon the temporary or non-funded Public Debt through the same years. Leaving an estimated surplus at the close of the third year, in gold in the Treasury, of full twenty-five millions of dollars, and a balance in Currency from the avails of surplus Gold sold in the market last year, of at least ten millions, to be carried to the currency interest of the succeeding Fiscal Year.

From a very early hour in the morning the streets were astir with eager crowds, the balconies were hung with drapery, and national flags waved out on every side. At a little before 9 o'clock the procession started from the Piazza di Santo Spirito, the cannon of the fort San Giovan Battista announcing its departure. The representatives of the Italian and foreign press led the way, followed by those of the Italian dramatic art, with their banner; then came in long line the representatives of the provinces, the communes, and the institutes of every part of Italy, and the foreigners invited to the ceremony. More than 700 banners were borne in the procession. At a little before eleven the cortege reached the Piazza di Santa Croce, where it was shortly afterward met by the King, who was received with hearty and long continued applause. The Mayor of Florence then delivered a short speech, and after another from Padre GLANBATTISTA GIULIANI in honor of DAN[???]E, the covering of the monument was removed. The enthusiasm at this point of the ceremony rose to the highest pitch, and the scene was altogether most impressive. Not the slightest disorder is reported to have occurred throughout the day.

Orders in View of Peace,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/05/archives/gen-canbys-orders-in-view-of-peace.html,Orders in View of Peace,"From the temper and bearing of Gen. CANBY's recent orders, (which we published yesterday,) we take it that he fully understands the scope of his commission in view of the lapse from war to peace. He orders his subordinate commanders to extend the limits of their commands to all the sections of country east of the Mississippi within his jurisdiction. He directs them to see that the benefits of unrestricted trade, proclaimed by the President, are made available for the peaceful inhabitants. He makes the harboring of guerrillas an offence punishable by the withdrawal of the privileges of unrestricted trade. All military orders conflicting with the President's proclamation are revoked, and military taxes, except for sanitary purposes, are declared abolished. The work of the military, in short, as prescribed by Gen. CANBY, is not to overawe the people of the South, but to protect the peaceable against evil-doers. Much virtue will be found to lie in the temperate, unobtrusive, conciliatory manner in which these orders are carried into execution. Nothing is at this moment of greater practical importance to the reestablishment of loyal government in the South, than that military commanders of every grade should hold themselves under thorough self-restraint. Their mission henceforth is less one of physical coercion, than one of cooperation with the peaceably-disposed in the restoration of order, and the reorganization of a stable system of local administration.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""GEN.

ROSS BROWNE's second paper on ""Washoe Revisited"" is amusing, though the vein of adventure it illustrates has been rather worked out of late. ""The Americans on their Travels,"" by Dr. ROBERT TOMES, is shrewd and sensible. VAMBERG's adventures in Central Asia are epitomized in ""From Teheran to Samarcand."" In the late war Gen. MCCLELLAN's ""Change of Base"" is illustrated by John S.C. ABBOTT, in a paper containing several clever wood cuts, and Gen. GRANT's career is pleasantly commented on in the ""Recollections"" of a personal friend. DICKENS' strangely constructed story, ""Our Mutual Friend,"" and WILKIE COLLINS' romance ""Armsdale,"" are the chief attractions from foreign sources, with the exception of Prof. GOLDWIN SMITH's ""University of Oxford,"" here concluded, forming an article of value and interest.

"GEN. SHERMAN AND THE CITY COUNCILS. -Everybody who admires and loves Gen.

JOSEPH JOHNSTON, one of the foremost of the Southern leaders, that a social war between the whites and blacks of the South is probable. There is reason to fear that this expectation widely prevails throughout the South. It was an universally accepted axiom there, long before the rebellion, that emancipation would result in one of two things--either amalgamation or extermination. That was the feeling even two or three generations ago, when slavery was admitted to be a positive evil; and it was the standing argument against disturbing the existing order of things.

Even during the progress of the war, and while the prospects of our country looked worst, there were tens of thousands of stout, industrious, intelligent Germans, who left their native land and came over to make their homes in the United States. But for every one who emigrated last Summer, there are ten who desire and purpose emigrating this year. They have learned a great deal about America during the war -about its resources, its agricultural and mineral wealth, its commercial and business facilities, and the unequaled opportunities it offers for industry and labor. They have learned also that it has a safe and strong, as well as a free and beneficent government. The results of the war, the state of society during its progress, and the condition of affairs after its close, are final arguments in behalf of republicanism.

There are necessarily some of a different order, but the balance is on the right side. Mr. S.R. GIFFORD exhibits two paintings widely divergent in character, but both good. No. 268, called ""Hampton Beach,"" is a bright, breezy, shining spot on the ocean, with a couple of figures sitting on the sand and looking out upon the beautiful waters -- as Mr. GIFFORD probably gazed upon them -- with, the eyes of love. We notice, by the way, that sand-benched couples are becoming decidedly popular with our painters. Mr. GIFFORD's work is pretty, thoroughly finished and completely agreeable in tone. It possesses no distinct individuality, and might have been painted just as well by half a dozen other artists. This cannot be said of No, 349, ""Shuwangunk Mountains."" The old and well-known style of the artist comes back to us here. A vast expanse of fretted mountain ridge, exposing to our view all the secret ways of those altitudes, stretches before us. The scene is suffused with that gorgeous sunlight which Mr. GIFFORD admires so inordinately. The perspective and general sense of space are superb, whilst the wholeness of the texture of the picture is thoroughly artistic. Few even of those who object to Mr. GIFFORD's mannerism will hesitate to give this fine work the position to which it in fairly entitled. There is one thing, too, which may be conveniently mentioned here Mr. GIFFORD's mannerism is essentially and peculiarly his own. In its worst form it is yet redeemed by solid characteristics of great and unmistakable power. The difference is very clearly marked in HENRY VON INGRU's ""Farm-yard Scene,"" No, 272. Here we have the mannerism not of an individual, but of a nation -- an imitation of the modern Flemish school, and as pluffy and rough as tools can make it. Beyond the obvious effort referred to, there is yet some merit in the picture. It is bright and healthy.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'National Academy of Design East Room.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'National Academy of Design East Room.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9765a936-ad29-5308-9aa3-9bdd36e08247,2262,nyt://article/9765a936-ad29-5308-9aa3-9bdd36e08247,

Strong vs. Marg E. Strong. -- This was in appeal from an order made at special term of this court in December last, requiring the plaintiff to deliver to the defendant sworn copies of two letters written by the latter to a third person, (Mrs. Bedell,) and by her delivered to the plaintiff's counsel. The motion for such order was made on the pleadings, the answers of Mrs. Bedell to interrogatories on a commission, and a petition in the defendant's name, but verified by her brother, (J.A. Stevens, Jr.,) in which verification the contents of such petition were stated to be true of his own knowledge, except as to the matters therein stated on information and belief, as to which he was informed and believed they were true. Absence of the petitioner from the City of New-York, and ignorance as to her place of residence, were assigned as reasons for not verifying such petition by her own oath. Such motion was opposed on an affidavit of the plaintiff, and also one of his counsel (Murray Hoffman, Esq.) admitting the possession of the letters. This action is brought for an absolute divorce. Mrs. Bedell, in answer to interrogatories annexed to such commission to examine her, testified to the contents of certain letters received by her from the defendant, and by her destroyed, and stated that in them such defendant confessed her criminality. The letters in question were not exhibited to such witness at such examination, nor were they or their contents proved by her; she only testified to sending them to the plaintiff's counsel. The petition in question alleges what the plaintiff's affidavit denies, namely: that Mrs. Bedell testified to the contents of the letter in question. The former also stated that the defendant has no copies of them, and, therefore, could not state with accuracy their contents. The appeal was argued in the February term, before Chief-Justice Robertson and Judges Garvin and McCunn, and decided on the 27th of February last. The General Term reversed the order appealed from, Justice McCunn dissenting, and the following opinion was delivered by Robertson, Chief-Justice:",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Strong Divorce Suit Opinion of Chief-Justice Robertson.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Strong Divorce Suit Opinion of Chief-Justice Robertson.; SUPERIOR COURT GENERAL TERM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f22cadc-a8b4-55d0-8c52-a38a00c268be,1218,nyt://article/9f22cadc-a8b4-55d0-8c52-a38a00c268be,

London Times; Plea for the Alabama,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/08/archives/a-plea-for-the-alabama.html,London Times; Plea for the Alabama,"The London Times, according to the European news today, makes it part of an argument against our claims for the depredations of the Alabama, that we failed to use a sufficient number of vessels to capture her! We employed, it seems, too many of our ships of war in blockading the Southern ports, and putting needless restrictions upon the British blockade-running trade. Well, this argument has at least the advantage of being novel. We might, as the London journalist suggests, have left all the Southern ports open to the neutral British traffic in saltpetre, shells, torpedoes and Armstrong guns, or for the admission of the British-built privateers and their prizes. We should, then, doubtless, have had a larger fleet to chase the Alabama from Liverpool to Nassau; thence to Bermuda, Halifax, Melbourne, (Australia,) the Cape of Good Hope, Calcutta, Hong Kong, and generally round the world where British or British colonial ports were open to welcome her, while practically closed against war vessels of the United States. We should have also shown in this way that we were intensely eager to make any bill of claims against our neutral neighbors as light as possible.

The avidity with which the elite off New-York have taken hold of the Paterson races, and given it the weight of its affluent support, was fully manifested on Wednesday, (the steeple-chase day,) when such a throng assembled on the occasion as has never previously been seen, remarkable alike for its numbers and respectability, on any race course in the vicinity of New-York. The result of the admirable management displayed by the executives of the meeting, the earnest desire to contribute to the comfort of all present, the strict attention to decorum, and the excellent punctuality which was maintained in all the details, found its reflex in the closing day of the meeting. The last day, or ""wind-up"" of a racing meeting is usually a dull affair. The great events are usually exhausted, as also the vim of the visitors, and the result is generally a series of consolation scrambles among the contending stables, and defeated horses, for ""hay and straw"" compensation. It was not so, however, at Paterson; for in addition to the three great races previously advertised, the association, with a liberality which does it honor, threw in a fourth and extra race in the shape of a handicap hurdle race, with a premium of $400 for the winner and $100 for the second horse, for which all the steeple-chase horses of the previous day, and two other fresh horses, were entered.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.; The Paterson Spring Racing Meeting Third and Last Day A Glorious Culmination of Legitimate Racing.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.; The Paterson Spring Racing Meeting Third and Last Day A Glorious Culmination of Legitimate Racing.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4fd6933-7f39-5fe6-8174-5d1461a2d00a,3038,nyt://article/d4fd6933-7f39-5fe6-8174-5d1461a2d00a,

Impertinent Advice from Impertinent Men; Pleas for the South,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/09/archives/impertinent-advice-from-impertinent-men.html,Impertinent Advice from Impertinent Men; Pleas for the South,"It was unfortunate for the meeting held last night to hear Mr. GERRITT SMITH deliver himself on "" reconstruction, conciliation and pacification,"" that the gentleman who was announced to take the chair, and, at least, two of those who signed the call, should have been persons who have been from the outset bitter opponents of the war, or in other words, warm supporters of JEFF. DAVIS' right to do as he pleased. Mr. CHARLES O'CONNOR, for instance, was just as much opposed to all measures for the restoration of the national authority in the rebellious States as JUDAH P. BENJAMIN himself, though being a sensible man, he of course never thought of displaying his feelings in anything more potent than words. Mr. O'GORMAN, too, was perfectly horrified by the whole struggle which has just ended so gloriously, and in 1862 -- 3, in the dark days of the war, when many hearts were faint and weary, did not hesitate to use what influence he possessed to aggravate the general doubt and despondency. Of Mr. S. M. BARLOW there is very little to be said. If a man's words and acts count for anything, no bitterer enemy of the government, when the government needed all the support it could get, was to be found, at least in the whole North, than himself. And he derives an additional claim to the respectful attention of the community, from the fact that he was a leading member of the famous Society for the Diffusion of Political Information, which devoted itself in the Spring of 1863 to reviling Mr. LINCOLN for meddling with slavery, and the spread of tracts proving the divine origin of that institution.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Impertinent Advice from Impertinent Men.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Impertinent Advice from Impertinent Men.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2594214-1739-510f-89e2-90b82b797524,626,nyt://article/e2594214-1739-510f-89e2-90b82b797524,

The examination was attended by the following Board of Visitors, appointed by the head of the Navy Department: Vice-Adimal D.G. FARRAGUT, U.S.N., President; Rear-Admiral D.D. Porter, U.S.N., Capt. J.L. Worden, U.S.N., Hon. Jos. T. Mills of Wisconsin, Rev. C.B. Boynton, D.D., of Maryland, John Jacob Astor, Jr., of New-York, J.M. Forbes, Esq., of Massachusetts, members. Their duties were to attend the examination, and inquire into the state of the police, discipline and general management of the institution, the results of which were to be reported to the Secretary of the Navy. On Monday the interesting proceedings commenced by examining the first class in interternational, constitutional and maritime law, both in writing and orally. The second class was examined in naval gunnery, and the fourth in algebra. Commander J.S. BLAKE, the respected commandant of the institution, was highly complimented for the discipline manifested in every department. Over two hundred applicants for admission were examined, nearly three-fourths of whom passed. The school-ships Constitution and Santee are moored in their old places, together with the practice-ships Macedonia, Marion, Marbethead. The Atlantic-house, as well as the vessels, is filled with midshipmen. At present there are about 500 students at the academy, divided into four classes. Two examinations are held annually, the second occurring in September. Everything is provided for the comfort and welfare of the student. The daily routine begins with the reveille at 6 A.M. all the year round, when the middles turn out, stow away their hammocks and wash and dress for inspection at 6:50. Breakfast, prayer and the sick call fill the time to 7:57, when the forenoon studies and recitations commence, which lasts until 12:57, when dinner is called. Afternoon studies begin at 1:57 and continue to the retreat at 3:57. From 4 to 5:45 military drill on shore, takes place and sometimes a good deal of sky-larking. Supper and the evening parades intervene and the evening studies are called at 7:30. Hammocks are slung at 9:30; at taps (9:53) all turn in; at four bells, seven minutes after, there must be perfect silence fore and aft. The table is supplied not by rations, as in actual service, but by a commissary who is paid per week or month, as at a hotel. The cost per month for boarding a midshipman is $16 50. A middy's pay is $500 per annum, which is intended orly to cover his necessary expenses for maintenance and clothing. Of this they are not permitted to draw more than $100 a year, thus forming [???] of [???] year term, with which to procure an outfit for actual service. Liberty to go ashore is granted each Saturday, except to those who forfeit the privilege by improper conduct. While on liberty the rules of the academy must be strictly observed, the middy being required to state in writing that they have not violated the ""regulations."" Church parties are formed on Sunday, to go to whatever place of worship they please -- going to and returning from church without stopping at any other place. In such a large assembly of young gentlemen, there are of course a few who represent the cruder specimens of humanity, but the strict regulations have an excellent effect in forming a gentlemanly character. It is a well-known fact that our navy, during the rebellion, has greatly felt the need of accomplished officers. Our navy should prefer the flower of American youth an applicants for admission in the Academy, rather than those favored one appointed by members of Congress. High authority has suggested that the present system be done away with, and the system of competitive examinations be adopted, in which the successful contestants would obtain the appointments. The highest and lowest ranks would then be represented within the walls of the Academy.

Returning; Gratitude Forgotten in New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/10/archives/our-returning-soldiers.html,Returning; Gratitude Forgotten in New-York,"-- All through the week our city has been jubilant. Every day the eager crowds of our population have thronged the busy streets as regiment after regiment of returning braves have passed through them, browned by exposure in field and camp, with garments stained and torn by war, but with high and martial step, with brightly-gleaming arms, and flags illustrious with the records of victory. As the rivers of steel wound their way between groves of welcoming banners, shouts of gladness rose from the thousand-voiced people, flowers, strewn by fair hands, carpeted the earth, and glorious strains of music and of song lifted the souls of a grateful city to a delirium of joy. Not forgotten are our heroes! The tender melody of bands which, with speaking voice, proclaimed the return of peace, or rang forth martial airs sacred to our national history, and which chronicle the deeds of our soldiers, spoke for us all. The men who sit at our Council Boards, as with all the honors at their command they welcomed the Army Come Home, spoke for us. And while that army felt that ""Home, Sweet Home"" was theirs once more, we, for whose hearths and firesides and liberties and honor they have fought and bled, made them feel that, while we valued all that was worth living for, we were grateful and would never _____ _____",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR RETURNING SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR RETURNING SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2743a2b0-998d-5a7b-96e5-e935a3ccef41,258,nyt://article/2743a2b0-998d-5a7b-96e5-e935a3ccef41,

They would then have learned that he was watching mischievous boys; and it the superior officers had done him any injustice, he could have appealed to the commissioners.

And Neutrality; a New Plot,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/10/archives/more-piracy-and-more-neutrality.html,And Neutrality; a New Plot,"-- We have news to-day from Nassau that another pirate is afloat the same that was concerned in the Chesapeake and Roanoke captures. If the story of this new scourge is honestly told, the ""Confederates"" in command must have belonged to the Richmond ""detached service."" Their mission is not that of ordinary privateering. It is entirely of a piece with the St. Albans robberies, the yellow-fever plot, and the burning of Northern hotels. A vessel, (American, of course,) boarded by the pirate off the Bahamas, was instantly fired, while the Captain and his crew were left to perish with the wreck, or make their escape as best they might in small boats. We cannot say that we are astonished at this story, horrible as it is. We shall not be surprised, indeed, if scores of our merchantmen share a similar fate before the piracy legalized by Europe has filled up the measure of its iniquity. This improved system of murdering on the high seas is the logical result of all the rebel ram-building and harboring of the pirates in the Seaports of Western Europe and the British Colonial possessions. And it is simply folly to expect that such an organized system of belligerency on the part of professed ""neutrals"" against the United States is to pass into history without a reckoning.

News and Herald on Davis' fate","The law which, according to the English view, governs cases of this kind has been so clearly explained, and will be, doubtless, so powerfully stated in answer to the American demands, that there is no need for us to say anything further on the subject. Our point is simply that nations in a state of war must protect their own interest, and cannot expect [???]trals to guard them from the operations of the enemy. It is enough for us to show that nothing was done in bad faith by this country. The Alabama was, it is true, built by British subjects, and her armament was also furnished from an English p rt; but this, though a culpable act on the part of certain Englishmen, does not compromise the government, which used reasonable means to prevent such proceedings, and would have stopped the vessel had not the Confederate agents fraudulently taken her out to sea. All that can be said is that the affair was one that is always possible in maritime war. In getting ready ""No. 290"" the Confederates and their agents were too quick for us and for the Federals also; they carried their vessel into the ocean before we could seize it in the Mersey, or the Federals could seize it in the narrow seas; if we were slow, the Federals were negligent. Mr. ADAMS, who inter[???]d the British Government of the character of the vessel, might have as easily communicated with the naval authorities of his own country and taken measures to capture the vessel as soon as he left our jurisdiction. A belligerent government can hardly claim to be com[???] for [???] results of an accident, when it is plain that its own agents neglected to [???] a proper wat[???] over the enemy's proceedings. The British Government, however, does not, we conceive, assert that a neutral country is not responsible [???]ly for the [???] [???] of ships or expeditions within its limits [???] one of two belligerents; on the contrary, no [???] [???] would be more ready than our own to allow that such equipments were real grounds of complaint. That there is no desire to defend the [???]ity of the fitting out of the Alabama is show by the [???] that proceedings were taken against the constructors of the [???] and that this vessel, as well as the two [???]t[???] ""r[???]"" were seized by the British Government in spite of the protestations and [???] legal opposition of those concerned in [???] them. This conduct of our government sufficiently shows what if con[???]s the [???] of a neutral State to be. A well-[???]nt but [???] act was passed half a century ago to forbid the very proceeding of which the Americans complain, and certainly no State in Europe or the New World has maintained the principles of neutrality and non-[???] more strictly than our own. All that we now content for is that when a vessel does a [???] [???] a [???] [???] as a neutral may be [???] to maintain a [???] has no claim to be com[???]ted, especially in a case like the present, where the vessel act[???]y went out to sea we armed, was armed in the open [???], and might have been captured without opposition if the belligerent who now complains had used the commonest in precautions.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM OUR FOREIGN FILES.; THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.

The struggle closed with such luminous splendors, and so perfect has been our triumph, that we have already almost forgotten the awful events and the fearful years through which we slowly passed. The convulsive shock that followed the initial action in Charleston harbor on the 12th of April, the wide and universal preparations for war, the appalling issue at Manassas in July, the weary winter of doubt, the great and disastrous battles on the Peninsula, the misfortunes in the West, the repeated demands for more troops, the gigantic and ill-starred battles of Fredericksburgh and Chancellorsville, the indecisive and ever-recurring campaigns in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as in Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee; the ravages of pirates on the high seas and on our own coasts -- these were events calculated to try the mettle of the nation, and imperil its existence. Faction reared its head in the North; riot and treason were rampant, and the great Powers of Europe perpetually menaced us with direct quarrel. Our losses in men were enormous; our outlay in money stupendous; our efforts after success innumerable and, ceaseless; but still, up to the opening of last year, the great armies of the enemy obstinately maintained themselves in Virginia and Tennessee, and the Southern Confederacy was powerful and defiant. No wonder that great numbers utterly despaired of success, and still greater numbers were doubtful and despondent. Last Summer, the fierce and awful straggles in the Wilderness and thence to Petersburgh, and the prolonged and bloody struggles of SHERMAN in Georgia, did not seem to the nation promising of anything like decisive success; and when Winter came with GRANT still standing before Petersburgh, SHERMAN ""lost"" in Georgia, and THOMAS fighting in Middle Tennessee, the final issue still seemed to thousands uncertain, and even the most hopeful continued to look for weary years of war. In a few months, victory, decisive, complete and glorious, was secured for the army and flag of the Union; and suddenly the strife which had raged over a continent gave place to universal peace.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Late War The Present Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Late War The Present Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/490190f0-a172-5026-8a66-e997dca0fde1,733,nyt://article/490190f0-a172-5026-8a66-e997dca0fde1,

HEDDEN, of the Sixteenth Police Precinct, instructed his men to watch the fellows vigilantly, at their nest and elsewhere, and lose no opportunity to take them into custody. Accordingly, on Friday night, there having been a disturbance in the porter-house kept by THOMAS KAVANAGH, at No. 134 West Twentieth-street, a platoon of officers entered there and apprehended KAVANAGH, the landlord, MATTHEW SMITH, TERRENCE QUINN, PATRICK SMITH, JAMES JOHNSON, LAWRENCE CASEY, SIMON CLARK, CHARLES MUNDY, and WILLIAM DOWD. The prisoners were held at the Sixteenth Precinct Police Station until yesterday morning, and then taken before Justice LEDWICK for examination on a charge of vagrancy; but there being no sufficient evidence against KAVANAGH, MATTHEW SMITH, TERRENCE QUINN, JAMES JOHNSON, WILLIAM DOWD, and SIMON CLARK, they were released from restraint. Counsel who appeared for LAWRENCE CASEY, PATRICK SMITH, and CHARLES MUNDY, moved that the papers be amended in the case of CASEY by expunging the clause in which the accused is alleged to have made confession that he had served a term in the Penitentiary; but the magistrate declined to entertain the motion. Counsel introduced testimony showing that CASEY's father clothes the youth and given him food, and that he is not a burden on the public, and therefore cannot be committed as a vagrant. In addition to this testimony, counsel requested his client (who had been surrounded by his peculiar friends) to exhibit the contents of his pockets, and the prisoner produced $40 in Treasury notes. Thereupon counsel denied the right of the court to commit a man as a vagrant who had in his possession, or could borrow of a friend, that sum of money. But to meet this fetch the court put Captain HEDDEN on the stand, and it was shown that at the time of searching the prisoner, in the police-station, the police did not find forty cents in possession of the entire party. Here the further hearing was adjourned to this morning.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE POLICE COURTS.; Jefferson Market Before Justice Ledwick.DESCENT BY CAPT. HEDDEN.

H.","This estimable lady died on Saturday, June 10, in Hartford, after a lingering illness. She was born at Norwich on the 1st of September, 1781, and was consequently in her 74th year. During the quarter of a century ending, perhaps, somewhere about 1850, her name was more widely known, in either hemisphere, than that of any other American authoress. Latterly her poetry has given place, in most libraries, to that of a more modern and varied school, though it will never be wholly superseded. She was early addicted to verse-making, possessed a temperament which, while it never marred her sound and solid health, was nevertheless keenly susceptible to the varied beauties and subtile influence of nature. She removed to this city in 1814, where she opened a select school for young ladies, and where her poetical talent and many lady-like and christian graces soon attracted the notice and engaged the personal interest of the late DANIEL WADSWORTH, a gentleman whose artistic and literary taste was fortunately equalled by his pecuniary means; and he was the means of introducing her to the public, in a volume of ""Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse."" In 1819, Miss HUNTLEY became the second wife of CHARLES SIGOURNEY, a well-known merchant of this city; and since that time she, while engaged in the domestic affairs of rearing a family of children, found time to contribute largely to the serious literature of the country, both in prose and verse. Her published works, in all, number nearly fifty volumes. Her prose is marked by vigor, beauty and good sense, and, like her poetry, is full of good moral precepts.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary.; MRS. L.H.

If the condition of the whites and blacks alike is such as is described; if the relations of the two classes toward each other are what our correspondent has seen or believes them to be, there is absolute social demoralization throughout the State. Labor is so despised by the whites that they actually prefer starvation or begging to work in any form whatever. And even in their penury and wretchedness they show the most virulent spirit of disaffection.

This suggestion, from such a source, created much surprise at the time, especially for its broad and extreme Federal doctrine, which demanded a resumption of the Federal constitutional power to regulate and control the currency, which the States -- originally forbidden to issue bills of credit themselves -- had usurped by creating corporations to do that, indirectly, which they could not, of themselves, do directly.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Federal Control of Banking.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Federal Control of Banking.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'BANKS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f35808f7-d307-53d0-91ab-320e9359acd2,1025,nyt://article/f35808f7-d307-53d0-91ab-320e9359acd2,

"National Academy of Design, South Room",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/13/archives/national-academy-of-design-south-room.html,"National Academy of Design, South Room","Mr. BIERSTADT, N.A., is fortunate in having a good place on the line, and we may at once frankly confess that he deserves it. We shall not perhaps feel ourselves justified in bestowing unlimited praise on his picture (No. 436) ""Looking down Yo Semite Valley Ca,"" but its merits are sufficiently conspicuous to entitle them to honorable consideration. It certainly commands public attention in its present position. The dimensions of the canvas, the imposing character of the frame, (should we not in justice to artiste who use chisels instead of brushes seriously put ourselves to the contemplation of wood work? The tendency toward carpentry is marked. Considered esthetically it may also be significant,) -and the nature of the scene which glares upon us from every part of the room renders it impossible for any one to commence, as the catalogue directs ""on the left as you enter."" We prefer, therefore, to speak at once of this overhanging frame, and so, in some sort, escape its domineering influence. The subject is one of those grand landscapes which the intra-Californian country affords to the artist. Hugo masses of rock rise up on every hide, and through a notch wrought with the ceaseless waters of centuries the river passes. From this gigantic rift issues a flood of light, the fiery particles of the departing sun sinking into its prison home in those solitary and stern recesses. The distribution of the picture, we take it, is geographically correct. It does not lack the hardness of a Gradgrind fact, nor the sole merit of a photograph, But we may ask with pertinence and justice, in what way is such a picture essential to our perception of beauty; to our apprehension of the sublime? Natural scenery owes all its interest to the relation which it holds with man. The Alps are the most picturesque mountains in the world, simply because, they are the most known, and Mr. GIGNOUX's representation of them (opposite to Mr. BIERSTADT's picture) is valuable because it epitomises their general characteristics. But these distant regions, selected with so much pertinacity by Mr. BIERSTADT, are, as it were, cut off from human sympathy. They are to the average mind unverified. It must be added, too, that Mr. BIERSTADT, in this instance, is hopelessly local. He does not essay a generalization of the scenery of the ""Yo Semite Valley,"" but contents himself with giving us, doubtlessly a correct, but still a positive survey of one particular portion of it. The sunlight effect to which we have referred is ingenious enough, but it is by no means novel. It detracts, perhaps, from the rigor of the scene, but it does not add to it human interest. The foreground, where the brimstone-dust rays of the sun fall upon it, is carefully finished, but the shaded part to the right, is hard, inelegant, cold and utterly commonplace as it generally is in all this artist's pictures. The rive seems to us to be narrow, extremely swollen, and ""too forward,"" but Mr. BIERSTADT has doubtless is precise information on every, save the last point. The face of the rocks display all those characteristics which GIETHE describes as the natural traits of the German school; namely, dry simplicity hard strength and timid correctness. But, to bring our remarks to a close, the defect of the picture is its lack of an appreciable subject. These remote wonders are chilling. Had Mr. BIERSTADT bestowed the same amount of conscientious labor on any the[???] more [???]m [???]iate to our every-day or even every-twenty-[???]-year-experience, he would achieve [???] a [???] [???]ss.H[???]l he imparted to this canvas any deep, in[???], [???] [???]ve personal impression of the [???]e, he would to [???]i[???] extent also have made it in[???]re thus, To quote once more from GIETHE: Seek within yourself and you will find everything; and rejoice that without (as it may be always called,) there lies a nature that says yea and amen to all have discovered in yourself.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN.; South Room.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN.; South Room.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/96b38907-46e2-583b-aacf-bc18c80671c8,2870,nyt://article/96b38907-46e2-583b-aacf-bc18c80671c8,

Government Agents and Southern Trade,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/13/archives/freedom-of-southern-trade.html,Government Agents and Southern Trade,"-- We had yesterday the very gratifying information from Washington that President JOHNSON, having had under consideration the question of encouraging and enlarging Southern trade, has determined to issue a general proclamation putting an end to the present system of purchasing cotton, tobacco and other Southern products, by government agents. The general opinion has been that there can be no relief, except through the action of Congress, from the system established by the law of July 2, 1864, providing that the products of insurrectionary districts shall be sold through government agents, and taxing them one-fourth of their value; but our dispatch states that the Attorney-General has given his opinion that the remedy is now with the President, who may, by proclamation, declare that there is no longer an insurrection in any of the States recently in rebellion. The law, as its language implies, applies to the ""products of States declared to be in insurrection;"" but the rebellion having everywhere entirely ceased, there are no longer any such States or any such products. By removing this taxation of 25 per cent., cotton, tobacco, and other Southern staples will only be taxed under the general laws, as in the case of products of other States.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FREEDOM OF SOUTHERN TRADE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FREEDOM OF SOUTHERN TRADE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'GOVERNMENT', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fbbdbc12-43fa-5ef7-8c4e-cedc6be2b075,285,nyt://article/fbbdbc12-43fa-5ef7-8c4e-cedc6be2b075,

The conferences, it seems, are still in progress; and we hear, privately, that the prime difficulty is, in getting an imperial indorsement for the notes on which the colony must raise the money necessary to do its part in the fortifying scheme. If the colonists had to borrow the required amount without such indorsation, the delegates reason fairly, it would overturn their credit altogether. Reasonable as this claim is, we doubt whether it is at all likely to be granted.

An immense assemblage of spectators was gathered on the grounds on the occasion, considerable interest being taken in the contest, as it was anticipated that the Athletics would meet with tough adversaries in this encounter; but though the Eagles had out nearly their best team, their play, as a general thing, was not up to the mark of their recent contest with the Stars.

At the close of the fifth innings, which was played in an hour and ten minutes, the totals stood 14 to 7 in favor of the Philadelphians, a ratio of two to one; but in the last four innings, the Eagles gained ground, scoring 7 to their adversaries 10.

The subscription lists (two sous) have been bravely seized; the money appropriated to the reward of those who most distinguished themselves in the seizure, and henceforth there is an end to one revolutionary movement, at least. This must be a consoling thought for the Imperial mind, scarcely less so than the recent triumphant victory of the police over the students of the Latin quarter, when resolutions on the subject of Mr. LINCOLN's death were on the tapis.

The torpedo was charged with one hundred and fifty pounds of gunpowder, and the explosion was grand in its effect, though the report was not so loud as many anticipated. It sent up a volume of water to a height of between eighty and ninety feet, and of proportionate circumference. Following the water came a dense mass of steam, smoke and flame, the whole forming a magnificent sight and well repaying the disappointment of the spectators on Thursday last. The raft was utterly demolished, being blown into fragments, which were quickly picked up by a squad of small boats which were waiting for the chance. This invention of Mr. FAY's will eventually prove of wonderful importance, as the clockwork of the machine, which it is designed to manufacture, combined with the shell containing the powder, can be adjusted so as to explode at any time, from one minute to one month. The explosion was witnessed by a large crowd of spectators, who cheered loudly as the waters subsided.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWS OF THE DAY.; GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0018d962-88ed-5b47-86df-e16af00b4d80,1007,nyt://article/0018d962-88ed-5b47-86df-e16af00b4d80,

The facts in this case, now probably forgotten by the public, excited universal attention at the time. He was committed on the 30th of November, 1863, for the murder of a woman with whom he was living as his wife. WALTER is a very intelligent man, of perhaps thirty-five years of age. He says that he was living in St. Louis as a house-joiner; that he there met this woman, with whom he came to New-York. He was not very well, and they took rooms together at a house of prostitution, in Centre-street, opposite the Tombs. They lived as happily together as people of that class can, finding their enjoyment in matters purely physical, drinking, carousing, and all that. When the hospitals were opened on David's Island, he went there, and was employed in some subordinate capacity, doing very well, and giving general satisfaction. He occasionally came down to the city on furlough, and always spent the time with his paramour. On this occasion they left the house at which she was lodging, and went to another, where they remained several days, drinking all the time excessively, and on the last day, becoming noisy and quarrelsome, they were taken to the station-house. The next morning they were discharged; she went back to her old home, and he continued his spree. In the evening he called at the house, and went directly to the landlady's room, where he found the girl. He fell upon her and stabbed her eighteen times, in different parts of the body, when one of the other girls struck him over the head with a hair-oil bottle, and he left the place. The girl died, WALTER was arrested, tried and convicted, and sentenced to be hanged on the 23d of this month. The Court of Appeals has affirmed this sentence, and there is no reasonable doubt that on that day the sentence will be carried out.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Execution of Walter.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Execution of Walter.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abe8995b-6178-5d2a-83f3-46e7b7e72499,506,nyt://article/abe8995b-6178-5d2a-83f3-46e7b7e72499,

The excellent gentlemen who forwarded for publication their willingness to take shares in the scheme, payable when all the stock was taken, got what they sought -- a little cheap notoriety but tiny have paid no money, and the debt is just as large as it was before they subscribed. Evidently the benevolence of our wealthy men had been overrated. It would require only about one-fifth of all the property in the United States, real and personal, to pay the national debt, and it seems to have been supposed that two hundred thousand persons might be tempted to pay it themselves. This proves to have been a mistake. The scheme has collapsed. Even the Herald has dropped it, and when that journal drops one of its pet sensations, it must be very dead indeed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The National Debt.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The National Debt.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e20f0339-1a58-5e18-b3f4-b92cb968cc43,987,nyt://article/e20f0339-1a58-5e18-b3f4-b92cb968cc43,

A.T. STEWART & CO's, was remanded by Recorder HOFFMAN. A day or two thereafter she was taken to court to receive sentence, but was again remanded. On the way back to the Tombs, the officer in whose custody she was walking was pushed by one GEORGE P. HALE, at the Chambers-street crossing of Centre-street, and as the officer turned to see who had pushed him, a female, vailed and attired in close resemblance of MARY BROWN, slipped into the prisoner's place by the officer's side, and the Tombs gang passed on until they had reached Worth-street. Here the female representing MARY BROWN stepped aside toward Broadway, and the officer requested her to give him no occasion to resort to force, but to go quietly to prison. The female retorted by warning him not to insult her, lest she report him to his superiors, and, raising her vail, disclosed a face which he never had seen. In his confusion, the officer permitted her to escape, and, until recently, nothing further was heard of either the real or the putative MARY BROWN; but last week District-Attorney HALL ascertained that the fugitive was in Yonkers. He informed Capt. JOHN JOURDAN of the fact, and instructed him to exercise the utmost vigilance in capturing her. Policemen WOOLDRIDGE and MCDONALD, of the Sixth Ward, accordingly went to Yonkers, and after diligent search, found and apprehended the prisoner, and she was committed to the Tombs yesterday afternoon, to be sentenced this morning. The prisoner, who has already served four years and six months in State prison for grand larceny, and whose term had but just expired when she committed the offence for which she is new to suffer imprisonment, had secured passage in today's steamer, and resolved to add one to the cosmopolitan population of California. The spurious MARY BROWN is said to be an experienced pickpocket from Rochester, and GERARD P.

Anxiety of a Native American Paper,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/16/archives/suspicious-anxiety.html,Anxiety of a Native American Paper,"-A daily newspaper, which but a few years since furiously rode the hobby of nativism, and advocated the refusal of suffrage to everybody born outside the limits of the country, is now painfully unhappy because there is a possibility that some half million thorough native Americans, may possibly be allowed to vote. By direct opposition, by indirect insinuation, by open sneers and perpetually varying misrepresentation, the editor endeavors to cast ridicule upon the extension of the franchise to a class of men who have, to a certain extent, enjoyed the right ever since the foundation of the government; a class whose few votes in this State have been importuned for this same editor, and who have by him been taught that the ""dirty foreigner"" was their greatest enemy. Now, when the question is imperative whether five hundred or five hundred thousand of these men shall vote, his pen reeks with abuse of them; he complains that neither women, nor paupers, nor lunatics, nor idiots can vote; ergo, this new class of citizens must not vote. Of course we do not look for strict consistency in these revolutionary times; particularly among those whose partisan gymnastics have left them to inquire in the words of a famous statesman, ""Where shall I go?"" but, surely, a sense of decency -- if that idea be comprehensible in such a quarter -- ought to induce some care in the squandering of false logic and impotent spite upon a matter that has become of great and controlling importance to the welfare of the nation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SUSPICIOUS ANXIETY.--', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SUSPICIOUS ANXIETY.--', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SUFFRAGE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2405521e-16fd-5f7b-81c0-e7e97387e4fd,258,nyt://article/2405521e-16fd-5f7b-81c0-e7e97387e4fd,

Y.; Coogan, Michael, Shot by Gorman in Self-defence","MICHAEL COOGAN was shot and instantly killed, at about 9 o'clock last evening, at his dwelling, in the rear of No. 99 Cannon-street, near Stanton, by MICHAEL GORMAN. The circumstances, as related by Police Captain ULMAN, of the Eleventh Ward, are as follows: GORMAN, who has served three years or more in the army and navy, and who was honorably discharged from the United States ship Savannah on the 4th of May, returned to this city only to find his mother, BRIDGET GORMAN, living with MICHAEL COOGAN, and calling him husband. This annoyed young GORMAN, and he made no secret of the fact, but expressed his opinion with so much plainness that COOGAN forbade him the house. He went thither last evening, to see his mother, and COOGAN being at home, after ordering him to depart, seized him by the throat and attempted to thrust him from a second-story window. In the struggle between the two COOGAN struck young GORMAN a stunning blow, knocking his head into a looking-glass, and severely wounding him, and then GORMAN drew a small four-barreled Sharpe's pistol and discharged two barrels into COOGAN's breast. COOGAN still struggled a moment, and then fell to the floor and expired without uttering a word. GORMAN now instinctively fled, but on hearing that COOGAN's wound had proved mortal, he went to the Eleventh Ward Police Station and surrendered to Capt. ULMAN. The officers, on going to Mrs. COOGAN's apartments, found her in a condition which unfitted her for communicating intelligence; yet she retained sufficient reason to attempt to hide the weapon with which the deed had been committed. She was taken to the Eleventh Ward Police Station, and held for the night. Mrs. COOGAN is perhaps 50 years of age; COOGAN, who was a laborer, was about 45; and young GORMAN, who is a printer, is but 21.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER EAST SIDE TRAGEDY.; A Returned Soldier Murders, His Putative Father-in-Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANOTHER EAST SIDE TRAGEDY.; A Returned Soldier Murders, His Putative Father-in-Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/26cf5748-c117-5959-b30d-6abf90d9981d,352,nyt://article/26cf5748-c117-5959-b30d-6abf90d9981d,

We recognize that Mexico is entitled to independence of all European control, but we do not yet accept the ""manifest destiny"" doctrine that if must some day, in its entirety, become part of the United States. The character of its eight million mongrel population -- in the worst degree indolent, ignorant, bigoted and superstitious -- sufficiently forbids it. But a sterner prohibition yet lies in the fact that all that part of Mexico, which is the most fertile and populous, all that part which forms the real substance of the country, lies south of the tropic.

He was indicted by the Grand Jury, but was subsequently bailed in the sum of $1,500 by his father. Shortly before the day fixed for his trial, he escaped from the city, and his bail was forfeited. Thinking, probably, that he had no more to f[???]ar, he recently returned to the city, and remained for some days at the house of a relative, which is next door to the residence of the lady whom he robbed. He doubtless made himself acquainted with the premises, and laid his plans accordingly. At the time of the robbery in Herkimer-street he carried on the business of a butcher in that neighborhood, and was familiar with the premises he then entered in a felonious manner. His chances of escape now are very limited.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f99b6ea4-717d-56f7-bea1-97a259035291,515,nyt://article/f99b6ea4-717d-56f7-bea1-97a259035291,

LEE for treason -- and we believe it is not yet decided whether he will be so tried or not -- there are one or two points of great delicacy to be considered. Dr. LIEBER has discussed, with his usual acumen, the force and duration of the parole given on surrender, deciding that it lasts as long as the war lasts, and no longer, and that on its expiration, the person giving it becomes a civilian, and liable, like any other man, to any pains and penalties to which he may have rendered himself liable for violations of the laws. In other words, the parole of a prisoner binds him, and has to be respected by his captors, only so long as he would have remained in confinement had it not been given at all. Either the cessation of hostilities or a regular exchange puts an end to it, and reduces the prisoner, if an alien, to the condition of a foreign sojourner; if a rebel, to that of a simple citizen.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Trial of Paroled Rebel Prisoners for Treason.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Trial of Paroled Rebel Prisoners for Treason.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2f9097db-bece-5e85-a900-2256dc5b1a13,590,nyt://article/2f9097db-bece-5e85-a900-2256dc5b1a13,

Suffrage and Threats of Revolution; Mr. Cain on,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/17/archives/amusements-winter-garden.html,Suffrage and Threats of Revolution; Mr. Cain on,"-- It is not as Evadne or as Lucretia Borgia that MISS HOSMER is seen to the best advantage. The latter character was thought would suit her presence and style better than the role in which she made her debut. We were mistaken. The opportunities offered by the large and passionate temperament of the Borgia were seized last evening with an unsteady grasp, and the evidence of injurious [???]ing in a vicious school was only too manifest. [???] advice have appeared before a New-York public with better claims to consideration [???] Miss HOSMER. Her voice is excellent, her manner impressive, and under due restraints commanding; her elocution in the suave passages that [???] become the voice of woman, is thoroughly charming. With these advantages, natural and acquired, it was not at all strange that the lady obtained an immediate success, notwithstanding a common aversion to the piece, (Camille,) in which she appeared. But these claims will surely be forgotten, and rightly, if she indulges in the ""Er[???]s vein"" so persistently as she did last night. We have had so many dignified types of Lucretia Borgia, both in opera and drama, that it were in vain to point out the fact that dignity is an essential element of the character. Miss HOSMER, it seems to us, is oblivious of this. The character in her hands is lowered to a level which it ought not to occupy. The haughty and erring mother becomes a mere scold, and rages furiously at everything that crosses her path. The performance throughout was uneasy -- if not violent -- in speech and in action; displaying, instead of the independence of youth, the imitative of subserviency of the old stager. There can be no humane justification, of the positive rant, the unreasonable gesticulation and incessant wails of the second act. They are mannerisms of the worst kind, and we consult Miss HOSMER's interest when we advise her to discard them at once. An audience such as she addressed will not patiently return to a school that is exploded, and the subject of general ridicule.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.; WINTER GARDEN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.; WINTER GARDEN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0e48c14-dc77-5791-813e-c8d1cc81d24f,384,nyt://article/f0e48c14-dc77-5791-813e-c8d1cc81d24f,

Perhaps no two men of note in allthe South would be received with anything like the consideration that these repentant sinners can command. In spite of his manifest treason. Gen. LEE has retained a strong hold upon Northern regard; he has held, notwithstanding his complicity in the treatment of Union prisoners, a sort of deified petition, and has been tacitly excepted from the herd of common traitors.

Trevor >amp; Colgate's Gift of 160,000 for Scholarship for Soldiers","-- The Boston Traveller states that when a number of prisoners were released from Fort Warren, on Monday last, the crowd were very anxious to secure some of the buttons on the coats and jackets of the rebels for curiosities -- the Virginia State buttons, with the motto ""Sic Semper Tyrannis"" engraved upon them, being the most in demand. The rebels readily cut off a number and gave them away. Others, who were not so fortunate as to receive any, resorted to all manner of schemes to obtain a button. The man was kept in earnest conversation by two or three men, while another would operate on the buttons, and in this way several were secured. A rebel detected a person in the act, and laughed at his eagerness to get such a trifle, saying that he was willing to give away all he had on his clothes, if they would sew others on, so that he could keep his coat together. The ""C.S.A."" and South Carolina buttons (with the palmetto tree engraved upon the latter) were also much inquired after. They were evidently made in Manchester, England, from the mark on the back of them.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DOMESTIC ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DOMESTIC ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/19995ebf-95fb-5750-96b9-45cdbcf3aaa8,1978,nyt://article/19995ebf-95fb-5750-96b9-45cdbcf3aaa8,

As the sessions were secret, and nothing was known by the public at the North, of the result which had been reached, until the close of March, when all hope of peace or compromise had passed away, and when every mind was absorbed in the contemplation of the tremendous catastrophe which was then approaching, there was but few people who paid any attention to the labors of the convention, and there are, perhaps, fewer still, who now remember that it ever sat. Neither its debates nor its resolutions have exercised the smallest influence on the course of events, or on public opinion. They never made the smallest approach to the amicable adjustment of the differences between North and South; we doubt if they over raised the smallest expectation, even in the minds of those who took part in its proceedings, that they would postpone for one hour the great collision which was then impending.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PEACE CONVENTION OF 1861.; Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the Peace Convention Held in Washington, February, 1861.

MYSTIC. -- The contest between these clubs, which took place on the ball-grounds on Sixty-third-street and Third-avenue, on Saturday afternoon, proved to be a signal victory for the Empire Club, and a very good practice game preliminary to the grand match which comes off at Hoboken on Wednesday between the Empire and the champion Atlantics. In the game on Saturday the Empires batted in fine style throughout, and their fielding, especially that of their catcher and second base player, was very good. Their opponents found it next to impossible to punish MARTIN's pitching to any extent, and when they did do so, they found it hard work to get round their bases. There were but about three or four players on the Mystic side at all up to the mark in play -- HARRIS being the best fielder of the party.

It was a military end that he had primarily to accomplish; and his main responsibility was discharged when he raised the adequate forces, and intrusted them to the fittest commanders. President LINCOLN was a man of great discretion, and he exercised it with excellent effect when it was required. Yet the success of the war depended mainly upon the discretion of his Generals, particularly upon that of his Lieutenant-General.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/19/archives/general-city-news.html,,"A QUIET SABBATH. -- Complaint from various quarters having recently been made against the many lager-bier gardens on the upper part of the island, Superintendent KENNEDY instructed the captains of police to enforce an old order forbidding music or dancing at these places of popular resort on the Sabbath. The recuit was that last week the Superintendent was overwhelmed with remonstrances, the keepers of the parks and lager-bier gardens up town complaining of the injustice of shutting music out of their places, and permitting the down-town saloons to continue their music as usual. Regarding the point as having been well taken, the Superintendent promulgated an order requiring every police captain of the force to prohibit music, yesterday, in every place within his precinct wherein beer or spirituous liquors were offered for sale, and the order was obeyed to the letter throughout the city. Yesterday afternoon a multitude of Germans assembled at the Bellevue Gardens, at the foot of East Seventy-ninth-street, and on ascertaining that the police had forbidden music they held an indignation meeting, passed a series of denunciatory resolutions, and departed for their respective homes. Perfect quiet reigned throughout the city last evening, even East Houston-street behaving itself like an abode of civilization. The number of arrests for drunkenness, up to 11 o'clock last evening, was reported at 42, 11 of the prisoners being females. In the Third, Eighth, Eleventh, Fourteenth, and Twenty-second Wards no arrests were made.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eaae0429-d451-5f5d-9e50-f265934b6489,376,nyt://article/eaae0429-d451-5f5d-9e50-f265934b6489,

The crops were duly sown and gathered, and beside supplying our own necessities, there was an abundance to supply the heavy demand for export. Ships were built for commercial purposes for our own use, and furnished to other countries for commercial uses, as well as to the navies of other governments. Foundries made engines to be employed on railroads and in all the industries. Factories of cotton goods even, were, to some extent, kept active. Every pursuit and profession that ministered to the necessities or luxuries of the people, or that was required in the economy of society or for the ends of civilization, was prosecuted to the extent required. Houses were erected, towns projected and built, and all the cities of the land enlarged. Even those pursuits which minister solely to the intellect, such as the making and publishing of books, were carried on to an extent that must be pronounced astonishing.

SCOTT to Mexico, and he there fought creditably under that distinguished leader, and, having been wounded in the head, received an honorable discharge. Returning to this city he again accepted an appointment as Policeman, under Capt. (now Inspector) CARPENTER, of the Fifth Ward, and served under the Captain until the present organization of Metropolitan Police took the place of the effete Municipal body, in 1857, and then, linking his fortunes with Capt. CARPENTER, and going with that officer into the Metropolitan force, he was made a member of the detective squad. He was among the first that responded to the lamented LINCOLN's call for men to retake those ""forts and places,"" and having raised a company for the One Hundred and Thirty-third (Metropolitan) New-York Volunteers, was made Captain thereof. Capt. KING passed through the sanguinary siege of Port Hudson, and followed Gen. BANKS in the disastrous expedition up Red River; but his health failing, he was compelled to resign, and when he reached home, the Board of Police Commissioners again tendered him a position on the detective force, and this he accepted. Detective KING, who had won an enviable reputation as a discreet, skillful and conscientious officer, was sent to England, last Spring, in pursuit of CHARLES WINDSOR, the Mercantile Bank defaulter; but after he had struck the fugitive's trail, British red tape stepped in between him and the accused, and he was forced to come home and report that his mission had been fruitless. A fortnight ago duty called him to the Paterson races, and while there he was prostrated by a sunstroke, from which he did not fully recover. He was able to report for duty up to Friday last, but was then forced to place himself in the hands of a physician, and yesterday morning, when the family thought he was convalescing, he suddenly expired from congestion of the brain. Detective KING, who was 43 years of age, leaves a widow and several daughters to mourn his decease. The entire body of the New-York Detective Police will attend the funeral.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36a4df45-c5fc-5e27-8052-9f2738b7b187,904,nyt://article/36a4df45-c5fc-5e27-8052-9f2738b7b187,

STONE, Esq., counsel for HERROLD, being necessarily absent, the argument prepared by him was read by Mr. JAMES J. MURPHY, one of the official reporters of the court. It commences by saying that, at the earnest request of the widowed mother and estimable sisters of the accused, he had consented to act as his counsel. After denying the jurisdiction of the court, the counsel says, the charge in this case consists of several distinct and separate offences embodied in one charge. The parties accused are charged with a conspiracy in aid of the rebellion, with murder, with assault with intent to kill, and with lying in wait. It is extremely doubtful, from the language of the charge and the specification, under which of the following crimes the accused HERROLD is arraigned, and now on his trial, viz.: First, whether he is on trial for conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States, punishable by the act of Congress of the United States, passed on the 31st of July, 1861; or, second, whether he is on his trial for giving aid and comfort to the existing rebellion as punishable by the act of Congress passed the 17th of July, 1862; or, third, Whether he is on his trial for aiding and abetting the murder of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States. His counsel will understand the legal definition of this three crimes above-mentioned, but does not understand that either to the common law or to the law of war is known any one offence comprised of the three crimes mentioned in this charge. He knows of no one crime of a conspiracy to murder and an actual murder all in aid of the rebellion, distinct and separate from the well-known and defined crimes of murder, of conspiracy in aid of the rebellion, or of giving aid and comfort to the rebellion, as defined by the act of Congress.

THIERS. The subject chosen by the distinguished speaker was the financial condition of the country a subject which gave ample scope for M. THIERS to enlarge upon a variety of features in the imperial policy, on which the liberal and the old constitutional party in France are decidedly at issue with the Emperor. The gross national expenditure of the current year is likely to be little less than twenty-two hundred million francs, or about $440,000,000. The deficit, making the most liberal revenue estimates, is likely to exceed $36,000,000. And M. THIERS, while showing by a keen and searching analysis, the insidious way in which the disparity between the income and outlay of the empire is every year increasing, is specially careful to elaborate his picture of the costliness of the glory which France is at this moment reaping from her attempt to establish an imperial system in Mexico. The hopes of a reimbursement of the French Exchequer from the resources of that country, M. THIERS shows to have been thus far altogether fallacious. The securities based upon these resources, which had a nominal market value, last year, of 64, are, to-day, quoted at 44; and M. THIERS confesses himself so entirely skeptical of this financial record improving under a prolonged French occupation, that he urges upon the Emperor's Government the expediency of a prompt and final withdrawal from Mexico. The amour propre of the empire, he admits, might suffer, but not the glory of France.

They have the power to do this. By the reconstruction proclamations of the President, the new constitutional conventions must be ""composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of the people of said State who are loyal to the United States, and no others;"" and they are empowered to ""prescribe the qualifications of electors, and the elegibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws of the State."" It is true that all who vote for these convention delegates must have the qualifications prescribed by the constitution and laws of the State before its so-called ""secession;"" but thousands in each State who have these qualifications have been so identified with the rebellion that they will not be considered by the Provisional Governor, and the judges of election, his appointees, as meeting the other requirement of loyalty to the United States, and their votes will be rejected. The new conventions will represent that portion of the people who have always remained loyal at heart, and who have been made to suffer in some form or other because of it. They will take every precaution to prevent the control of the State from again passing into the hands of those who so flagitiously betrayed it. This object alone will necessitate great curtailments of the franchise. It is only to be feared that personal feeling may impel the Union men to indulge in an undue measure of proscription. The impulse will be very strong to repay persecution with persecution. All such action ought to be avoided. Broad considerations of public policy should determine the future relations of the loyal Southerners to those who have been disloyal. Private griefs should have no influence.

"This distinguished cavalry officer arrived here on Monday evening from North Carolina, and took rooms at the Metropolitan Hotel, where he was cordially welcomed by a host of admiring friends. Yesterday he visited New-Jersey -- his boyhood home -- and to-day he will go to West Point, there to spend a brief leave of absence. Just before leaving North Carolina, the officers of KILPATRICK's command presented him with a valuable sword as a token of their respect and esteem. It was manufactured by SCHUYLER, HARTLEY, GRAHAM & CO., New-York, at a cost, including belt and all, of about $6,000. The scabbard is made of ""solid sterling silver,"" richly gilt. The chain on the guard is made of eighteen karat gold. On the upper band of the scabbard is the initial letter ""K."" in diamonds, on a scroll supported by recording angels in full relief.

The plaintiff sued the defendant for a conversion of the bonds and for a breach of his duty as agent and claimed to recover about $40,000 as the difference between the price paid for the bonds in currency, and the value of the gold in which it was claimed the company had paid the bonds when gold was at 245 to 250. The principal question in the case, was whether the defendant was chargeable with the value of the bonds in gold or only their legal value in currency. The court instructed the jury that they must estimate the value of the bonds; that is, what they were worth on their face in currency, and not in gold in which they were said to have been paid; and on that basis they must find a verdict for only nominal damages.

Surrender and London Tory Press,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/21/archives/sad-disappointment.html,Surrender and London Tory Press,"Gen. KIRBY SMITH, as appears by the European telegram this morning, has grievously disappointed the London Tory journals. By one American steamer they received the inspiriting news that this redoubtable chieftain, at the head of 85,000 veteran troops, of whom nearly one-half were cavalry, was not only prepared to bid defiance for years to any force that SHERIDAN could bring against him, but even to carry the war into the Eastern States. The next steamer brought them the unwelcome news of his quiet surrender. But, though intensely disgusted, these journals were not without comfort. We are reminded that by this surrender our troops are ""brought face to face with the French outposts on the Rio Grande."" This is doubtless a very dreadful circumstance, though we fail to appreciate it. And, besides, they had not then heard of the surrender of STERLING PRICE, who, according to the London Times, was likely to prove more formidable as a general and a statesman than KIRBY SMITH himself.

I.","Yesterday was set apart by the firemen of Astoria, Jamaica, Flushing and College Point, for a trial of fire aparatus at Flushing. Extensive preparations were made for a grand display, and Engine Companies Nos. 1 and 7, of the Eastern District, No. 3 of the Western District, Brooklyn, and No. 14 of New-York, were invited to be present. Consequently, early in the day, an immense number of firemen and their friends assembled in the town. In consequence of some delay, the trial did not take place until about 2 P.M., and scarcely had the machines been put in working order, when a tumult arose in Main-street, near Woolley's Hotel, which became so formidable in its proportions that all idea of a further trial was abandoned. It appears that an engineer from the Eastern District offered a bet of $40 to a member of the Astoria Company, each having been discussing the merits of the Smith and Jeffer's engine, when they quarreled over the terms of the bet -- the Astoria man first striking the Eastern District man. Their partisans then took up the quarrel, and in a few minutes the fight became general between the Jeffers men and the Smith men. As soon as the report of fire-arms was heard, the business men of the town closed up their stores, and in a few minutes afterward the wildest disorder prevailed. The reports of pistols, the clashings of bowie knives, the screams and curses of the combatants, the terrified shrieking of women and children, among whom fell showers of stones, rendered the scene one of intense horror. The house-tops were crowded with men, while the women and children sought refuge in cellars. This state of things lasted for about two hours, when the rain commenced to fall in torrents and seemed to cool the passions of the infuriated rioters, and they gradually quieted down, and collected their wounded and disabled friends. It is impossible to state the number of those injured, but it is estimated at fifty or sixty. A lady, whose name was not ascertained, received a bullet wound in the breast. Several citizens and children were wounded by stray shots, but the fighters themselves suffered the most severe injuries. The wounded brought to Williamsburgh include, PAT. MCGINNIS, _____ MCCARTHY, knife wound in neck; ED. MCHUGH, badly injured about the head; CHARLES VAN DYKE, visitor, badly; F. KELLY, head bruised. The scene of the fight presented evidences of a terrific conflict -- bricks and stones, knives and broken pistols lying about on all sides.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""FIREMEN'S RIOT.; Serious Disturbance at Flushing Knives, Pistols and Brickbats Fifty or Sixty Persons Injured."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""FIREMEN'S RIOT.; Serious Disturbance at Flushing Knives, Pistols and Brickbats Fifty or Sixty Persons Injured."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/632b0488-6fe0-50c4-bd69-bcc18e6cdf1c,424,nyt://article/632b0488-6fe0-50c4-bd69-bcc18e6cdf1c,

A meeting was held last evening, when Alderman PANGBORN was elected Chairman pro tem., and JOHN E. SCOTT acted as Secretary. The minutes of the previous meeting were read, and a motion was made to approve them, to which Alderman GAFNEY raised an objection, on the ground that the proceeding would be illegal. The motion to approve was lost by a tie vote. A communication was received from Minot Engine Company No. 7, inviting the members of the board to be present on the occasion of the reception of their new engine, to-day, (Wednesday.) The bonds of the Corporation Attorney, R.C. MCCLELLAND, were presented, and a motion to lay them on the table was lost by a vote of 9 to 9. A motion to refer the bonds to a committee was also lost by a tie vote. Two veto messages were presented from His Honor Mayor CLEVELAND -- one disproving the resolution reinstating to duty Policeman SIMMONS and Chanceman DOLAN, and the other against the ordinance granting permission to the New-York and Fort Lee Railroad Company to lay down rails in certain streets in Jersey City. A motion to pass the resolution and ordinance, notwithstanding the objection of the Mayor, was lost, 9 ayes, 9 nays. A motion to go into an election for a city weigher and measurer was lost by the usual 9 vote, and the board adjourned.

The gentleman who has been the cause of this excitement is Mr. SMITH J. EASTMAN, of the firm of EASTMAN & CO., provision dealers, Broad-street. It is stated that Mr. EASTMAN has lately been operating largely in pork, selling short, and has lost heavily. He has also been operating in stocks, but his financial difficulties are not supposed to have arisen from the latter cause, as all the losses on stock operations paid by him during the past year do not exceed $25,000. His broker, however, will be a heavy loser, as he holds Mr. EASTMAN's notes not yet matured to a large amount. A warehouse man with whom EASTMAN had extensive dealings, is also said to be missing. It is alleged that this man gave EASTMAN receipts for lard in store, knowing that many of the barrels were empty. These receipts were hypothecated to capitalists, who, of course, will be heavy losers. For some of this lard, duplicate receipts are believed to have been issued, on which money has been raised. Investigation having been made yesterday of a cellar in which some of this lard was stored, it was found that the front part of the storehouse was filled with full barrels, while the back part contained nothing but empty packages. It is supposed that EASTMAN has raised on these warehouse receipts something like $350,000, In addition to this, he is said to have drawn from the bank, the day before he left, the balance of the firm, amounting to over $100,000.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ALLEGED HEAVY FRAUDS.; Disappearance of a Prominent Produce Dealer Convention Among his Victims.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ALLEGED HEAVY FRAUDS.; Disappearance of a Prominent Produce Dealer Convention Among his Victims.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/115fa53c-73f1-5989-b775-05e34892831e,418,nyt://article/115fa53c-73f1-5989-b775-05e34892831e,

"Between 8 and 9 o'clock last evening, Mrs. JOSEPHINE COHEN, having been thrust from the threshold of the Hotel Swiss, at No. 19 Jay-street, fell, head foremost, on the door-steps leading to the hotel and was instantly killed. There are, of course, two statements already abroad in the Fith Ward. That of SIMON COHEN, husband of the deceased, is that himself and wife arrived in port, yesterday, on the National Steamship Company's steamer Arion, and on leaving that vessel went directly to the Hotel Swiss and engaged board at the customary tariff of the house, $1 50 a day each. Their luggage have come up from the steamship last evening, they had ordered a porter to take it to their room; but the landlord, WERNER WERNER, objected, saying that there was too much to be taken up stairs. COHEN insisted upon having his luggage in his own room, and WERNER WERNER insisting that it should not be taken up. COHEN went out and engaged board at the Wyoming Hotel. Returning and preparing to depart from the Hotel Swiss, he had words with WERNER, concerning his bill, the landlord having demanded $3, notwithstanding, according to COHEN's story, he had had nothing. Mrs. COHEN entered into the dispute with spirit, and, it is alleged, WERNER struck both herself and her husband, and when she was about going out of his doors, gave her a push or kick, throwing her over, head foremost, to the foot of the stone steps leading to the house. When taken up, Mrs. COHEN was a corpse. Policeman COLE, of the Fifth Ward, hearing the shout which the bystanders made for the police, hastened to the spot and took WERNER into custody, and turned him over to Capt. PETTY, at the police station, and the body was taken into the Fifth Ward Hotel, where it was viewed, last evening, by Police Surgeon KENNEDY. Subsequently Capt. PETTY sent a body of policemen to apprehend the inmates of the Swiss, and the following-named boarders were taken as witnesses, and held at the Fifth Ward Police Station last night: Moritz Glaser, John Bruppacher, H. Ryf, Nicholas Bauholser, Louis Gabbiell, Joseph Stach, Anton Low, Jacob Egger, Henry William Sieb, Florin Colin, (daughter of deceased,) and Agrada Shader, Mrs. COHN, who was 34 years of age, was a native of Brussels.

The audience was mainly composed of the fairer sex, and the various lines and shades exhibited by the endless variety of costumes was almost bewildering.

One year ago there was no little reason for such painful apprehension. The insurrectionary States were known to be nearly desolate or on the borders of starvation; a million of men, directly in the service of the General Government, were to be discharged and thrown into the channels of our shrunken industry, at a time when the government demands which had stimulated it to an almost preternatural degree of activity, were expected to cease. At the same time, with the currency returning toward the specie standard, as was hoped, there would necessarily follow a decline in values, which would put a temporary stoppage to most kinds of manufactures required by ordinary consumers. ""Who will build ships,"" it was asked, ""when the government will have hundreds to dispose of at merely nominal prices? Who will put up houses with the prospects of a great decline in business and fall of rents? Who will spin silk or weave cotton for a falling market? Who will speculate when prices slide down day by day, like an avalanche? And what demand can arise for luxuries, in view of the struggle that is certain to follow for the necessaries of existence? In a word, will there not be, with the cessation in our industry, a panic, compared with which that of 1857 was insignificant in regard to duration, and no more extended in its sweep? In view of the troubles experienced in the British islands after the peace of 1815, before Europe had time to adjust itself to the new condition of affairs and become the customer it had been for British merchandise, what might not be apprehended here, where no much larger a proportion of our able-bodied men would be at once diverted from the pursuits of war to those of peace?""

This action is brought by his widow, as administratrix, under and by virtue of an act of the Legislature of this State, passed several years ago.

Resuscitation Necessary,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/23/archives/american-commerce-and-shipping.html,Resuscitation Necessary,"-- We spoke a few days since of the importance of energetic action on the part of our commercial men, shippers and ship-builders, to resuscitate our mercantile marine from the low condition into which it had fallen during the war. The Boston Commercial Bulletin, which has been discussing the subject, expresses astonishment that American ship-builders are not more active, now that peace is assured. There is not only the transportation of Southern staples, which the English and French are trying to secure; there is not only the vast trans-atlantic Ocean trade by steam which is now entirely in European hands; but the carrying trade of the world, from which we have been in a great measure excluded by rebel privateers, is now open to us. When our shipbuilders have three or four hundred thousand tons of shipping afloat, we shall be able to take advantage of all markets, and shall easily replace with American ships the two hundred sail of foreign vessels that crowd the port of New-York. We have abundance of ship-building materials upon our own soil, whereas Great Britain, our principal rival upon the seas, is compelled to import most of her timber; and the Southern pine, which was so extensively used before the war, may now be obtained by the same means as easily as ever. As the Bulletin remarks, everything, so far as we can perceive, is in favor of our ship builders, and nothing against them but their own fears. Let them throw their fear to the winds, and begin at once to replace the shipping which has been sold to foreigners or destroyed by British pirates, and we have no doubt they will soon reap a golden harvest for their enterprise.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMERICAN COMMERCE AND SHIPPING.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMERICAN COMMERCE AND SHIPPING.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0d2773e-ec1b-52c1-8318-b42adceb171b,287,nyt://article/f0d2773e-ec1b-52c1-8318-b42adceb171b,

The high estimate WOODRUFF places on Dexter as the best trotting horse out, is well known to the trotting world, while the supporters of the Hartford horse are just as firmly convinced of his superiority. It seems to be generally admitted that Dexter and Stonewall are the two best three-mile horses we have on the trotting turf, hence an intense interest is manifested concerning the result of the contest for the long distance championship. At present the Hartford horse is the favorite, at odds of about 5 to 4 in his favor; but in all probability the Dexter party will come into the market with a rush on or before the day; if so the tables will be turned. Formerly heat races of two, three, and four miles, were common occurrences, and esteemed as better tests of the courage and lasting quanlities of a horse than mile heats, now so much in vogue -- as in the latter, a horse may and frequently does win who has a great turn of speed and but little endurance.

Those of them that refuse to become partners in that political compact are to be henceforth denied the benefits of the protection they now get from the parent State. These refractory Provinces might do without the protection, but they would find it hard to do without the expenditure of British gold, which accrues to them from the quartering of sundry garrisons within their borders. There is where the Imperial shoe begins to pinch them. And there is how they will begin to discover and appreciate the advantages of the intercolonial union.

"Chicago, Funny Stafford, Tug",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/24/archives/general-news.html,"Chicago, Funny Stafford, Tug","A terrific explosion occurred in Chicago June 19, when the boiler of the tug Fanny Stafford exploded. The engineer was instantly killed. His body was blown out of sight, and has not been seen since. The Captain was blown from the storn of the tug to the vessel in tow, a distance of forty feet. Two wheelsmen and a deckhand were also blown into the headgear of the vessel, where they clung fast. All are uninjured. A piece of the boiler and works attached, weighing three tons, was blown into the air a distance of sixty feet, passed over a four-story building, and landed on the roof of a building across the road, a distance of nine hundred feet from the scene of the explosion. In the upper stories of the house were living two families, who, marvellous to relate, were unhurt, although the first floors are complete wrecks.

H. STEPHENS, R.M.T. HUNTER and J.A. CAMPBELL, on the other. The Chronicle says its statement is based on a conversation between its editor and Mr. STEPHENS himself, immediately after his return home to Georgia from the conference, and prefaces it with the remark that as DAVIS has no longer the power to arrest and confine persons or suppress papers, ""it may be as well to let people know the truth."" Mr. STEPHENS is said to have been well-disposed toward and hopeful of the result of this interview, but did not altogether like his companions in the mission. President LINCOLN and Secretary SEWARD, as is well known, informed the rebel commissioners that no terms for peace would be entertained which did not recognize ""complete restoration of the authority of the constitution and laws of the United States over all places within the States of the Confederacy;"" and the late President remarked that ""whatever consequences may follow from the reestablishment of that authority, it must be accepted; but individuals subject to pains and penalties under the laws of the United States, might rely upon a very liberal use of the powers confided to him to remit those pains and penalties if peace be restored."" Mr. LINCOLN's offers throughout were of the most generous and conciliatory character, and he urgently insisted on the return of the rebellious States and the close of the war, and offered $100,000,000 as compensation to owners of slaves for the abolition of slavery throughout the South. The result is known. Nothing was done; and the arch traitor now in Fortress Monroe, despite the report of Mr. STEPHENS -- who thought ""the way open for settlement,? -- rejected the propositions with contempt, and in communicating the result to the people of the South, he prefaced the report with false statements written by himself. The Chronicle says Mr. STEPHENS returned ""home with but a new cause of sorrow,"" and those who say he talked of making speeches denouncing the terms offered by our government, ""simply lied."" He spoke of Mr. LINCOLN ""as an old friend, who had generally voted with him in Congress, and who had a good heart and fine mind, and was undoubtedly honest.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2c3a4ffb-89db-5ae5-a3c4-e4f369f7a961,1836,nyt://article/2c3a4ffb-89db-5ae5-a3c4-e4f369f7a961,

Wool's Denial of the Story","Our eight Police Magistrates hold court on alternate weeks, and each disposes of his own prisoners, usually on the last day of his week's labor. This day being the Sabbath, the Sunday morning session is often quite theatrical in its visible features. Yesterday morning was one of the most interesting of these occasions, at the Third District Police Court, popularly known as Essex Market -- the court before which the officers of the Metropolitan Police are required to take all offenders that they may capture in the five densely populous, cosmopolitan Wards of the, great East Side. The week's calendars had been corpulent, and there was consequently a vast array of offenders that Justice MANSFIELD had committed to prison is await his pleasure -- many of them persons whom he had held merely to purge them of poisonous gin, others old offenders, that had been detained to enable the police to find evidence upon which to convict them of crimes of high grade, and yet others who had been imprisoned for a day or two, by way of reprimand. These were summoned from the cells in gangs. The first gang was composed of the ""revolvers,"" or those unhappy beings of both sexes whose master is the battle, and who come down from Blackwell's Island once in three months or six, only to return within a week of their release. These were summarily consigned to the ""Black Maria,"" that gaudily-painted vehicular contrivance which takes its name from the color it once bore, and wherein both sexes and all classes of criminals are huddled like untamed beasts in a cage. The second gang appearing, we see young men who, having been abroad on festive tours, have fallen into the bands of the meddlesome police and rendered themselves liable to the $10 fine or ten days imprisonment, which is the prescribed penalty for intoxication. These are ordinarily dismissed with a mild reprimand; but where it is shown that an inebriated man has given an officer offence, he is punished by imprisonment, as was the case, yesterday morning, with a dashing youth who had defied the policeman who had ordered him to go home. The magistrate thought that this prisoner was able to contribute ten dollars toward the support of the county's paupers, and he was accordingly given the option of doing this or of serving ten days on ""the Island."" A boy with a letter in the Post-office, having stolen a ball, was told that if he turned to look back on the way home his fate shall be that of Lot's wife, and, moreover, if he is again arrested for petty larceny he shall go to the House of Refuge. The third gang comprises thethieves of higher grade; the fourth, the burglars; the fifth, the highwaymen, and so forth, but let us to the, business of the day. The first noteworthy case is brought by Policeman MCCARE, of the court, and the complaint is for.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; THE POLICE COURTS.

Jerked Beef and the Price of Meat,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/26/archives/south-american-jerked-beef.html,Jerked Beef and the Price of Meat,"In view of the persistent attempts by our graziers and butchers to force us to pay exorbitantly for meat, the experiment successfully made in England to use South American jerked beef as a chief article of food, becomes of great importance. The most distinguished scientific men have carefully investigated the subject, and report that the meat is perfectly good and as nutritious as when fresh. The price is so low -- it can be shipped from Buenos Ayres at three cents a pound -- that there is no reason why a handsome profit should not be realized on arrival here, though sales be made at one-quarter the present price of beef in this city. The truth is that we can afford to be at the mercy of no one interest in regard to the prime necessities of life; and even if the meat salesman at once lower their prices, the importation of jerked beef is needed as a check upon future operations such as we now suffer from. Commercial men will no doubt see to this. The extortions of one class of tradesmen invariably end in its own discomfiture, and in the enrichment of another class. In short, the fable of the silly person who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs, is just as true an exposition of the consequence of greediness as it ever was, as certain people will surely find out before very long.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'South American Jerked Beef.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'South American Jerked Beef.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15dcff5c-e6e4-5396-8f3f-7e6a517f11c7,238,nyt://article/15dcff5c-e6e4-5396-8f3f-7e6a517f11c7,

To those again must be added its splendid streets, and edifices and parks, and its hundred miles of commodious and luxurious residences. To these also, its cosmopolitan and liberal spirit, its scientific and literary supremacy, its artistic treasures and opportunities, and all the innumerable appliances or gratifying the rich man's ordinary wants and ministering to his higher nature.

A few thousand men in each State have owned most of the cultivated soil, have held most of the wealth, have had the control of the legislalation and civil administration, and have kept not only black men in physical bondage,but the great mass of the white men in almost total ignorance, and in almost complete servitude mental and moral.

Nothing can be more proper than this. They had a horse-race the other day at Epsom, at which the French horse, Gladiateur, was enabled, by good English jockeyship, to carry off the honors. There was on that occasion a blending of business, sport, science, happy political augury, peace, and politeness, such as is rarely witnessed in the progress of rival nations. Now -- in a few days -- they are to have a grand mutual naval demonstration, as announced by yesterday's European mail. All the French iron-clads are to sail round the British Islands, from John O'Great's to Land's End, taking an entirely peaceful survey of the small but valuable piece of property they contain. All the British iron-clads, at the same time, are to sail round the coast of France as far as there is water communication to go by. And then there is to be a general rendezvous of the fleets at Plymouth. Nothing can be more gratifying to the outside world than this.

Nothing can be more proper than this. They had a horse-race the other day at Epsom, at which the French horse, Gladiateur, was enabled, by good English jockeyship, to carry off the honors. There was on that occasion a blending of business, sport, science, happy political augury, peace, and politeness, such as is rarely witnessed in the progress of rival nations. Now -- in a few days -- they are to have a grand mutual naval demonstration, as announced by yesterday's European mail. All the French iron-clads are to sail round the British Islands, from John O'Great's to Land's End, taking an entirely peaceful survey of the small but valuable piece of property they contain. All the British iron-clads, at the same time, are to sail round the coast of France as far as there is water communication to go by. And then there is to be a general rendezvous of the fleets at Plymouth. Nothing can be more gratifying to the outside world than this.

"Brougham, Lord; Friendly Advice of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/26/archives/article-2-no-title.html,"Brougham, Lord; Friendly Advice of","FRIENDS INDEED. -- It is assuredly gratifying to the United States to be befriended by a man of such immense antiquity as Lord BROUGHAM; and as he is never weary -- weak though he be -- in giving us advice, it must be pleasing to him to see how well we get along under it, even though we generally totally disregard it. But we are pained to be compelled to say that his Lordship is an illustration of the sad fact that old age is apt to be characterized by weak memory as well as by physical infirmity. By the last mail, we have a speech of his, delivered at a banquet to the Prince of WAXES, in which he gives this country a great deal of advice as to how it shall comport itself hereafter, and he precedes it by these words: ""If my voice could reach across the Atlantic, it would tell our kinsmen that their best friends, those who have been their advocates through good report and through bad report, now pray and beseech them"" -- to do so and so. Now, for Lord BROUGHAM, with the memory of the speeches he has delivering concerning this country during the last four years in the House of Lords, before the Social Science Congress and elsewhere, to undertake to give us advice as one of our ""best friends, who has been our advocate through good report and through bad report,"" is decidedly lively. We thought these speeches showed that he had been a friend and advocate of the slaveholders' Confederacy, an enemy of our Union, a laudator of the Southern rebels, a maligner of the Northern loyalists, a defender of JEFF. DAVIS, an assailant of President LINCOLN, and we had thought that his sympathies, even in his old age, had been so strong as to cause him to apologize for the system of slavery which in his earlier years he had struggled so hard to overthrow. Even if our memory were poor in this case, we have the reports of his speeches in our files; and they are sadly against his present assumption. But so goes a great part of mankind, Lords as well as Commons. We have been successful; we have triumphed; we have shown that power was on our side; and now they begin to see that justice also was with us, and to claim that they too were always our friends.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Article 2 -- No Title', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f2b00f2d-00f1-5248-aa6f-4ab924e9af54,405,nyt://article/f2b00f2d-00f1-5248-aa6f-4ab924e9af54,

Every few days we hoar of the repair or opening of some new line that has been ruined during the war. The old route to Richmond by way of Aquia Creek has just been reopened, and work on the Orange and Alexandria road is well under way. The roads south of Richmond as far as Charlotte and Wilmington, in North Carolina, are in bad condition, and do not make much better time than our city street-cars, but some repairs and now stock will set things to right again. It is of high importance that the great line known as the Virginia and East Tennessee Railroad should be put in running order speedily and in the best style. Our repeated raids during the war on this road, and destruction of costly bridges, have made its repair a question of time and expense; but on such a route neither energy nor capital will be wanting. In South Carolina, the line from Charleston to the State capital has been repaired, and is kept running, but we believe the other roads in the State are still unrepaired. The Georgia system of railroads is very excellent and simple -- consisting of three great lines crossing the State from East to West, with various connections and branches. The Southernmost of these, the Atlantic and Gulf railroad, has been restored to the Board of Directors, who at once inaugurated measures for the restoration of the damaged portion of the line; and as but a small portion of it was irreparably damaged, it is announced that trains will be running at a very early period. The Georgia Central Railroad also has been restored to the control of its directors, and a large force of laborers are now engaged in repairing it. The railroad system of Alabama -- what there is of a system -- never has assumed any importance; but that part of the Memphis and Chattanooga road which crosses the State is in some sort of order. The two great lines which run through the State of Mississippi, north and south, require but a small amount of repair.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Southern Railroads Their Present Condition.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Southern Railroads Their Present Condition.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Meat', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/99ace0ed-a6eb-505f-8ed1-d9e00c46587d,426,nyt://article/99ace0ed-a6eb-505f-8ed1-d9e00c46587d,

Its industry, though checked for a time by the first outbreak, soon became more active than ever, so that probably no four years in our history has yielded, on the whole, ampler products. Our agriculture has scarcely been diminished, and has realized higher prices. Our manufactures have suffered largely in certain branches, but have gained as much in other directions; and even that portion which has met with loss has secured an incidental protection, through the high tariff created by the war, which will soon far more than compensate for any post damage. Our commerce, that is to say our carrying trade on the high seas, has indeed sustained immense injury, directly and indirectly, through the Southern blockade and the rebel privateers. But on the other hand an immense benefit has accrued, through the war, to our railroads, which have never been so full of business or so profitable as during these four years. It is true that the war has brought, in different ways, great losses to some people; but it has brought as large gains to as many others. It is true, too, that a public debt of some three thousand millions has been entailed upon the country, the greater portion of which will have to be borne by the North. But this debt is almost entirely due to the people of the North, and they will have the large interest upon it while it runs, and the benefit of the principal when it is paid. It is true that hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men have been abstracted, by the war, from industrial pursuits; but this very absence has enhanced the price of labor, which has benefited the millions of laborers left behind, and has also greatly stimulated immigration from abroad. The active operations of the war having been confined almost entirely to the South; the North has lost almost nothing by its ravages. Surveying the matter broadly, then, we may say that the North, as a section, is to-day little, if at all, out of pocket, in consequence of the war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'What Rebellion Has Cost the South Pecuniarily.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'What Rebellion Has Cost the South Pecuniarily.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Milk', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6a7f52f-a73a-5f0c-8d28-29ed9c0ed89b,1562,nyt://article/d6a7f52f-a73a-5f0c-8d28-29ed9c0ed89b,

Shipments of Produce Increasing,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/28/archives/export-purchases-of-produce.html,Shipments of Produce Increasing,"-- Very considerable purchases of cotton, flour, wheat, tobacco, tallow and other leading articles of domestic produce have been made in this market within a few days, in execution of foreign orders, or for shipment to foreign markets. These purchases have added materially to the supply of commercial bills of sterling exchange, and led to a reduction of the price of such bills to a rate which precludes the possibility of any immediate profitable shipments of specie. They thus tend directly to check the export demand for gold, and depress the premium, to the embarrassment and chagrin of the speculators for a rise, who really operate against the credit and currency of the country.

Co., Policy Warrant","John S. Steward vs. The Phoenix Insurance Company of Brooklyn. -- The plaintiff brought this action on a policy of insurance issued by the defendants on the 14th of May, 1860, whereby they promised and agreed to insure against loss or damage by fire to the extent fo $2,000. The property insured was a flouring-mill situated at Mackford. Marquette County, Wisconsin, and konwn as ""Mackford's Mills."" The building was four stories in height, built of stone, and the machinery propelled by water. On the 20th of May, 1860, six days after the insurance was effected, it took fire from some cause unexplained, and was entirely destroyed. Due notice was given to the company -- defendants in the action, who refused to pay, and thereupon plaintiff brought a suit. The complaint is in the usual form in such cases. The defendant's answer set up: 1. That by the policy and survey it appeared that plaintiff warranted that the supply of water for the mill was sufficient, with proper arrangements to supply the mill so that the machinery might be run constantly. Second, That plaintiff warranted the cash value of the property insured, including building and machinery, to be worth $10,000, when in fact it was not worth $4,000. Third, That plaintiff warranted the average value of wheat on store in the mill to lie $4,000, whereas the truth was it did not amount to half that sum. Fourth, That plaintiff warranted that the property insured was encumbered by mortgage to one J.P. Yelverton, whereas at the date of the policy there was no such encumbrance. Fifth. That plaintiff warranted that the above-named mortgagee had an insurance in the Peoples' Insurance Company, to the extent of $3,000, whereas there was, no such insurance; and 6th, that plaintiff warranted that he had no reason to believe that the properly in question was in any danger of being burned by means of incendiaries, whereas, in fact, the plaintiff well knew at the time that there existed in that community a growing hostility to the mill, and to the manner in which it was managed; that there had been many angry disputes arising from the fact that much of the water used by the mill overflowed the lands lying adjacent, and which were owned by a large number of persons.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title; Important to Insurance Companies What Constitutes a Warranty in a Policy.

WILKINSON was put on the stand, and swore that he never signed the lease; did not know DONOHUE and was never in his office; STEELE swore that he saw WILKINSON sign the lease and identified him in Court. R.W. ANDREWS, Esq., a lawyer, also swore that he saw WILKINSON in DONOHUE's office; J.C. BLACHLEY, as agent of DONOHUE, swore that he served WILKINSON with the regular notice to pay the rent by leaving it with a person of mature age, and that he (WILKINSON) afterward acknowledged to him that he had received the notice. The justice gave the case to the jury who rendered a verdict in favor of the landlord. Whereupon plaintiff made the necessary affidavit of willful and corrupt perjury against WILKINSON who was committed to jail for examination.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a6694f1-6e33-52b3-92e5-c6ce0aac57dc,361,nyt://article/5a6694f1-6e33-52b3-92e5-c6ce0aac57dc,

Most of the vacant Sees are to be filled by their former occupants, who are not to be required to take an oath of allegiance to the King. The vacancies caused by the refusal of certain Bishops to return to their ecclesiastical duties under the Government of Italy are to be filled by others. And from this latter class, we presume, the King will be entitled to exact an oath of fidelity. If not, we can hardly see what his title as ""King of Italy"" practically comes to. The old Bishops, who served under the Bourbons, may possibly have some claim to be relieved from the duty of taking an oath of fealty to the Savoy dynasty. But the new incumbents cannot well claim any such exemption, unless they claim likewise to found for Italy an imperium in imperio.

Nearly the entire population of Nevada and Colorado are of the male sex, and now that they have got houses and cities, and wealth of silver and gold, they are anxious beyond measure for the society and help of women. Neither wives nor servants can be had, though both have unequaled opportunities. The Rocky Mountain News, of the 14th instant, in very plaintive on the subject, and is also practical. It declares that women will find in that country the ""Utopia of their dreams."" If husbands are desired, they can be had at leisure; and if they wish to engage in household employment, they can quickly acquire fortune. In the populous Territory of Colorado, we are told, ""there is scarce one woman where six could and would be profitably employed if they could be obtained.

On that occasion the Atlantics found that the difficulty of punishing MARTIN's pitching was rather greater than they or their friends had anticipated. The result being that they were put out for a smaller score in the first five innings of the game, than their full nine had been in any previous match since 1860, when the Excelsior placed them hors du combat for a total of four runs only in a full game. Yesterday the Mutuals put in an appearance in a match for the first time this season, their opponents being the self same Empire nine who had so ably acquitted themselves against the champion Atlantics the week previous. Of course the desire to witness the play of the most prominent of the opponents of the champions, in their first game of the season, and also to see how far the Mutuals would succeed in batting MARTIN's pitching, led to an immense gathering of spectators at the Elysian Fields yesterday, every ferry-boat from 1 to 3 P.M. being crowded, and every car and carriage filled to its utmost capacity.

Did the governmental revenue depend solely on the patriotism and good faith of the poorer classes of the community, there would be little need of assessors and indeed it is but fair to assume that had the wording of the original law been clear and explicit, very much of the present conflict of opinion and prospective litigation might have been avoided. During the first years of the law's operation, when intensest patriotism stirred the majority of Northern hearts, when the entire people urged a vigorous prosecution of the war, there was little need of official prompting at external pushing, but it is natural now, when the war is closed, when people look for a return to the channels of trade, when necessity demands a rigid scrutiny of every expenditure, that men should look carefully to their legal rights, being willing to pay to the government all that it is entitled to, but being equally tenacious of their own interests. Judge LEWIS, the commissioner, has been taxed with labors which few men could bear. He was embarrassed by the lack of perspicuity in the law, pestered by continual protests from the people, hampered by the conflict between the wording and the spirit of the act, and compelled to decide day in and day out questions of vast importance to the mercantile community, pending the consideration of which piles of documents from every quarter of the country accumulated on his desk. That honest men should be discouraged and rogues emboldened by such a state of affairs, is not to be wondered at.

JOE JOHNSTON, and other prominent Southern men, have lately proclaimed their continued adhesion to the doctrines of State sovereignty and secession, we are not troubled about it. Thousands of men in the South will continue to hold these doctrines as long as they live, and there will be believers in them in the next generation. War, in its action and issues, may forcibly change institutions and overthrow theories in their practical development; but it does not always eradicate from the minds of these who have been defeated by it, the theoretical convictions of a life-time -- convictions which they may have received in youth an which have been strengthened by the experiences of their maturity. Even to this day there are people in Great Britain who uphold the claims of the Stuart dynasty, and the memory of Prince CHARLEY lives in song and story. So in France, there are believers in in the divine right of the BOURBONS rule; and the Ex-King of Naples has aristocratic adherents near the throne of VICTOR EMANUEL.

He had no plan, no better way, no platform -- no nothing; he was evidently quite adrift, without rudder or compass, without purpose or destination, and with only enough recollection of the past to remember that it is the one solitary inalienable privilege of the minority to be dissatisfied, and especially the duty of the Democratic party to abuse the other side, their men, their principles, their purposes and their acts on all occasions, and under all circumstances. The few Kentuckians who came to listen to the voice of wisdom speaking from the lips of experience, heard only the common-place growling of a politician behind the age; one who insists on shutting his eyes at midday, and declaring that it is pitch dark.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DRIFTING ABOUT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DRIFTING ABOUT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6057b106-2bdc-5928-a63a-dccd5e2616f2,261,nyt://article/6057b106-2bdc-5928-a63a-dccd5e2616f2,

The proposed undertaking was intended to illustrate in a literary and artistic way the labors of one of the Council committees in connection with the obsequies of the late President. This work, however well conceived, His Honor considered to be uncalled for, on account of the expense, and the limited number of paying subscribers, or non-paying readers that might be attracted by its publication. In that view we had the happiness of agreeing, and in these columns expression was given to the hope that the Mayor himself might be asked to edit, in his usual felicitous style, a record of the events referred to, which might form a popular edition, so to speak, of the intended heavier and more exhaustive work of the Council. These hopes have been frustrated. The Council having once entered the literary arena in a body, refuse to be driven therefrom by any such rival as the Chief Executive of the city. The work is to proceed. Twenty-five thousand copies are ordered.

L. Letters on European Social Reforms. London--Its Organization","If one were to search about through England for the modern ""chivalry"" of the kingdom, one would not find it among the titled and lordly, though among these are many ""true knights,"" but especially in that great vigorous middle class from which the best of modern England comes. In this powerful class may be found men who have consecrated themselves to a life-long crusade against the great enemies of modern society, who are fighting a heroic battle each day against ignorance and prejudice and vice and disease and death. It is these men of the true Anglo-Saxon pluck and pertinacity, never disheartened by defeat or disaster, never wearied out by the marvelous stupidity of the public they are seeking to benefit, who have covered England with the remarkable sanitary improvements and institutions of education and reform, which have so marked English progress during the last ten years. It is they who are under-draining damp and pestiferous cities, removing cess-pools -- those nests of disease -- banking up rivers, carrying off the vile sewerage, till it becomes a new source of fertility; destroying the old and picturesque houses, which are such homes of fever and crime; widening the narrow lanes, where guilt and misery have so long crouched. They struggle with the ""death-rate"" and the ""average of crime,"" as the old knights of chivalry struggled with the robbers and oppressors of their time. They do incessant battle against the dragons of ignorance and vice, as their forefathers did against the dragons of the wilderness and the infidel Paynim. It is they who provide the poor with pure water; who continually press legislation on a dull and unwilling public, which shall lessen the frightful evils of overcrowding. They analyze the food of the masses, and the air which they breathe; they show the poison which lie in wait for the health of the ignorant, they battle against the nuisances of the large cities, and relieve their thronged streets by the underground railroads. They erect baths and abattoirs, and urinals, and model lodging-houses; they build the mighty sewers which carry off the drainage of towns to fertilize new fields, instead of poisoning the rivers; they erect schools and reformatories and refuges without number; they have their missions for the women, for the men, for the boys and the girls; they care for the thieves, for the beggars, the outcast women, and the little ""Arabs of the street."" And in smaller palaces, they can point you out the trophies of victory. In Salisbury, they show you the death-rate reduced from 27 in 1,000 before 1856 to 20 in 1,000 since that year, by a wise and efficient system of drainage; and in the close from 20 in 1,000 to 14, which is one of the lowest rates in England.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LETTERS ON EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; Sanitary Reforms-London Its Organization.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LETTERS ON EUROPEAN SOCIAL REFORMS.; Sanitary Reforms-London Its Organization.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-06-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cfc24d5-8cc3-5133-b4e0-69f8cb48da56,1317,nyt://article/8cfc24d5-8cc3-5133-b4e0-69f8cb48da56,

From the commencement of the innings up to the time when the call of ""dinner"" put a temporary stop to the proceedings, a very fine display of cricket was shown, especially by Messrs. GIBBES, BAMBRIDGE, H.

The bowling was good in two or three instances, especially that of GEORGE WRIGHT, but as a general thing it was not up to the high mark shown in the match of the previous week. The Philadelphians missed the valuable services of GEORGE NEWHALL and BARCLAY in this match both in batting and bowling. The second innings of the St. George terminated with a score of 152, which with that of the first innings made their grand total 271. At 3:10 the Philadelphians went into their second innings to get 197 to win.

Buckhardt vs. The New-York & Erie Railway Company. -- This action was brought by the plaintiff, a German, who, by the way, understands very little of the English language, for the purpose of recovering the sum of about $1,119, which is the alleged value of property destroyed under the following circumstances: Sometime about the middle of November, 1864, the plaintiff undertook to convey himself and his effects from Cincinnati, Ohio, to the City of New-York, by way of the Little Miami and the New-York and Erie Railway. His effects consisted of boxes and packages, containing furniture and wearing apparel. The testimony went to show that, at Cincinnati, Ohio, the goods in question were committed to the care of the common carriers, to be by them transported to New-York. At that time there was a written or printed agreement, and entered into between the plaintiff and the railroad company, that ran its trains to connect with the Erie Railroad, in which agreement it was particularly specified that none of the proprietors of the lines would be liable for the loss or damage by fire of any goods while in transitu. This agreement or contract had no United States revenue stamp upon it, as is required by law. The property in question was safely transported to Dunkirk, the western terminus of the New-York and Erie Railway, and by the latter company it was put aboard their cars, bound to New-York the place of destination. On the route the goods in question took fire, and were destroyed at a station known as Callicoon. The defendants allege that the fire occurred without any negligence or want of care on their part. The written or printed contract, made at Cincinnati, between the plaintiff and the common carriers, was set forth in the complaint, but it did not appear that the clause therein relating to the non-liability of the defendants in case plaintiff's goods were destroyed by fire, was soon by the plaintiff, or that he knew anything about it. This stipulation, or proviso, was printed in small letters in the middle of a printed and formal paper.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Court Calendar This Day.
