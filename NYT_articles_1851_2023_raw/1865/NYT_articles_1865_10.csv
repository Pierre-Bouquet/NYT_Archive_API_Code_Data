Baptism of Children by A bert Pike,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/01/archives/interesting-masonic-ceremony-baptism-of-six-children-by-albert-pike.html,Baptism of Children by A bert Pike,"Last evening, one of the most interesting, and, at the same time, novel ceremonies, connected with Free Masonry, was performed in Masonic Hall, Thirteenth-street, near Fourth-avenue, by the Thrice Potent Grand Master of the Scottish rite, ALBERT PIKE, late General in the rebel army, the Senior Warden being Gen. J.H. HOBART WARD, late of the union army. It consisted of the baptism of six children, ranging from six months to eight years of age, according to the Masonic ritual. This being the first time this ceremony was performed at the North a large number of Masons, with their wives, daughters, sons, &c., were present, so that the lodge-room was crowded. The ceremony took place in a Lodge of Perfection which was opened publicly. In the east on a platform were placed a font filled with oil, a vessel of consecrated oil, and a plate of salt. All being ready two lines were formed consisting of a guard with drawn swords facing inwards and the officers and members of the Grand Lodge of Perfection entered in procession to the music of a grand march by the organ. After several alarms the parents and children entered with the godfather and godmothers, the latter dressed in white; the children who were unable to walk were carried on a cushion covered with blue silk, by the master of ceremonies; after him came a brother carrying the lighted candles, black, white and rose color in the form of a triangle, while the choir sang the chant ""Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, Thou hast perfected praise."" Then came the other children, two by two, then the fathers and mothers. The procession went three times round the lodge-room, the organ playing, and the chant still proceeding, while the Master and Wardens repeated certain sentences, the mystic sentence commencing ""Suffer little children to come unto me,"" &c. After questions asked of the fathers and answered by them, the children were brought to the front and an impressive prayer offered up by Bro. WILSON SMALL, as Grand Chaplain. This was followed by a hymn, and the Master informed the godfathers and godmothers of their duty, while the Orator in the North, the Senior and Junior Wardens, admonished them and their parents to be true to themselves, to others, to their country and to God. Another prayer was then offered, and the children were brought to the altar.

Submit the question of the choice of a profession to a class in our public schools, and you would certainly find in it more aspirants for the bar than for the surgery, and possibly more for the pulpit than the bar. The reason for this is obvious. It is a sad thing to behold human suffering, and sadder when, in order to relieve it, the impassive operator is compelled to add to its poignancy before he can apply those remedies which will give ease to the patient. It is the same with the moral as with the physical reformer. To guage misery and plumb the depths of crime is not a pleasant, but a very necessary duty. It is far from agreeable to be compelled to stun the ears of the gay and busy throng with long lists of human wretchedness, and their natural concomitants, startling records of human guilt. Doubtless there are many who deprecate the policy of publishing such statistics, and some who consider the press itself as an aider and abettor of the very evils it searches out and exposes; while not a few tender-hearted people shudder at their recital, like wounded men shrinking from the requisite but sharp brobing of the skillful surgeon.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Modern Reformer and His Duties.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Modern Reformer and His Duties.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3ab94f29-e51d-55e7-a3a0-b2b8c4f26f9a,727,nyt://article/3ab94f29-e51d-55e7-a3a0-b2b8c4f26f9a,

The Owyhee Silver Mines of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/01/archives/the-owyhee-mines.html,The Owyhee Silver Mines of,"In the southwestern portion of Idaho Territory, some twenty miles from the right bank of Snake River, in the depressions and along the ridges of the Owyhee Mountains, are located the richest and most valuable silver mines yet known to the world. It is but recently, to speak comparatively, that these discoveries have been made, and already the primitive wilderness is changed to the abode of civilization and the theatre of that active life pertaining to the business of mining. Already three growing towns -- Booneville, Ruby City and Silver City -- are the flourishing points of profitable traffic. Some half dozen quartz mills are crushing the ore and sending forward their silver bricks to swell the aggregate of the wonderful and manifold productions of our common country. It is necessary that the great centres of commerce and capital on the Atlantic side of the continent should be better informed in reference to a section of country of so much consequence as the Owyhee mines. The productions of a country constitute the chief source of its wealth and prosperity. In the United States, more than any other country, and now more than at any other time, it is essential to encourage all industrial pursuits, and none more so than those which are promoted by the means of intelligent labor -- to develop every resource, that the revenues of the government may be drawn from every available quarter, so that our system of taxation may not be felt to be burdensome and oppressive. Mining is now among the most important interests of our country, and it will not be very long before our mineral products will. equal in value those obtained from agriculture. The Owyhee country is a vast treasury, which only requires the judicious investment of a small amount of capital, in addition to what is there already, to establish the magnitude of its richness and make it available to the world. Unlike ail other mining countries the valleys of the Ouohhee are exceedingly fertile and productive; even the summits of the mountains are covered with nutritious grasses. Groves of excellent timber, fir and pine chiefly, well adapted to the wants of the population, abound throughout that region. The water courses are abundant and constantly supplied by innumerable overflowing springs, which form the sources of the Owyhee River. The quartz mines are principally within an area of six miles long and four miles wide. The lodes have a common direction, tending North and South, and crop out boldly on the surface, so that in some instances they have been traced for a great distance. The vein matter varies from two to ton feet in width. The surface rock contains pay ore, some of which it is not uncommon to find yielding forty dollars to the ton. Free gold, in considerable quantities, is contained in the ore of a great many of the lodes, although disappearing at certain depths in the shafts, when the lode presents a body of distinct silver ore -- generally in the form of chlorides. Very often large doposits of polybasite -- which is as pure silver ore as can be obtained, being from seventy to eighty per cent. silver -- are struck in the shafts and drifts, even at no greater depth than sixty feet. Among the choice lodes may be named the ""War Eagle,"" ""Silver Legion,"" ""Florida,"" ""Morning Star,"" ""Potosi,"" and ""Oro Fino."" The one reduced at the mills has yielded results varying from two hundred and fifty to five hundred dollars per ton, and the average value of ore thus reduced has been upwards of one hundred and fifty dollars to the ton. The country is rapidly filling up with an active, industrious and enterprising population, giving substantial evidence of its worth in the gradually augmenting treasure which each steamer semi-monthly brings to impart additional consequence to every department of our trade.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Owyhee Mines.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Owyhee Mines.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Idaho', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6fedffa3-3ed0-5db6-be5c-2ef959f15ee0,648,nyt://article/6fedffa3-3ed0-5db6-be5c-2ef959f15ee0,

Mr. WM. MCGILL, the company's clerk, promptly laid the facts before Capt. JOURDAN, and that officer, knowing JOHNSON as a person who had served in State Prison for a like offence, went in search, but did not find him until Friday afternoon. JOHNSON, meantime, is alleged to have been in Messrs. AUGUST BELMONT & CO.'s banking-office, on Thursday afternoon, and to have stolen from their counter a package containing fourteen $1,000 and twenty-two $500 five-twenty bonds. The prisoner was taken to court on Friday afternoon, and Mr. WILLIAM F. HOWE, his counsel, claimed his release, saying that not only was there no evidence against him, but that no person had seen the money and bonds stolen by anybody. Mr. SEWARD pressed the charge, claiming that the magistrate should hold the accused for examination; and he was so held. He was examined on the charge of stealing $25,000 from Messrs.

In striking contrast to the race at Sing Sing last Monday, a large number of ladies were present, who seemed to enjoy themselves wonderfully, and added greatly to the delights of the race.

The difficulty appears to be that Mr. Bull cannot yet strike out a plan by which he can at once neglect the children and diminish the crime. As to fullfil both these requirements is a manifest impossibility, the meeting held in London on Monday, Sept. 4, came to no conclusion on the subject. Dr. CLARKE, the orator of the same, after stating that he had received above a thousand letters, some of which contained valuable suggestions, contented himself with negativing the proposition for establishing foundling hospitals with revolving baskets, ""because they tended to increase immorality."" He forgot that the lack of them operated to increase murder. But the true reason, it is surmised, was not that they would tend to increase immorality, but that they would eventually tend to increase the poor rates, which is a crime even worse than murder in that pauper-ridden country. The bewilderment, meantime, of poor Mr. Bull, continues to increase in a manner which, if it wore not horrible, would be ridiculous. He appears to be as lost in regard to what should be done in the crisis, as Mr. Toot was when the question was put to him, ""Sir, in the case of a war with Russia, what are you to do with your raw materials?"" It is almost a pity Mr. Bull is not a cannibal Mr. Toot's answer follows so readily, ""Cook em, Sir, cook em."" It will be remembered that Dean SWIFT solved a difficulty in the case of Irish babies in a similar manner. But we respectfully inform Mr. Bull we do not indorse such suggestions, for there is a diabolical doubt, that in his present state of excitement, he might be induced by us to carry out so very practical a solution of his present dilemma.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Glances into the Pit.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Glances into the Pit.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f6fecfdf-9f80-5421-be28-3a8f2cdef90b,1205,nyt://article/f6fecfdf-9f80-5421-be28-3a8f2cdef90b,

There are to be two buildings, the main edifice, and a smaller one in the rear, in which are to be the cells and lodgers' apartments. The dimensions of the main building are: 32x56 feet, and three stories high. The stories of the front building are as follows: First story, 12 feet; second, 11 feet; third, 10 feet 6 inches. The rear: First story, 10 feet 6 inches; second, 10 feet. On the first floor of the front building there are to be a muster room, Captain's private office, Captain's sleeping room, two rooms for the sergeants, a sitting room for the men, and a bathroom. The stories above are to be devoted for sleeping rooms. The main building is of brick, with brownstone trimmings, and a cupola is to surmount the whole. The house is to have all modern improvements. There are to be ten rooms on the first floor of the rear building, and on the first floor of the second, the lodgers' apartments. When completed the whole will cost $18,367. Mr. HILL, is the architect, Mr. HANNIGAN, a veteran in his trade, is the mason, and Mr. ALLEN, well known in the construction of the station houses, is the carpenter.

Magazines for October,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/02/archives/the-magazines-for-october.html,Magazines for October,"-- Harpers' New Monthly Magazine (New-York, HABPER & BROTHER) comes before us this month, with the same general style and contents, or intellectual physiognomy, as it may be called, rendered familiar by the experience of many previous appearances; adventure, fiction and recent history, are all well represented in its pages -- the first by an interesting article, ""Down in the Cinnabar Mines,"" descriptive of the mineral and metallic workers of New Almaden, the great mercury yielding district of California. It is well illustrated, and the writer is extremely well ""posted up,"" as the visit it records was made during the present year. The paper most important in its relation to late events and the truth of future history, is undoubtedly ""Jefferson Davis,"" a searching examination of that gentleman's claim to ability and statesmanship, by Gen. JORDAN, late Chief of Staff to Gen. BEAUREGARD, in the Confederate service. Some of the facts it relates are, as might be expected, new to us in this part of the country; the general argument is well sustained, and the conclusions pressed home -- showing with a force that is difficult to resist how much the arch rebel has been overrated in every point of view, and how easily at a distance, the acrid and petty obstinacy of a narrow mind is mistaken for heroic firmness of will and stability of purpose. ""Sherman's Great March"" is an abstract of Major NICHOL's book, with characteristic embellishments. WILKIE COLLINS continues what a critic will call his ""Chinese puzzle.""

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/02/archives/coroners-inquests-soldier-found-dead-in-dyckmans-woods-by-coroner.html,,"On Friday afternoon Policemen KING and HAYDEN, of the Thirty-second Precinct, found the body of a soldier in the woods near old Fort George, at One Hundred and Ninety-ninth-street. In the pockets they found a discharge paper, dated ""Delancey House, D.C., July 28, 1865,"" and indicating that the bearer had been a corporal in Capt. VICTOR PRAXMARER's Company, of the Forth-sixth New-York Veteran Volunteers, and that he was a native of Amsterdam, Hol[???] HENRY VAN NIEROP by name, 44 years of age, [???]persmith. Finding the throat apparently cut, and a razor in the deceased's pockets, the officers argued that he had cut his throat and deliberately put his razor away while his life's blood was ebbing; but Dr. WOOSTER BEACH, Jr., who made a postmortem examination on Saturday, found that the soldier's throat had not been cut, and could not find conclusive evidence of suicide. The corpse was so much decomposed that it was impossible to determine whether there had been any internal wounds, and the gash which the officers had mistaken for a cutting of the throat was a jagged wound extending from the mouth to the ear. Two pools of blood were visible within twenty feet of the spot where the body was found, and in the soldier's pockets was an empty bottle; and from these facts it may be inferred that while inebriated the soldier may have attempted suicide and perished from hemorrhage.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Coroners' Inquests.; SOLDIER FOUND DEAD IN DYCKMAN'S WOODS.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/02/archives/newjersey-union-meeting-at-caldwell-nj-old-hudson-county-courts.html,,"GRAND DEMONSTRATION AT ELIZABETH -- SPEECHES BY GEN. HITE AND OTHERS. -- A very large and enthusiustic meeting was held on Saturday evening, at Library Hall, Elizabeth. The hall was densely packed with a very respectable and appreciative audience, a great many ladies being present. The national colors were tastefully suspended from the sides of the building, and several banners bearing curious devices, such as, ""WIRZ is no 'Fellow-citizen' of Ours,"" were on and around the platform. A fine brass band was in attendance, and discoursed some very excellent music. The meeting was called to order by A.J. CRANE, Esq., at 8 o'clock, and Hon. JOHN DAVIDSON was the first speaker who was introduced. He spoke in a very numerous and interesting manner for about one hour, holding the audience at one time in a rapture of thought, and at other times bursting out in raptures of applause. The constitutional amendment he advocated in very strong terms, and exposed the fallacy of the platform of the Democratic party, who he denounced as traitors in the strongest terms. The ""stone of the corner"" as he termed New Jersey, which was rejected, is, on the 1st of November, to be made the ""chief stone of the corner."" He described in flowery terms the valor and patriotism of the New-Jersey troops who fought in the late war, many of whom were present and appreciated all he said. His speech throughout was one of those spirit-stirring and eloquent appeals which never fail to produce a lasting conviction. At the conclusion of his remarks the band struck up a national air. Gen. HITE was then presented to the audience, whom he kept in a continual roar of laughter by the recitation of his comic anecdotes. The Copperheads he denounced as the worst enemies of the Union, for to save him he did not know where to place them, whether as rebels or as Union men; they were like the nigger on the fence -- one time for the Union, and at another time for the rebels. He spoke at length of the character and services of Gen. ROSSEAU, whom he hoped the audience would have the pleasure of listening to before this campaign was over. Ask this man, said he, what he would do with these men who remained up North, grumbling, afraid to go and fight -- talking of the constitutional measures and other matters, instead of fighting to save their country, and he would say to you, I would send them among their fellow-citizens down South. In referring to the sympathy which the Democrats professed to the soldiers, he said, soldiers, How many times were you allowed to vote while in camp? Ah! not at all. No; but you were denounced as Lincoln hirelings and had no right to vote. These Democrats say they are not in favor of negro suffrage, but are in favor of all other kinds of suffrage. Well, we are not. How would you like rebel suffrage? [Sensation.] Now this is the only State which has not accepted the constitutional amendment, and so long as the people of this State reject progression, so long will they lag in the progress of science, art and manufacture. For God when he made this nation, made it to work; and he made this government to carry out the principles of virtue and morality. The government tried to put down a rebellion, and still were willing to continue the accursed institution of slavery; and no victory was ever gained worth mentioning until the proclamation of emancipation came. But after that it was victory and success every step of the way. [Applause.]",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW-JERSEY.; UNION MEETING AT CALDWELL, N.J. Old HUDSON COUNTY COURTS.

"-The Sentinel, published at Jacksonville, Oregon, of the 12th ultimo, says: ""Several of our citizens returned last week from a visit to the Great Sunken Lake, situated in Cascade Mountains, about 75 miles northeast from Jacksonville. This lake rivals the famous valley of Sinbad the Sailor. It is thought to average 2,000 feet down to the water all round. The walls are almost perpendicular, running down into the water, and leaving no beach. The depth of the water is unknown, and its surface is smooth and unruffled, as it lies so far below the surface of the mountain that the air currents do not affect it. Its length is estimated at twelve miles, and its breadth at ten. There is an island in its centre having trees upon it. No living man ever has, and probably never will, be able to reach the water's edge. It lies silent, still and mysterious in the bosom of the 'everlasting hills,' like a huge well, scooped out by the hands of the giant genii of the mountains, in the unknown ages gone by, and around it the primeval forests watch and ward are keeping. The visiting party fired a rifle several times into the water, at an angle of forty-five degrees, and were able to note several seconds of time from the report of the gun until the ball struck the water.

His appearance was the occasion for a burst of applause, so hearty and kindly in its nature that it was apparent it came from those who remembered his previous triumphs, and were glad to see him back to win others. The reception, if it may be dignified by the name, was quite flattering, and somewhat unusual. New-York as a rule is decidedly ungrateful to to its favorites.

Account of his Violent Death,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/03/archives/the-death-of-yancey.html,Account of his Violent Death,"WM. L. YANCEY came to his end by violence. It was toward the close of the second session of the first Confederate Congress that he broke from the counsels and influence of Mr. DAVIS, and became, with Mr. HENRY S. FOOTE, a leader of the opposition. Mr. BEN. HILL, a Senator from Georgia, had likewise changed his front, and was remarkable for the earnestness, personal interest and persistency with which he sustained the measures of an administration to which his allegiance had been given but late in the day. Mr. YANCEY, it will be remembered, had returned from an unsuccessful mission to Europe, and was representing Alabama in the Confederate Senate. The question of a navy was under discussion in secret session. The debate ranged beyond the parliamentary limits, and Messrs. YANCEY and HILL became animated over the abstract doctrines of State rights and the divinity of slavery. High words passed, and finally the lie was given by Mr. HILL. Mr. YANCEY leaned forward, and as he aimed a blow at his adversary, was caught in the arms of the latter, and thrown violently back over a desk. Mr. HILL is a man of wonderful muscular development. Mr. YANCEY was never very heavy, though lithe and active. In the fall, his spine was seriously injured, and when the bystanders rushed upon the two and drugged the one from the other, the great fire-eater lay unconcious upon the floor, with a little trickle of blood oozing from his lips. He was carried to his hotel a vote of secrecy was passed, and the encounter hushed up. No one in Richmond except that body of men knew of the circumstance for six months after. Meanwhile the victim did not recover. He drooped from day to day. He became listless, hopeless and vacant. He was transferred to his own home, where his convulsions ceased a few weeks before his death, which was tranquil and calm. -- Nashville Banner.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DEATH OF YANCEY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DEATH OF YANCEY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38191d58-c2ce-5c6c-9b21-dea1f1b76970,325,nyt://article/38191d58-c2ce-5c6c-9b21-dea1f1b76970,

Sale vs. Sun Insurance Co. Marine Insurance,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/03/archives/important-marine-insurance-case-superior-court-part-ii-trial-term.html,Sale vs. Sun Insurance Co. Marine Insurance,"William A. Sale and others vs. the Sun Mutual Insurance Company. -- The trial of this action was commenced yesterday in the Superior Court, before Justice BARBOUR. The amount of money involved is not very large, being between three and four thousand dollars, but there are some principles of law in the case which if they are not, ought to be settled as between marine insurers and the insured. The facts are briefly as follows: In the Summer of 1863, the plaintiffs effected an open policy of insurance on goods to be shipped from the port of Matamoras to the port of New-York, by a vessel known as the brig Trade Wind. There were some other marine insurance companies that took risks on the same vessel and cargo, but their names do not appear, and for a proper adjudication of the questions involved, it is not material that they should. The defendants are charged with having insured one-third of the cargo, and about this there is no dispute. About the 6th of August, 1863, the Trade Wind was loaded with cotton and sailed soon after from the port of Matamoras for the port of New-York. The plaintiffs had upon her one hundred and sixty-six bales. When the brig arrived off Cape Lookout, she was overtaken by a storm, and during the stress of weather a portion of the cargo was wholly lost. The plaintiffs lost eleven bales. The remainder of their one hundred and sixty bales, was at length brought on to New-York, and sold at public auction on the 9th and 17th days of October of the same year. On the 9th of October, sound cotton was selling in New-York at 92 cents per pound, and on the 17th at 90 cents. The price at which it was valued at Matamoras, where it was shipped about three months before, was 65 cents per pound. A large portion of the plaintiff's cotton, which was brought on to New-York, could not be identified with certainty, for the reason that, owing to the water getting into the vessel and among the bales, the bags or sacks that held the cotton burst, and much of it had to be overhauled and resacked, or else brought on here in a loose state. There appears to be no dispute about the bales which could be identified after their arrival here; but the plaintiffs claim they are entitled to $8,351 37 from the defendants, on the general average. The defendants, on the other hand, insist that they are only liable for $5,225 07, as their proportion, and this amount they are willing to pay, with interest since the liability accrued. The questions in the case are considered important, as regards the value of insured goods at the place of shipment and at the port of destination, and also in respect of the fall or advance in the price of merchandise sold at public auction under the circumstances this cotton was at the time. The trial will be continued to-day, when the facts will be more fully developed, and the law governing such cases more fully stated by the court.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Important Marine Insurance Case.; SUPERIOR COURT PART II.

No solid ground is now left save what relates to the freedmen. The renewed loyal spirit of the Southern people has so distinctly manifested itself through these conventions and other public channels, that the North can no longer doubt it, and none of our representatives in Congress will seriously impugn it. The question that will be made is not whether the late rebels have sincerely returned to their allegiance to the government, but whether they mean to do justice to that race whom circumstances have made the wards of the government. If it can be shown that no such justice is done or intended, the restoration of the Southern States to their full civil capacity will be contested strenuously, and, in all likelihood, effectually. The rehabilitation of the Status involves a remission to them of all their old municipal power over all within their limits, white and black; and the government must find some kind of security in advance, express or implied, that this power will not be abused to the harm of the freedmen.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Progress of Reconstruction.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Progress of Reconstruction.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/729078a3-c2d5-5441-b67d-97d182031ea4,966,nyt://article/729078a3-c2d5-5441-b67d-97d182031ea4,

"It is barely possiblethat this trial will load to more important developments than have hitherto been suspected. The apparent impossibility of controverting the powerful array of facts adduced by the prosecution, seems to have compelled the defence to abandon their naturally direct course, and, while impliedly confessing judgment, undertake to show that Capt. WIRZ was not the responsible party. It is stated that this line of defence takes the extremely remote stand-point that the real responsibility for the maltreatment of our men at Andersonville, rests upon our own government, or at least upon the officers in charge of the exchange of prisoners, because of the suspension of exchanges during 1863-64. Should this style of defence be admitted, we may as well begin the trial anew, and commence the list of witnesses on one side with ANDREW JOHNSON and Secretary STANTON, and on the other with JEFFERSON DAVIS and Secretary SEDDON, and so go through the entire history of the exchange business. But we hardly think this course will be pursued; it would prove a two-edged sword, and smite backwards more effectively than forwards. The prosecution are not unwilling to admit reliable testimony of DAVIS' knowledge and participation in this fearful business, but we do not believe that the defenders of WIRZ are in any hurry to furnish it. It is too late for their client to turn State's evidence; his case is apparently hopeless; all the evidence on his side, thus far, is negative and worthless -- the witnesses ""did not see"" and ""did not hear."" Such testimony might be taken by the ream; but of what value can it be? -- proving a negative does not go far to disprove an affirmative.

The Secretary, therefore, (to use the language of the official notification,) gives notice to the holders of ""Certificates of indebtedness which mature before the 1st day of January next, of compound interest notes, and of one and two year Treasury Notes, of the readiness of this Department to give in exchange for them, to the extent of fifty millions of dollars, six per cent. Five-Twenty Year Bonds at three per cent. premium; that is to say, one hundred dollars of bonds for each one hundred and three dollars in certificates and notes; provided the conversion is made prior to the 1st day of November next. The bonds issued in exchange for such certificates and notes will bear an interest of six per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually in coin, upon the 1st days of May and November, and will be redeemable at the pleasure of the government after five years, and payable in twenty years from the 1st day of November, 1865.""

Nearly four hundred guests were present, among whom were Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Rev. Drs. Storrs, Cuyler, Leavitt, Irinee, Putnam, and Farley, Miss Phebe Cary, Hon. Moses F. Odell, Robt. Dale Owen, Ex-Mayor Hall, A.J. Spooner, Henry C. Bowen, and a fair representation of the editorial fraternity. The parlors were lavishly supplied with bouquets and baskets of choice flowers, presented by Messrs. CHITTENDEN, of Brooklyn, and HASKELL, of Llewellyn Park, N.J. The guests, as in duty bound, individually brought an offering of tin-ware, which, in the aggregate, seemed sufficient, when set out on the tables, to supply the wants of the happy couple in that peculiar line for life, and their children and grandchildren after them. Some of the gifts were quite elegant and beautiful, and there was such a variety of them that it almost appeared that the guests had consulted together to determine that no article should be duplicated. The evening was passed in a delightful manner, many happy hits being made by humorous persons in the company. An effusion by Miss PHEBE CARY was read by OLIVER JOHNSON, in which a witty play upon the word ""tin"" was introduced in easy verse, making much amusement. Letters were received from Dr. CHEEVER, Rev. SAMUEL J. MAY, EDNA DEAN PROCTOR, P.T. BARNUM, and others, regretting their inability to participate in the festivities, and expressive of an infinity of good wishes for the recipients.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d43e1d76-c5e5-5914-97e2-689b02134dfa,1256,nyt://article/d43e1d76-c5e5-5914-97e2-689b02134dfa,
First Message to General Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/04/archives/general-news.html,First Message to General Assembly,"Gov. BROWNLOW, of Tennessee, sent his first Message to the General Assembly yesterday. He recommends amendments and additions to the franchise law, but says: ""I am by no means an advocate of its repeal, nor do the loyal people of the State wish any sweeping change."" The restoration of civil law has worked well, and prosperity is promised in every section. Guilty rebels should be treated with severity, in proportion to their offences; the mass of them with not less than ten years' disfranchisement, and the leaders with neither mercy nor forbearance. He says: ""I am convinced that the white and colored people cannot live together, politically or socially, as equals."" He advocates the setting apart of some portion of the national territory, best adapted for the purpose, for a nation of freedmen. The testimony of negroes is recommended to be taken in the courts on the same basis as that of white persons.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ec644d91-6a2f-50ca-89ed-e7792476daa7,939,nyt://article/ec644d91-6a2f-50ca-89ed-e7792476daa7,

Alarming Increase of Price,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/05/archives/the-alarming-increase-in-the-price-of-coal-coal.html,Alarming Increase of Price,"-- At an auction of coal yesterday, by wholesale, the prices realized, convey an alarming intimation to the multitude of poor consumers, of the Winter prospect before them. The lowest rates at the sale were a fraction under $11 a ton. While a large quantity of stove coal went off at $12. The average increase since the middle of July is about $4 50 a ton. The purchasers yesterday seemed to thing themselves fortunate in making the bargain they did. It will not be much consolation for those who are still without their Winter supply, to learn that the subscribers to some of the mutual companies organized for the protection of consumers, can, to-day, lay in a full stock for the season at about $6 a ton. Such is the actual fact. And it is clear that the public have not been fully aroused to the necessity of meeting trade combinations by counter combinations. This coal question brings the matter of cooperation into strong relief.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ALARMING INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF COAL.; COAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ALARMING INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF COAL.; COAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Coal', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4e332d3f-4f58-55f2-a284-e3dd5582d994,165,nyt://article/4e332d3f-4f58-55f2-a284-e3dd5582d994,

This was certainly the case last evening when ""Ernani"" -- fullest blooded of all VERDI'S operas -- was played for the first time this season. We cannot remember to have heard the work better performed. The ensembles were admirable, and the singers without exception were in their best voice. Mlle. ZUCCHI, who so far has been under the weather, shone forth last evening in pristine splendor. Her voice was grand and profuse, and her acting perfectly fine. The new tenor Signor IRFRE appeared to great advantage in the title-role. He has a voice and style which improve rapidly on acquaintance, but we cannot help suggesting that if the gentleman would drag the time less frequently, it would not detract from the meritorious vigor and earnestness of his singing. Signor ANTONUCCI, as Silva, revealed the quality and capacity of his voice finely in the Infelice, which has not been sung so well since the best days of MARINI. The part of Don Carlos was sustained on the occasion by Signor MARRA, who made his first appearance, and achieved a marked and merited success. He has a fine baritone, full and sympathetic in quality, and of ample power even for the discouraging dimensions of the Academy -- which, by the way, he did not seem to estimate accurately, and in consequence slightly over-exerted himself to his own prejudice. Signor MARRA's style is large and dramatic, and his ease on the stage and in the delivery of his voice indicate that he has had abundant experience. The debut was a complete success -- perhaps the most prompt and unequivocal of the season.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73d69a62-d4ca-57bc-8f79-1702ef9e4d97,443,nyt://article/73d69a62-d4ca-57bc-8f79-1702ef9e4d97,

Mr. ROOSEVELT hoped that the board would not summarily expel those non-resident female pupils who are completing their course in the schools. Mr. MILLER thought that the board's action should be sweeping, inasmuch as these pupils, having graduated at the Grammar Schools, may claim admission to the Free Academy. The resolution was finally adopted by nineteen yeas, and no nays. The question of in the first and second grades of the Grammar Schools came up, and Mr. MILLER thought that the Eleventh and Thirteenth Wards were entitled to the additional teachers that would be required to teach these languages, the population of those wards being mainly of German descent.

"Doubtless one of the principal causes of the prominence given to the Fenian movement in the British press is the dearth of political or party excitement in other quarters.

The British press had usually a hard struggle with dullness during what the Saturday Review calls ""the silly season"" -- when Parliament is not in session, and when the most sensational features of the day's news are a four-column literary review in the Times, or an agricultural speech by a rural M.P. The election this year reduced the term of general stagnation by several weeks.

In the Summer of 1864, the Danish invasion furnished fresh matter of tragic interest every day for months. And overshadowing every other cotemporary event, there were the daily bulletins of the struggle in this country, sufficient alone, if intelligently discussed by the British and European press, to feed the utmost craving of the public appetite for news. All these extraneous sources of supply have now been drained out. The Gastein Convention, with its coolly barbarous disposition of the Principalities, does not supply the place in public interest of the butcheries at Duppel. And the progress of reconstruction in this country does not compensate for the loss of the war news budget sent hence by each Atlantic steamer. There is absolute dearth in every civilized quarter of the world where gleanings of news were formerly available for the British journalist. The Fenians, at such a juncture, have proved a god-send.

"David Tilton vs. James Murphy and Hugh Smith. -- The defendants, on the 3d day of January, 1863, were the owners of a certain line of stages, well known as the Wall-street Line. Early in the evening of that day, Mr. David Tilton was driving up Wall-street in his wagon, and, as the testimony showed, he was on the right hand side of the street, when, just as he crossed Broad-street, he was met by one of the defendants' stages, on the same side and going at a rapid rate. When the vehicles were quite near each other, the driver of the stage suddenly undertook to cross over, and, in doing so, the stage swung around, struck the plaintiff's wagon, upset it and throw plaintiff out. The result was that his shoulder was dislocated, and, as he claims, he was otherwise seriously injured in such a manner as to incapacitate him from attending to his usual avocations for a long time after. He now comes into court and claims damages against Messrs. Murphy & Smith for $5,000 for injuries he received in consequence of the gross and wanton recklessness of their driver. The facts as above stated, appeared from the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses. Plaintiff's counsel insisted that inasmuch as plaintiff was all the time on the right hand side of the street, it was clear that the accident occurred through no fault of his. The defendants' stage was on the wrong side, and when the driver saw that he was in danger of coming in collision, he undertook to get out of the plaintiff's way, in doing so he struck the wagon, and hence the damage to his client was caused. It was all the fault of the defendant's driver, he contended, and the plaintiff had come into court with clean hands.

Hughes's Atmospheric or Lightning Ore Stamp,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/06/archives/atmospheric-or-lightning-ore-stamp.html,Hughes's Atmospheric or Lightning Ore Stamp,"On Wednesday, a party of gentlemen interested in mining operations and the reduction of ores, assembled at CONDICT & CO.'s foundry, in Jersey City, to witness the operation of HUGHES' atmospheric or lightning ore stamp. The machine exhibited was of full working size, with two stamps of about twenty-five pounds weight each, attached to a piston moved up by a double cam, forcing them and the piston at the upper end into an atmospheric or air cylinder, the ascent of which produces a vacuum underneath the piston-head, which forces the stamp down with great velocity and power. By this means, 500 blows of 4,000 pounds each per minute are given, and with a steady and uniform motion, without the aid of a balance-wheel. The mortar is inclosed and detached from the main running gear, the stamps moving up and down in it through a groove. It is claimed that by the application of the atmospheric principle, a stamp of twenty-five pounds weight will give a more effective blow (by the velocity gained) than can be given by the ordinary stamp of six hundred pounds weight. The total weight of the Hughes stamp machine is but about 1,000 pounds, which is less than any other machine known; at the same time it does the work of an ordinary fine stamp mill with less than half the ordinary expenditure of power. A quantity of gold quartz was placed in the machine, and in a very short time it was turned out as an almost impalpable powder. It is claimed by the inventors that any known ore, including the stubborn ones of Colorado, can be reduced in the same manner. By the use of a fan blower, a current of air carries the particles as soon as reduced to a powder into a room or box, where they settle and are taken out without a particle of waste.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Atmospheric or Lightning Ore Stamp.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Atmospheric or Lightning Ore Stamp.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1c891291-a09a-5453-ac63-a4ee937a1313,434,nyt://article/1c891291-a09a-5453-ac63-a4ee937a1313,

Petty appeared in court and stated that the hackmen who had been arrested had violated the law, and that the proprietors of the Albany boats and others had applied to him to have the hackdrivers arrested if they persisted in leaving their coaches, crowding the piers and going on board of boats just arrived, for the purpose of soliciting patronage. Capt. Petty at the same time stated that these men had been repeatedly warned of the consequences of a violation of the law, and that their rights and liabilities had been especially impressed upon them.

"Public Schools, Overcrowd ng by Non-Residents",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/06/archives/the-public-schools-overcrowded.html,"Public Schools, Overcrowd ng by Non-Residents","-- TheBoard of Education have felt themselves justified in taking action against the crowding of the city public schools by the children of non-residents. It seems that pupils are sent to these schools from all the outlying suburban districts -- including Jersey City, Hoboken, Brooklyn, Williamsburgh, Morrisania and elsewhere -- and that in some cases special trains are run for their convenience. A vote of exclusion has been unanimously passed by the board; and we dare say their action may have been well considered, although it is altogether anomalous that a condition of things should exist requiring the public schools to be shut in the faces of any decently behaved children -- no matter where they come from. It is a question, moreover, whether a city tradesmandoing all his business within the city limits, paying his full share of the local taxes, and doing his entire duty generally as a citizen, can equitably be denied the right of sending his child to one of the city schools, merely because the overcrowding of houses on the island has driven him for the time into a suburban residence. We say there is a question of equity involved in this matter, which we trust the exigencies of their position have not compelled the board to overlook. It ought certainly to be regarded as a tribute to the excellence of our city schools that they are sought after by non-residents. And we doubt if the action of the board will not be keenly criticized by those immediately interested.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OVERCROWDED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OVERCROWDED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9bfc9ddf-8e1e-5280-bca9-4953672b8bf7,254,nyt://article/9bfc9ddf-8e1e-5280-bca9-4953672b8bf7,

Y.; Mrs. Virtue by Hack driver in Central Park,"JOHN FOLEY, a hackman, was arraigned before Justice KELLY, at the Fourth District Police Court, on Wednesday, on a charge of assaulting and robbing Mrs. CAROLINE VIRTU in Central Park, on Tuesday evening. The complainant, who resides at the corner of Clove and Atlantic avenues, Brooklyn, alleges that herself and a lady acquaintance employed FOLEY to drive them through Central Park. She also states that FOLEY gave her some drugged liquor, and that while partially insensible he attempted an indignity. Mrs. VIRTU screamed for help, and a Parkman arrested the accused. The complainant and accused were taken to the Nineteenth Precinct Station-house. Mrs. VIRTU was still suffering from the effects of the liquor she had drunk. On becoming composed, she informed Capt. HARTT that she had been robbed of two diamond rings and a gold watch and chain, valued in all at $575. None of the property was found on the prisoner. Mrs. VIRTU declined to make a charged against FOLEY. He was accordingly discharged, and then persistently demanded that he should be paid for driving the ladies through the park. In this, however, he was unsuccessful, and finally drove off. Although he had no proof against the hackman, Capt. HARTT believed he had stolen the property. He accordingly directed Officer VAN ARSDALE to follow him. The latter did so, and as FOLEY entered his stable at the corner of Fortieth-street and Second-avenue, he was arrested. The officer demanded the restoration of the property stolen from Mrs. VIRTU. FOLEY was startled at the demand, and immediately produced the watch, chain, and rings, which were identified by the owner.

Col. H. BEENY called the meeting to order, and Mr. ORLANDO L. STEWART was made Chairman. The Ex-Assistant District-Attorney said, [???], that, as it is important at this time that loyal men should have control of the Government of New-York, this meeting had been called as the initial of a series of ward meetings of citizens who desire that only loyal men should be chosen to office. Mr. JOSEPH B. VAERNUM, the first speaker, called the attention of the audience to the phenomenon of all the newspapers and politicians who were traitors during the war being the foremost supporters of the ticket which is called Democratic. Hon. FREDERICK A. CONKLING indorsed President JOHNSON's policy, but demanded that every black man who had fought in the Union army should be permitted to vote. Rev. WILLIAM H. BOOLE read the published appeal of the Mozart Democracy -- the men, he said, who during the war received the gold which was the price of the country's blood. That document cried ""Peace, peace,"" but there is no peace. The conflict for human freedom is not ended -- it is merely transferred from the field to the forum. The nomination, by the Syracuse Convention of Gen. SLOCUM, reminded him of the church which sought to hide its sins by employing a very good minister.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rousing Ratification Meeting in the Eighteenth Ward.; UNION MEN AND WOMEN OUT IN FORCE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rousing Ratification Meeting in the Eighteenth Ward.; UNION MEN AND WOMEN OUT IN FORCE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e2d99469-f65a-561a-8b59-3e36205c1fc6,811,nyt://article/e2d99469-f65a-561a-8b59-3e36205c1fc6,

"Trial, and Newspaper Writers as Witnesses",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/07/archives/newspaper-writers-as-witnesses.html,"Trial, and Newspaper Writers as Witnesses","The Judge-Advocate in the WIRZ trial seems to have cast grave reflections on the credibility of a witness, during the proceedings yesterday, on the ground that the witness in question was a correspondent of two New-York journals. There is no doubt that correspondents are sometimes liable to the suspicion of manufacturing reports which have no foundation. The ""reliable gentleman,"" for instance, who turns up every other night at Philadelphia or Cairo, after a confidential chat with Gen. GRANT, is one of those correspondents that we think Col. CHIPMAN would have good reason to impeach on the witness-stand or anywhere else. And the same, even in a greater degree, is true of the worthy who does the principal part of the fighting on the Rio Grande for the press of New-Orleans. But the bare fact of a witness having been known as a correspondent of a public journal ought not of itself, we should think, to invalidate his testimony, even in a military court. Perhaps Col. CHIPMAN has an experience different from journalists; but if the press were to apply his rule to the vast multitude who address themselves to it every day, the literal conclusion that ""all men are liars"" would be inevitable. In this matter, moreover, of the testimony for the defence of WIRZ, we think Col. CHIPMAN would best consult the public interests by giving the fullest scope to those who have anything to say in mitigation of the unparalleled crimes laid at the prisoner's door. The evidence is not laid before an ignorant or prejudiced jury, but before a court perfectly competent to weigh every separate item of testimony with judicial calmness and impartiality. Straining points to impeach the evidence of the defence is therefore unbecoming, to say the least.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEWSPAPER WRITERS AS WITNESSES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEWSPAPER WRITERS AS WITNESSES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9abf380e-ff41-5546-9ea7-d071300ea56b,293,nyt://article/9abf380e-ff41-5546-9ea7-d071300ea56b,

Its call upon the Postmaster-General and upon Congress, to provide a decent building for this branch of the public service, will meet with an emphatic response. The one now used is a disgrace to the city and a scandal to the government. There is not a fire-engine company, nor a police justice in this city that is not infinitely better accommodated, in the transaction of its business, than the Post-office Department of the General Government. A rickety old church, with cracked walls and decayed timbers, patched up in every quarter, with bare or fallen ceilings, cramped, crooked and dilapidated in every respect, is all that the National Government can afford for the transaction of the business that comes closest home to the people in the metropolis of the continent. The merchants have a granite palace which cost two millions for the payment of their custom duties, -- and the Sub-Treasurer has a marble building of equal splendor for their custody. But the mass of the people who go for their letters must hang around a tumble-down old church, which scarcely affords shelter from the rain to the crowd of clerks who are required to transact its business.

Expression of National Character in Crime,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/08/archives/expression-of-national-character-in-crime.html,Expression of National Character in Crime,"At a moment when crime seems epidemic throughout the world, when the European journals of every language vie with our own newspapers in contributing to the cotemporary history of violence, the observer of the dark side of human nature thus presented cannot fail to note the apparent assimilation of all nations in the methods and character of crime. Formerly it happened that the different peoples, living much in ignorance of each other, and made remote by the difficulties of travel, produced each a type of wickedness, which was Italian, or Spanish, or French, or English. But now poison is more resorted to in England than in Italy, and murder is done with Italian cunning and reticence; while in France crime is attended by many circumstances of sullen ferocity, which were once thought to characterize it chiefly in England. Has advancing civilization indeed created, with a community of blessings and comforts, a hideous community of crime, also, in which the old national characteristics are disappearing? Or are these characteristics merely repressed by the conventionalism which is varnishing the surface of human nature to one effect everywhere, and are they still to be developed by inquiry?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Expression of National Character in Crime.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Expression of National Character in Crime.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/42c3c012-94ae-59ff-aab9-fd247ae25b29,1416,nyt://article/42c3c012-94ae-59ff-aab9-fd247ae25b29,

DE LAMATER, of the Broadway police, and informed him that she had lost her wallet in that omnibus, Officer DE LAMATER bade her tarry near the corner while he overhauled the vehicle; he had, however, a spirited race with the stage, but captured it near Bleecker-street. Entering, he required whether any person had found a wallet. Nobody had. ""Then"" said he, ""permit me to search this vehicle;"" and the passengers having risen, he found a wallet under the feet of a gaudily-attired female. He returned to Mrs. GRAHAM and to his amazement learned that the wallet which he had recovered was not her property, and contained $20 more than hers, she having had only $30. A gas-bill in the wallet disclosed the owner's name, and he notified the lady yesterday afternoon; but under the Metropolitan Police rule the owner cannot get her property until it passes through the hands of the Police Property Clerk. That gentleman will restore it to her to-morrow morning. Officer DE LAMATER thinks that the female at whose feet he found the wallet had stolen two port-monnaies, and, on seeing him, dropped the one that he recovered, as a ruse to throw him of scent.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf1bfba6-49b7-5524-9388-941fbe2a9589,1512,nyt://article/cf1bfba6-49b7-5524-9388-941fbe2a9589,

HENDRICKSON, went on an excursion on Friday last, to Sing Sing, to visit the prison, taking the staunch little steamer Norwalk. They had a delightful sail on the Hudson, discussing all the principal places of literary and historical interest which they passed. The noble palisades, rearing their tall columnar forms like huge ramparts for miles along its western shore, furnished a peculiarly interesting topic for scientific instruction. These rocks, at all times picturesque and beautiful, are at this season of the year especially so; the mass of shrubbery which, in Summer, fringes many of them to their very crests with living green, is now fast assuming the gorgeous garniture of Autumn. Having been previously provided with a pass through the kindness of Judge JOHNSON, the courteous Superintendent of the prison, they experienced no delay in passing the guards. They were in time to see the convicts, over 800 in number, march in to dinner, some wearing the ball and chain, some the iron crown, and all in prison garb. They marched in regular order, their feet keeping time with a heavy tread, apparently as doleful as the hearts that beat above them. After dinner they visited the various workshops, and were greatly interested in several machines, one of which manufactures its own pegs, make its own holes and ""pegs a shoe in the twinkling of an eye."" They also visited the chapel, hospital and library, where they were introduced to Rev. Mr. LUCKEY, the venerable and distinguished chaplain of the prison, who addressed some pertinent remarks to the boys. In the female prison they were shown the nursery, where were several bright and handsome infants born since the incarceration of their mothers.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'School Excursion.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'School Excursion.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d25f6d8d-9cfb-5d44-b9d3-11c62cb4d198,312,nyt://article/d25f6d8d-9cfb-5d44-b9d3-11c62cb4d198,

Fletcher on a White Government,"-- We Wish that those gentlemen who take the trouble to give to the public the private remarks or opinions of distinguished public men, would be particularly careful to propagate accurate versions of such remarks or opinions. Incorrect reports not only injure the distinguished men who are their victims, but they mislead the community, and frequently give wrong directions to public sentiment. A prominent Eastern Abolitionist lately declared in a public speech that President JOHNSON, in a private conversation with the Governor of Missouri, made the remark: ""This is a white man's country, and while I am President it shall be a white man's government."" There is nothing particularly criminal about the remark in itself; but then it was not made by President JOHNSON to Gov. FLETCHER; and we are pleased that Gov. FLETCHER has taken the pains to set the matter right. He has authorized the statement that the President did not make the observation attributed to him, but as far as the Governor remembers, President JOHNSON used about the following words: ""I am in favor of the white man,"" or, ""I belong to the white man's party."" Those who think that the Governor has peformed an unimportant labor in rectifying this matter, or who think that the corrected version amounts to the same thing as the other, have paid little attention to politics, opinions, logic or language.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ae90e10-5e39-5e23-8068-6f8d0d7f8552,416,nyt://article/0ae90e10-5e39-5e23-8068-6f8d0d7f8552,

Vivisection of Canard about Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/09/archives/vivisection-of-a-canard.html,Vivisection of Canard about Mexico,"--The demolition of the villainous fiction attributing to Lieut.-Gen. GRANT the utterance of sundry wicked and foolish remarks concerning our Mexican relations, has been complete. We exposed its falsity from internal evidence as soon as it had got into print; but as the dispatch opened by announcing that its statements were ""established beyond a doubt,"" the other proofs of its truthlessness become of interest, now that these proofs, may be considered as having reached a satisfactory conclusion. The original telegram was at once minute and indefinite. It gave for authority a ""distinguished Illinoisan"" who had been in conversation with GRANT, and who repeated to a third party the remarks of GRANT. When the names of the unnamed individuals were demanded, we were furnished with those of Judge CATON, of Illinois, and Mr. SMITH, editor of the Chicago Tribune. No sooner had this been done, however, than Judge CATON, who happened to be in this city, published a card over his own signature, denying that GRANT had ever, in his presence, made the remarks attributed to him, and denying that he (CATON) had ever quoted such remarks in the presence of SMITH as coming from GRANT. In addition to this, the Chicago Tribune declares that the ""SMITH referred to in the alleged conversation with Judge CATON is not the editor of that paper.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VIVISECTION OF A CANARD.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'VIVISECTION OF A CANARD.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3bc7446e-11fd-56c1-94cc-498701364b9f,327,nyt://article/3bc7446e-11fd-56c1-94cc-498701364b9f,

"At a meeting of gentlemen called to devise some measures for rescuing the multitude of fallen women to be found in our metropolis, and for preventing others from falling who are exposed to temptation, it was resolved that there is an urgent call for the establishment of a House of Reception in the midst of the city, is which those who desire to reform may find a temporary refuge, and in which the virtuous may seek protection in their exposure. The undersigned were appointed a committee to raise the funds for such an institution, and were authorized to place it under the entire control of the lady managers of the Magdalen Female Benevolent Society. These ladies have consented to take the charge of such a house, in addition to the home already established and filled to its utmost capacity. An appeal is now made to all who are interested in the moral character of our city, and in the temporal and eternal welfare of their fellow-men, to contribute liberally to the establishment of such an institution. It in not deemed necessary to set forth the enormity of the evil which so loudly calls for vigorous efforts at removal. It stares us in the face on every corner and in every street. It is one of the most melancholy features of this social evil, and at the same time a source of encouragement to labor for their reformation, that so many of the victims of this vice are young girls.

The effect  of the President's conciliatory policy abroad has a practical illustration in the news from Europe which we publish this morning.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/10/archives/the-presidents-plan-abroad.html,,"-- The effect of the President's conciliatory policy abroad has a practical illustration in the news from Europe which we publish this morning. The President's speech to the Southern delegation is said to have inspired general confidence in the speedy and cordial reunion of the North and South. Along with this general statement comes the report that ""the amount of business done in American securities has been of a magnitude unprecedented since the outbreak of the rebellion."" Further, we are told, ""Five-twenties have been largely taken at an advance of quite two per cent."" The advance, however, does not extend alone to government bonds, but to other American securities as well. We refer, in another column, to various causes as leading to this result. But the great central fact with which the improvement in our credit is connected, we take to be the interpretation which is put, abroad, upon the Executive policy of reconstruction. The idea is, that a permanent military occupation of the late insurgent States means national bankruptcy; that reunion, on the President's simple method, signifies national strength, solvency and good faith with the public creditor. This foreign view of the case entirely coincides with liberal opinion here.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN ABROAD."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN ABROAD."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/28ec3c40-7126-577c-919d-9b264961908d,200,nyt://article/28ec3c40-7126-577c-919d-9b264961908d,

STEWART, the drygoods millionaire, was successfully launched, yesterday afternoon, from the ship-yard of Mr. E.F. WILLIAMS, at Greenpoint, in presence of a large attendance of ladies and gentlemen. The Spanish steam frigate, Isla de Cuba, lying near by, was gaily dressed in bunting for the occasion, as was Mr. JESSURUN's yacht, the Galgo, of Curacoa, both of which presented a very beautiful appearance, and with the national ensign living from the various ship-yards and house tops in the vicinity, served much to enliven the scene. The ceremony of christening the vessel was performed by a very interesting young lady, Miss ELLEN M. CLARK, daughter of JONAH N. CLARK, Esq., who stood on the bow as the boat glided from the ways, and as her stern dipped in the water, broke a bottle of wine on the bowsprit, and in a loud and distinct voice proclaimed the name the vessel should in future be known by. This is the twelfth vessel of this class built by Mr. WILLIAMS in ten years; and she is said, by competent judges, to excel in beauty of model his previous efforts. The dimensions of the A.T. Stewart are -- length over all, 80 feet; length on deck, 76 feet; breadth of beam, 21 feet; depth of hold, 7 feet 10 inches, and will be about 100 tons carpenter's measurement. She was built to replace the George Steers, No. 6, which was lost on Barnegat shoals on the 12th of January last.

Slocum on; Proc. on Freedmen's Bureau","A most virulent war has been opened in Mississippi against Judge SHARKEY, the Provisional Governor, for his issue of a proclamation Which may be found in another column. This proclamation announces an agreement with the Freedmen's Bureau to transfer to the civil authorities of the State the right to try all cases in which the rights of freedmen are involved, on condition that they be allowed the right to testify, and all the rights accorded to white men before the courts. The Governor declares that ""the late constitutional amendment, which abolishes slavery, abolishes also all laws which constituted a part of the policy of the system of slavery, and in declaring that the negro shall be protected in his person and property, establishes principles which, of themselves, entitle the negro to sue and be sued, and as a necessary incident to such right, that he is made competent as a witness, according to the laws of evidence of this State."" The newspaper organs of the party which has just come near electing an unpardoned rebel (Judge FISHER) Governor, in opposition to a strong Union candidate, are denouncing this action of the Provisional Governor with intensest bitterness. The Jackson Daily News, the leading Fisher champion, declares that ""no public man in Mississippi can survive the storm of indignation which will pelt him into obscurity when he stands forth the avowed advocate of the equality of the negro before the judicial tribunals of the country."" This language, doubtless, is overheated by party zeal, yet there can be no doubt that the President's policy, as understood and applied by the Provisional Governor, is to be embarrassed and opposed in every practical way by the party which has just shown such strength at the polls.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The President's Policy, and the Opposition."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The President's Policy, and the Opposition."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'NEGROES', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/304ad1ff-89bc-58fe-8ead-67363bda7c5b,1143,nyt://article/304ad1ff-89bc-58fe-8ead-67363bda7c5b,

The second mate was also asleep in his room, and the steward in the next room to him. About 9:30 o'clock the steward was awakened by groans from the second mate's room. Thinking the mate was dreaming, the steward knocked on the partition to awake him, but as the noise continued, he sprang up and found the second mate standing in his doorway bleeding and almost senseless from what proved to have been two severe cuts of an ax in the face. The steward at once ran for the Captain, and to his horror, found him dead in his cot, having been murdered also by blows of an ax. The steward rushed on deck and called the mate, who learning the state of things, armed himself and some others whom he could trust, and proceeded to put all those of the crew who were in the Captain's watch in irons.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Murder on the William Tell.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Murder on the William Tell.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/461cc825-6240-52ac-b5df-b62dafdb5f09,1041,nyt://article/461cc825-6240-52ac-b5df-b62dafdb5f09,

There is among the papers of last Congress a terrible document containing the details of the Indian massacre in Colorado, by Col. CHIVINGTON; and we fear the fact that CHIVINGTON has thus far been allowed to go unpunished, has led other officers operating against these Indians to act with a ferocity that is disgraceful in a Christian people.

"A case of considerable interest, involving the sum of over $50,000, was commenced yesterday in the Superior Court, Part First, before Justice MCCUNN and a jury. The parties to the suit are the Board of Water Commissioners of the City of Detroit, against HENRY A. BURR and others. The defendants are sued as sureties on a bond executed by them in behalf of Messrs. DICKINSON & SICKLES, contractors, who are the real parties defendant in interest. The gentlemen last named, in 1856, entered into a contract with the City of Detroit, to construct a number of pumps, engine-house and engines, to be used in supplying the City of Detroit with water. By the terms of the first agreement, Messrs. DICKINSON & SICKLES were to complete their work on or before the 18th of July, 1857, but the time was subsequently extended. The defendant, BURR and others, became sureties that the contracting parties would faithfully perform the stipulated work. They performed a portion of the work, and the City of Detroit, through their representatives, the plaintiffs, from time to time, advanced money on the contract, amounting in the aggregate, as they claim, to over $50,000. The defence insist that the work which was done was imperfect and did not at all answer the purpose. The trial, which has just commenced, will be continued to-day.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/11/archives/local-news.html,,"A case of considerable interest, involving the sum of over $50,000, was commenced yesterday in the Superior Court, Part First, before Justice MCCUNN and a jury.

Paterson Fall Meeting--Second Day,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/12/archives/the-turf-paterson-races-second-day-intense-excitement-brilliant.html,Paterson Fall Meeting--Second Day,"The second day of the Paterson Fall Meeting will be long remembered in racing annals as the most brilliant scene ever witnessed on this continent. Large as was the assemblage on the grand day of the Spring Meeting, larger still as was the culminating one of the meeting at Saratoga, both suffered a total eclipse yesterday at Paterson, where there was an attendance beyond all precedence. Old turfites refer with pride to the assemblages on Long Island, when Eclipse, Henry, Lady Suffolk, &c., were in their glory, and their contests drew spectators by thousands, and the old Union course echoed and reechoed with their shouts; but henceforth Paterson will stand alone in the quantity and marked superiority in quality of the visitors. So brilliant a coup d'oeil as that presented can better be imagined than described. The grand stand was crowded with elegantly-dressed ladies; the other capacious stands were wedged to repletion. The field was densely packed with equipages of the most recherche and the most nondescript character, and not a vacant spot could be found anywhere. Yet this dense mass of racing-loving humanity presented the most perfectly good-humored and orderly array. Not a single disorderly or improper character could be found within the precincts of the course, or for that matter outside of it -- the detectives took care of that -- oaths and objurgations were unheard, inebriety hid its head, and the strong body of police on duty were indulged with a complete sinecure. It is a great thing to possess a good character and a bright record. In these respects Paterson is patent in the public mind. Roughs and rowdies know full well that it is no place for them; hence they never attempt to put in an appearance there, having a potent fear of quick justice, and Jersey laws. The model management of the association shone resplendently on this occasion, and received its coveted reward in the unqualified approbation of all present. The arrangements of the Erie Railroad were of the most complete and satisfactory description. Determined to be up to the occasion for ten days past they have been collecting spare cars, and even sent as far as Cincinnati for additional ones. Some idea of the magnitude of the demand for transportation made on the company, may be gathered from the fact that one of the morning special trains had twenty-eight cars attached, another, twenty-six, and a third, twenty-two -- all three being so densely crowded that even standing room inside was unobtainable -- and the people clustered like bees on the platforms. Yet all were landed, and returned in safety, not the most trivial accident occurring. From early morning the Paterson plank-road was alive with vehicles, whose sinuous course could be traced by clouds of dust, as they swept past. As the curse was neared, the- crush and crowd were indescribable. The sleepy old Passaic awoke from its lethargy and put on an additional ripple, and the town of Paterson rubbed its eyes, and turned out its population en masse to witness the unwonted procession of New-York raiders.

"The English mind is supposed to move slowly but surely. If a long time is required for it to get to a point, it is supposed to remain a good while at the point. It adhered to the rebellion until after the last armed foe had expired, and only begins to believe in the Union alter a half year of peace has proved it to be firmly established. It believed in Confederate bonds after the Confederacy itself was tottering, and only acquires faith in the value of Federal securities when the necessity of faith has been superseded by sight. It appears that now English capitalists are beginning to be large purchasers of these securities, of which heretofore the Germans have been the chief European buyers. The likelihood is, that having begun this, they will carry it to a great extent and keep on it for a long while. The security is unsurpassed; and the profits accruing to European holders have been heavy enough to tempt English cupidity.

It believed in Confederate bonds after the Confederacy itself was tottering, and only acquires faith in the value of Federal securities when the necessity of faith has been superseded by sight. It appears that now English capitalists are beginning to be large purchasers of these securities, of which heretofore the Germans have been the chief European buyers. The likelihood is, that having begun this, they will carry it to a great extent and keep on it for a long while.

Judging by present appearances, Iowa and Indiana, on the same day, took the same course. The States of the Centre and the States of the West utter their responses to Maine and Vermont, which pronounced their verdict last month. Neither in Ohio nor Pennsylvania, nor in the other States, has the campaign been of such warmth, or regarded of such importance, as to call forth the greatest energies of the parties, or the full vote of the people. Perhaps, the greatest efforts were made by the Democracy, because for the first time in years it now seemed that they might have a chance to win. Their platforms were less obnoxious, their candidates generally better than heretofore; the honor and fate of the country were not conceived by patriotic men to be at stake in the elections; and there were Symptoms of party disintegration and lassitude of political feeling, which, it was thought could not but inure to the benefit of the Democracy. They adopted all the expedients of party trickery to secure success. In one place they appealed to patriotism by nominating a soldier; in another they wrought upon prejudice by denouncing negro suffrage, and trying to fasten that measure upon their opponents; they attempted to take advantage of the great and unquestionable popularity of the Administration policy toward the South by claiming to be the most determined supporters of that policy, and they attempted to cajole the people into believing them the special adherents of President JOHNSON.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Tuesday's State Elections."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Tuesday's State Elections."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York State', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ef0fbae2-6b35-5725-9318-cd0cd97d87fc,463,nyt://article/ef0fbae2-6b35-5725-9318-cd0cd97d87fc,

Their calculation has been that their old friendly relations to the South would specially commend them for the work of reconciliation which is now the order of the day; and also that the prevailing prejudice against the colored race could be turned, by a little management, to their great profit. They have expected much, too, from the lack of harmony in the Union party upon some of the questions pertaining to reconstruction. This disagreement, they were indeed, quite sure, would greatly distract and impair the working force of the party, even if it did not absolutely rupture and paralyze it. They professed, too, to bury forever all the issues of the war, and to adopt heartily the entire reconstruction policy of President JOHNSON. They undertook these Fall campaigns upon new ground entirely, and ground, too, so chosen as to give their opponents as little advantage of position as possible. They have plied every art, exhausted all strategy to gain success. The result is that they have been overwhelmed in every field. In September, they were routed worse than ever in Maine and Vermont, and in October they are again severely defeated in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.

A bullet entered Mrs. GERKEN's nose, and, glancing off, lodged in her cheek. HILLEN also was wounded in the cheek. Policeman ANDREW P.

Destitution at the,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/14/archives/destitution-in-the-south.html,Destitution at the,"A very general impression exists that the destitution of the South has been greatly exaggerated, and that there is much less suffering and want than was at first expected. This is probably partially true. In all those parts of the South which are easily accessible by sea or railroad, and in those through which the army has simply passed, without remaining for any length of time, the condition of affairs is better than had been anticipated; the crops are good, and the prospect is, that with, perhaps, some assistance in the way of clothing, seed and implements, the people will get along. But in the interior of the South, where trade has not yet penetrated, and especially in the track of SHERMAN's army, there are regions where the desolation almost surpasses belief, and where relief must be afforded either by government or by the charities of the North, or thousands must die of hunger and exposure.

This exhibition of Northern determination struck discouragement into the rebel heart. The rebel armies showed it in multiplied desertions, and in the loss of all their old fighting temper. The rebel Congress showed it in the new hesitation and bewilderment which entered its councils. The people at large showed it in more bitter complaints of the Richmond rule, and in a more respectful, half-submissive style of speech toward the old government. The suddenness with which the South, after the surrender of LEE, changed from rebellion to loyalty, has excited much surprise, but it was more apparent than real. The change was, for the most part, a gradual one. The five months which elapsed between the reelection of President LINCOLN and the laying down of the rebel arms, was but a period of preparation to the Southern heart for the inevitable event. The necessity of going back to the old allegiance became a familiar Southern thought long before the firing between the armies ceased, and when the peace came it required no mental struggle for the Southern people to adapt themselves to it. The real breaking down of the rebel spirit was accomplished by the great political struggle of the North in November.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Moral Influence of the Fall Elections upon Reconstruction.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Moral Influence of the Fall Elections upon Reconstruction.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Elections', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/79a8734c-eea3-5dcc-90cb-8624b1882d02,1080,nyt://article/79a8734c-eea3-5dcc-90cb-8624b1882d02,

The Soldiers' Home has been incorporated by the State of Pennsylvania, for the relief of soldiers and seamen who have been honorably discharged from, and the children of those who have died in the service of the country. The Cooper-shop Soldiers' Home has been merged in this institution by legislative authority, and is now in successful operation, but as the building now occupied, at the corner of Race and Crown streets, is entirely inadequate to the necessities of the Home, the managers have given their sanction to the proposed fair. Although the Home is located in Philadelphia, its benefactions are not limited by State boundaries. Its doors are freely opened to every deserving soldier and sailor of the republic who seeks admission. The management contemplates an Industrial Department in the institution, in which the inmates who are able to work at their trades may find employment, and thus be relieved from the position of mere dependants on public charity. It contemplates also a department where children of those who have died in the service will be tenderly protected and carefully educated and prepared for suitable vocations.

The topic was discussed with considerable warmth, and at length FLORENCE MCCARTHY, of No. 45 Oak-street, demonstratively said that every Fenian ought to be drowned. Whereupon one DENNIS FOLLY sprang upon MCCARTHY with a knife and stabbed him twice, inflicting a severe gash on his left wrist and ripping open his abdomen. This occurrence somewhat sobered the revelers, and they called in Patrolman FERNES, and he at once took FOLLY to the Oak-street Police-station. MCCARTHY was removed to his abode, and there his wounds were dressed by Dr. CONWAY; but later in the day, there being [???] that the [???] might result fatally, [???] was summoned to take the sufferer's [???], which is as follows: ""My name is Florence McCarthy; I am a native of Massachusetts, 29 years of age; at about three o'clock this morning I was at the [???] of [???] and Water-street, in a porter[???] by [???]; with a number of [???] I was [???] a bench; [???], the [???], was standing in front of me; I saw him [???] knife [???] then [???] to get away [???], but [???] could he [???] in the left [???] and on my left wrist; I had neither done nor said anything to [???]perate him, except, when joking about the Fenian Brotherhood, I remarked, in just, that they all ought to be drowned; he then stabbed me.""

When the civil war broke out here, they were as strongly opposed to slavery as we, but then they sympathized with the slaveholders, because the institution was not involved in the contest; or, if it was, the Federal Government would never abolish it; or, if they should, it would be done from very worldly and selfish motives. When, at last, the great work was accomplished, where was the joy, the enthusiasm of English philanthropy, which had never wearied of bragging to the very echo of the liberation of half a million slates in the West Indies, over the unconditional emancipation of four millions of bondmen in the United States? We catch scarcely a lisp of congratulation, aside from the utterances of the enlightened few who have comprehended, from the first, the deep significance of our struggle.

Up to the day named, the proceedings of the convention had been characterized by unusual harmony -unusual for an ecclesiastical assembly. The sectional division of the Church, which dated from the beginning of the civil insurrection, seemed to have been fairly in the way of being healed by mutual forbearance. And this conciliatory temper in the earlier sessions of the convention may have been only temporarily banished by Saturday's discussion. It is, nevertheless, perfectly manifest by the tenor and the result of that discussion, that much more has to be forborne by the members, lay and clerical, of the Episcopal Church, than they had anticipated in restoring a healthy and perfect union between the Northern and Southern branch of the Church. The naming of a day of thanksgiving for the general mercies of Providence might have been supposed to be the question of all others least likely to evoke discordant views. And yet, the simple fact of a Northern member's proposing that the observances of the day should include a common expression of thankfulness on the part of the Church for a restored Union, was regarded as a brand of discord. And a pacific solution of the difficulty was only reached by a majority consenting to lay the resolution aside.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE EPISCOPAL CONVENTION ON NATIONAL AFFAIRS.; AFFAIRS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE EPISCOPAL CONVENTION ON NATIONAL AFFAIRS.; AFFAIRS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38fbc072-32e6-5a7f-a933-7b9f3836a72a,366,nyt://article/38fbc072-32e6-5a7f-a933-7b9f3836a72a,

Jones, Arrested","COFFIN MANUFACTORY DESTROYED. -- Between 5 and 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, fire was discovered on the second-story of Mr. EDWARD H. SENIOR'S coffin manufactory, at No. 57 Downing-street, and before the bells struck the alarm, the flames had enveloped the entire second story. This delay in calling out the firemen is said to have been occasioned by an alarm just at that time for a fire in Mr. FALKEN METER's looking-glass-frame manufactory, at No. 171 Suffolk-street. The fire had enveloped the coffin manufactory before the firemen had unlimbered their hose and they therefore turned their attention to saving surrounding property. In this they succeeded. Mr. SENIOR's loss is estimated at $15,000. He has $3,300 insurance on stock and $2,000 on the building, in the Greenwich office. No. 59 Dowing-street, owned by Mr. SENIOR, and occupied by Mrs. MARY BARRON, was slightly damaged by fire and water. The building is insured for $2,000 by the Irving Company, and Mrs. BARRON has $4,000 insurance on her furniture, in the Peter Cooper office. Mr. R. SOMERVILLE, of No. 61 Downing-street, sustained trivial loss from damage by water. Mrs. DOUGLAS, Mrs. BRADY, Mr. MCCLOSKEY Mr. McAvoy, and Mr. WOLF, occupants of Nos. 76 and 78 Carmine-street, also lost something from dam age by water and breakage of furniture in moving.

Charges,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/16/archives/telegraph-charges.html,Charges,"-- Is it not about time that something was done to popularize the telegraph? The prices charged for the use of it are perfectly outrageous. On the continent of Europe one can send a message across the whole breadth of France for a singe franc, (twenty cents,) while the shortest dispatch from Albany to New-York costs fifty cents. There is no excuse for this. It is the most profitable business in the country. All the lines are making enormous dividends, upon a capital three, five and ten times the cost of the lines. There is no reason why the public should pay such outrageous prices for the service. The cost of working a telegraph is very small, compared with a railroad or anything else, yet the charges in proportion are much higher.

Pennsylvania election returns,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/16/archives/the-pennsylvania-election-returns.html,Pennsylvania election returns,"-- The sudden subsidence of Democratic exultation over the late elections is very easily accounted for. Their principal organ here had prophesied and worked so persistently for disorganization in the Union ranks that the editors really believed in such a state of facts. Anticipating an easy victory in Pennsylvania, the scream of triumph was written, if not in type, on the night of election; but the late telegrams plainly indicated a Union victory, and the exultant ""leader"" gave way for a paragraph of the most ludicrous muddiness. Next day the result, by Democratic measurement, was ""doubtful."" Next day came a prolonged whistle of incredulity, and finally the blustering and bragging settled down into the modest admission -- ""Of course, we expected the Republicans would carry the State; but how cruelly their majority is cut down."" It is just possible that we can stand a good deal of such cutting down. We have a majority considerably exceeding that of last November for President LINCOLN; we have very largely increased our strength in both branches of the Legislature, and we have made absolute gains in strength in 38 out of 42 counties so far officially reported. And this is upon a largely diminished vote, so that the per centage of gain is much greater than the numerical gain.

HAMMAN, anticipating trouble, went to the street and notified Policeman EDWARD BARBELET, the officer on that post, that his services might be needed in the saloon and the officer accordingly kept an eye on the place. The game went on until between 1 and 2 o'clock yesterday morning, and then, a dispute having risen between RAMMING and the players, one of the gang sprang upon him while he was drawing beer behind the bar, and before any person could stay the ruffiian's hand he had inflicted four stabs on RAMMING, one of them a deep and mortal wound in the right eye. The fellow immediately fled, and is still at large. He is, however, well known by the police. At the time of the assault. Officer BARBELET was nearly a block distant; but he reached the saloon before the entire party had effected their escape, and having taken four of their number into custody, he sent for a physician. Dr. A.J. CHADSEY, of No. 288 Spring-street, responded to the summons; but when he arrived the wounded man was breathing his last. RAMMING lived about half an hour after the stabbing; but he was unable to articulate. His partner, however, who was in the saloon at the time of the attack, says that the assault was unprovoked, and that one AUGUST BUCKLEY struck the fatal blow with a large pocket knife. Officer BARBELET's four prisoners, whose names are MATTHIAS CONNELLY, HUGH MCNELLIS, ROBERT BROWN and ROBERT ANDERSON, were committed to cells in the Greenwich-street Station-house, and held to await the orders of Coroner COLLIN. The Coroner impanneled a jury yesterday afternoon, but deemed it prudent to postpone the inquest until 2 o'clock this afternoon. A post-mortem investigation was made by Dr. THOMAS ROBINSON, and four wounds were discovered on the right side of the face; the wound in the right eye was ascertained to be three inches in depth, and at the extreme point which the blade touched the Doctor found pieces of bone from the skull. RAMMING dwelt at No. 9 Carmine-street. He was a native of Germany, aged about 40 years.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Usual Saturday-night Murder.; INQUEST BY CORONER COLLIN SALOON-KEEPER KILLED AT HIS BAR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Usual Saturday-night Murder.; INQUEST BY CORONER COLLIN SALOON-KEEPER KILLED AT HIS BAR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de9943a2-cce8-5b6d-aeb9-f1adc8460002,423,nyt://article/de9943a2-cce8-5b6d-aeb9-f1adc8460002,

The topic was discussed with considerable warmth, and at length FLORENCE MCCARTHY, of No. 45 Oak-street, demonstratively said that every Fenian ought to be drowned. Whereupon one DENNIS FOLEY sprang upon MCCARTHY with a knife and stabbed him twice, inflicting a severe gash on his left wrist and ripping open his abdomen. This occurrence somewhat sobered the revelers, and they called in Patrolman BYRNES, and he at once took FOLEY to the Oak-street Police-station. MCCARTHY was removed to his abode, and there his wounds were dressed by Dr. CONWAY; but later in the day, there being fears that the abdomen stab might result fatally, Coroner WILDEY was summoned to take the sufferer's deposition, which is as follows: ""My name is Florence McCarthy; I am a native of Massachusetts, 29 years of age; at about three o'clock this morning I was at the corner of James-slip and Water-street, in a porter-house kept by Peter Matthews; with a number of others I was sitting on a bench; Dennis Foley, the prisoner, was standing in front of me; I saw him opening a knife in his pantaloons pocket; I rose then and tried to get away from him, but before I could he cut me in the left side and on my left wrist; I had neither done nor said anything to exasperate him, except, when joking about the Fenian Brotherhood, I remarked, in jest, that they all ought to be drowned; he then stabbed me."" Previous to committing FOLEY to the Tombs, Coroner WILDEY took his statement, as follows: ""I dwell at No. 341 Water-street, am a native of Ireland, 38 years of age, and am a laborer; I went into the bar-room with a friend to get a drink, when McCarthy hit me twice, and to defend myself I cut him.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fenianism at Slaughter-House Point; HOMICIDAL ASSAULT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fenianism at Slaughter-House Point; HOMICIDAL ASSAULT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e14996f3-a8dc-54d2-a23c-9307f627ad66,350,nyt://article/e14996f3-a8dc-54d2-a23c-9307f627ad66,

We believe it will be well received throughout the country. It should give renewed assurance to all conservative and prudent people that the blame will not be with the Administration at Washington if our finances are not gradually but surely consolidated, and the currency improved without panic or expansion in any direction. It is already sufficiently evident that Mr. MCCULLOCH is not a finance minister of extremes either way. The sudden close of the war surrounded his movements through the Spring and Summer with embarrassments and anxieties. The former related not to the ability, but the readiest and least costly means of raising a very large amount of money; the latter to the importance and duty of paying off our vast armies and navies before, or as soon, as they could be reduced to the peace establishment and were disbanded. The appropriations to the united service designed for six months or a year, were suddenly crowded into a few weeks, and six hundred millions of money had to be raised for the new fiscal year before the old year had closed on the 30th June.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Mr. McCulloch at Fort Wayne.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Mr. McCulloch at Fort Wayne.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ef8beaaf-2502-5291-af6d-ddb539115e23,550,nyt://article/ef8beaaf-2502-5291-af6d-ddb539115e23,

We are sorry for the Athenians; it is quite too bad that an eclipse should be to the only partially visible.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/17/archives/notes.html,,"Boston is a knowing town. We are sagely apprised therefrom that on the 19th instant there will be an eclipse of the sun ""partially visible in Boston."" We are sorry for the Athenians; it is quite too bad that an eclipse should be to the only partially visible. Let us hope that when the next solar obscuration happens they may be permitted to see the whole of it. But we may as well put our own people on guard. Be it known, then, that on Thursday next, the 19th inst., there will be an eclipse of the sun, which will be seen as an annular eclipse in certain portions of the Southern and Western States. The eclipse will be visible as a partial one over nearly the whole of the continent of North America, the northern half of South America, and the whole Atlantic Ocean, and in parts of Western Europe and Africa. The central eclipse begins at 9:32 A.M., Washington time, on the Pacific coast, near the mouth of the Columbia River, and the central line, extending across the continent in an east-southeast direction, comes to the Atlantic near Charleston, S.C., and crossing this ocean, terminates in Africa, near the western coast, at 12 h. 53 m., Washington time. This line passes very near to St. Joseph, Mo., Paducah, Ky., Nashville, Tenn., and Charleston, S.C. The annular phase will be visible on either side of this line to a distance of about ninety geographical miles. Besides the cities we have mentioned there are included within these limits Knoxville, Tenn., Huntsville, Ala., Columbia, S.C., Savannah, Ga., and many other less important places. The position of the central line in this eclipse, passing near to so many accessible places, makes it a peculiarly favorable one for the observation of the phenomena attending the annular phases; and expeditions have accordingly been sent to several positions on the line from the National Observatory, and from the offices of the Coast Survey and the Nautical Almanac. In New-York the eclipse will begin at five minutes before 9 o'clock in the morning; the height of obscuration will happen at about 10:30, and the end will be as twelve minutes past noon. At the greatest obscuration about two-thirds (7 3/4 digits) of the sun will be shaded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NOTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NOTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bcdcd91c-225b-5f72-b5c3-f63e3fee5c23,691,nyt://article/bcdcd91c-225b-5f72-b5c3-f63e3fee5c23,

That list included the names of some of the most eminent members of each House of the British Parliament, the leading capitalists and merchants of Great Britain, and the most influential proprietors and editors of the English press. Among the latter figured the manager of the London Times, who was put down as a victim of misplaced confidence to the tune of £10,000. The proprietor of the Morning Post was also enrolled as a fellow-sufferer to a large amount. The notorious Mr. LAIRD, the builder of the Confederate rams and blockade-runners, was likewise given a prominent place on this block list.

Greenleaf et al. vs. Peter R. Mumford, John Oakey, The Nassau National Bank, Albert Speyers, &c. -- The complaint in this action alleges that in August last the plaintiffs were copartners; that on the 12th day of that month they sold and delivered to the defendant Mumford $20,000 in gold, for which they were to be paid on delivery the sum of $28,200 in legal tender and rational currency; that the gold was delivered to Mumford, and that the plaintiffs received in payment therefore, a check dated Aug. 12, on the Mechanics Bank for $28,200, which check was drawn by Mumford and made payable to the plaintiff's order; that the check was presented at the bank on which it was drawn and payment thereof demanded, which was refused; the reason assigned being that there were no funds there to the account of the drawer. The plaintiffs thereupon notified Mumford of the dishonor of his check, and demanded payment of the amount named therein, or in default of that they insisted they should receive the original amount in gold. Mumford, it seems, refused to comply with either demand, and he is now charged with having perpetrated a fraud in the purchase of the gold, when he well knew at the time he gave the check that he had not the funds in the Mechanics' Bank to meet the same. The plaintiffs insist that he did not intend to pay for the gold when he bought it. Afterward Mumford sent to John Oakey a certified check on the Tradesmen's Bank for $53,000, with a request that Oakey would hold the same for his, Mumford's, benefit. Oakey drew out $53,000 from the Tradesmen's Bank, and deposited the same to his own credit in the Nassau National Bank, and then drew his own checks against this sum and for the whole amount thereof. Subsequently he procured these to be certified as good, the money still remaining in the Nassau National Bank and the checks in his own possession.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Mumford Frauds Again in Court-- An Important Commercial Question.; SUPREME COURT -- SPECIAL TERM - OCT. 16.

Many interested spectators were present during the examination of the witnesses -- the first of whom was FREDERICK REHM, partner of HAMMING, the murdered man. REHM testified that a party of young men, among whom were Robert Anderson, Hugh McNealis, Matthew Conlin, William McGraw, Benjamin Cohen, Thomas Murphy and Gustavus Buckley, played cards until midnight on Saturday, when he (Rehm) took the cards from them, tolling them that it was time to close the house; the players insisted upon another game, but REHM would not countenance it, and went out; but he subsequently returned to the saloon and found the party again engaged in play, RAMMING having given them the cards and joined them in the game: the play went on without dispute until near two o'clock on Sunday morning, when an order was given the barkeeper to fill the glasses, and words passed between the deceased and BUCKLEY, the latter asserting that it was RAMMING's turn to pay for the refreshments: a wordy wrangle ensued, and CONLIN attempted to strike REHM, while BUCKLEY, who appears once to have threatened to chastise RAMMING, made an assault, and on the restoration of order, RAMMING was found to have been mortally wounded. The testimony of BENJAMIN COHEN, of Ninety-second-street, between Third and Fourth avenues, in interesting, and is as follows: I went into the saloon in the early part of the evening to meet a friend, and sat to play a game of whist; being caught by the rain, I remained there in company with Anderson, whom I had met in there; I remained until about one o'clock in the morning, when there was a quarrel between Buckley and the deceased, which ended in a scuffie; the deceased clenched with Buckley, and the latter bit the former; McGraw and myself separated the combatants, and everything was then quieted down; but ten minutes subsequently the deceased, who was standing behind the bar, and Buckley, who was outside, seized glasses, and Anderson said it there's to be any glass throwing I'll get out; I went out then, leaving Buckley standing at the counter having words with Ramming. The remaining testimony corroborates the statements in yesterday morning's TIMES. It may be remarked that the witnesses seemed to be aware of every occurrence from early in the evening to the moment of the the stabbing; but of that act not one of the party knows any thing.

Hurd vs. John Kelly, Sheriff of the City and County of New-York. -- This interesting case was tried yesterday in the Supreme Court before Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and a jury. It involves some points of law and some questions of fact, of interest to laymen as well as to lawyers. The facts are, in substance, as follows: In the Summer of 1864, the plaintiff, Hurd, commenced an action in this court against one Wm.A. Crolius to recover the sum of about $400. The summons was for a money demand on contract, but about the time the proceedings were commenced an order of arrest was obtained from Mr. Justice Barnard, for the reason, as alleged in the complaint and the accompanying affidavits, that the defendant Crolius had been guilty of fraud and misrepresentation when he contracted the debt. Crolius was accordingly arrested by the Sheriff of New-York and held to bail. Some time in October, 1864, judgment was obtained in that suit for the full amount claimed, and execution was thereon issued against the defendant's property, which was returned wholly unsatisfied. An execution against the person was then issued. The defendant was arrested, and after some delay furnished bail to the effect that he would not go outside of the City of New-York until the judgment was paid, or until his bonds were legally discharged. In other, and more familiar phrase, he was ""put upon the jail limits,"" which ""limits"" are the territory known as Manhattan Island. But the plaintiff Hurd was determined to have the amount of his judgment if he could legally obtain it. He had already become satisfied that his debtor was insolvent, and that he had been defrauded by him, as he claimed. Hence he made up his mind to compel the Sheriff to do his duty. By the statute law of this State, if a judgment debtor on the ""jail limits"" under circumstances like those above described, is caught outside of those ""limits,"", (except from Saturday night at 12 o'clock to Sunday night at 12 o'clock), and the Sheriff of the county holding the process, can be served with a summons during the time the debtor is so off his ""limits,"" then it is provided that the Sheriff may be held liable in an action at law for the full amount of the judgment upon which execution had been issued. This seems to have been a case in point, and it can readily be seen that five minutes, or even one minute may turn the scale for either plaintiff or defendant.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': '""Jail Limits"" What They Are and When a Prisoner May Pass Them Suit Against the Sheriff for an Escape The Jury Render a Verdict Against the Defendant The Value of a Minute.; SUPREME COURT CIRCUIT PART. 3 OCT. 17.

The motion of counsel was to remit the papers back to the magistrate for further examination. The motion is denied. The court holds that if the papers were to be sent back to the committing magistrate he might refuse to reopen the case. In that event the bail having been given, and the papers sent back, the bondsman would be relieved from all obligations; and cases might arise in which this power might be used to enable offenders to escape justice. In 1853, a similar application was made in the General Sessions before Recorder Hoffman. Peter Heffernan was arrested on the charge of larceny. The magistrate who committed him and took bail to answer consented to rehear the case. In the meantime, while this motion to remit was pending before the court, the Grand Jury brought in an indictment, and the Recorder denied the motion to remit the papers to the magistrate. He decided then that an indictment will not be quashed on the ground that it was found and presented by the Grand Jury pending an examination of the same charge before a Police Magistrate.

Postponement Denied,"The People vs. Peter R. Strong and Electra M. Potter. -- The motion for a postponement of the trial of this case was heard yesterday morning. The notoriety which the case has already attained drew a large crowd to the room. Mr. Graham opened the argument by saying that he appeared for the District-Attorney, for the purpose of making a motion to postpone the trial. He would say to His Honor, that it was a case in which he considered the public should be represented by some official agent or servant, end for that reason had declined to take the lead in the management of the prosecution. If the peculiar circumstances were such, as in the opinion of Mr. Hall, would make it improper for him to conduct the prosecution, he would suggest that the Attorney-General of the State be called in for that purpose, and he believed that an understanding had been arrived at with that officer that he was to represent the prosecution. He thought that criminal prosecutions Should be conducted by a public officer rather than by private counsel, who probably would not act with the same respect to the rights of the defence as would an official agent of the people. He had positively declined the responsibility of the management of the prosecution, and in doing so he acted in obedience to the dictates of his own conscience, and from the fact that he felt so strongly in reference to the case that he might exhibit an over-zeal which would be detrimental to the prosecution. The motion now was to postpone the trial on account of the situation of a most important witness for the prosecution. The records of the court would show that she was one of the most important witnesses against the defendant Strong, if the testified to the confessions made by him in her presence, which, if believed by the jury, supposing other facts in the case were true, must result in his conviction.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Strong Case.; COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS.

Yesterday Mr. STEPHENS and his brother paid a visit to Mayor GUENTHER and Sheriff KELLY. Their arrival soon became known in the City Hall, but they passed quietly through the crowd collected outside the Mayor's Office, and after visiting the Sheriff went up town on private business. They were out most of the day and did not return to the hotel until a late hour. Several prominent Democrats called to see Mr. STEPHENS during the day but were disappointed in finding him absent.

E. Denial of Loss by Rebel Loan; London Star on London Times and the Rebel Loan; Hope, A. J. B. Beresford, Denial of Holding Confederate Loan; Laird, John, M. P., Denial of Holding ...","In the list of ""English victims to the rebel loan,"" published by the American papers, one name appears which all Europe will read with amazement. Is it possible that there can be any ground whatever for the allegation that the Right Hon. WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE, Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among the Englishmen who advanced money toward the support of the Confederate rebellion? The first impulse thies, must be to declare such an assertion utterly beyond belief. But that the American papers assert that the list of contributors to the cotton loan, which they publish, is derived from authentic and official sources, the implication of such a name in such a transaction would seem too obviously unjust to warrant a reproduction of the statement. Let us just consider for a moment the full meaning of the charge implied in the assertion that Mr. GLADSTONE is one of those who speculated in the Confederate loan. For the most obvious reasons one is reluctant to admit the idea of an English Finance Minister engaged in any personal dabblings in any foreign loan whatever. But see what was the peculiar nature of the Confederate loan. Let us even put aside for the moment all considerations founded on moral principle, on the odiousness of the slavery system which the Confederate rebellion was undertaken to uphold. Let us look at the question solely as one of hard and dry political expediency and official propriety. The Confederate loan was raised to supply rebels with the means of carrying on a war against a lawful government, that government being one with which we were supposed to have and wish to maintain only friendly relations. Again and again the Queen and her Ministers had formally proclaimed the determination of Great Britain to act toward the belligerents on the principles of the strictest neutrality. Again and again had the government been accused of interpreting this declaration in a manner specially unfriendly to the North; again and again had it repudiated the charge, and admitted the extreme impropriety and even danger that must be involved in any official act which could lend countenances to it. And now we are told that while all this was going on, while every rational and prudent man, even on the Tory side, was urging on the government the immense importance of avoiding even a word which might seem to favor the rebellion -- all this time we are told that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the foremost member of the Cabinet with the sole exception of the Premier, was lending money to the Southern Confederation in order that it might be enabled to prolong the war against the Government of the United States. * * *",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""AMERICAN TOPICS.; THE CONFEDERATE LOAN.

One he married in England, about 1850. He lived happily with her several years. Thinking to better his fortunes he left his wife and children in Leeds, England, came on here and labored industriously to save money to bring on his family. News came to him, at length, that his wife and children had died. The intelligence was from such a source, he says, that he could not disbelieve it. He mourned his loss, as all good husbands and fathers do, but he never went over to see whether his wife was really dead. Time passed; he met with another, and as the evidence is, he loved and married her in this city, not long ago. Now, the first wife turns up alive and well. The husband prefers the first love to the second, and comes into court asking that a decree be granted declaring the second marriage null and void. This is the story of the plaintiff. The defendant, the second wife, has a different story to tell, and is disposed to contest the matter to the utmost. The full history of the defence has not transpired, but it is reported that there are some very interesting developments to be made.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Remarkable Divorce Case.; SUPERIOR COURT SPECIAL TERM OCT. 19.

There was nothing covert or insidious in its hostility, and therein it was free from the worst traits of Copperheadism. Being always straightforward, above-board, out-and-out, it was always a most valuable witness of the real intent of its party. Possessed still of the same qualities, its testimony concerning the present spirit of its party is equally good. Its frankness in the present canvass distinguishes it honorably from most of its Democratic cotemporaries, whose whole study seems to be how to juggle back the confidence of the people by false pretences.

Institute Fair; Races of Mutilated Men,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/20/archives/a-national-amusement.html,Institute Fair; Races of Mutilated Men,"-- There was an exhibition the other day at the fair of the American Institute, from which a savage might have turned with a shudder, and from which a wild beast (unless he belonged to some show in New-York, and was consequently depraved,) might have shrunk frightened and sickened away. The reporters give us to understand, however, that this exhibition afforded an amusement for people whom eighteen centuries of Christianity, and a cycle of unexampled freedom, with such advantages for the diffusion of humanizing education as the world never knew before, ought to have made the first people of the age in refinement of feeling and enlightenment of intellect. Yet we may all doubt whether all these great means have not failed of their end, when we read how a large crowd, at the American Institute, witnessed with interest and satisfaction, the struggles of certain mutilated men to outwalk and outrun each other on the artificial limbs of rival manufacture, which were to be tested in the graceful sport. In a place which was devoted as a temple to the inventive genius of our people, and in which the triumphs of their unequaled skill were displayed, this degrading spectacle took place. It could serve no purpose of science which could not have been better served in a decenter way, and the manufacturers of cork-legs could have found ample means of determining the comparative merits of their works without outraging -- we were going to say public sentiment, but it appears the public sentiment was not outraged. It seems that the grotesque and ferocious sense of drollery which could alone have prompted such a hideous show as this race of the cripples is the common instinct, and that we relish the scene which it invented for our gratification. The fact is none the less disgraceful, however; disgraceful to the managers of the fair who permitted the exhibition, disgraceful to the unfortunate men who took part in it, disgraceful to the public, which not alone endured it, but enjoyed it.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A NATIONAL AMUSEMENT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A NATIONAL AMUSEMENT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5f134fef-6d6f-52d5-96b1-b3e9a3ed49c8,559,nyt://article/5f134fef-6d6f-52d5-96b1-b3e9a3ed49c8,

The Advance of and Condition of New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/20/archives/the-advance-of-the-cholera.html,The Advance of and Condition of New-York,"The news by yesterday's European mail shows that we in America, must begin to ""set our house in order."" The only point of doubt thus far about the present invasion of cholera, with medical men, has been whether it was more than an epidemic of the Mediterranean basin. Till recently, the disease had not left the shores of that sea. In Italy, no inland towns had been attacked, and even cities in the filthiest condition, such as Verona, had altogether escaped the pestilence. France had, indeed, been assailed, but it was on the coast -- at Marseilles. Now, however, we hear of cases in the interior of Italy, and above all, the news reaches us that cholera has broken out in Paris and other parts of interior France. It cannot be long probably before cases are reported in England. Winter is not necessarily a safeguard against it, nor extreme cold. In the great attack of 1830, the pestilence raged all Winter frightfully in St. Petersburgh, and broke out in England first in October, remaining torpid, as it were, till the next Spring, and then raging through the cities of Great Britain. It did not appear here till June. It is not improbable that as the season is so far advanced before it has reached Paris, its ravages may be but slight this Autumn, and next Spring may witness its reappearance in Western Europe. If that shall prove the fact, the pestilence will inevitably cross the ocean, and appear here next Summer. Physicians already notice a certain choleratic aspect to diseases this year -- a peculiarity said often to precede a general attack of Asiatic cholera. If this mysterious agency which produces cholera -- this current or wave of invisible fungi or animalculae or malaria is on its progress around the world, no quarantine or exclusion can shut it out. In the first invasion it broke out in New-York soon after it appeared in Montreal.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Advance of the Cholera.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Advance of the Cholera.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Cholera', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73286629-b600-5579-9261-8f46a028d184,960,nyt://article/73286629-b600-5579-9261-8f46a028d184,

It transpired on the trial that there a are great number of associations of this nature in this city, the object of which is, to buy goods of all kinds in this market and sell them again to Western merchants. This ""Division"" is numbered 757, and the evidence showed that there were numbers all the way from one up to this. The court in directing the jury to find a verdict for the full amount of the draft and interest, said that the idea of there being ""Divisions"" for the purpose, and to the extent shown, was a novel thing in his judicial experience. At most they were but mere voluntary associations; they were not incorporated companies, and they had none of the elements of a co-partnership.

Among them, we noticed Major-Gen. Kilpatrick, Chancellor Ferris, Gen. Merritt, Peter Cooper, Hon. Daniel S. Dickinson, W.E. Dodge, Hon. Abram Wakeman, E. Delafield, Smith, Horace Greeley, Col. T.B. Van Buren and Charles S. Spencer. Unlike the audience, which, a few nights since, permitted Gen. SLOCUM to come before it unknown, unrecognized and ungreeted, this gathering rose as one man when KILPATRICK entered, and gave him nine as hearty cheers as he or any other man ever yet received. The walls were gaily and appropriately decked with banners and bunting, the pillars were wreathed with the American flag, and even the plaster busts of WASHINGTON, FRANKLIN, JACKSON and LINCOLN adorned their pedestals in improvised coverings of the red, white and blue. An admirable band enlivened the waiting moments prior to and between the speeches, and Anderson's Glee Club made memorable in song an occasion which was aptly illustrated by two hundred and fifty soldiers from the Union depot, who had participated in many hard fought battles on other but not more important fields.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GREAT UNION MEETING; Enthusiastic Gathering at the Cooper Institute.

The cargo consisted of some 800 tons, put up in bales, and was on board the steamer Progress, and three barges in tow thereof. While passing down the Mississippi, one of the barges came in collision with the Crescent City, was sunk, and of the 382,950 pounds on board, 237,225 pounds were totally destroyed, being about nine per cent. of the entire quantity shipped. The total value of the barge was $20,000, and the amount of insurance thereon, $10,000, a premium of two and a half per cent. having been paid. A clause in the policy provides that the company would not be liable for losses, general average excepted, not amounting to twenty per cent. of the value of the articles insured. A recovery was claimed on the ground that the loss exceeded twenty per cent. of the lading of the barge sunk. It was argued that where the cargo consisted of anything put up in bales or individual packages, the estimate of the loss should be on the separate cargo of packages, and not on the whole amount shipped.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Important Decision as to the Construction of an Insurance Policy.; SUPREME COURT CIRCUIT.

The cause of his wrath, this time, is that President JOHNSON does not force negro suffrage upon the South. There is no measure to the tirade which this ""sin of omission"" evokes from this reveller in contumely. This is morally worth nothing. It is a thing of course. No public man ever did or ever will live in this country that was secure from this man's railing. He is nothing if not censorious. But his objurgations in this particular case have a certain significance from their breadth of sweep. He denounces not only President JOHNSON, but the whole Republican party for supporting him. He declares that ""there has not been a single Republican convention that has not indorsed the President;"" that ""the Republican party has not dared to utter the word suffrage -- has not dared to deny the President's plan."" Thereupon he proceeds to annihilate the Republican party. He avers that the party no longer exists -- that there is nothing left of it but ""a spectre walking through the country in its shroud."" This summary dispatch by the single arm of WENDELL PHILLIPS of a party that has just prostrated again to the dust the Democratic party in Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa is an exquisite piece of absurdity. Yet the animus with which it is done is worth something as an index of the real relations between this extreme radicalism, and that great party which raised ANDREW JOHNSON to power and constitutes his chief support.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Wendell Phillips' Denunciatious of President Johnson and the Union Party."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Wendell Phillips' Denunciatious of President Johnson and the Union Party."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8cab64e7-6309-5d30-844d-54c285226aae,1062,nyt://article/8cab64e7-6309-5d30-844d-54c285226aae,

Rebel Loan and its Repudiates,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/22/archives/the-rebel-loan-and-its-repudiators.html,Rebel Loan and its Repudiates,"-- The denials of English gentlemen whose names have been published as subscribing to the rebel loan suggest one or two reflections. During the progress of the war, even from its commencement, the very writers of indignant disclaimers of rebel investments were persistent in their assumption that the Confederates were, as contrasted with the upholders of the Union, eminently distinguished, not more the heroism than for absolute truthfulness. Now, the list which has caused such a fluttering among these advocates and supporters of blockade-running and sundry other developments of the war -- why not say it, of piracy itself, is of Confederate origin, as we are well assured. It turns out that it contained names inserted without authority -- names of men to whom were offered, but who did not accept, allotments therein, and which names were nevertheless evidently used, without contradiction, until they were made public by the rebel authorities to enhance the value of their securities. May we not suggest that the comparative value of the statements of the putters forth of the loan, and the denials of its moral if not pecuniary backers, is fairly a subject of discussion? There was a man who could have written with some pungency upon this subject, but the tongue and pen of THACKERAY are stilled forever.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL LOAN AND ITS REPUDIATORS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL LOAN AND ITS REPUDIATORS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10544c58-df86-5109-8925-d63cfe9e33fe,216,nyt://article/10544c58-df86-5109-8925-d63cfe9e33fe,

Weights and Measures,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/22/archives/weights-and-measures.html,Weights and Measures,"A very singular and learned work has lately been issued in London, on the subject of the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is written by Professor PIAZZI SMITH, Astronomer Royal of Scotland, who asserts, and endeavors to prove in it, that the system of weights and measures used in Great Britain, the United States, and some other countries, and also the recognized divisions of time, together with those of length, &c., emanated directly from the Deity, and are to be found illustrated, in their proper order, in the various dimensions, departments and galleries of that very celebrated and most ancient structure. The volume is full of curious researches and deductions, one of which is noticed. It respects the measure termed a quarter. The Professor declares we have no account of what it is the fourth part. But there he is mistaken, for it is the quarter of the chaldron, which latter, from its unwieldiness, is not often used, but which holds exactly the number of cubic inches (68,880) contained in the sarcophagus enclosed in the pyramid. Without following the learned author through the details by which he strives to establish the soundness of his theories, we are content with believing that the perfection of justice is one of the attributes of God, and with asserting that, with regard to the Israelites, he established such special divisions of weights and measures, and also in one instance appointed the way in which they should be used; honoring the measure for grain by especial notice in the command, ""A just Epha shalt thou have.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Weights and Measures.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Weights and Measures.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5a37d515-47b7-5977-9956-91e0f483d960,2076,nyt://article/5a37d515-47b7-5977-9956-91e0f483d960,

This is sometimes expressed in very bitter remarks. A leading gentleman, a friend and adviser of Mr. SEYMOUR, happened to be on a car a little while before the Albany meeting, when JOHN was expounding his views of HORATIO, in terms more emphatic than polite, and overheard his expressions. He at once wrote to Mr. SEYMOUR, telling him the facts, and urging him, in self-respect, and as he valued his reputation, not to appear on the same platform with the Prince. Hence the absence of the Governor. By the way, will not Hon. CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW, Secretary of State, inform us what JOHN VAN BUREN said to him on a certain occasion, concerning HORATIO SEYMOUR and other leaders of the Democratic party? JOHN has repeated a portion of the conversation from the stump, and it thus becomes public property.

The entrance to the office was through a second story window, which was reached by climbing a car standing alongside the building. The sale (WILDER's) was drilled, and a heavy charge of powder must have been used, as the door was blown completely off the safe and the windows of the office shattered and thrown into the street. The noise of the explosion must have been great, but the depot stands some distance from any dwelling, and if heard in the village did not attract any one to the place. Of the amount stolen, $2,000 was the private property of the Superintendent of the road, Mr. ROBERT WHITE. About 6 o'clock on Saturday morning, two men got on the down train at West Flushing, who appeared to act strangely, and the conductor, suspecting them of the burglary, had them arrested at Hunter's Point and handed over to the police of the Forty-Seventh Precinct. Sergt. BOCH, who was on duty at the station-house, searched the men thoroughly, but found nothing to warrant any suspicion of their complicity in the burglary. He afterward ascertained that they were employed by his mother in Greenpoint, and were on their way to work when arrested.

The circumstances recorded there are so much like those at present existing between the two great parties at the North, one of which stood by the Administration during the war, and the other arrayed itself against it, that we quote the passage at length: ""And all the people of Judah conducted the [victorious!] King, and also half the people of Israel. And, behold, all the men of Israel came and said to the King, 'Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen thee away, and have brought the King and his household, and all David's men with him over Jordan?' And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, 'Because the King is near of kin to us. Wherefore then be ye angry with us for this matter? Have we eaten at all of the King's cost, or hath he given us any gift? And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said. ""We have ten parts in the King, and ice have also more right in David than ye. Why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our King?"" The sequel is equally instructive with the narrative alluded to. ""A man of Belial,"" named Sheba, blew a trumpet and said, ""Everyman to his tents, O Israel!"" Whereupon the ten tribes once more rushed into rebellion, which was only brought to a close by the loss of the leader's head. That organization which assailed the late President as a vulgar buffoon, and the present as a boorish tailor, are to-day as vociferous as the subjugated ten tribes, that they have ""more right"" in ANDREW JOHNSON than the men who nominated, elected and supported him cordially till the close of the rebellion.

Sewarage of Large Cities,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/22/archives/the-sewerage-of-large-cities.html,Sewarage of Large Cities,"-- The rapid march of the cholera toward the shores of England seems to have quickened in the Londoners a sense of the peculiar dangers to which all large municipalities are subject in times of pestilence. Precautionary suggestions pour into the office of the London Times by the cart-load. Pleasing theories are elaborated in the columns of the newspapers and reviews, concerning the small chance which any inhabitant of the great city will have of escape. One of these suggestions, although upon an unsavory subject, seems to have some truth in if, and at the present time relates to a matter in which the citizens of New-York are interested. The City of London is drained by an extensive system of sewers, some of which have existed for ages, and through these year after year has rolled the accumulated filth of two millions of people. This sluggish current, sometimes stagnant, sometimes beaten back, and rising so as to flow into the streets at any available outlet, is continually giving forth noisome vapors, reeking with deadly poison, the very breath of death, and the life of pestilence and disease. An eminent citizen of London writes to the Times that every water-closet in that city communicates with the sewers directly, and that owing to faulty construction, they offer to these generators of foul and pestilent gases just so many escape-vents. Thus, in his opinion, the great and intricate sewerage of the city, far from doing any good, is a simple and perfect machine for distributing poison in regular doses to the inhabitants of every house. Various suggestions for ventilating the sewers have been brought out by this novel theory of the circulation of unhealthy gases through the dwellings of the Londoners, but we have only referred to the matter for the benefit of the Croton Aqueduct Commissioners, who are about to build a new system of sewers for the City of New-York. It seems to us that provision should be made as much to carry off the poison emitted by the masses of filth which sewers contain, as to carry off the filth itself, and that the drains should have no direct communication with any buildings or with the street, except through ventilators erected for the purpose.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SEWERAGE OF LARGE CITIES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SEWERAGE OF LARGE CITIES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/abc2f868-252a-5853-9755-bc5714e310fb,374,nyt://article/abc2f868-252a-5853-9755-bc5714e310fb,

For the transfer of troops to its various possessions in British America, during the years 1862, 1863 and 1864, their maintenance while here, and the necessary expenditure for stores, a sum of eighteen millions of dollars was disbursed. This includes, it is true, more than four millions of dollars paid out of colonial exchequers -- principally or entirely by the Canadian Government; but it would no doubt be within the mark to say that the dubious relations between the two countries, leaving a margin for obligations incurred which have not been published, would amount to an aggregate of twenty millions of dollars.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Cost of War The Advantages of Peace.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Cost of War The Advantages of Peace.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/409d244a-511b-59ca-a86f-c4c67ea08aab,988,nyt://article/409d244a-511b-59ca-a86f-c4c67ea08aab,

In this infected state be was treated by the most eminent physicians he could find, but the excruciating pain in his side and chest, which became insupportable, so much alarmed his friends, that in this last dismal waste of life, he was taken to the well-known Dr. Von Eisenberg, of our city. At the doctor's office he complained of weakness at the least bodily exertion, and when placed in the examination chair, the breathing was fearful, the pulse was small and quicker than natural; he complained of a tightness, as if a cord were drawn across the chest. The doctor, with his usual care, made an accurate diagnosis of the case, expressed willingness to undertake to treat him, and to attend to him to the best of his ability. The doctor declared himself to be always impressed with a decided belief that our wise and beneficent Creator has placed within the reach of His feeble creature, men, a cure for all diseases; that he has often cored this fatal complaint by assiduous attention and careful judgment.

In the reply of the British Secretary, which he seems to have taken several weeks to frame, there are strong protests of the honor which has characterized all the dealings of the QUEEN's Government, and there is what appears to be a positive and final disclaimer of all responsibility for the aid and shelter given to the rebel cruizers in British ports.

They were consigned to the firm of M. Echeverria & Co., and by them entered at the Custom-house. The shipper of the goods was Joseph San Roman of Matamoras, and the affidavit taken before the American Consul and attached to the invoice stated that the price in the invoice was the ""true cost value"" of the goods. The wool was invoiced at six cents a pound. On entering it here, the consignees advanced its price two cents a pound, to bring it up to market value. On appraisal at the Custom-house, the value was fixed at ten cents a pound for a part, and sixteen cents for the rest, in gold. A second appraisement was had, and the appraisement was confirmed.

The ""solid parts referred to in the brilliant passage, are those in which the ""Prince"" says that a successful reconstruction must cause a remodeling of the Cabinet, and proposes to replace Mr. STANTON by Gov. AIKEN, of South Carolina; and where he also suggests MT. JOHNSON as the nominee of the Democratic party in 1868. Fearful that these bold and patriotic expressions might be lost sight of amid the scintillations of such wondrous wit, the Democratic organ takes occasion not only to call particular attention to them, but to fully indorse all that was contained therein, and proceeds to say that if the Presidential election were to take place this Fall instead of three years hence, there could be no doubt whatever that the Democratic party would nominate President JOHNSON, and would not for a moment entertain a thought of nominating anybody else.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Democratic Party and President Johnson.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Democratic Party and President Johnson.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/11a76434-2e22-53d5-a6d6-240559fa95de,759,nyt://article/11a76434-2e22-53d5-a6d6-240559fa95de,

Their productions, indeed, up to the present time, have far from kept pace with the demand, and, go where you will, the complaint is universal that it is impossible to get work done; neither printers nor binders will make new engagements until after Christmas, and a large proportion of the promised new books will have to be laid over from sheer inability to manufacture them. Some accidental causes have increased this pressure. Owing to the long-continued drouth in the Eastern States, most of the paper mills in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, from whence come the chief supplies of printing paper, are absolutely at a stand, and are unable to complete their existing contracts. The price of paper has in consequence largely advanced, and there is little appearance at present of anything like a return to moderate terms.

A large attendance was present, and the exercises were full of interest. Rev. THOMAS ARMITAGE, D.D., President of the Union, presided. The annual report was read by Rev. CHAS. A. BUCKBEE, Recording Secretary. This report related mainly to efforts made by the American Bible Union in the circulation of the Scriptures in Spain, Italy, China, Siam, India and Africa, and among the freedmen of the South. The new translation of the Scriptures has progressed favorably. The report states that since the last anniversary, the work on the Old Testament has been recommenced by Dr. CONANT. Dr. BLISS is still prosecuting his labors for the Union on the historical books. The coming year, it is hoped, will be distinguished by the publication of a considerable portion of this part of the Bible. It also afforded the agreeable and interesting information that a pulpit and family Testament, in large print, has just been published. It has been a work of great labor, both in preparation and execution. The poetic parts have been printed in poetic form, thus exhibiting the indications of rhythm which appear in the original, and all the quotations from the Old Testament are so presented as to leave no doubt where they commence and where they close. Very many improvements in the translation from the original have also been made, which will be introduced into the plates of the 16mo. This, it is claimed, is the clearest exhibition of the revelation of God in any existing version of the Sacred Scriptures.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMERICAN BIBLE UNION.; Sixteenth Anniversary Meeting of the Union Proceedings of the Session.

"-- Senator HENDERSON, of Missouri, in a recent speech, gave the following account of an interview with President JOHNSON: ""When recently in Washington, I called on him, and had a full and frank talk with him in reference to all the questions connected with his reconstruction policy. In that connection he stated that, in his view, the States attempting to secede were still in the Union, and had always been. That slavery was practically abolished in those States, and must be entirely so to secure admission of their members into Congress -- that they must adopt the Constitutional Amendment destroying slavery throughout the nation, and provide in their own constitutions that hereafter property shell not exist in man. Taking his stand-point that the States are still in the Union, he does not think that he can consistently interfere with the franchise in those States, or in any other, that is, that he can confer it upon persons not enjoying it, under the respective State constitutions as they existed before the rebellion. But, as an individual, he desires that the negro shall be enfranchised, and would be gratified to see the several conventions extend the franchise to all persons of color who can read the Constitution of the United States in English, and write their names, and also to all persons of color who own real estate valued at not less than $250, and who pay taxes thereon. I have now quoted the precise words of the President, and you will see that, if the Democratic party indorse him, they must indorse negro suffrage, and thus remove the last plank from their platform. I am rejoiced myself to see all parties indorsing the President. I am satisfied he is doing the best he can to restore peace and harmony between the sections. He may commit errors. It would be strange if he did not. Of one thing, I think we may all rest assured, and that is, whenever he finds an error, he will correct it, and correct it on the side of justice and the Union.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/26/archives/president-johnsons-views.html,,"-- Senator HENDERSON, of Missouri, in a recent speech, gave the following account of an interview with President JOHNSON: ""When recently in Washington, I called on him, and had a full and frank talk with him in reference to all the questions connected with his reconstruction policy.

on our Sick and Wounded Soldiers,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/26/archives/gen-meade-on-our-sick-and-wounded-soldiers.html,on our Sick and Wounded Soldiers,"-- In the course of his speech at the opening of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Fair in Philadelphia, on Monday evening, Maj.-Gen. MEADE said: ""I am sorry that in the short time which I have had to prepare for this occasion I could not appeal to the records in order that I might give you some idea of the great debt -- of its magnitude in numbers -- our Union has yet to pay. But I was fortunately in position to have recourse to the records of a single army -- the Army of the Potomac -- [great and continued applause] -- which I had the honor for two years to command -- [renewed applause] -- fortunate in being in command of it at the close of the rebellion. [Applause.] I was in a position to take a close glance at them, and I am able to tell you, on examination, that at the close of the war there were reported to the government, as wounded, over one hundred and twenty-five thousand men. Now, of course, large numbers of them were slightly wounded, many of them returned to the ranks, not disabled. But take a very small percentage of all these -- one-fifth of all these numbers -- at least 25,000 have been disabled out of these 125,000. It will be necessary to take care of these in some way or other -- those disabled from wounds received in battle. Now these are the returns from only one army. It is one of the largest of our armies, I know, that the government had during the war, and did some of the hardest of the fighting. [Applause.] But it is not these 25,000 men alone who have to be taken, care of, but the disabled of the whole armies, East and West. When we know them, then only can we realize the whole mass of suffering. And how are we to take care of these poor men? The answer maybe that they may be taken care of some time by the government, national, State or municipal. But the government is slow to move. There is a Legislature or a Congress, and many men take long to act, and the work cannot go on without appropriations by Congress. A few days ago I had to go to Washington. I am a member of an institution whose object it is to establish a national home for soldiers and sailors. A hundred gentlemen are appointed as corporators, and over fifty must be present before anything can be done on this subject. Three times I have been to Washington, but not once were fifty collected, and upon the last meeting, in order to do anything, it was determined to appeal to Congress for special legislation. So it is with the General Government; so it is, in a measure, with the State Governments. But these poor fellows cannot wait, and to your energetic charity they look to-night.""",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GEN.

The Spirit of the,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/26/archives/the-spirit-of-the-south.html,The Spirit of the,"-- The Southern people have undergone a number of extraordinary and violent fluctuations of feeling within the last twelvemonth. In October of last year, they were still confident of their success in establishing a government upon which all their hopes were based, and on the success of which the greater part of them had staked their lives. They had met with disasters, but they still had two great and brave armies, and held possession of a vast territory. In the next month of, November, began SHERMAN's march which, in connection with the tremendous pressure they then began to feel from GRANT at Richmond, and the terrible blow they received in the West, affected their spirits greatly and drove them into something like a panic. The continued action of the two former influences depressed their feelings profoundly by the opening of the year. They nerved themselves up, however, till GRANT's ceaseless menaces and blows, and SHERMAN's near approach to their capital, were enough to drive them mad. Then GRANT began to deliver the last tremendous series of assaults; then despair of spirits united with desperation of action, until, with the destruction of LEE; tumbled at once all their Confederate hope. For a season after this they were sombre, and there were signs of pride struggling through their crushed feelings. Time and Summer went on, and the harp sting of defeat began to pass away, and reason began to reassert itself, and calmness began to succeed passion, and the dictates of necessity were felt to be such. Lately they have been in perfect quiet and quiescence, gaining in strength, and contentedly resuming their old position and duties. In a few months more they will be in the enjoyment of perfect sanity. They have lost a fortune, but all the elements of vitality and of other fortunes are still with them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SPIRIT OF THE SOUTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SPIRIT OF THE SOUTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee3808e9-27f3-5706-b3f0-2996bd19b710,308,nyt://article/ee3808e9-27f3-5706-b3f0-2996bd19b710,

"DEATH OF A WOMAN UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. -- Yesterday forenoon, Coroner BARRETT was notified that a woman named ANNE JOHNSON, 35 years of age, died under suspicious circumstances, about 3 o'clock the same morning, at No. 8 Marshal-street, E.D. The facts thus far developed show that deceased, who is a native of Germany, was the wife of a colored man, whose name she bore. She had been living, for some time previous to her death, in a house of questionable repute in Broadway, kept by a Mrs. JONES. Her husband is absent in the army. Last week Mrs. JONES and deceased quarreled, the former being jealous of an intimacy existing between Mr. JONES and Mrs. JOHNSON. In consequence of this quarrel, deceased left Mrs. JONES' house on Monday last, and took up her residence at the place where she died. On Tuesday she was visited by Mrs. JONES, and a quarrel ensued. On Wednesday she called again, and the quarrel was renewed, but it is stated that they afterward purchased some liquor and drank together. After this Mrs. JOHNSON became very sick, and she sent for some medicine. Some powders were obtained, one of which she took, but she got no relief, and expired after much suffering at 3 A.M. Thursday. Some of the powders were found in her room, one of which was shown a druggist, who stated as his opinion that it consisted of corrosive sublimate.

The fact that the finances abroad were not at all influenced by the publication of the correspondence, shows that Lombard and Thread-needle streets at least, were perfectly calm over the matter, and that all the 'apprehensions' of a break in the friendly relations of the two governments were confined to the editorial sanctums of the London journals.

Some of them startle the expectant public with the coinage of a word presumably derived from Grecian mythology. Others resort to some mathematical or algebraic expression, and mutilate it into a form suitable to their purpose. And yet another class, of less originality, seize upon current slang, and render it subservient to the embellishment of their scarcely marketable commodities. Mr. WENDELL PHILLIPS announced himself as belonging to the latter class, when he drew together a company of listeners at the Cooper Institute on Wednesday evening, by placarding the dead walls of the city with his handbills, in which he declared ""the South victorious."" The South has been declared victorious, over and over again, by the poor Richmond editors; by the people who manufactured the Chicago platform; by the London Times, its money editor and its Liverpool correspondent, SPENCE; by Sir HENRY DE HOGTOWN and the subscribers to the Southern cotton loan; by LAIRD, the ram-builder; and by JOHN MITCHEL, of the New-York Daily News. And having regard to all these authorities, Mr. W. PHILLIPS comes hither by express from Boston, heralding his approach with the announcement that what these touters of the defunct Confederacy, these ram-builders and cotton speculators had declared a fact, was true. Nothing to this arrant pretender and quack that the cause of loyalty, honor and freedom had triumphed in the death of tens of thousands of the best and bravest men of the nation!

FARWELL, the young Bostonian whom a Washington jury have accused of the murder of his paramour, HARRIET WELLES, was arrested in West Broadway, yesterday afternoon, by Detective Officers ELDER and MCCORD. The murder was committed on Monday morning last, in the victim's brothel, in Thirteen-and-a-half street, Washington. It appears that FARWELL became enamored of the deceased when she dwell in Albany, and that he accompanied her thence to Washington. He appears to have been a rejected suitor for her hand, and is alleged to have said that if she would not marry him she should be no person's bride; and in pursuance of this threat he is said to have administered chloroform while she was asleep, and to have strangled her and thrust her corpse into a closet. The Washington police, immediately after the commission of the deed, communicated by telegraph with the police of the seaboard and other cities, describing FARWELL, and making it known that he probably had the gold watch which had been worn by the murdered woman; and with this information our detective officers undertook to find the fugitive. He was captured while in the act of pawning a lady's watch, which is believed to have belonged to the victim, and this watch, which is in the hands of the police, may be an important link in the chain of evidence against the accused. FARWELL was taken to the Headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, last evening, and there held to await the arrival of officers from Washington -- for whom Inspector LEONARD telegraphed, and one of whom (Detective CLARVOE) was put aboard the night train for this city by Chief-of-Police A.C. RICHARDS, of Washington. The deceased, who was quite respectably connected, had a son at school at New-Brunswick, N.J. The TIMES is requested to say that FARWELL sold to some person in this city, recently, a lady's gold chain, and that the purchaser thereof (who, if he conceals it, may be held as accessory after the fact of the murder) is requested to deliver it to the Superintendent of Metropolitan Police.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Latest Washington Tragedy.; ARREST OF LEVI FARWELL, THE ALLEGED MURDERER, IN NEW YORK.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Latest Washington Tragedy.; ARREST OF LEVI FARWELL, THE ALLEGED MURDERER, IN NEW YORK.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bc937be7-3928-5484-91bc-48c500bd97b0,347,nyt://article/bc937be7-3928-5484-91bc-48c500bd97b0,

The Navy Department ordered the Winooski to take the place occupied by the Algonquin, and the Algonquin to go on the other side.

It is alleged that the seizure of this alcohol will bring to light a system of frauds against the government in which certain parties in the New-York Custom-house are implicated. The manner in which they operated appears to be this: They would enter in bond a quantity of goods for exportation, ship them on board outward-bound vessels, and transfer them again to other vessels and lighters, which succeed in evading, or rather are permitted to land the goods, thus defrauding the government out of the whole amount of the duty, which on the article of alcohol is very heavy.

"-- A recent supplement of the Calcutta Gazette contains a very interesting report from Mr. ANDERSON, of the damage sustained by the Botanical Gardens during the destructive cyclone of October last. The fury of the storm was greater at the gardens than in the City of Calcutta, since they were nearer the centre of the storm; but it seems to have been principally owing to the ""open surface of the river across which the gale at its height blew diagonally, and thus struck the garden with a force unbroken, for the space of a mile, by any obstacle whatever. Few trees fell before 11 o'clock on the 5th of October, and almost none after 4:30 P.M. At 4 o'clock the great specimen of Andansonia digitata, the Baobab tree of Africa, was uprooted, and fall with a crash that caused vibrations in the earth, which were felt at a distance of some hundred yards. Three gigantic specimens of Casuarina equisitifolia, the oldest of the species in the garden, and none of them less than 150 feet in height, fell comparatively early in the storm."" It trill take years to repair the damage done to those beautiful gardens, and no description can give an accurate idea of it. ""The scene in the garden, the morning after the cyclone, was most dismal,"" says the Superintendent. ""A thousand trees, many of them gigantic specimens and the pride of the garden, were prostrated, besides innumerable shrubs of which no account could be kept. Nothing had been spared, and those trees that had not fallen were more or less stripped of their branches; some recorded as standing were mere bare poles, without a branch. Not a vestige of a leaf, flower or fruit remained in the garden."" The destruction among the smaller plants in pots has been of equal extent, but these losses are of secondary importance compared with the destruction of trees, many of them the growth of three-quarters of a century. Several specimens were only in cultivation in the Calcutta garden, ""and some of them are known to botanists only by dried specimens and descriptions of those trees now lost.....In the teak avenue, along the road from KYD's monument to the large bridge over the khal, only two mutilated specimens remain. The trees in this avenue were sixty-nine years old. Out of sixty-seven mahogany trees, thirty-one have been blown down. The mahogany grove, consisting of trees forty-five years old, is destroyed."" The cycadeae and palms, and the endogenous trees generally, seem to have escaped with comparatively little injury. The report, which extends over ten pages of the size of the London Gazette, concludes with a detailed list of the trees injured. It appears from this that 1,010 specimens have been totally destroyed.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/28/archives/scientific-notes.html,,"-- A recent supplement of the Calcutta Gazette contains a very interesting report from Mr. ANDERSON, of the damage sustained by the Botanical Gardens during the destructive cyclone of October last.

Though the collier was a claimant, the heir to the property is Mr. RICHARD BACKHOUSE, of Liverpool, whose solicitors write: ""The report has arisen, we believe, from certain proceedings in ejectment which were lately commenced against some of the tenants of the property by this same THOMAS, during which, owing to the tenants failing to enter an appearance or communicate with the receiver appointed by the Court of Chancery, he obtained temporary possession of their dwellings and farms, from which, however, he has not only been ordered by Vice-Chancellor WOOD to withdraw, but was, along with the Sheriff and Under Sheriff of Glanmorganshire, as the officers executing the writ of possession, ordered to pay the costs of their illegal proceedings on pain of attachment. Our client, Mr. RICHARD BACKHOUSE, of Liverpool, is the proved heir-at-law of the former owner of the estates, and we are happy to say that his title is perfectly clear, and depends not upon any such misty pedigree as that rested upon by this would-be fortunate collier or by those who, fostering his hallucination, made him the the hero of a comedy called 'A Reverse of Fortune.'

The female recently changed her place of abode to the Second Ward of Washington City, and FARWELL followed her thither and there pressed his suit, but was rejected; and resolved that if the object of his affections would not become his bride she should marry no other man, he went to her bed-chamber and applied chloroform while she slept, on Monday morning last, and having paralyzed her with the other, strangled her and thrust her corpse into a closet. He fled to this city, taking a small gold watch which she had worn. Chief of Police A.C. RICHARDS, of Washington, having secured a description of the fugitive and the watch, telegraphed to the Metropolitan Police, and our detective officers -- ELDER and MCCORD -- putting their peculiar machinery in motion, traced him, after searching three days and nights, to a house in West Broadway, and there captured him on Thursday evening. When taken, FARWELL had his victim's watch on his person, and knowing it to be the only tangible evidence against him, strove to conceal it; but in this attempt he was defeated. Detectives ELDER and MCCORD took their prisoner to Police Headquarters And incarcerated him in Murderer's Cell -- the same wherein BEALE and KENNEDY, and another murderer who committed suicide therein, were held while in custody at Headquarters -- and he was left for the night under care of doorman ROBERT P. BROWN. Inspector LEONARD, meantime, telegraphed to Washington, and Detective JOHN A.W. CLARVOE, of that city, was dispatched to receive the prisoner; but on the officer's arrival here, yesterday morning, FARWELL was found to have committed suicide. It appears that subsequent to his imprisonment at about 10 o'clock on Thursday evening, his food was passed into his cell on a tin plate -- the attendants giving him no knife or fork, lest he should make improper use thereof; and having no sharp instrument, he tore the plate in two, and with its jagged edges opened a vein in his right arm, and, lying over on his prison couch, died of hemorrhage. Murderers' Cell, wherein FARWELL died, is on the ground or basement floor, underneath the Detective's office, and is approached by a staircase from that office or from the apartments of the Broadway Police, on the Mott-street side of the police building; but it is surrounded by solid masonry and seldom visited at night, it being the duty of the night watchmen merely to see that no prisoner escapes. The cell is so situated that the inmate is completely concealed from the watchmen outside, and all that the police can do to prevent their prisoners from committing suicide in this place is to deprive them of weapons. When found, yesterday morning, the body was quite cold, and under the head was a bloodstained note, written in pencil, bequeathing FARWELL's effects to his brother, and saying that he was going to meet ""HATTIE."" Coroner WILDEY impaneled a jury, and a verdict of ""suicide"" having been rendered, the body was surrendered Mr. CHARLES H. FARWELL, of Washington, brother of the deceased.

His inaction led the South to suppose the government intended to be inactive, and when Mr. LINCOLN came in they regarded the Union as dead. His call for troops, therefore, seemed to them vindictive -- not as the act of a government exerting its rightful power and vindicating its just authority, but as an attempt to punish them for the steps already taken.

An interesting study of this sort, in natural history, has recently been furnished us in a new and unexpected quarter. One would hardly look for ornithological analogies in the developments of a political party -- the great unterrified Democratic party, for instance -- unless, indeed, it might be found in the memorable attitude of that famous rhetorical eagle who, standing on the highest peak of the Alleghanies, stretched one wing to the Rocky Mountains and the other to the Atlantic ocean -- and split in a blaze of glory.

The opportunity seeming propitious, the captain and a young man named PETER JOHNSON, determined to enjoy a salt-water bath. Jumping into the water, it was not many minutes when young JOHNSON says he saw something ""all white,"" and in an instant he was carried under the surface to a depth of twenty feet. He now discovered that he was in the jaws of one of those voracious man-eater sharks. Struggling with all his strength, JOHNSON managed to break away and reach the surface again; but the shark was soon after him, and continued to bite him in various parts of the body, when the young man bethought him of the sailor trick of putting his fingers in the shark's eyes, which he did, and to his no small gratification soon saw the frenzied monster fleeing from him. JOHNSON now swim to the vessel, and being taken aboard, was found to have been fearfully torn about the abdomen -- its lower section entirely off -- both thighs and shoulders being terribly lacerated. There being no wind to get anywhere, the crew took him in the yawl and rowed him eight miles to the village of Greenport, where his wounds were sewed up and dressed by Drs.

"Red Jacket Medal, History of the; Red Jacket and the Six Nations, History of",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/29/archives/the-red-jacket-medal.html,"Red Jacket Medal, History of the; Red Jacket and the Six Nations, History of","There is now on exhibition at the jewelry-store of Messrs. BROWNE SPAULDING, under the Metropolitan Hotel, a curious medal, formerly the property of the famous Indian Chief RED JACKET, and now belonging to one of his descendants, Col. PARKER, of Gen. GRANT'S staff. The history of this relic of revolutionary days is somewhat interesting. After the revolution, the six nations of Indians were left by their allies, the British, to secure a treaty of peace for themselves as best they could with the American Government. In 1784, the first preliminary treaty was made. In 1794, a final and definite treaty of peace was made and concluded. During the pendency of the final negotiations in 1792, a deputation of the six nations of Indians visited Washington, and were presented with several medals of this size. With this deputation was RED JACKET, who was just then coming into notice as an orator, and at that visit made quite an impression upon Gen. WASHINGTON, then President of the United States. RED JACKET was selected as a recipient of one of the medals. A profound veneration and friendship was created in RED JACKET's mind toward Gen. WASHINGTON, which he retained until the day of his death, in 1833. Of the great number of presents received by RED JACKET in his several visits to Washington, this medal was the only relic he retained to the day of his death. His regard for it arose from the fact that it was given in evidence of the good will and friendship of the United States toward the Six Nations. Its brightness was said to be emblematical of the brightness of the peace entered into, and the material, the value of the great friendship which should ever thereafter continue between the United States and the Indians. No tarnish could rest upon its white surface without its being immediately seen, and the parties to the compact, of which it was an emblem, could immediately unite their efforts and remove it. RED JACKET always wore the medal on all great and state occasions, and it was his pride in his speeches to allude to its emblematic character, At his death, in 1833, it was made a sort of heir-loom, and descended to his nephew, JAMES JOHNSON, a protege of his and a Seneca Chief. JOHNSON was apparently an proud of the sacred memento as was his illustrious predecessor. In 1851, however, unknown to the Indians generally, some parties prevailed upon JOHNSON to part with it for a small consideration, to the New-York State Museum at Albany. In its transit it was intercepted by Col. PARKER, then living at Rochester, New-York, who paid the consideration that JOHNSON expected for it. Col. PARKER retained it until 1852, when the principal sachemship of the Senecas and the Six Nations having become vacant by the death of JOHN BLACKSMITH, he was installed into the office and formally invested with the medal as an official badge. Col. PARKER has since retained the medal as an official medal, although it is not probable that it will be continued after his death, as the Indians are gradually abolishing the system of government by chiefs and adopting republican forms of government.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Red Jacket Medal.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Red Jacket Medal.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3320a8b5-0aa6-5e30-8d30-09cca9569622,533,nyt://article/3320a8b5-0aa6-5e30-8d30-09cca9569622,

It appears that the functions of the Envoy Extraordinary from Nassau to Darmsdat were confined, according to official documents of 1863, to -- 1. The paying a visit to the Minister of Hesse; 2. having an audience with the Grand Duke; and 3, being, present at the marriage of a Princess. For each of these acts the Envoy Extraordinary sent in a note of expenses, the amount of which excited the surprise and hilarity of the chamber. Another diplomatist represents at the Diet of Frankfort both Nassau and Brunswick. In consequence of this he has found himself forced, in 1862, to combat in the name of Nassau actively in the Diet the treaty of commerce with France, and to defend not less warmly the same treaty in the name of Brunswick. In the same way be protested, on behalf of Nassau, against the Prussian dispatch of 20th December, 1861, relative to federal reform, and supported energetically the same dispatch on behalf of Brunswick.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FOREIGN ITEMS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/860fc37a-52f0-5729-acb4-e8710296de31,742,nyt://article/860fc37a-52f0-5729-acb4-e8710296de31,

"A catastrophe almost unparalleled for the horrors with which it was attended is reported by the last mail from Calcutta. It was occasioned by the loss of a vessel -- the Eagle Speed -- and yet it can scarcely be designated as a shipwreck, but rather a cold blooded massacre of some hundreds of human beings. Let us briefly refer to the facts. On Sunday, August 19, a cargo of 497 coolies, natives of India, consisting of 305 men, 93 women, 65 children under ten, and 39 infants in arms embarked in the Eagle Speed, Captain BRINSDEN, from Port Canning for Demerara. This practice, carried on to stock the labor market of the West Indies recognized and placed under restrictions to prevent abuses. It will be observe from the classification of the passengers that about two-fifths of the whole would be almost completely helpless in an hour of great danger. The ship seems to have been average vessel. All the usual formalities of inspection were observed except one, that of mustering the crew by the pilot, which it seems was a duty which should by no means have been neglected. Only six men were fit for work. The captain was ailing, and he was anxious to get out to sea, ""that there his men might get well after a debauch on land;"" the chief officer was off duty, and even the coolie doctor was ill; but the port doctor, Capt. HOSKINS, took his place and accompanied the ship down the estuary. She was towed by the Lady Elgin, a Calcutta steamer, Capt. HEATH, on board of which as a passenger was Capt. W.G. MAITLAND, of the Twenty-ninth Punjabees. At 4 o'clock the next day, during rough weather, the tow-rope broke, and whilst efforts were being made to stretch another the ship drifted on to some sands and sprang a leak. This it is asserted would not have occurred had the ship been an iron one or new. Then with a bad leak and heavy weather, instead of towing the ship back to Halliday Island, the nearest good anchorage, the steamer took her out towards sea, the consequence being that the steamer also broke down at 10 that night, and both had to anchor. During the whole of this time, from 4 o'clock to 10, the coolies were kept at the pumps, and they continued working until 3 the next (Tuesday) morning. The Eagle Speed was then sinking fast, and the steamer was signalled for help. The steamer, however, neither towed the ship with her living freight back to Halliday Island, nor passed lines by which the coolies might have boarded her, nor sent off her own boats to help in transhipping them. The sea was high, but all of the witnesses assert that any one of these plans might have been adopted, and would have saved every soul on board. Instead of this, only three of the ship's boats were lowered. The shrieking coolies clung to the gangways and bulwarks, eager to save themselves, and a few threw themselves into the water on hencoops and were picked up. One boat, manned by the pilot and crew, made one trip and never returned. A second, manned by the second officer and others of the crew, was stove in after the first trip. Capt. HOSKINS made five trips, till sunstroke disabled him. Then the steamer put down one of its three boats, and it was long till the offer of money and shame would induce the now saved ship's crew to man it. They positively refused to save their Captain, who was still on the wreck. At last they made two trips, bringing him and the Coolie doctor and others off. The scene that ensued on the ship is described as something terrible; the interpreter had disappeared; the pilot had not returned; no orders could be given; no person could speak a word of the language of the unfortunate creatures; the Captain left at half-past twelve, and though the ship did not sink for eighteen hours after, the steamer actually put about and returned to Port Canning with only 169 coolies saved; leaving some three hundred human beings, without a word of advice or encouragement, to a fate too horrible almost to be pictured. All Tuesday afternoon and night they watched death slowly approaching them, -- the ship sinking lower and lower, the sullen waves creeping nearer and nearer to them, the breakers washing off the exhausted, and the strong battling with death, and climbing higher and higher on the masts. The dawn of Wednesday brought the unhappy beings no ray of hope, and at 7 o'clock they were swallowed up by the waves which had so long been waiting for their prey. Two steamers came from Calcutta and found three little children clinging to the top of a mast. A few others saved themselves on pieces of the wreck: but no less than 265 of the 497 coolies were lost. To add to the horrors of the tale, if that is possible, several of the poor wretches who escaped a watery grave were devoured by tigers on landing on the mud islets. One left his companion for a moment and returned to see him in a tiger's jaws. In desperation he again committed himself to the mercy of the waves to escape from a like fate. The catastrophe has roused the indignation of the people of Calcutta to the highest pitch. Of course an inquiry has been instituted, and it will be hard indeed if those responsible for the frightful calamity do not receive their just deserts. For the conduct of the crew there is no excuse; it was such as Englishmen are rarely guilty of, and can only be accounted for by the condition in which they sailed. Capt. HOSKINS seems to have done his duty nobly, and he declares that every soul on board might have been saved. The Captain of the steamer excuses himself on the ground that he had only one day's coal on board, but at least he could have lent the assistance of his boats. The pilot is most severely blamed. He knew the language of those whom he had in charge, and yet never returned to the wreck, excusing himself on the ground that the crew would not work, and that his boat was smashed -- there being at the same time other boats which he could have obtained. The correspondent who communicated these facts winds up with an earnest appeal for the abolition of the coolie trade.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/29/archives/a-horrible-catastrophe.html,,"A catastrophe almost unparalleled for the horrors with which it was attended is reported by the last mail from Calcutta.

The wages of labor rise, comforts are spread abroad, luxuries are in demand, as was never before known in the experience of those countries. The great middle class are acquiring what was once the possession of the aristocracy, and the laboring class are approaching more the position of the corresponding class in this country.

Those who were in power at Richmond, however, pursued a different course, and the result has been such a sacrifice as no people have suffered. The restoration of the Federal Union gives assurance of peace and civil liberty. Disunion is civil war, anarchy, military despotism and all its attendant evils.

Y., had been suffering for years from Consumption, with a severe putrid infections sore throat, to make use of his own words, a hurried respiration, hot and offensive breath, the skin of burning and disagreeable heat, without the least moisture; the pulse quick, hard and irregular, averaging from 100 to 140 strokes per minute; the mouth and throat presenting a fiery appearance, the palate and glands painfully swelled; combined with a pain in the chest, the whole countenance presenting a ghastly, cadaverous look; the white part of the eye had a pearly, unnatural appearance, and, strange to say, the eye itself beamed with sparkling animation and lustre; the expectoration was copious and frequent; white, frothy and sometimes tough opaque substance, solid, of a yellow or green color, having a fetid smell when thrown on burning coals. In this infected state he was treated by the most eminent physicians he could find, but the excruciating pain in his side and chest, which became insupportable, so much alarmed his friends, that in this last dismal waste of life, he was taken to the well-known Dr. Von Eisenberg, of our city. At the doctor's office he complained of weakness at the least bodily exertion, and when placed in the examination chair, the breathing was fearful, the pulse was small and quicker than natural he complained of a tightness, as if a cord were drawn across the chest. The doctor, with his usual care, made an accurate diagnosis of the case, expressed willingness to undertake to treat him, and to attend to him to the best of are ability. The doctor declared himself to be always impressed with a decided belief that our wise and beneficent Creator has placed within the reach of his feeble creature, man, a cure for all diseases; that he has often cured this fatal complaint by assiduous attention and careful judgment. The preliminary arrangements were made; Dr. Von Eisenberg operated on the patient, after which Mr. Patterson declared himself to be very much relieved, since which time the patient has been under the doctor's care for a few weeks. To the patient's inexpressible delight, as well as to the great satisfaction of his friends, he has entirely recovered, and has just now come to New-York for the purpose of asking the doctor to allow him to resume his usual business. He looks remarkably strong, and his face is filled out and looks stouter than over it has been; in fact, he says for the last twelve years he never enjoyed a single night's rest, and now he sleeps as sound as an infant; and, according to his own words, he seems to have an iron digestion. He appears anxious to make known the great benefit he has derived from Doctor Von Eisenberg's skillful and successful treatment to all who suffer from this wasting and fatal complaint, and the Doctor's unremitting attention to his patients.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION; THE FOLLOWING APPEARED IN THE NEW-YORK EXPRESS, IT IS VERY ENCOURAGING.

The first race was for single scull 17-feet working boats, for the champion silver belt, a very handsome and costly affair, manufactured by Messrs. TIFFANY & CO. This belt is the property of the club, and is offered for annual competition. The entries for this race were as follows: Meteor, rowed by W.A. KNAPP; David Banks, Jr., rowed by GEO. ROAHR; and the Zephyr, rowed by WM.C. MAINLAND. The start was an excellent one, and for some two or three hundred feet the contestants kept well together; after this the David Banks, Jr., rowed by ROAHR, took the lead, gradually increasing it to the end of the race, coming in an easy winner in 27:40; Zephyr second, in 29:55; Meteor last, in 30:30. The second race was between the married and single members of the club, in four-oared shell-boats. The New-York was rowed by the following married members: Alden S. Swan, stroke; W.C. Mainland, Ransom Parker and George Roahr, bow. The single members manned the Knickerbocker as follows: B. Russell, stroke; W.A. Knapp, John J. Wilson and John H. Lindsey, bow. At the signal they got off evenly, the New-York obtaining a slight advantage by being pulled more steadily than the Knickerbocker. The race was, however, a close one while the boats were in sight; the New-York turned the upper stake-boat first, and came down the homestretch closely pursued by her bachelor rival until she passed the judge's yacht, a winner by one boat's length, in 23:45.

It is natural, undoubtedly, for the people to stand by a man who has stood by them, and HAMPTON's active and effective share in the rebellion has evidently commended him to the confidence and support of the people of his State. But the people of South Carolina can scarcely afford just now to indulge these personal preferences to so great an extent. They are not yet in position to insist upon the unrestricted enjoyment of their political sentiments. They may still believe, as probably most of them do, that they had a right to secede; but they must remember that this right is no longer open to discussion. It has been decided against them in the field of their own selection. They profess to acquiesce in the result, and, on the strength of that acquiescence, they seek restoration to their old status in the Union. They cannot doubt that the strongest disposition exists throughout the country to accept their professions as sincere, and to concede what they demand. But this disposition will not be strengthened by the election to office of the most conspicuous and defiant of the rebel leaders. So far as they are personally concerned, we have faith in their fidelity. They are men of strong convictions, resolute action, and sincere in their declarations. They proved their sincerity in the cause of secession, and we have little doubt that they are just as sincere in conceding its failure, and in pledging themselves now to the cause of the Union and the coun- But they must not expect the government or the people to accept personal assurances of this kind as conclusive, or as a safe basis for action.

Possibly, in the very guarded and restricted form given to this opinion, it may be true.

It reserves that high pledge for the several States of its own Union.

The popularity of MARCUS L. WARD, our candidate for Governor, is unbounded and well deserved. The committees have been unwearied and practical in their labors. KILPATRICK has swept through the political battle-field as he used to sweep around and over the rebel cavalry. And LOGAN, of Illinois, comes in to wind up the contest with such heavy blows as he alone can strike. He speaks to-night at Jersey City, and then goes to one or two other places in the State. We hope he will reserve a few days for service in New-York.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NEW-JERSEY ELECTION.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/10/30/archives/brooklyn-news.html,,"A GENERAL JAIL DELIVERY -- SEVEN CRIMINALS SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON ESCAPE THROUGH THE ROOF. -- Seven prisoners, who had been sentenced in the Kings County Court of Sessions on Saturday, and who had been remanded to jail for safe keeping until they could be transferred to Sing Sing, effected their escape some time during Saturday night. The prisoners were confined in two adjoining cells in the upper tier of the male prison, and it seems that an entrance was gained from the outside through the roof. The manner in which the entrance was effected appears to be thus: The outside parties mounted the roof of the dead-house, which adjoins the jail inclosure on the easterly side, and by means of a rope-ladder, which was in some way fastened on the top of the fence, they mounted. The fence is braced against the jail building with heavy wooden beams, over which a person can easily walk, and thus gain the roof of that portion in which the prisoners are confined. A hole was cut in the roof, the deliverers descended, and with skeleton keys soon succeeded in unlocking the; cell doors. The prisoners then escaped through the aperture, and, by means of the beams and rope ladder, crossed over and descended upon the roof of the Dead-house, which is not more than ten feet in height, and jumped off on the Willoughby-street side. As no watchman appears to be employed in the jail, the parties were in no danger of being disturbed. A skeleton key and the rope ladder were discovered about a o'clock yesterday morning, which was the first that was known of the occurrences of the night previous. The names of the prisoners and the terms of the sentences, together with the offences of which they were convicted, are as follows: Edward McNeill, sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, for attempt to kill; James Harnold, 10 years' imprisonment, for burglary; James Robinson, William Brady and Henry Stevens, 5 years' imprisonment, each, for attempt at burglary; B. Komph, forgery, 5 years' imprisonment; and Thomas O'Keefe, larceny, not sentenced. The latter was to have been used as a witness against other parties. The roof of the jail is constructed of shingles, put on in 1840, and is represented to be in a dilapidated condition.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf491cfe-950e-5760-85c5-2c84e01e4035,676,nyt://article/cf491cfe-950e-5760-85c5-2c84e01e4035,

Dr. WORCESTER was born in Bedford, N.H., Aug. 24, 1784, and removed to Hollis, N.H., in 1794, with has father's family. He was educated at Hollis, Andover and Salisbury Academies, and was graduated at Yale in 1814. While teaching school he published a Geographical Dictionary (1817) and a Gazetteer of the United States in 1818. In 1819 he published Elements of Geography, Ancient and Modern, at Cambridge, Mass., whither he had removed, and the next year, Epitome of Geography. Several works of various value, but in related fields, followed these, and then he commenced with TODD's Johnson, that great lexicographical labor which gave him reputation. This work was published in 1827. The next year he prepared an abridgment of Webster's Dictionary, and in 1830 a Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary. He then visited Europe, and spent much time in those philological inquiries which had their fruit in his revised lexicon. A Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language was published by him in 1846, which was immediately reprinted in Europe. His Pronouncing, Explanatory and Synonymous Dictionary made its appearance in 1855, and in 1860 his magnum opus, quarto, ""A Dictionary of the English Language,"" was published. He also published a spelling-book, and edited the American Almanac for twelve years from 1831.

Mr. LYNAGH was earnestly urged to take at least $150 with him, as that amount would be required in case of his son's demise, which he was informed would no doubt happen before the place was reached. Mr. LYNAGH being in poor health got his son-in-law, Mr. PATRICK WALKER, and his daughter, to depart on the sad mission, the stranger accompanying them. Mr. WALKER had about $300 with him when he started. On the arrival of the party opposite the Merchants' Hotel, in Cortlandt-street, New-York, the stranger pressed his companions to enter that hotel and partake of some refreshments previous to commencing their carriage ride to Newark. This they acceded to. After this Mr. WALKER's suspicions were aroused by the strange familiarity of his new-made acquaintance, and he concluded not to leave until the morning. This disappointed the stranger considerably, but finding that he could not prevail on Mr. WALKER to hire a carriage and accompany him, he very kindly offered his services to take his valise to Newark. This offer made Mr. WALKER more suspicious still. The stranger finally left empty-handed, and the next morning WALKER and Miss LYNAGH started for Newark in search of their dying relative and the Marion Hospital. But there was no such place to be found, and they returned home with the very natural belief that the villain who misled them wanted to get them on a carriage ride for the purpose of robbery. He gave his name as GEORGE A. ATKINSON, and said he did business at No. 23 Broad-street, Newark. Since the above transaction, Mr. JOHN M. OAKLEY, residing in Dupont-street, between Franklin and Union avenues, Greenpoint, received the following letter, probably from the same young man:",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Williamsburgh.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Williamsburgh.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fb1033a5-b935-5fda-b8bf-4ac4137e2b45,599,nyt://article/fb1033a5-b935-5fda-b8bf-4ac4137e2b45,

These impressions have at least the value of freshness. If they do not furnish any profound analysis of the social and political changes in progress at the South, they present... a carefully-drawn picture of what came under our correspondent's observation. Many readers here may question the correctness of the writer's conclusions as to the degrees of loyalty with which he credits the various classes of citizens in Alabama. But it is at least worthy of particular note that he gives special credit to those who have been openly in arms against the National Government for a frank and candid bearing in their submission, which is not apparent in the less martially-disposed portion of the inhabitants. Our correspondent likewise offers certain statements respecting the freedmen of Alabama, which we commend to careful notice. While it is apparent from all the facts that could be gleaned, that large numbers of the released plantation hands absolutely refuse to work, and many of them take to dishonest ways of living, our correspondent points out the dangers that might arise, from leaving the freedmen without some military protection, whether it is called ""a Freedmen's Bureau"" or anything else. The great value, however, of the pictures given in our correspondence, lies in the fact of their being free from any bias which might attach, on the one hand, to a sectional prejudice for the white residents of the South, or on the other, to a cheap and easy patronage of the colored race.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Aspect of Affairs in the Gulf States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Aspect of Affairs in the Gulf States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-10-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b83fe508-e3fc-5246-94d3-7bf81cfb8f29,361,nyt://article/b83fe508-e3fc-5246-94d3-7bf81cfb8f29,
