Peace Letter to the President (Niagara Falls); Greeley's Peace Letter,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/01/archives/mr-greeleys-peace-letter.html,Peace Letter to the President (Niagara Falls); Greeley's Peace Letter,"We copied from an English paper a day or two since a letter written last Summer by Mr. GREELEY to President LINCOLN, urging him to take steps which should either lead to the conclusion of peace with the rebels of the South, or satisfy the people of the whole country that it was not his fault if the war was to be continued. It is pretty generally understood in political circles that this letter, as well as the entire series of which it forms a part, would have been published last Fall but for the President's unwillingness to have certain expressions which it contains, concerning the inability or unwillingness of the country to prolong the struggle, go to the world under the sanction of a name so influential as that of Mr. GREELEY, -- and for Mr. GREELEY's unwillingness, on the other hand, to have it published in a mutilated form.

The Struggle between Emperor and Aristocracy,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/02/archives/the-great-struggle-in-russia.html,The Struggle between Emperor and Aristocracy,"The great contest between the Russian Emperor and the aristocracy still continues. We called attention, in a recent issue, to the address put forth by the Moscow Diet, urging a representation of the nobility in a new Imperial Parliament for all Russia. This address, and the debate accompanying it, were published, without permission, in a St. Petersburgh journal, and thus made public to Europe. The Emperor, indignant at such a divulging of the internal conflicts of the empire, has suppressed the journal and imprisoned the editor. The excitement over the contest between the Crown and the noblesse is intense through the country. The nobility denounce the ingenious expedient of the Czar for weakening their power, in allowing the lower rank of landholders to enter the Moscow Diet, but the Imperial Government is firm, though their course is surrounded with difficulties. The peasantry, a vast and powerful class, are grateful to the Czar for his act of emancipation, and would stand by him in emergencies, but they have their own grievances in the settlement of their properties and rights, and as yet are not so organized as to act with the Emperor in his great struggle. The middle class -- as in Poland or our own South -- is very small, and possesses scarcely any political power or experience.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Struggle in Russia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Struggle in Russia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Russia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5346b515-528b-51d3-b951-ce89ca7fcf9f,664,nyt://article/5346b515-528b-51d3-b951-ce89ca7fcf9f,

"His Honor held the Court open yesterday morning for the purpose of disposing of the case of Eliza Ploss, an interesting young girl, convicted last week upon an indictment for grand larceny. The evidence in this case showed that on the 13th of January last, the prisoner picked up a purse containing $270, the property of a poor woman. Besides the money, the purse contained a receipt for rent, containing the full name and address of the owner of the money. It was also advertised extensively, and the advertisement brought to the notice of the prisoner and her mother. The money was finally traced to the prisoner, and the woman who had lost the money called on her and begged her to return it, but the prisoner's mother said that the description given of the purse was incorrect: the one found by her daughter being a new one, and not containing any rent receipt. After her arrest, the prisoner confessed that she had thrown the original pocket-book away, and substituted a new one, of a different shape, for the purpose of deceiving the owner. She also stated that her brother had taken the money away from her and gone off to the army. After her conviction.

CORLIES, of the Twenty-second Ward, who had been drafted. As there was no place in the office for the men to get their meals, this substitute, with others, was marched to a restaurant about two hours afterward, to get supper. While supper was in course of preparation, TAYLOR, the substitute, watched his opportunity and ran off; but one of the guard, JOHN D. SWENTON by name, who had him in charge, was too quick for him, and discharged a pistol, wounding him in the wrist. The bullet then entered the coal-yard No. 682 Eighth-avenue, breaking a chair, tearing a dress coat, &c. The deserter was taken to the United States General Hospital, on Lexington-avenue and Fifty-first-street, and it is understood he will lose his arm. Capt. DUNNING thanked the soldier for his vigilance and promptness, and reminded the guard that, as substitutes were frequently professional deserters, it would be well to keep an eye on them hereafter.

"Substitute for; Guacoyol, of Mexico",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/02/archives/volunteer-substitutes.html,"Substitute for; Guacoyol, of Mexico","-Efforts have been making for some time past to induce the War Department to allow persons who wish to save a relative or friend from the draft to volunteer in his stead, and not be classed as a substitute, who are usually strictly guarded, and are allowed few of the privileges of volunteers. If the head of a family is drafted, a son will find it more convenient to the family to go in his father's place, and brothers having no families are willing to go in the place of those who have. Dr. SAUNDERS last week visited Washington, and obtained the consent of the Department to allow such persons to be classed among the volunteers, receiving from the Bounty Fund Commission a certificate to that effect. By this means a better class of men are obtained for the Government than the substitutes who usually present themselves, and whose only object is to get the highest amount of pay. Those who are willing to make sacrifices for their family or friends are prompted by a good motive, and will faithfully perform their obligations. With this privilege, a number of volunteer substitutes will doubtless be added to the army, and as the service is willingly entered into, they will make the best kind of soldiers. -- Philadelphia Ledger, March 20.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'VOLUNTEER SUBSTITUTES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'VOLUNTEER SUBSTITUTES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Coal', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e93494b3-b586-5b39-8996-9034c5b63339,219,nyt://article/e93494b3-b586-5b39-8996-9034c5b63339,

Rebel Losses at; Final Grand Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/03/archives/the-rebellion.html,Rebel Losses at; Final Grand Attack,"The grand movement of the Army of the Potomac, introduced as it is with gratifying tidings of success, naturally absorbs public attention to the exclusion of all other topics. The presence of Mr. LINCOLN with the army; his brief and modest telegrams; the knowledge that GRANT himself is at the front, supervising in person; that glorious PHIL. SHERIDAN leads our splendid cavalry; that THOMAS is already threatening Lynchburgh from the West; while SHERMAN, with an army flushed with six months of unvarying success, lies within striking distance in GRANT's rear, ready, if need be, to launch upon the enemy a power utterly irresistible; that the James River is clogged with our monitors and gunboats; that Mobile, if not already under fire, will soon be subjected to an ordeal that promises an early victory -- all these great facts necessarily fix the eyes of our whole country -- we may say of the world -- upon the stirring events of the hour. That the visit of the President to GRANT's headquarters, and the grand council of Generals held last week should be translated into action so soon, shows that there is a determination to make at least an effort to end the long protracted struggle, and by a blow so decisive that all hope of further organized resistance on the part of the leaders of the rebellion must be abandoned. Gen. GRANT's movements were begun by SHERIDAN, who, on Tuesday last, began to push his cavalry along the rear of our lines toward and beyond Ream's Station. The enemy quickly detected this movement, and their papers at once grew uneasy as they sounded the alarm. On Wednesday morning the Second and Fifth Corps moved from their works to follow and support SHERIDAN. There followed a rain-storm, as usual when the Potomac army moves, whereby movements on the next day (Thursday) were materially retarded. To return to Wednesday: Our infantry met very little opposition, receiving only here and there a sprinkle of musketry, until the First Division of the Fifth Corps had got to the junction of the Boydtown with the Quaker road, where they had a fight, which lasted about an hour and a half, and our loss was some three hundred and thirty, of which number about forty were killed and the rest wounded. The rebel loss was about two hundred and fifty in killed and wounded, and one hundred prisoners. The enemy was finally driven from his works, and retired to another line beyond the Boydtown road, and our troops of the First Division followed up and took a position with the left, about two miles north of the road. The entire losses of the First Division for the day were a little over 450. After the right here alluded to, the Second and Fifth Corps formed a junction and advanced slowly, driving back the rebel skirmishers, until darkness compelled a suspension of operations. This was ail the important fighting during Wednesday. The enemy, however, enlivened the night by a furious cannonade along the lines in front of our Ninth Corps, evidently in the hope of finding a weak spot; but they were disappointed. On Thursday the rain began very early, about midnight, and lasted until 4 P.M., rendering the roads impassible for artillery, and necessarily suspending active operations. A lively fire of artillery was kept up by the enemy and picket firing was rapid and continuous, but no serious damage was done. On Friday morning the enemy became fully awake to the danger threatening him; LEE himself, so prisoners say, was at the front and speedily began the day's work by a desperate rush upon our left, which he forced back upon their previous position on the Boydtown Road. Here our men rallied and in turn drove the enemy with considerable loss, over all the distance he had gained, taking possession of the White Oak road. At the same time the enemy made an attack upon the right flank of the Fifth Corps, but by a sudden and brilliant charge our men drove them a long distance, and strewed the ground with their dead and wounded. The result of the day's work was the capture of four battle-flags, about 1,000 prisoners, and a considerable advancement of our lines. It is thought that the enemy lost about 1,200 men during the day. Very soon after the attack on the Fifth Corps, the rebels attacked SHERIDAN, at a point about three miles from the South-side Railroad, with infantry and cavalry, and, as usual, gained a slight advantage for the moment; but all was quickly recovered, and something gained besides. Operations on both sides were heavy and difficult, on account of the muddy state of the roads. On Saturday the struggle became more general, and a furious fight raged apparently nearly all day. The net result was highly favorable to the Union arms. The position called the Five Forks was recaptured, and SHERIDAN on our left, carried everything before him, capturing a large number of prisoners and several batteries of artillery. But all this heavy and successful fighting was only the prelude to the grand effort of yesterday, when Gen. GRANT ordered, an attack along the whole line. At 8 o'clock the rebel lines had been broken and the battle was raging with desperate energy; SHERIDAN was sweeping down from the West; ORD was engaged and all appeared favorable. At 11 P.M. the President telegraphed: ""All is going on finely. Gens PARKE, WRIGHT and ORD's lines are extending from the Appomattox to Hatcher's Run. They have all broken through the enemy's entrenched lines, taking some forts, guns and prisoners. SHERIDAN, with his own cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west, on the enemy's flank, Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad."" A few hours afterward we received another bulletin from GRANT, dated 10:45 A.M. Everything had been swept from the left of the Ninth Corps. The Sixth Corps had taken 3000 prisoners. The Second and Twenty-fourth had captured guns, forts and prisoners. The army was closing around the works enveloping Petersburg. Al looked well; SHERIDAN not heard from. Six hours later GRANT telegraphed that his men were all up in unbroken line, and in a few hours he entrenched from the Appomatox below Petersburg to the river above. Our entire captures were at least 12,000 men and 50 guns The dispatch closes thus; ""All seems well with us and everything is quiet just now.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0676590-e8d1-58a3-b93e-92c0943db088,1729,nyt://article/a0676590-e8d1-58a3-b93e-92c0943db088,

"At no time since the Fall of Sumter has the City of New-York been so thoroughly excited as it was yesterday upon the announcement of the occupation of Richmond. The news in the morning journals was sufficient to arouse the most latent patriotism, and cause the hardest heart to beat with gratitude. Scarcely, however, had the people settled themselves at their various avocations when a strange whisper filled the air, penetrating to the counting-room, the workshop and the school, as if by magic, and long before the newspaper extras stamped the joyful news upon the public mind, it was everywhere known that great news had come to hand, and that victory was ours. An interested crowd gathered about the TIMES Bulletin, and as the cheering words were read again and again, great hearty cheers went up from the multitude, and joy beamed from every eye. Soon the nimble feet of the newsboys had sped with the official dispatch through-out the town, and what had been but an intuitive surmise became a patent truth. The manifestations of exhilaration were boundless; flags were flung to the breeze from innumerable stores and dwellings, making Broadway to shine with the Stars and Stripes, and casting a stream of glory upon the harbor. At the ferries, as soon as the announcement was formally made, an order was issued to deck the boats with bunting, and at once the several fleets of double-enders steamed across the river gay with the flutter of our flag. The down-town shipping houses, most of which are provided with staffs, ran up their colors, so that South-street and West-street, Broad-street and Beaver-street, with the neighboring marts of traffic, vied in patriotic display with the hotels of Broadway and the mansions of the upper end. The magnetism of delight was upon every man. Not a dismal face, not an averted eye, not a pursed-up mouth was seen, nor a croaking tongue heard. No one suggested an ""if"" or a ""but,"" but every one accepted the glad tidings as truth from the pen of an ""honest man."" Hand grasped hand in places where ""how much"" and ""how low,"" are the ordinary salutation; ""glorious news"" and ""thank God"" sprang from lips more accustomed to ""buyer sixty"" and ""seller ten;"" hard pebbled spectacles that have weathered the beatings of the world and the buffetings of care for sixty years without a moisture, were wet with tears of gratitude, and men estranged for months grasped each others willing palm, while their hearts beat in harmonious thanksgiving.

Appropriate addresses were made in several of them by the Principals, and the national hymns were sung with a gusto which only school boys and girls can give.

Brooklyn; Attempted with Oxalic Acid by Colored Help,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/04/archives/brooklyn-news.html,Brooklyn; Attempted with Oxalic Acid by Colored Help,"NARROW ESCAPE OF A FAMILY FROM BEING POISONED -- OXALIC ACID PUT INTO THEIR TEA BY A COLORED SERVANT. -- The family of Mr. GEORGE F. MAIN, residing No. 33 Bond-street. Brooklyn, had a narrow escape from being poisoned at the breakfast table yesterday morning. It appears that they have had employed in the family for some months past, a colored girl named ZOE YOUNG, a native of the Eastern shore of Maryland, who, although only 12 years of age, was very active and competent to do the light domestic work. A woman named MURPHY comes to the house every Monday to do the washing. Mrs. MURPHY had on a previous occasion offended the girl by complaining to MIS. MAIN of some dereliction of duty, or impudence. Mrs. MAIN talked to her sharply on account of it, and made her mind, therefore, to poison the washerwoman. With this object in view, she took a vial containing oxalic acid, and when making the tea poured a considerable quantity into the pot. The washerwoman sat down to the table with the family, consisting of five persons, including three small children, and tasting the tea, remarked its sour acid taste. Others tasted it and also found it unpalatable. The little girl was applied to for the cause, when, after some hesitation, she confessed that she had poured in some of the poisonous stuff for the purpose of killing Mrs. MURPHY. The vial was kept on the third shelf in the kitchen closet. Her attention had been called to its poisonous qualties on several occasions, in order to prevent her from handling it. It had been used in the house for cleaning brass, and she was told it would kill rats. She thought, she said, if it would kill rats it would kill the washerwoman, having no desire, seemingly, of injuring any one else. The girl was taken before Justice PERRY and committed for a further hearing.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2c3a0af0-73f1-54ed-abaa-2a0866b057c4,590,nyt://article/2c3a0af0-73f1-54ed-abaa-2a0866b057c4,

Scores of mammoth steamers thunder through the waters, hundreds of well-modeled palaces glide swiftly on the wave, and thousands of smaller craft betoken by their presence the power and wealth and commerce of this great city. The exigences of the war, or rather of the War Department, came upon the government at a time when the Navy Department had no visible means of transportation and the Secretary was compelled to turn to the country for relief. Naturally, New-York was the centre of attraction, as here were owned vessels enough to float all the armies of the world and transport all the commissariat in creation. The agents of the government ransacked every steamboat office in the city, and at one time it appeared quite probable that all the steamers owned by our merchants would be turned into transports, while circumstances made it by no means impossible that sooner or later our Brooklyn and Jersey City friends would be compelled to resort to the most primitive modes of crossing the rivers, or be deprived of the innumerable blessings and privileges of metropolitan existence. The result of this tonnage raid was soon apparent. Very few steam vessels, except the ferry-boats and those belonging to regular lines, were to be seen about the harbor, and, save on government service, it was a rare thing to find any of our largest-sized steamships in this vicinity. Many of these vessels were bought outright, but the most of them were chartered for a specified time, with the privilege of purchase, or else chartered by the week at enormous rates. As the Spring approached, fortunately the necessities of the government relaxed, and hundreds of the boats which had vigorously steamed under the ""regular"" flag, are back again, and will be in readiness for the enormous traffic which all agree in anticipating during the coming Summer. Last year, travel was impeded and rendered very uncomfortable or impossible on very many routes, by reason of the dearth of vessels, and quite likely the same difficulty will be met now, but it will be greatly lessened by the expiration of the charters, as alluded to above.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; SPRING AND SUMMER TRAVEL.

Matches Announced,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/04/archives/billiards-distinguished-arrival.html,Matches Announced,"The arrival of a distinguished French professional has created a marked sensation in billiard circles during the last few days. This gentleman, M. PIERRE CARME, was born at Bordaux, and is now about thirty years of age. He had long been known to be remarkably expert at billiards, and on coming to Paris, some three years since, at once assumed superiority by conquering BARTHOLEMEW, BERGER and others. Since the period last mentioned, he has stood in the very front rank of his profession in Paris and Versailles. After subjugating all France, he determined to ""seek fresh fields and pastures new,"" and finally concluded to come to the United States. He arrived here about ten days since, and immediately sought Mr. PHELAN, and after an interview, exhibited to that gentleman and a few of his friends, his extraordinary powers. Although all the party bad often witnessed BERGER's seances, the masterly execution of M. CARME had such an electrical effect upon them, that they all readily admitted he possessed powers infinitely superior to anything ever before witnessed in this country. In the masse he manipulates with wonderful certainty and brilliancy; yet, all is accomplished with unusual grace of position, and the slightest physical effort. In regard to the strength of his game we have no means of estimating at the present time; but as his playing is not confined to the small balls used in France, and he is equally efficient with ""two and three-eighths,"" he is undoubtedly, at the game of billiards, at least the equal of any man in this country. M. CARME will shortly give a series of public seances, at which he will be assisted by Mr. PHELAN, and in another month he will be probably one of the lions of the day.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Billiards.; DISTINGUISHED ARRIVAL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Billiards.; DISTINGUISHED ARRIVAL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Billiards', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/82f8e61c-21f8-5af4-81bb-8ea69483c3b0,588,nyt://article/82f8e61c-21f8-5af4-81bb-8ea69483c3b0,

Visit to Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/04/archives/the-presidents-visit-to-richmond.html,Visit to Richmond,"-- If President LINCOLN has ""gone to the front,"" or entered Richmond, he has departed widely from the discretion and good judgment which have hitherto marked his conduct. We can readily understand his personal eagerness to witness events of such transcendent importance as the defeat of the rebel army and the capture of the rebel capital; but we deem it his duty to have subordinated all such personal predilections to the higher considerations of public duty which the case involves. Mr. LINCOLN's life may be of no special value to himself, and of no more value to others, considered merely in his personal relations, than that of any other man. But his official position makes it of special value to the country, and he has no right to put it at the mercy of any lingering desperado in Richmond, or of any stray ballet in the field, unless some special service can be rendered by his personal presence. It seems to as he might have left to Gen. GRANT the closing up of the great campaign which he has so wisely planned and so ably executed, -- and that his own share in the great transaction might have been as well performed at Washington as in front of Richmond. If nothing happens to him, this gratification of a very natural curiosity will be of little public consequence.

We have had for the last two or three years a large number of wiseacres who were firmly satisfied that all that was needed to keep gold down was to ""punish the speculators,"" and that it was entirely owing to their evil machinations that it had reached the unconscionable height at which it sometimes figured. They got a chance to put their plan into execution, and carried a bill through for the purpose last year. Gold immediately rose to the highest point which it ever reached. The bill was immediately repealed -- but the mischief was done. The price of coin did not come down materially for nearly three months; and the worst of it was that the prices of all commodities had risen with it, and even in a still greater ratio, and, as usual, did not fall as it fell, and the burdens of the poor were thus greatly and suddenly increased. We venture to assert that the speculators have not in their whole career accomplished half as much mischief in the same space of time as this one piece of foolish and ignorant legislation. One good, however, resulted from it. It was thus fully, and, we believe, satisfactorily proved, that the price of gold could not be kept down, or, to speak more correctly, the price of paper kept up by penal enactments.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Rise and Fall of Gold.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Rise and Fall of Gold.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b1f066bf-947e-5cdd-9fa0-fe87a2ed63f7,596,nyt://article/b1f066bf-947e-5cdd-9fa0-fe87a2ed63f7,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/04/archives/news-of-the-day-the-rebellion.html,,"When our summary of war events closed yesterday, it was at the point where Gen. GRANT announced a temporary cessation of hostilities on Sunday evening. Up to that time our arms had met with almost unvarying success; save the little fillip of a reverse on the first advance beyond the Boydtown road, nothing had gone amiss. The grand march was FORWARD; the stern resolve and unconquerable will of the ""Northern horde', were in full activity; it was evident that our leaders had resolved to manifest our real strength -- that this was no mild reconnoissance, no holiday parade, but that every step and every manoeuvre mean: business. The hour and the man had come; the long-delayed and ardently prayed-for time was present; the day of doom for the rebellion had dawned. We have already briefly sketched the main features of the contest, from the commencement of GRANT's movement on Wednesday morning until the lull in the furious contest on Sunday afternoon. From that point the record is broken; results so grand and overwhelming as to dwarf all ordinary details, arrest the attention -- RICHMOND IS CAPTURED! The grand significance of this truth needs no interpretation -- the nation breathes freely -- the end draws nigh. This most important fact since the first gun was fired at Sumter, was announced early yesterday morning in an EXTRA TIMES, in the following brief telegram from the President: ""This morning, Lieut.-Gen. GRANT reports Petersburgh evacuated, and he is confident that Richmond also is. He is pushing forward to cut off, it possible, the retreating rebel army."" This glorious announcement was very soon followed by a note from the Secretary of War, which read: ""It appears from a dispatch of Gen. WEITZEL, just received by this Department, that our forces under his command ARE IN RICHMOND, having taken it (Richmond) at 8 1/4 this morning."" This was enough; all doubt was removed; the truth was manifest; the rebel stronghold was ours; the Libby prison, the accursed Belle Island, the capital of the arch-conspirator were under the bayonets of Union troops. The announcement was hailed with the wildest manifestations; such beaming faces, such cordial hand-shakings, and even embracings, such indifference to all other things, such haste to display some manifest token of loyalty never before occurred. All at once the city was radiant with ""red, white and blue;"" business was instantly suspended; even gold speculators forgot their peril, and sang and danced and made speeches, and gray-beards were boys again; Wall-street became a play-ground, and the most astonishing pranks were indulged in by staid old fogies, whose hearts for once triumphed over conventional dignity. While these astounding events were going on, a brief interruption was made -- at about 2:30 P.M. -- to read the following telegram, sent under the sanction of the War Department: ""Gen.

SHERMAN to the James River -- indeed, before Gen. SHERMAN's army had emerged from the bogs of South Carolina. The time of its execution depended much more upon the completion of SHERIDAN's cavalry campaign from the Shenandoah Valley to Petersburgh, than upon the advance of the army of SHERMAN.

I expressed my conviction that whereas I had always opposed secret political organizations, as a member of the Democratic party, the time had come when they were useful and necessary, provided they were kept legitimate. Assurance was given me by those gentlemen that there was nothing of the king I apprehended in that Order; that a new arrangement of the organization was to be made, and that any objectionable features could be obviated: that it was only a political organization, having reference to affairs in the States that adhered to the Union and recognized the Federal Government and its authority.

He found this lusus naturae in the person of Capt. WADDELL, of the rebel pirate Shenandoah, on board of which the correspondent was writing his puff of her master. What struck him so much in this officer was the indignation he expressed at the fate of the Florida, captured by the ""rascally blackguards"" of the Federal navy in Rio Janeiro. Capt. WADDELL was very emphatic and ""gentlemanly"" in speaking upon this subject, and intimated a very strong desire to make reprisals upon the unarmed Yankee merchantmen then lying in Melbourne Harbor; but he did not, because, said he, ""the Confederates, Sir, are gentlemen, and, please God, we shall always act up to that standard!"" This settled the question with the Telegraph's correspondent. He could not doubt, after that remark, that Capt. WADDELL was a ""splendid specimen of an American gentleman."" The Shenandoah was built in England, equipped in England, carries eight rifled Whitworth guns, of coarse made in England, and devotes herself to the gentlemanly business of robbing, plundering and burning unarmed American merchantmen at sea. This class of operations, and the gentlemen engaged in it, command a remarkable degree of admiration and respect from our neutral English brethren now-a-days; but they will have an account to settle for it before very long.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A BRITISH DISCOVERY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A BRITISH DISCOVERY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b636b8e-44cd-54e9-a18f-e28daa65cd17,262,nyt://article/6b636b8e-44cd-54e9-a18f-e28daa65cd17,

The regular war dispatches also convey many important particulars, the wires being now working direct from City Point to Richmond. Gen. WEITZEL telegraphed early yesterday morning that he found 28 locomotives and 150 cars in the city, Gen. GRANT is said to have directed WEITZEL to allow No one to leave or enter the city except men connected with the army. On Sunday night, before the evacuation of Richmond, the rebels blew up their forts and rams on the James River, the explosion of which was terrible. Our gunboats have moved up the river, and are engaged in removing the obstructions. The rebels fired Petersburgh in several places before evacuating the town, but the fire was speedily extinguished. Gen. GRANT was, at 3 3/4 o'clock on Tuesday morning at Sutherland's Station, ten miles from Petersburgh, from which point he telegraphs that ""SAERIDAN picked up twelve hundred prisoners to-day, and from three to five hundred more have been gathered by our troops. The majority of the arms that were left in the hands of LEE's army, are now scattered between Richmond and where his troops now are. The country is also full of stragglers. The line of retreat is marked with artillery, ammunition, burned or charred wagons, caissons, ambulances, &c."" We are yet without definite knowledge of losses on either side, but our captures of prisoners are something wonderful. A Washington dispatch estimates that we had taken more than 25,000 up to Monday noon This figure is reduced by others to 20,000; others say 15,000 to 18,000. But this is, mainly, guesswork; GRANT has no time to make inventories. Many thousands of prisoners have already been received at City Point, and others are continually arriving. A sufficient number of troops could not be spared to guard them, and detachments of sailors and marines were taken from the gunboats and placed in charge. The destruction of property by the rebels is very great, but not equal to the general expectation. They burned some public buildings, but no attempt was made to convert Richmond into a Moscow; indeed, their haste was such that they lacked time for anything like systematic work. It is the general opinion, justified by GRANT's own position, that LEE is retreating upon the Danville Railroad, and that SHERIDAN is upon his flanks.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title; THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Editorial Article 1 -- No Title; THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7329bb2b-986a-5e5b-8559-2a3e9a73515a,784,nyt://article/7329bb2b-986a-5e5b-8559-2a3e9a73515a,

A careful comparison of different data gave LEE, three months ago, an army of 85,000 men. Within that period there is superabundant evidence to prove to us that this force, so formidable in numbers, and, peradventure, scarcely less formidable in its tough experience, had lost full 15,000 men. We should clearly be under, rather than over the actual number, if we set down LEE's losses, in killed and wounded, in the five day's engagements, at 10,000 more. And putting together all the returns of captured prisoners already received, we are unable, by the most moderate computation, to reduce their aggregate below 25,000. These deductions alone bring the relics of the rebel army of Virginia down to 35,000 men, without including the gangs of stragglers from that fugitive band, met with at every furlong of GRANT and SHERIDAN's pursuit. If LEE to-day has even 30,000 in his immediate command he must have found material for conscription in the line of his inglorious flight.

PHELAN COLLENDER, Mons. PIERRE CARMS, the great French billiard-player, whose arrival was announced in the TIMES of Tuesday, gave an exhibition of his wondrous skill, in the presence of a select audience, including representatives from the principal daily and weekly newspapers, and several of our most influential citizens. This Board met in special session at 3 o'clock on Tuesday, Mr. ROCHE in the chair. The hour announced for opening the exhibition was 4 o'clock; but, at the urgent solicitation of gentlemen who, in their anxiety to witness his performance, had arrived before the proper hour, M. CARME commenced at about 3 o'clock. The feature of the entertainment was the execution of the different varieties of the masse, and the boldness, brilliancy and originality of the artist was a theme of unbounded praise. During the first hour, particularly, M. CARME's efforts surpassed even expectation, and the accuracy with which he consummated the most difficult problems, drew forth the most flattering encomiums from such of the spectators as, having seen that other wonderful player, M. CLAUDIUS BERGER had come prepared to measure the new comer by that high standard. Although the exhibition was an impromptu affair, conceived and carried out in a few hours, and notwithstanding, also, that M. CARME played upon a table of inferior size to that with which he is familiar, and in a building where the movement of machinery was a source of continual jarring, it gave eminent satisfaction to all who participated in it, and conclusive proof that the French expert is all that had previously been claimed for him -- a player daring in conception, and brilliant and accurate in execution. He exhibited, altogether, about thirty different strokes, the majority of which were novel and striking in the extreme. It is his intention to give a moderate number of exhibitions in several of the prominent cities; the first two of which will take place at the Hall of the Cooper Union on the evenings of Tuesday and Wednesday, the 11th and 12th of April. During the succeeding week he will appear in Boston. In each of these seances he will be assisted by Messrs. PHELAN, GOLDTHWAIT, and others.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Exhibition by M.

There are men in his army who will probably adhere to him and fight for him to the last -- till he either makes a voluntary surrender of himself, or succeeds in effecting his escape from the country.

It is their action that is the primary concern. It they resolve to give up the Confederacy, and show this determination by their political action through their State Legislatures and their primary conventions, the mere fact that some of LEE's soldiers might do a little fighting on his account, would make no change.

Government to be Transferred to Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/06/archives/the-rebellion.html,Government to be Transferred to Richmond,"The letter of our special correspondent in Richmond will be read with curious interest. We can hardly blame the people for skepticism in ordinary matters connected with our victories, but doubt was carried to the extreme yesterday, and there were not a few honest people who looked upon the slight rise in gold (in the absence of any direct advices from Richmond in the morning papers) as evidence that the rebel capital had not been taken -- that the whole story was false, or at least quite premature. We trust that our own letters and official telegrams from the War Department will reassure these distrustful friends. Our correspondent says that LEE telegraphed on Sunday that GRANT had driven him a mile and a half, that he had suffered severely, held an untenable position, and requested that the city should be evacuated that night. The flight of the rebel leaders began at once -- JEFF. DAVIS is said to have heard the news while in church. He had previously sold his furniture, and was ready to go at once. Leaving Mrs. LEE behind, he started for Charlotte, N.C. Other accounts say that he started with his family the previous Wednesday -- the day GRANT began his march -- but subsequently returned to his capital. Gen. WEITZEL now occupies his house, and Gen. DEVINS resides in the house of Gov. SMITH of Virginia. Our men approached the city very cautiously on Monday morning over grouad, thick with torpedoes -- so thick that our main body marched in single file, while pioneers pointed out the dangerous places. No opposition was made to our approach; a small squadron of cavalry rode in, and Mayor MAYO handed over the keys at 7 A.M. on Monday morning. Gen. WEITZEL soon followed, and was greeted with enthusiastic cheers by citizens both white and black. The rebels set are to many important buildings, in order to burn the tobacco on storage, and most of Main-street is destroyed; but our men soon extinguished the fire. The State House, the Enquirer and Dispatch newspaper offices, and two or three bridges are burned. All the rebel magazines and gunboats were blown up. There were no Union prisoners found, all having been sent off for exchange the day before. Commissioner OULD handed to Gen. MULFORD all the papers in his possession on the subject. The departure of the rebel army after SHERIDAN's victory at Five Forks must have been very sudden, since they left all their tents behind. Our captures in Richmond amount to about one thousand rebel soldiers in health and five thousand wounded, mainly in the hospitals, with 5,000 stands of small arms, and five hundred pieces of artillery President LINCOLN visited Richmond on Tuesday, but returned yesterday to City Point. Gen. SHERMAN put his army in motion on Saturday morning, but in what direction we are not informed further than that it is moving northerly in accordance with plans arranged by Gen. GRANT.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'West Virginia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a48b9de5-a04f-502a-babb-b99451230f35,530,nyt://article/a48b9de5-a04f-502a-babb-b99451230f35,

Albany Atlas >amp; Argus; Mr. Comstock Withdraws,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/06/archives/general-news.html,Albany Atlas >amp; Argus; Mr. Comstock Withdraws,"The Panama Star Herald of March 21 states that on Thursday evening, the 19th ult., the longtalked-of revolution against the State government broke out in Panama. It was a quiet affair, the whole matter being settled in a few minutes, by the actual President. Senor CALANCHA, abandoning his post and taking refuge in the United States Consulate until he had a chance to escape about midnight on board the United States sloop-of-war St. Marys, the arrest of the leading members of his administration, and the assumption of the Presidential chair by the candidate of the revolutionary party, Senor JIL COLUNJE. The national troops, the militia, and the population generally, appear to have been on the same side. The Commander of the national forces was arrested in the street at the outbreak, and the Captain of the forces made a show of supporting the government, but as neither his officers nor his men stood by him, he soon gave himself up. Four or five soldiers were killed, rather by accident than otherwise; and a good deal of alarm existed for a time. Senor COLUNJE was duly sworn in at noon on the 20th, at the Cabildo, as Provisional President of the State. On the 17th an armed force was dispatched from Panama to Aspinwall to establish the provisional government there. On the arrival of the men they were met by the Prefect, Senor BRACHO, who opposed them with the small police force under his charge, and in the encounter three of the latter were killed. The Department was then handed over to the new government. On the same day a force was sent to Veraguas and Chiriqui with a similar object. It is expected there will be bloodshed in the latter place, as that is the Ex-President's native State. In Panama everything is quiet and no further trouble is anticipated.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Newspapers', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/aae5e7b3-9dd2-5d3c-992a-849b8117e831,521,nyt://article/aae5e7b3-9dd2-5d3c-992a-849b8117e831,

The body was then carried to the Cemetery of the Holy Cross for interment. The body of GARDINER was taken from his brother's residence, Hon. THOS. A. GARDINER, No. 167 Johnson-street, to the Church of the Assumption, corner of York and Jay streets, where a solemn requiem high mass was also offered, and, after the services, was conveyed to the family vault in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New-York City.

The processions met on Court-street, opposite City Hall, and the Hall bell toiled solemnly as they marched along to the grave. The same respect was shown to the deceased whose funerals took place in the morning. The sight was a most affecting one as the long line of mourners passed quietly through the streets.

Trade may now be Revived,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/08/archives/southern-trade.html,Trade may now be Revived,"All the great Southern cities and centres of population are now in our hands, and the flag of the Union waves over all the seaports of the Atlantic coast. Now that the great armies of the rebels, and the military power of the Confederacy are nearly effectually demolished, there will not much longer be any necessity or avail in maintaining any of the severe restrictions that originated with the blockade, or in continuing the rigid anti-trade orders of military commanders. After the demolition of the armies of LEE and JOHNSTON, there will be no coherent rebel forces in existence, and little danger of any further organized resistance, on a large scale, to the Union power, and there will be no chance of any goods being imported or used for rebellious purposes. Take, for instance, the States of North Carolina and Virginia. With our troops in possession of Fayetteville, Raleigh, Goldsboro, Wilmington, Newbern, and all the seaboard of North Carolina, what possibility would there be of any organized rebel force existing in any part of the State? And in Virginia, with the possession of Norfolk, Richmond, Fredericksburgh, Lynchburgh, Burkesville and Danville, no rebellious army could maintain itself. The bringing about of public order and security would be a matter of a very short time, and would be effected in great measure by the people of the different counties and towns. Nothing would tend more to this than the inducement of activity by the revival of trade and commerce. The people should be invited and encouraged to bring their products into the cities, and should be protected in legitimate traffic. There are undoubtedly immense quantities of the great Southern staples now in the South -- cotton, rice, tobacco, and the naval stores of North Carolina. Our army saw vast amounts of naval stores in the region along the Cape Fear River, and there is no reason why these should not be all gotten out now at once. The people of Wilmington, Goldsboro, and all other parts of North Carolina, have welcomed the advent of our army; and the greater part of them have shown their willingness to take the oath of allegiance at once. Great quantities of cotton can also be gotten out very speedily, by way of Savannah and Mobile, if we adopt the proper measures. There is no sufficient reason why trade with the Southern cities and the Southern country should not immediately be greatly enlarged, and in a few months Southern staples may flow forth to enrich the land, enlarge the general prosperity, and strengthen the public credit. Already in this city, and at other Eastern ports, many ocean steamers are being fitted up, in anticipation of a general resumption of trade with the seaport cities of the South.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Southern Trade.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Southern Trade.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/15c2d48d-3a53-5574-b6db-4d000424d2f3,460,nyt://article/15c2d48d-3a53-5574-b6db-4d000424d2f3,

He was also among the earliest, in connection with Hon. AMOS KENDALL, WILLIAM M.

His high integrity of purpose which, as President of the pioneer line, he infused through all the operations of the new business, also did much to command that public confidence so essential to success, Mr. BARNUM was the first President of the present American Telegraph Company, and was an active director in it, as well as President of the old ""Magnetic Company"" at the time of his death. He was connected with various improvements in his own State and in Virginia, and was ever among the foremost with his capital and his great business qualifications to encourage and aid every public improvement. We knew him well as a most worthy man. He was domestic in his habits, and kindly disposed to all. -- Philadelphia Ledger, April 5.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEATH OF ZENAS BARNUM, ESQ.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DEATH OF ZENAS BARNUM, ESQ.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/16bef2f7-3dc6-5657-a7be-af7c904f9319,271,nyt://article/16bef2f7-3dc6-5657-a7be-af7c904f9319,

Proclamation for Thanksgiving April 20,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/08/archives/the-rebellion.html,Proclamation for Thanksgiving April 20,"The city was greatly excited yesterday over a report that LEE's army had surrendered, but the joy wss premature; it was FITZ HUGH LEE, and not the General-in-Chief, who had succumbed; at least such was the ultimate story -- from Philadelphia. But there was enough of genuine newsto keep up the joyful fever of patriotism which has marked every day and hour since GRANT begun his last glorious campaign. Our dispatches make it very clear if not already at the point of surrender, LEE will very soon be brought to that alternative; the unremitting blows of SHERIDAN's avenging sword are too powerful to be endured; the rebels have not time to form an effective line of battle before our troopers are upon them, and another disorderly rout is the result. SHERIDAN reports at 11 1/4 P.M. of Thursday: ""The enemy made a stand at the intersection of the Burkes Station road with the road upon which they were retreating. I attacked them with divisions of the Sixth Army Corps, and routed them handsomely, making a connectiion with the cavalry. I am still pressing on with both cavalry and infantry. Up to the present time we have captured Gens. Ewell, Kershaw, Button, Corse; De Barre, Curtis, Lee, several thousand prisoners, fourteen pieces of artillery, with caissons and a large number of wagons. If the thing is pressed, I think Lee will surrender. As for the ""pressing"" we may safely leave GRANT and SHERIDAN alone for that. Further dispatches from Gens. MEADE, HUMPHREYS and WRIGHT give details of operations on Thursday, all of which were in every way favorable to our arms. MEADE says: ""It is evident that to-day's work is going to be one of the most important of the recent brilliant operations."" HUMPHREYS says: ""Our last fight, just before dark, at Sailors' Creek, gave us two guns, three flags, considerable numbers of prisoners, 200 wagons, 70 ambulances, with mules and horses to about one-half the wagons and ambulances."" WRIGHT says: ""The result has been a complete success.""

About two thousand people daily invest each their fifty or a hundred dollars; and these subscriptions represent farmers, mechanics, laborers, apprentices, soldiers, women, and people of all ages and conditions of life, resident in every State of the Union, North and South. There are subscriptions from Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as from Maine and Iowa; from South Carolina and Virginia, as well as from New-York and California. The people have faith in the government, faith in the national credit, faith in the national future. This faith is as firm as their faith in themselves, and will be as enduring.

On the 21st ultimo, the Spanish Government gave the pirate the convoy of a frigate to enable her to quit Ferrol harbor without molestation from our fleet. This friendly act was not as successful as it was possibly meant to be. The Stonewall and the Spanish convoy were closely followed by the Niagara and Sacramento. The pirate refused to part company with his protector. Our naval commanders wisely restrained themselves from separating the two by force, and both were permitted to return to the harbor of Ferrol unmolested. There, also, our fleet is again anchored, and the status quo is resumed. The question how long -- in the present condition of Confederate belligerency here -- the European Governments that have extended over these pirates the immunities of privateers, can venture upon the continuance of this species of neutrality, must come up anon for executive deliberation. Pending that, there are two important duties incumbent upon the United States naval commander at Ferrol. The first of these is, that, under no contingency, shall this new piratical scourge be allowed to get out upon the high seas. The second is that he shall steer clear, as he has done in this instance, of an avoidable quarrel with the Spanish Government.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL RAM STONEWALL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL RAM STONEWALL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f0eff1e4-12b3-579a-aae7-fd4594cca30b,218,nyt://article/f0eff1e4-12b3-579a-aae7-fd4594cca30b,

They have simply changed their policy; but their purpose is the same. Our military victories have been too decisive for them to continue to show the impossibility of the success of the Union arms; but they can still, for a while yet, injure the country by assailing its credit. It is true that the Seven-Thirty victories are hard for them to explain away, and the Five-Twenty triumphs in Europe cannot be overlooked, and the Internal Revenue successes are great and growing. But still they have forebodings, and still they croak. They have for years been pointing us to the vast and ferocious armies of hundreds of thousands of rebels, and telling us we could never subdue them; but now, when that is nearly accomplished, they point us to the hundreds of millions of debt, and tell us we can never subdue that. As surely as we have achieved the one, however, just so certainly shall we accomplish the other. Neither the rebellion nor its cost will crush this nation, which has power and vitality enough to dispose of both, though twice as large. A sanguine Senator, who has his home in the setting sun, prophesied, when first the gigantic power of this rebellion appeared, that it would be crushed out by the close of Mr. LINCOLN's first term, and its expense paid by the close of the second. Time has already Justified the first part of what seemed then a very wild prophecy; and though the second part will not be fully realized, we have no doubt that by the time indicated, the financial problem will be as simple of solution as the military one now is.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PUBLIC DEBT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PUBLIC DEBT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fa81325f-ebc8-5fe2-a41a-a1e53fd52c47,347,nyt://article/fa81325f-ebc8-5fe2-a41a-a1e53fd52c47,

POLLARD -- a brother of Mr. POLLARD-URQUHART, M.P. -- to obtain a divorce from his wife on the ground of her adultery with a Mr. HEMMING. Mrs. POLLARD was engaged to Mr. HEMMING before she became acquainted with the Colonel, but the engagement was broken off in consequence, it appears, of some quarrel between her brother and Mr. HEMMING. The brother, Mr. DYSART, afterward introduced Col. POLLARD to his sister, and was anxious that she should marry him. They were married in 1850, and went out to India together. There is no reason to suppose that, at this time, the Colonel knew that his wife had ever been engaged to Mr. HEMMING. In 1861 Mrs. POLLARD's health gave way, and, for the second time during her married life she had to come to England. Mr. HEMMING then began to visit her. This he did almost daily for some time. At last, when the Colonel came home, toward the end of 1863, he found his wife had eloped, leaving a note behind her owning that she had been untrue to him, and saying that, by the time her note reached him, she would be at sea, hundreds of miles away. She afterwards wrote to her sister, saying she had gone thousands of miles away from home with the man who had loved her, and whom she had loved, sixteen years ago. Col. POLLARD could not find out where they were till August, 1864, when he ascertained that they were living together as man and wife near Barking, in Essex. There was no defence to the charge of adultery, but the counsel on both sides addressed the jury on the question of damages. For the Colonel, it was contended that Mr. HEMMING, as a man of honor, ought not to have renewed his acquaintance with Mrs. POLLARD while she was without her husband's protection; and that, having abused the opportunity afforded him by his previous acquaintance to alienate her affections from her husband, he ought to pay exemplary damages. For Mr. HEMMING, it was urged that the real origin of the misfortune was the marriage of the Colonel with a lady who had formed a strong attachment to another person, and that Mr. HEMMING being a man of very moderate means, he would be completely ruined by heavy damages. The Judge-Ordinary told the jury that Mr. HEMMING's position in life was not the measure of damages, for, if he could not pay in purse, he must in person. He told them the question was, what loss had the husband sustained. The jury returned a verdict for the petitioner, with £1,000 damages.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'SINGULAR DIVORCE SUIT.; HEAVY DAMAGES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'SINGULAR DIVORCE SUIT.; HEAVY DAMAGES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Post', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1f0c9a47-4811-546a-b529-90d1b725e6a9,448,nyt://article/1f0c9a47-4811-546a-b529-90d1b725e6a9,

Adventures at Sea of a Boat's Crew,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/09/archives/extraordinary-adventure-at-sea.html,Adventures at Sea of a Boat's Crew,"The Melbourne Argus, of Jan. 15, relates a singular incident at sea. On the 21st of November, while a heavy sea was running, one of the crew of the steamer London, from London to Melbourne, fell overboard. A boat was at once lowered, and Mr. HARRIS, the sailing master, and five men, pulled off in search of the man, who, however, perished. The man fell overboard about 11 o'clock in the morning, and Capt. MARTIN, the captain of the London, felt confident he saw the boat [???] down soon after it was lowered from the ship. Nevertheless, the search was continued until dusk, about 7 o'clock, when all hope of ever seeing any of the men again alive was abandoned. Throughout the day the London was plainly visible to the [???] themselves, but their boat, as large life-boat, drawing barely four inches, had no hold of the water, and drifted to leeward so rapidly that they could not put up to the steamer. However, they had a resources Passengers, as we all know, will cause annoyance on shipboard by using the boats as storerooms. Mr. HARRIS had himself cleared out the life-boat a few days previously, but it was now round that there had been a fresh transgression, and that two or three rugs and blankets, and other ""gear"" of that description were on board. These were speedily made use of. Two oars, lashed blade upper most, the one forward and the other [???], furnished masts on which the rugs were hoisted; a broken oar was transformed into a bowsprit, and a linen bolster case split [???] made a couple of jib-sails, which answered admirably. Still the boat would not lie close to the wind'. The most that could be done was to keep a parallel course with the steamer. When evening fell, and the vessel was shut out from sight, she was not above six miles away, so that while the light lasted the rise and fall of her bowsprit with the swell could be plainly traced. Mr. HARRIS divided the men into watches, one man to steer and another to look out while the others slept, and he kept on the steamer's course until daylight, though the chance of catching her was but small. In the morning nothing was to be seen, and Mr. HARRIS then determined to steer for Trinidada, a little [???] perched on the ocean between South America and Africa, a barren spot, but on which water is to be procured, and on which, it is said, though it is not positively known, that a few walls of society obtained a precarious living. Trinidada must have been one hundred miles distant, but the wind was fair, and aided by a fifth sail, a square sail, rigged amidships on the boat-hook, the little craft slipped along at the rate of five or six knots the hour. There was literally nothing in the way of eatables on board; there was not even a beaker of water or a pipe of tobacco, but the men bore the privation with perfect good humor, laughing as to who would have their ""plum duff."" By-and-by, the masts of the Henry Tabor, an American whaling-bark, were sighted. She was about eight miles off, but, as the wind was free, the boat soon ran down to her, and the crew met with a hospitable reception. They had been in the boat for thirty-two hours, and had encountered a very heavy sea during the whole of that time. Next day the Henry Tabor fell in with the John Bunyan, and the men were taken on board, that vessel and conveyed to Melbourne. After the arrival of the lost men, rumors, emanating from some of the passengers, attributed blame to Capt. MARTIN in not having instituted a sufficient search for the boat; but, on the other hand, the saloon passengers presented Capt. MARTIN with an address at the close of the voyage, as an expression of their approval of his conduct, and Sir DANIEL COOPER and Archdeacon REIBEY, two of the passengers, formally expressed their opinion that every effort was made to find the boat, and that the search was not abandoned until all hope was given up. Mr. HARRIS has also written a letter, declaring that no commander could have done more than Capt. MARTIN did. An inquiry was made into the facts by the Acting Shipping Master at the port of Melbourne, and the evidence taken by him was laid before the Attorney-General, who pronounced that it did not furnish grounds for a charge of misdemeanor against Capt. MARTIN. Doubtless investigation will be made by the Board of Trade in England.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE AT SEA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE AT SEA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fd5daa80-6086-5ff5-a8d2-7181b8d85d3c,778,nyt://article/fd5daa80-6086-5ff5-a8d2-7181b8d85d3c,

There is a record in existence to the effect that the pallum of St. Peter was transferred to his successor Linus, and that of St. Mark to his successor in Alexandria, which at the present day Paltea, similar to those of the Roman Church, are used by the Greeks, and other Easten Christians. On the 27th January, (the feast of St. Agnes,) in each year two lambs are taken and placed in the custody of religieux until shearing time. From the wool then taken the pallum is made. It is then taken to the tomb of St. Peter and there blessed by the Holy Father himself, and is thus said to be taken from the body of St. Peter.

Among the best articles are: ""The Petroleum Regions of America,"" by JOHN S. SCHOOLEY; Mr. ABBOTT'S ""Stir- ring Adventures Beyond the Mississippi,"" devoted to an account of Gen. BANKS' ill-fated Red River Expedition, and ""Recollections of Gen. SHERMAN, by W.F. SHANKS. ""Armadale"" and ""Our Mutual Friend"" will be welcomed by all lovers of romance. The current numbers of these stories show no falling off in their attraction. DICKENS, indeed, seems to be taking more pains as the work proceeds. The scene of the resuscitation of a half-drowned man in the present installment, is written with much of his old power. ""Wall-street in War Time"" will interest all who wish to understand the secret of the rapid fortunes that everyone hears of as matters of daily occurrence.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/10/archives/the-rebellion.html,,"The evening of Palm Sunday, sacred to the PRINCE of PEACE, was made ever memorable and glorious in the history of this nation, by the announcement of the SURRENDER OF GEN. LEE AND HIS WHOLE ARMY. It is the harbinger of an immediate and glorious Peace, a Peace gloriously won by the grand courage, endurance, and unshaken faith in their cause of the splendid Armies of the Potomac and the James, aided by their glory-crowned brethren under SHERDAN and THOMAS and HANCOCK, and the heroes of the ocean who have kept watch and ward along our coasts from the Delaware to the Rio Grande. The news is none the less welcome because prematurely announced, none the less glorious and important because for many days considered a foregone conclusion. It is the end of the Confederacy. There may be sporadic efforts here and there; JOHNSTON may venture a battle; Mobile may undertake a half resistance; the rebel troops west of the Mississippi may indulge in irregular campaigns; but LEE has surrendered -- LEE, their Commander-in Chief, and practically Dictator; LEE, upon whose shoulders, by universal consent, has for half a year rested the fortunes of the rebellion, has abandoned their cause as hopeless. He surrendered an army never surpassed in bravery, in suffering, in persistence in a bad cause -- an army that had everything to gain by success -- everything to lose by defeat. The corner-stone is removed -- the edifice has fallen beyond the possibility of restoration. It is the greatest and most importhant event for this country since the imperishable Declaration of July 4, 1776, the most, momentous fact of the century as affecting the stability of democratic government. It will be hailed, not only in our own land, but wherever mankind aspires to freedom and progress, as a turning point in the history of man.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6bfddf4-6895-5fc1-b197-bd0551145e0b,1026,nyt://article/d6bfddf4-6895-5fc1-b197-bd0551145e0b,

The investigation into the circumstances connected with the recent disaster in Furman-street, whereby five persons lost their lives, was commenced before the Coroner and jury on Saturday afternoon. JAMES S. SMITH, residing in Portland-avenue, near Dekalb, testified that he was on the roof of the burning building, with others, and while there was cautioned to step back; some twenty or thirty men were on the roof at the time; Mr. GEORGE HAVILAND cautioned them to leave; the firemen remained; they were playing on the fire; a minute or two after the warning the roof fell in; there was some one who directed the movements of the firemen, but he heard no orders given. WM. WESSELS, of No. 158 York-street, Jersey City, testified that he was upon the roof of the burning building, No. 93 Furman-street; told the Chief Engineer that it was useless to throw any water there, and was told to mind his own business; some one cautioned him that the roof was in danger of falling any minute; the caution was loud enough to be heard by all; the firemen were apparently doing no good there, as they were throwing the water into the street; after the caution, the citizens mostly left; was just in the rear when the roof went in; labored under the impression that the Chief-Engineer went down with the rest. T.D. HERBERT, of No. 90 Hicks-street, heard the Chief give an order, and supposed it to be an order to vacate the roof, some ten or fifteen minutes before the accident. ROBERT BARR, Assistant-Engineer, testified that he was present at the fire, but heard no order given for the people to get off the roof. Had been at the fire about half an hour when, the root fell in, and assisted several men out of the ruins. The question of the security of these buildings had never been raised among firemen to his knowledge. Had no conversation with the Chief-Engineer that night, and did not consider that there was any danger. Did not know that the Chief was there at the time the root fell in. Did not think it safe to have a covering of earth on those buildings. GEORGE COLGAN, of No. 7 Engine, testified that the Chief-Engineer ordered the men on the roof to cease playing, as they were throwing the water on those below. As the order was not obeyed, he went on the root himself. The fire had been burning about half an hour at this time. In a few minutes thereafter the Chief gave the order to stop playing, the roof fell in. The inquisition will be resumed this afternoon at 1 o'clock.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FURMAN-STREET DISASTER INVESTIGA-', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FURMAN-STREET DISASTER INVESTIGA-', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eb6d2ef3-2c4e-53e2-be0a-e3077a9e6e0f,449,nyt://article/eb6d2ef3-2c4e-53e2-be0a-e3077a9e6e0f,

In every characteristic of an army, it is vastly inferior to that lately under LEE. It has never, as an army, fought a noteworthy battle. It has no traditions of success. It has no capable leaders. The troops of HARDEX, who fled from Savannah and then from Charleston, form its nucleus, and to these have been added the tail of HOOD's old army, the Wilmington force of BRAGG, the picayune force of BEAUREGARD, various feeble forces and garrisons picked up around, and a cavalry force under WADE HAMPTON and WHEELER. It is a piebald collection. Since its organization -such organization as it has -- it has been steadily on the retreat; and the last we hear of it is that it has fled from Raleigh, and it must be now somewhere near the Southern border of Virginia.

The premature announcement on Friday had the effect of making the people incredulous; the hour of the real announcement was late, and, as it was on Sunday night, the weary world was wending bedward, there was not that amount of rejoicing which would naturally have arisen at an earlier hour. Yet the excitement was equaled only by that which followed the attack upon Fort Sumter; the surrender of LEE and his army was anticipated, looked for, and to a great extent discounted in advance. The utter demoralization of the rebel army, the increased esprit of our own forces, the vigorous pursuit of the Union troops and the prophecy of Gen. GRANT had prepared us for the great news which, on Sunday night, was flashed across the wires to an expectant public. Despite this, however, the errand of the mercurial newsboys was successful; with their arms full of extras, they rushed up town and over to the neighboring cities, shouting the glad tidings as they ran, so that before the morning papers disclosed the fact, the great mass of the people were aware that LEE and his armed men no longer stood in the pathway of the Army of the Potomac.

Immunities have been denied to these vessels, under a pretext of neutrality, which are conceded, either by treaty, by public law, or by the comity of nations, to the vessels of every other Power. The President thinks the time has come when this should be revised. Otherwise, the foreign governments thus continuing to bear themselves toward us, will find their vessels subjected to precisely the same treatment in our ports. This fair and honest action might have been adopted, probably, with advantage at an earlier date.

PIERRE CARME, formerly of Versailles and Paris, gave his first seance in the large hall of the Cooper Institute last evening, and notwithstanding the threatening state of the weather, he was greeted by an audience of nearly two thousand people, among which were many eminent citizens, including judges of the courts, leading bankers, lawyers, merchants, editors, etc., and a large delegation of ladies. M.CARME was assisted by M. PHELAN and Wm. GOLDTHWAIT. On introducing the Professor. Mr. GAVIT took occasion to observe the serious disadvantage M. CARME was laboring under in this exhibition. That he was an almost total stranger in the country, had only recently arrived from a sea-voyage, that the table, balls, machinery, etc., of the game was entirely new to him. Again, as in the case of all first appearances, he was considerably embarrassed with ""the glare of the foot-lights."" Therefore, if he should fail in some of his shots on the first attempt, under the existing circumstances, he trusted to receive their kind indulgence. The playing then commenced with a French three-ball game -- fifty points up, between M. CARME and Mr. GOLDTHWAIT, which was won by the former. After which M. CARME demonstrated the power of the masse and other intricasies of billiards in a series of about thirty shots, the most of which were made with wonderful accuracy, and showing the most astonishing control over the balls. Some of the demonstrations drew forth salvos of applause. After this Mr. GAVIT came forward and stated that he was now enabled to answer a query which had been repeatedly asked during the last few days, viz.: ""What is the strength of M. CARME in a game of billiards."" The reply to this was a letter from M. CARME to Mr. PHELAN, which he would now read.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BILLIARDS.; M. Carme at the Cooper Institute.

What if it does? -- which we do not believe however. The means of exit from the lower part of this over-crowded island need multiplying ten fold rather than diminishing. The loss of the Canal-street Ferry has been long and bitterly felt by thousands at both sides of the route. The request of the company, in these circumstances, is scarcely decent, and we urge on the Council that it be not listened to for one moment. Until the facilities for suburban travel are vastly increased and improved, the great body of citizens who have but moderate means to depend upon, must continue to be victimized by the extortionate class of landlords. Cheap, speedy and regular means of conveyance to and from the suburban districts, is the only remedy for this growing and intolerable evil.

States and Union Office Cleared Out,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/12/archives/general-news.html,States and Union Office Cleared Out,"An unusually active inquiry (mainly for permanent investment) prevailed yesterday for the gold-bearing bonds of the Government, which advanced 1 1/4@1 1/2 cent., and closed with a strong upward tendency. The bonds were extremely searce, and much difficulty was experienced in executing orders for round sums, either through the Stock Boards or through the commission houses. The latter were decidedly more eager to buy than inclined to sell, at even the improved rates. A few speculative purchases were made, chiefly of the new 5-20s, and the 10-40 five per cents. The demand from buyers on foreign account was developing significantly, promising soon to absorb a large portion of the comparatively limited supply of the bonds in the market, and at rising figures. One or two leading foreign banking firms had their brokers busily employed in running from counting-room to counting-room on Wall-street, and endeavoring to purchase large lines, especially of the funded six per cents, at prevailing quotations; but, owing to the reduced supply available, their efforts were comparatively unsuccessful. The home demand for small sums was so respectable in the aggregate, and, withal, so urgent, that the commission houses were kept actively at work in filling the popular orders. All parties seemed to anticipate an early and marked appreciation in the market value of the bonds, which are now 4@6 cent. lower than at this time last year, even in the face of the recent decisive Union successes, implying unmistakably a speedy restoration of the national authority throughout the length and breadth of the Republic. The prompt effect of the news of these successes abroad will be a vast increase of foreign orders for the funded stock of our country. The immediate effect at home is to be seen in the steady augmentation of the sales of the 7-30 Currency Loan now in process of distribution. The subscriptions to this Loan opened this week with the high daily aggregate of $2,873,650, including 2,011 single orders for the $50 and $100 notes of this Loan. The amount subscribed yesterday reached $3,132,400, and there were 2,193 subscribers for $50 and $100 bonds.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed6f9822-f97b-5dcc-97ac-4b2ccff4b971,717,nyt://article/ed6f9822-f97b-5dcc-97ac-4b2ccff4b971,

Securities appreciation of; Securities; Appreciation of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/14/archives/government-securities.html,Securities appreciation of; Securities; Appreciation of,"-- Heavier sales of government gold-bearing bonds were made yesterday, including the sixes of 1881 and the 10-40s, at comparatively steady prices, while the 5-20s, old and new series, suffered a temporary depression of 1 and 1 1/2 per cent., caused by efforts of a few foreign banking agents, to realize on bonds held here, or expected ""to arrive soon,"" on European account -- efforts originating mainly in real or affected disappointment at the latest quotations by the New-York from Frankfort and London, (to March 30.) These quotations showed an advance in the 5-20s of 3 to 3 1/2 per cent. in the principal foreign markets as the immediate response to the news from this side (to March 18) of SHERMAN's occupation of Fayetteville, N.C., and of SHERIDAN's cavalry raid from the Shenandoah Valley to the James River. Intelligence of SHERMAN's occupation of Goldsboro, and junction with SCHOFIELD; of the Council of War at City Point; and of the great events preceding (and including) the fall of Richmond and Petersburgh, has, by this time, reached Europe. In about a week from the present date, the official account of the capitulation of LEE, and the practical termination of the war, will be in Europe. Such decisive news must inevitably lead to unusual activity and a further very decided rise in the funded stocks of our government in foreign markets. It cannot be denied that this is the prevailing opinion among the most sagacious bankers and brokers here. Very few, if any, considerable lots of our national securities already in Europe will find their way back to this country, in the face of this recent glorious news. On the contrary, all the signs of the times distinctly indicate that the current of our funded stocks will be decidedly in the opposite direction.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'GOVERNMENT', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bbe8393b-a114-5e0e-adfc-c7ddfd53bf87,401,nyt://article/bbe8393b-a114-5e0e-adfc-c7ddfd53bf87,

The change to; Drafting Stopped,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/15/archives/the-change-to-peace-the-first-movement.html,The change to; Drafting Stopped,"Probably no act of the Government of the United States was ever received by its people with profounder satisfaction than the general order, just issued, stopping all drafting and recruiting, and announcing the speedy reduction of all branches of the military establishment. It was the first practical earnest that this dreadful war had indeed ended. To tens of thousands of families, who have been for weeks haunted by day and night with the terror of having a father, a son, a brother, taken away from them for years, perhaps forever, it brought a relief which no language can describe. To a vastly greater number of families yet, who for months and years have been in sorrow for the absence of a loved one, and in daily apprehension of tidings of his death, or of a capture entailing horrors worse than death, it brought a hardly less joyful assurance of an early reunion. And then there was the pleasure, hardly worthy to be mentioned, perhaps, in this connection, yet gladly coming home to the ""business and bosoms"" of millions -- the pleasure of being spared any further increase of the burdens of taxation, already very hard to be borne. One of the most wonderful things of this war is the cheerfulness with which the people have met the immense taxes and voluntary contributions necessary to support it. But this cheerfulness was no token that the sacrifice was light. To multitudes that sacrifice trenched far upon the comforts, and even upon the necessaries of life. An intense love of country alone braced the people up to its acceptance. How far it could have continued to augment without reaching that point where endurance is no longer possible, it is impossible to calculate. It is enough that every man feels it to be a great personal blessing to himself that it is to go no further.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Change to Peace The First Movement.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Change to Peace The First Movement.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PEACE', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/03a96766-31ce-593d-8939-570e067605ab,964,nyt://article/03a96766-31ce-593d-8939-570e067605ab,

Safe Conducts at Richmond; Mischief Makers on Gen. Weitzel's Exchange,"The accession of Gen. ORD to the immediate command in Richmond is so directly in the natural order of military arrangements, that it requires no ordinary share of the faculty of malicious invention for a newsmonger to pervert it into a censure of Gen. WEITZEL's conduct. A Philadelphia story was allowed to circulate, during the greater part of yesterday, by which it was made to appear that Gen. WEITZEL, in giving safe conduct to certain ""Confederate"" representatives of Virginia to assemble in Richmond, had disobeyed the orders of his superiors. Gen. WEITZEL did grant facilities for certain citizens of Virginia to assemble and discuss the question of the readmission of the State into the Union. But the statement that his doing so was the cause of his removal, is simply a mischievous falsehood. We are asked to give the story contradiction, and we readily do so. But the evil its circulation was intended to compass, was done when it was allowed to pass through the hands of the telegraph censor. One would suppose, that if a censorship is any longer necessary or useful, or ornamental, the suppression of such malicious paragraphs as this would have been attended to before it had gone through a hundred different offices, and been put in the hands of probably a million of credulous readers. If Gen. WEITZEL had been removed for allowing representative Virginians to meet and deliberate over the return of the State to its allegiance, the inference would be that the War Department was at issue with Gen. GRANT, if not also with the President himself. To create such an impression as this, even for a few hours, would temporarily serve no end of schemes. And it would, no less, gratify that class of intemperate politicians who are now bawling -- each louder than the other -- to have their peculiar theories of reconstruction, of subjugation, of retribution, and so forth, adopted. The mischief-makers here need the closest sort of watching. They are more dangerous, for the time than the disjointed bands of insurgents that still wear the ragged livery of JEFF.

It consists of a clock, made by several ingenious fellows, to wile away their weary hours, at Salisbury, N.C., during their imprisonment last Winter. The mainspring is made from the blade of a sabre which once belonged to Stonewall JACKSON. The hair-Spring and balance-wheel were taken from the telegraph-office ime-piece at Andersonville, Ga. The hands are made of a toasting-fork from the kitchen of Vice-President STEPHENS. The wheels are made from the mountings of carriages, &c., of prominent Southerners. The pillars which connect the frame are made of a ramrod, and nearly all the parts are taken from something picked up in the Confederacy, and have more or less, romance attached to them. A saw used in constructing this interesting little piece or mechanism was made of a table-knife, and files, jack-knives, &c., used in making rings, were often called into requisition by the anxious workmen.

It appears that when four hours out from port, a barrel of spirits was about being lowered into the lower hold, when, owing to some wrong management in arranging the slings, the barrel slipped, and fell with great force into the hold, where it immediately burst. The storekeeper, Mr. JOHN HUGHES, who was in the hold at the time, with several others, upon seeing the occurrence, went immediately to the barrel, and having a lighted candle in his hand, it set fire to the spirits, which exploded, killing Mr. HUGHES instantly, and mortally wounding the carpenter, Mr. L.

St Louis; Frauds in,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/16/archives/revenue-frauds-in-st-louis-for-several.html,St Louis; Frauds in,"weeks past the United States Revenue Collector for this district has had his suspicions excited that a system of fraud in the manufacture and sale of whisky was being carried on, with the purpose of evading the payment of the tax on that article. The tax itself is $2 per gallon, and yet whisky has been sold in large lots as low as $2 75 per gallon -- a transaction, which, if correct, would leave only 15 cents per gallon for the value of the spirits. The collector has been diligently at work to procure evidence sufficient to warrant a seizure, and has at last been successful.

Last Address to the Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/17/archives/the-last-address-of-the-president-to-the-country.html,Last Address to the Country,"Probably all men in all quarters of the world, who read President LINCOLN'S last Inaugural Address, were impressed by the evident tone of solemnity in it, and the want of any expression of personal exultation. There he stood, after four years of such trial, and exposed to such hate and obloquy as no other great leader in modern history has experienced, successful, reelected, his policy approved by the people and by the greater test of events, the terrible rebellion evidently coming to its end, and he himself now certain of his grand position in the eyes of history -- and yet not a word escaped him of triumph, or personal glory, or even of much hopefulness. We all expected more confidence -- words promising the close of the war and speaking of the end of our difficulties. Many hoped for some definite line of policy to be laid out in this address. But instead, we heard a voice as if from some prophet, looking with solemn gaze down over the centuries, seeing that both sides in the great contest had their errors and sins, that no speedy victory could be looked for, and yet that the great Judge of the world would certainly give success to right and justice. The feeling for the bondmen and the sense of the great wrong done to them, with its inevitable punishment, seemed to rest with such solemn earnestness on his soul, that to the surprise of all and the derision of the flippant, an official speech became clothed in the language of the Bible. The English and French critics all observed this peculiar religious tone of the Inaugural, and nearly all sensible persons felt it not unsuited to the grandeur and momentous character of the events accompanying it. Many pronounced it a Cromwellian speech; but it had one peculiarity, which CROMWELL's speeches never possessed -- a tone of perfect kindness and good-will to all, whether enemies or political opponents.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Last Address of the President to the Country.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Last Address of the President to the Country.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e1feaaba-45ed-5ee4-b9a5-9a34baa1db2b,613,nyt://article/e1feaaba-45ed-5ee4-b9a5-9a34baa1db2b,

The body was conveyed to the Arsenal building by Policeman JOHN RUSSELL, where an inquest was held yesterday by Coroner COLLIN. From the evidence it appears that a single-barreled pistol, which had been discharged, was found near the corpse, and beside which was a flageolet, under which was a note-book, containing a letter and a fragment of a letter, both written in French. Dr. ROBINSON examined the body and found a lacerated wound of the head covering nearly the whole of the temporal bone on the right side, nearly all of the bone driven in. The wound was evidently produced by a bullet and not by a fall. There was fatty degeneration of the heart and liver, and from the condition of the intellectual organs. Dr. ROBINSON is of the opinion that deceased was subject to fits of hypochondriasis, during one of which he committed the fatal act. A verdict in accordance with the above facts was rendered by the jury. Deceased was apparently about 25 years of age, five feet seven inches high, and a native of France.

In the rebel army generally the belief prevailed that all their prominent officers would be executed as traitors, and the opinion was freely expressed that this belief had led to the desperate resistance hitherto shown by the rebel armies. As a general thing, the took the surrender very calmly, few of them exhibiting any special emotion. Gen.

When found by the police, the body had been stripped of all these, and it is therefore feared that a foul murder has been committed.

An inquest into the form and circumstance of the deed committed at Ford's Theatre reduces the actor to the grade of a very ordinary sort of felon. Between him and his confederate, who aimed at the prostrate and helpless Secretary of State in his sick chamber, the merit of heroic daring may be almost evenly divided. The ""stroller"" at the play-house has certainly less the advantage in this regard than at first blush might appear. Both rank essentially with the Bealls and Kennedys, who illustrated the chivalry of the rebellion on the scaffold as convicted incendiaries, compassing a violent death for hundreds of unconscious citizens, regardless of sex or age, in our hotels and along the lines of railroad and steamboat travel. The successive protests of these ruffians that they were Virginia ""gentlemen"" failed to relieve them not merely from the ignominy of justly-condemned criminals, but from the status of cowardly felons as well. It is important, looking to the examplar which a really great malefactor invariably becomes for the graduates in crime, that we should see to it, that neither the glare of the footlights, the trick and swagger of the mountebank, nor the accessories of the ""property"" room which this vagabond mimic knew how to appropriate, shall be allowed to make the criminal, by so much as one degree, less a poltroon than the essential facts of the murder will warrant.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Cowardly Character of the Murder.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Cowardly Character of the Murder.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/db3bab6a-c2f5-5ca4-8a4c-252fee4904ff,868,nyt://article/db3bab6a-c2f5-5ca4-8a4c-252fee4904ff,

The pirate Shenandoah has been lying at the port of Melbourne for several weeks, and it now transpires that the cause of her detention is the refusal of the local government to allow her provisioning for starting on a new expedition, and continuing her depredations on our commerce. This refusal of ""belligerent"" rights by the Victoria government, has drawn from the commander of the pirate a protest and a threat which read like a parody of the broadest kind of farce. The conduct of the colonial, authorities, is to be reported to Richmond -- nothing less! The subject, however, assumes more serious form, when we remember that it is precisely this species of impotent threat that has made the governments of Western Europe the servants and instruments of this wretched imposture of a Confederacy, which has thus prolonged its infamous existence, which has alienated to a painful extent the respect and friendship of the American people, and which has led, by no indirect pathway, to the culminating crime of the conspirators that, to-day, spreads a pall of immeasurable sorrow over all the land.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PIRATE SHENANDOAH AN IMPOTENT', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PIRATE SHENANDOAH AN IMPOTENT', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e35d1761-77f6-59bb-9cac-d1d4cdbeec68,218,nyt://article/e35d1761-77f6-59bb-9cac-d1d4cdbeec68,

The admirable article from the Toronto Globe, which we copy, undoubtedly reflects the all-prevailing sentiment in regard to the late President -- a sentiment not merely of profound respect, but something almost akin to personal affection. That there is an exception to this feeling is shown by the view of an assassination which is taken by the provincial organ of the rebels. That print, we believe, will be found to be the only so-called British newspaper in either hemisphere that will be able to find so self-satisfying a plea to justify the murder.

Toronto Globe on death of,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/19/archives/the-feeling-in-canada-opinion-of-the-leading-canadian-journal-the.html,Toronto Globe on death of,"At twenty-two minutes after seven o'clock, on Saturday morning, about nine hours after he had received the shot of the assassin, ABRAHAM LINCOLN drew his last breath, surrounded by the members of his family, his Cabinet, and leading political and personal friends. His death would, under any circumstances, have produced an extraordinary sensation, but accompanied by murderous violence, the feeling; which has been created has been the most intense. No single event of the present century in America can at all compare with it in effect on the popular mind, and we think that in England the shock will be nearly as deeply felt. The grief which is expressed has two very distinct origins, the stronger of which seems to arise from personal sympathy and regard for the deceased. We hear in all quarters the strongest expressions of admiration of the character of Mr. LINCOLN, and deep sorrow that his noble career should have been brought to an untimely end. His simplicity of character, his straightforward honesty, his kindliness. even his bluntness of manner, seem to have won the popular heart, even among a foreign, and, in matter of opinion, a hostile nation. We may judge by that fact of his popularity among the citizens of the Northern States. Almost all of us feel as if we had suffered a personal loss. Mr. LINCOLN is spoken of in the same terms as are used toward a familiar friend. All mourn his untimely fate. He had risen by industry, ability and integrity to the great position of Chief Magistrate of his country. He found it in the most imminent danger, and his power to control the elements which were sweeping over the land were far from generally acknowledged. He was regarded with fear and trembling by the friends of his government, and with contempt by his opponents. But steadily he made his way. He was not the best man who could have been imagined for the post of Chief Magistrate in a great civil war. He had not the commanding force which infuses energy into all around him, and his public appearances were often lacking in dignity. But he was sagacious, patient, prudent, courageous, honest and candid. If he did not inspire great Generals, he gave every man in the army an opportunity of developing the talents within him. He recognized merit and rewarded it. He placed confidence, as a rdle, where it was due, and he had his reward in great military successes. Some say that he has been cut off at a favorable moment for his reputation, but we cannot accept this view. It seems to us that he had gone through his worst trials, that his patience, sagacity and honesty would have borne even better fruits in the settlement of the affairs of the South than during the wild commotion of the war. He has been cut off at a time when, certainly, he had accomplished a great deal, but leaving much undone which he was well qualified to do. A naturally strong man, of only fifty-six, he might have hoped to live many years after finishing his work as President, in the enjoyment of the respect and admiration justly due to one who had saved the life of his country. He will be held, we think, by Americans, if not equal to WASHINGTON, second to none but he. But he had not the gratification of his great predecessor, of seeing his work completed and enjoying for along period the gratitude of his conntrymen and the admiration of strangers. There are few so hard of heart as to not shed a tear over the sudden and Moody termination of so bright a career. As great as WASHINGTON in many moral and mental qualities, his genial character was calculated to win far more popular sympathy than his predecessor. Ability and honesty all admire, but when to them are added kindliness, simplicity, and freedom from selfishness. haughtiness and pride in high position, they win love as well as respect.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FEELING IN CANADA; Opinion of the Leading Canadian Journal-- The Deep Regard and Affection Felt for the President--The Secessionists Carousing in Honor of the Assassin--A Plea for the Murderer--His Crime Justified.

"We hope that hereafter the police will be a little cautious about clubbing people in the streets for improper, foolish, or wicked remarks. It has already turned out that not a few of the accusations made on Saturday last for indecent remarks about the assassination of the President, were false accusations, based in some cases on malice and in others on misapprehension. The police have very freely avenged the President's memory, when insulted; and the satisfaction with which their conduct was in the first instance received by the public has encouraged them to greater freedom in the use of their billies than is desirable. The grief for the death of Mr. LINCOLN is all but universal, as everybody knows and sees, and the pitiful handful of dissenters may very well be let alone. If they make unseemly demonstrations, let them be arrested, and legally punished; but let there be no passionate or unruly violence -- especially on the part of the police.

The police have very freely avenged the President's memory, when insulted; and the satisfaction with which their conduct was in the first instance received by the public has encouraged them to greater freedom in the use of their billies than is desirable. The grief for the death of Mr. LINCOLN is all but universal, as everybody knows and sees, and the pitiful handful of dissenters may very well be let alone. If they make unseemly demonstrations, let them be arrested, and legally punished; but let there be no passionate or unruly violence -- especially on the part of the police.

""Yes, I am shot,"" and then fell motionless.

The editor of that journal not only repeats his assertion, that the leading rebels of Toronto -- with a ""Southern clergymen"" at their head -- held a carousal in honor of the assassination, but he adds that those of the rebels that did not participate in the debauch, were unable to conceal their satisfaction at hearing that President LINCOLN had been murdered. The public opinion of the resident population compelled a change in their tone. But the first impulse of the ruffians was one of entire concurrence in the justice and righteousness of the murderer's act. Everything, indeed, goes to prove that the soi-disant peace agents were so far privy to the conspiracy against the President's life, that they have all along freely predicted his murder. It is important that these facts should be borne in mind in settling the limits of any future amnesty. The rebel cut-throats, who have been employed to hatch schemes of robbery and murder against us on foreign soil -- the Thompsons, the Slidells, the Sanderses, the Masons, the Burleys and the Youngs -- clearly rank with the class of outlaws whose crimes can neither be condoned nor forgotten.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBEL REFUGEES IN THE PROVINCES.-', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBEL REFUGEES IN THE PROVINCES.-', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Toronto', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1cc681cf-1346-5485-9486-7045c86252d0,407,nyt://article/1cc681cf-1346-5485-9486-7045c86252d0,

The message from Her Britannic Majesty which the new Minister was charged to deliver in the Queen's name, would have been specially grateful to Mr. LINCOLN -- not less from the friendly response it was designed to give to his forbearing and forgiving policy, than from the confidence which the late President had cherished that the Queen's assurances of ""regard and good will"" were unaffectedly sincere, and that, in good faith, ""Her Majesty has nothing more at heart than to cultivate relations of amity and good understanding between the two kindred nations of the United States and Great Britain.""

Although many of the facts have appeared from time to time in our columns, the reader will be interested in the recap[???]ulation of their labors. Having the care of all the penal and charitable institutions, under public patronage they are charged with a vast responsibility not only in a pecuniary, but in a moral sense. And it is conceded on all hands that they have been good and faithful servants, prompt and economical in duty, and winning universal commendation for the manner in which they have guarded and dispensed the privileges and duties of their office. Yesterday the reorganization of the board took place. Mr. ISAAC BELL was chosen President, and Mr. JAMES BOWEN Secretary, the other members being JAMES B. NICHOLSON and OWEN W. BRENNAN. Collector DRAPER, so long the respected and efficient head of the commission, sent a note regretting that public business prevented his attendance, and expressing his warm sympathy with the board and the unfortunates in their care.

FLEMING, B.A., of Oakville, writes to a cotemporaty expressing his astonishment at a statement in the Globe of Monday, relative to the demonstration of approval with which the news of Mr. LINCOLN's assassination was received by certain Southernrefugees in Toronto. We beg to repeat the statement to which Mr. FLEMING refers, and to assure him that it is literally true: ""It caused a thrill of horror in this city when it was made known that Southern refugees assembled in our chief hotel, as soon as the deed was known early on Saturday morning and entered upon a noisy debauch in honor of the event, and that a clergyman among them said publicly at the breakfast table at the same hotel that Lincoln had only gone to k -- l a little before his time."" These facts are well known in Toronto, and nobody here thinks of disputing them. Even the Southern organ has been careful not to deny them. Mr. FLEMING, however, having ""read without knowledge,"" rushes to the defence. He says that, even if the statement ""about the debauch were true of some thoughtless young man over his cups. it is an outrage to hold the whole body of Southern refugees, or, indeed, any part of the thoughtful and sober, responsible for such sentiments."" The statement is true of several men, ""thoughtless"" they certainly were, or they would have known enough to conceal ""such sentiments."" We hold nobody responsible for the exultation over President LINCOLN's assassination but those who were guilty of that outrage. We are willing even to say that some refugees would not have committed such an offence against decency as to give public expression to feelings so atrocious. But the reflection immediately follows that ""sober and thoughtful"" men are not so numerous among the Southern refugees in Toronto as they ought to be. Ordinarily we look for such qualities in clergymen, but a man has been found among; the refugees to degrade a sacred calling, by using language so blasphemous and atrocious that all good men must shudder to hear it.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE FEELING IN CANADA.; The Southern Refugees.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE FEELING IN CANADA.; The Southern Refugees.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Canada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Toronto Globe.

The doctrine, it is true, had an authoritative enunciation, and was offi cially practiced when JAMES BUCHANAN held parley with the prime conspirators, and refused to hurt the sectional feeling of the rebel leaders by assigning to their first overt acts either the character or the penalty of treason. But we had supposed that four years of carnage -- the bloody, heritage bequeathed by that wretched official to his country -- had brought home to us all a sufficient experience of this business of sparing sectional pride, and nourishing open and defiant treason. It might be thought, at least, that the culminating crime of the conspiracy to ruin the republic would bring with it the lesson, that when Southern pride shall have been fully propitiated, the national authority will be prostrated, and the individual members of the national government will be offered up as a sacrifice to the tender sensibilities of a chivalry whose communion is held to be essential to the common weal.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'National Humiliation-Wounding Southern Pride.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'National Humiliation-Wounding Southern Pride.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8c345be5-82b7-5698-a248-6671eba9ba27,675,nyt://article/8c345be5-82b7-5698-a248-6671eba9ba27,

His position is one which calls for encouragement, and peradventure, for indulgence, from loyal men of all parties. And, probably, there is no better way of conveying Mr. JOHNSON an expression of public sentiment than by means of addresses from representative bodies, formally delivered. The question, however, may well be put, whether the range of representation in this case may not be inordinately extended. There must, we take it, be some limit set to the claims of the different varieties of organizations assuming a representative character, to participate in the formal presentation of these addresses. Good taste would surely dictate that there be no needless multiplying of formal resolutions, either hortatory or sympathetic. There is not a State in the Union but may be fitly and fully represented on such an occasion as the accession of a new Executive by half a dozen delegates. That number, carefully selected, would have done ample justice, at least, to the common sentiments of this community, and would have sufficiently embraced the great financial, commercial, political and religious interests of the State.

The church doors open at 10 o'clock usually, but at that time the efficient clerk of the society, Mr. WELD, and his many assistants had more work on their hands than they could easily attend to; the people would go in, and although strenuous efforts were made to keep up a reasonable hour the pews for their owners, the crowd had their own way and filled the church to overflowing. Thousands were turned away, and hundreds hung about the outer door in the vain hope of learning. The church was very by heat and effectively draped in black and white, and upon the Pastor's desk was placed a basset of beautiful flowers.

By 8 o'clock several thousands had assembled, and seemed determined to stand their ground at any inconvenience, so that an early view might be had of the remains. The City Hall was barred and locked; around the front, and guarding every side, stood lines of uniformed police, keeping perfect order, and strictly enforcing the rule that no one should enter. Invitations extended by the courtesy of Alderman J.D. OTTIWELL secured the admission of the press to the rotunda, and subsequently to the Governor's Room, where, in spite of the singular opposition of a man named LEWIS CARPENTER, a mechanic, who seemed to be temporarily in charge, they remained during the exhibition. The sound of hammers mingled with the voice of authority, while the decorations were being completed and arrangements made by the committee. Gen. HALL, with his aids and assistants, were in one room, receiving messages and sending dispatches; Alderman OTTIWELL, and the other members of the committee, were in another room, winding up the ends of their programme for the day; the builder and decorator of the velvet-carpeted resting-room of the Martyr-President were smoothing out wrinkles, adjusting folds and driving the last tack; Col. HAMILTON, of Gen. SANDFORD's staff, and Maj. RATHBUN, of the army, were making arrangements for the accommodation of the many military gentlemen expected; Gen. BURNSIDE, with several elegant ladies, waited for the arrival of the body with floral testimonials of regard; the half-dozen members of the press, after arguing with one door keeper, parleying with another, escaping the machinations of CARPENTER, who followed them like a second old man of the mountain, noted the appearance of the hall and the Governor's Room, and viewed from the balcony the sight of all others, the great massing of the people. All around the pillars in the rotunda and in front of the hall wound graceful folds of cloth and crape, black as night; about the walls hung great masses of sombre bunting; CARPENTER's ""Study of Lincoln"" rested quietly with sad expression opposite the entrance to the Governor's Room, and the exponents of our city's pomp and power -- her colors -- draped the walls on either side. The hours wore on and the multitude deepened; far up Chatham-street waited thousands of men, women and children, whose impatience burst forth in occasional and periodical pushings, which only the sharp rap of the policemen's clubs could quiet; Printing-house-square was full, the Park was held by very many who hugged close to the line of the police, contenting themselves with the sight of the City Hall and the sound of the tolling bells; boys and men mounted the trees, and WASHINGTON's monstrosity in the park, dark sashed, was the involuntary support of half a score of adventurous youths who neither feared the police nor regarded the Father of his Country.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The City Hall.; THE OBSEQUIES.

Peace Terms with Johnston,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/25/archives/shermans-scheme-of-peace-and-our-great-calamity.html,Peace Terms with Johnston,"They can hardly be judicious friends of Gen. SHERMAN who seek to show that but for the great calamity under which the whole nation is weighed down, his scheme of pacification would have been justified, or, at least, criticised with tenderness. One open apologist says of the terms which JOHNSTON exacted from his antagonist: ""No man in his senses can expect the North to feel as it would if this appalling crime had not been committed. We have passed into a new era."" We do not know that a proposition more at variance than this with actual facts could have been advanced. ""The North"" -- all of it, at least, that has shown a clean and loyal record throughout this war -- feels, in regard to the terms of Gen. SHERMAN's peace plan, precisely ""as it would if this appalling crime had not been committed."" Nay, we do not see how even those whose loyalty has occasionally been open to question, or who have been all along suspiciously neutral in this war, can honestly hold, that the political situation is in one degree altered by the assassination. For, we are compelled to remember, that since that calamity overtook us, the very organs which now demand consideration for SHERMAN's ignorance of actual events at the seat of government, have been the loudest in their protestations against attaching political significance to the murder of President LINCOLN. Only three days ago, the journal which now teaches us that ""we have passed into a new era,"" ransacked several volumes of ancient and modern history to illustrate the fact that no temporary calamity, however appalling, could shake the faith of the American people in their purpose of maintaining self-government and free institutions. It compared their steadfastness and sell-possession in the extreme crisis of danger to the immovable firmness of NAPOLEON, as pictured by THIERS. -- facing an enemy overpowering in numbers in the heart of a great campaign. So far from holding, then, that by President LINCOLN's death, we had ""passed into a new era,"" it urged the doubting and the timorous to remember, that ""neither the fell spirit of slavery nor the revengeful blaze of feelings wrought to madness,"" had anything to do with the murder; but that it was simply the fruit of a horrid individual ambition. How a crime thus characterized has introduced us to a new era, it will be desirable to learn, at least before we fall back upon its commission as the cause for the all but universal reprobation which SHERMAN's extraordinary project has invoked.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Sherman's Scheme of Peace and our Great Calamity."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Sherman's Scheme of Peace and our Great Calamity."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c0ff53a5-df6d-5b45-93a8-f0fba91c20f5,927,nyt://article/c0ff53a5-df6d-5b45-93a8-f0fba91c20f5,

It appears, from Secretary STANTON's statement, that, since the capitulation, rebel officers have appeared in their uniform within the loyal States. And upon this there naturally arises the question, whether such conduct is not an act of hostility, subjecting those guilty of it to be dealt with as enemies of the United States. The Attorney-General reaches a conclusion on the subject without much apparent hesitancy. Starting with the decision of the Supreme Court, that the rebellion was an organized insurrection with a defined territory, and that Gen. GRANT, in giving certain terms to LEE, spoke and acted simply as a soldier. Mr. SPEED is of opinion that the rebel officers who surrendered to GRANT have no homes within the loyal States, and have no right to come to places which were their homes before the rebellion. The Attorney-General is also of opinion that the stipulation made betwixt Gens. GRANT and LEE only embrace the officers and soldiers of LEE's army. Civilian officers of the Confederacy, therefore, have no protection under that instrument, if found within the territory of the loyal States. The wearing of a rebel uniform is held by the Attorney-General to be in itself an act of hostility.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE STATUS OF LEE'S PAROLED OFFICERS; AND OF REBEL CIVIL OFFICERS.--"", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""THE STATUS OF LEE'S PAROLED OFFICERS; AND OF REBEL CIVIL OFFICERS.--"", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73904cfb-7186-503f-9c8c-f6bc112990e6,330,nyt://article/73904cfb-7186-503f-9c8c-f6bc112990e6,

The first thought with those who found the occasion one favorable to quiet contemplation, must have taken form in a reflection upon the continuity of those feelings of anguish, sorrow and poignant regret (among the vast body of the people,) which had their first sudden impulsive outburst twelve days ago. Twelve days of human sorrowing -- even when the affliction, or bereavement comes closely home to the household affections, represent a longer period than many would at first be ready to admit. Twelve days, voluntarily devoted to the expression of a grief which arises from a public loss, measured by comparison with all our past experience, or even with all our historical acquaintance, seem to expand almost into an age.

Afterward the plaintiffs gave up this obligation and accepted inconvertible stock, or, in other words, stock as to which there was no obligation to repurchase. To make up for the difference in value of the two kinds of stock, the plaintiffs accepted also a conveyance of sixty-two lots of land in the City of Cairo. After the arrangements thus made, it was discovered by the plaintiffs, as they allege, that they had been induced to make the original purchase, as well as the subsequent exchange, by reason of false representations, emanating from the trustees.

"GERMAN OPERA. -- Mr. GROVER's season of German opera commenced here last evening. The house was comfortably filled by an appreciative audience, our public not having yet recovered from the shock of recent events. MEYERBEER's opera of ""Robert il Diavolo"" was performed. The orchestra, so important in these works, was larger than that of last year, having been reinforced by many of our best resident musicians. The chorus was effective and precise in a high degree. Among the performers, Messrs. FORMES and HABELMANN, and Mme. FREDERICI, most excelled. FORMES was in better voice than heretofore, and his acting was almost perfect; giving to the character of Bertram a harmonious and logical development which is rarely seen on the lyric stage.

The eminent surgeon, the honored, kind, and philanthropic citizen. VALENTINE MOTT, M.D., L.L. D., died last night at his residence, No. 1 Gramercy Park. Dr. MOTT was born in Glencove, L.I, Aug. 20, 1785. His father, Dr. HENRY MOTT, was for many years a practicing physician in this city. The son graduated at Columbia College in 1806, and immediately went to Europe, where he pursued his studies with great zeal and success. Three years later, at the age of 24, he was called to the chair of surgery in Columbia College, remaining there until 1813. In 1826, he, with Drs. HOSACK, MITCHELL, FRANCIS, and others, established the Rutgers Medical College. About 1830 he began to devote his time to lectures and instruction, and his great abilities have ever since been the pride of the profession. His position as a surgeon was second to no living professor, and challenged from the renowned Sir ASTLEY COOPER the remarkable eulogy: ""He has performed more of the great operations than any man living, or that ever did live."" Dr. MOTT has left several works of great value to science and literature, among them a translation of ""Velpeau's Surgery,"" the ""Mott Cliniques,"" ""Travels in Europe and the East,"" ""Transactions of the New-York Academy of Medicine,"" &c.

DE PEYSTER, of Tivoli, Dutchess County, Aid-de-Camp to Gen. SHEPLEY, (Chief of Staff to Major-General WEITZEL,) formerly Military Governor of New-Orleans, subsequently of Norfolk, and more recently of Richmond, raised the first real American flag, or ensign, over the Capitol of the rebel Confederate Capital, with the assistance of Capt. LANGDON, Chief of Artillery to Gen. WEITZIL. Two cavalry guidons had been previously placed there, but it should be remembered that a small flag attached to a staff could be planted while the halyards were in process of adjustment and attachment to raise a ""real flag.""

The full effect of the news, financially, could not be seen by reason of its arrival at the close of Passion Week; Good Friday, the day preceding the sailing of the Africa, being of course a holiday. Still, United States securities are quoted at an advance, while the rebel loan is down to 23. The ""leading journal,"" with its usual expertness in changing it base, has discovered all at once, that it is altogether wrong in the Australian Colonists to show any sort of favor to the pirates of the Shenandoah.

In its mad efforts, it has ruined the hopes and desolated the country of its supporters; and now, when just dying under the executioner's stroke, with garments stained with the best blood of the nation, it turns to strike with assassin's blow at the head of the republic, and culminates its long course of iniquities by a crime which, in dishonor, cowardice and atrocity, is almost without a parallel in history.

They contain an expansive statement of the sanitary statistics of each ward of New-York, and, altogether, form one of the most remarkable monuments of the practical work of this association. In careful detail, they present the number of tenant-houses, the population inhabiting them, the average cubic feet to each person, the nuisances afflicting the district, the sewerage, paving and other similar facts, together with the number of drinking-shops and brothels. The cases of disease and the rate of mortality are also frequently given, and remedial measures are suggested. The volume, numbering some 348 pages, will be an invaluable storehouse of facts and figures bearing on the future sanitary labors for the city, and we trust will prove to our wealthy citizens the pressing need of speedy and powerful remedies. The figures show in numerous wards of the city a frightful overcrowding of population, and the most unhealthy conditions of life for the laboring classes, accompanied often by a shocking death-rate. The instances of are so many, that it is difficult to select from them. Here, for example, we find in the Fifteenth Ward, embracing the region between Bowery and Sixth-avenue, and Fourteenth-street and Houston, a cellar 18 feet square and 7 feet high, where a family of seven persons lived; of these, two died of typhus, two of small-pox and one of erysipelas. There happen to be in this ward many good private residences as well as many tenant-houses, and the opportunity is presented of comparing them. Thus a medium private house, covering a space of 20 feet by 40, contains one family, or eight persons; a tenant-house, on a space of 20 feet by 25, has eight families, or forty persons. The former has an average air-space of 4,000 cubic feet to each person; the latter of 400; the former, a ground area of 100 square feet; the latter, 15; the rooms of the one are light and dry; of the other, dark and damp. When it is remembered that 1,000 cubic feet of air-space is the least which should be allowed to each person, we can see what terrible causes and promoters of pestilence and disease exist in such a quarter, side by side with the favorable conditions of the better class. In this ward there are 4,940 persons who live in tenant-houses, and 234 in cellars.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Sanitary Statistics.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Sanitary Statistics.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/152c3176-347e-56cd-9ebd-e97ed046a495,801,nyt://article/152c3176-347e-56cd-9ebd-e97ed046a495,

He was succeeded by other members of the society, who each and all eloquently discoursed on their several themes. Applause was judiciously and frequently bestowed. Our space will not permit us to give extended notices of individual performances, but the orations of Messrs. DE WITT, MARTINE, SWAIN, VALENTINE, and CORNELL must not be passed over without mention. The music throughout was excellent, and reflects great credit on HELLEMSMULLER, the efficient leader. The ""Peithologian Gallop."" ""Old Friends with New Faces,"" and ""Student's Songs,"" seemed to delight the audience more especially.

The End of the Assassin,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/28/archives/the-end-of-the-assassinthe-further-progress-of-justice.html,The End of the Assassin,"The official announcement made in the city about noon of yesterday that the assassin of President LINCOLN had at last been hunted down and killed, and that one of his chief confederates had at the same time been captured, produced an excitement not ordinarily surpassed by the announcement of a victory in the field, accompanied by a profound sense of relief, satisfaction and pleasure. The pursuit of the assassin had lasted just eleven days, and had been carried on with a keenness and an intensity unequaled by anything in our criminal history. It had, of course, been particularly vigilant in and around Washington; but the agents of justice were hunting him everywhere. The search reached up to Quebec in the North, and extended far down into the Southern Confederacy. The hiding places in the mountains, forrests and swamps, as well as the hiding places in the great cities of the land, were scoured for him. All outward-bound ships to foreign ports were searched for him; the gunboats and garrisons on the Mississippi River were, and doubtless still are, closely watching for his appearance; on every railroad train, on all the lines of the country, lynx-eyed men were eagerly trying to discover him; detectives, governmental and municipal, regular and voluntary, soldiers, sailors, citizens, rebels, negroes, -- everybody everywhere seemed to be after the accursed outlaw. The large rewards were, undoubtedly, a stimulus to activity; but, beside this, every one felt that he had a duty to perform to himself, to his country and to public justice.

He came to this country when quite a lad, and learning the trade of a hatter, was for some years employed by Mr. ESPENCHEID, of No. 118 Nassau-street. On the 12th of April, 1861, he enlisted in the Twelfth New-York Militia, returned to the seat of war with his regiment three times, and was taken prisoner at Harper's Ferry, when MILES surrendered to Stonewall JACKSON. He was soon afterward exchanged, joined the Sixteenth New-York Cavalry, and was captured by MOSBY at Fairfax Court-house. CORBETT was deserted by his companions when MOSBY's cavalry came down upon them. He refused to surrender, and setting his back against a tree, he used his pistols so well that he kept twenty-six of the rebels at bay for more than hour. His ammunition being expended, he advanced upon them, sword in hand, and MOSBY, admiring his gallantry, ordered his men not to fire upon him but to take him alive.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- There is undoubtedly a strong Teutonic flavor about GOUNOD's music -- a local coloring peculiarly adapted to the splendid story which he so happily and powerfully illustrates. ""Faust,"" for this reason, is generally beard to advantage when rendered by a German company, and this in spite of some alterations in the music, necessitated by translation and transposition of accent -- as for instance in Margherita's opening phrase -- prim, modest and demure in the original, but shorn of its fair proportions in the German versions. These, however, are trifles when weighed against the obvious and general adaptability of the music to the idiom of the German language. In some passages, indeed, this is so manifest that the preference must be given to it over either of the other two languages through which the work has been made so widely known. The best characteristics of the German version were certainly brought out last night in an unusually agreeable manner. We have rarely heard the work, in all general respects, better given. The artists were, without exception, in capital voice, and a rare and enjoyable unanimity prevailed -- a desire to be good and conscientious. The cast was mainly the same as last season, when Mr. GROVER played the opera here. We note, however, in his artists a commendable degree of improvement Mme. FREDERICI's voice has become fuller, and is evidently more under her control. Its quality is as heretofore, exceedingly good. We should be glad if the lady would not display so much energy in her acting -- especially in the window scene of the third act. A modest young woman communing with her thoughts in the chaste light of the moon does not fling her arms about so violently. We throw out this hint without desiring to detract from the general merit of Mme. FREDERICI's performance, which indeed was great. Mme. DJIUBA -- a young artist who sang once or twice last season -- gave a very acceptable rendering to the small but charming role of Siebel. Her voice also has notably improved. Signor TAMARO was the ""Faust,"" (singing the words in Italian,) and was good. Of Herr HERMAN's Mephistophcles it is unnecessary to speak. It has been fully accepted as one of the best personations on the stage. We must not forget to add a word of praise for Herr STEINECKE, a reliable and painstaking artist, who is always at his post. The orchestra and chorus were alike admirable. Indeed our recollections of last evening's entertainment are wholly agreeable.",https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/29/archives/musical.html,,"ACADEMY OF MUSIC. -- There is undoubtedly a strong Teutonic flavor about GOUNOD's music -- a local coloring peculiarly adapted to the splendid story which he so happily and powerfully illustrates.

These, however, are trifles when weighed against the obvious and general adaptability of the music to the idiom of the German language. In some passages, indeed, this is so manifest that the preference must be given to it over either of the other two languages through which the work has been made so widely known. The best characteristics of the German version were certainly brought out last night in an unusually agreeable manner. We have rarely heard the work, in all general respects, better given. The artists were, without exception, in capital voice, and a rare and enjoyable unanimity prevailed -- a desire to be good and conscientious. The cast was mainly the same as last season, when Mr. GROVER played the opera here. We note, however, in his artists a commendable degree of improvement Mme. FREDERICI's voice has become fuller, and is evidently more under her control. Its quality is as heretofore, exceedingly good. We should be glad if the lady would not display so much energy in her acting -- especially in the window scene of the third act. A modest young woman communing with her thoughts in the chaste light of the moon does not fling her arms about so violently. We throw out this hint without desiring to detract from the general merit of Mme. FREDERICI's performance, which indeed was great. Mme. DJIUBA -- a young artist who sang once or twice last season -- gave a very acceptable rendering to the small but charming role of Siebel. Her voice also has notably improved. Signor TAMARO was the ""Faust,"" (singing the words in Italian,) and was good. Of Herr HERMAN's Mephistophcles it is unnecessary to speak. It has been fully accepted as one of the best personations on the stage. We must not forget to add a word of praise for Herr STEINECKE, a reliable and painstaking artist, who is always at his post. The orchestra and chorus were alike admirable. Indeed our recollections of last evening's entertainment are wholly agreeable.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Musical.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Musical.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1865-04-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/af903006-07b0-51b6-8860-51bf893e73bc,438,nyt://article/af903006-07b0-51b6-8860-51bf893e73bc,

Cabinet Changes not to be made at Once,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/29/archives/cabinet-changes.html,Cabinet Changes not to be made at Once,"-- A letter from the intelligent Washington correspondent of the Boston Advertiser, which we copy in another column, will reward perusal. It confirms what we had previously understood to be the fact, that the ill-timed demonstration made upon President JOHNSON for a reconstruction of his Cabinet, immediately after the murder of Mr. LINCOLN, did not succeed. The whole country was tranquilized and reassured by the semi-official announcement, made in our columns some days since, that no change whatever would be made in the Cabinet at once. It was generally felt that the nation had been sufficiently shocked by the assassination of the President, and that it would be unwise to add to the public excitement and apprehension by hasty revolutions in the political administration. President JOHNSON naturally and wisely preferred to postpone action upon so important a matter, and we have no doubt that, whenever the time shall come for such action, it will commend itself to prudent and sagacious men throughout the country.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CABINET CHANGES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CABINET CHANGES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'CABINET', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1865-04-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4d8926a-e5ac-5ed9-942b-7146e2d31e05,164,nyt://article/f4d8926a-e5ac-5ed9-942b-7146e2d31e05,
Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/29/archives/secretary-stanton.html,Secretary,"There is no one member of the Cabinet about whom public opinion has been so surely, though gradually changing, as in regard to the Secretary of War. The faults which appeared in the beginning of his administration -- his impulsiveness in public action, and his sometimes harsh treatment of individuals -- are being forgotten in the splendor of his successes and the integrity of his administration. If Mr. STANTON is impulsive now, it is always on the side of liberty against oppression, or it is against some gigantic crime, or in his eagerness to throw his own tremendous force of character and mind into military movements which seem to him sluggish or hesitating. His acts of revolutionary energy and arbitrary power are not confined to punishing petty traitors, but to the arrest and punishment of more conspicuous criminals in peculiar crises of affairs. His prompt removal of Gen. BUTLER and his immediate renewal of the attack on Wilmington were grand and successful instances of his ""revolutionary energy.""

More than a year ago the deceased President declared to some of his intimate personal friends here, that alter he had laid aside the cares of his great office and retired to private life, it was his intention to spend the remainder of his days in Chicago. He had commissioned one of our citizens to look about the city, and before the close of his present term of office, to secure the refusal of a comfortable residence on some pleasant and suitable street. He felt a warm attachment for the people of Chicago, for what they had done for him before he became President, and for their unwavering and powerful support through the dark days of his first term. If the matter had been left to the choice of the stricken widow of the fallen chief, she would have directed that his ashes should repose on old Michigan's shore, near those of his great compeer and friend, STEPHEN A.
