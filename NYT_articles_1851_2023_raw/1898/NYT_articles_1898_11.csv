"DENVER, Col., Nov. 8. -- This has been the most disagreeable election day in Colorado for ten years. It began snowing early this morning and continued until 10 o'clock tonight. The weather was extremely cold and raw, and as a result the vote cast throughout the State, and especially in the country districts, was not up to the expectations of any faction, by at least 25 per cent. There were fifteen tickets in the field.
