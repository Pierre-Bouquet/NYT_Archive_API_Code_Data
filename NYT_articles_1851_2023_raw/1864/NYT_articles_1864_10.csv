These qualities will all be found in the volume before us, but those who really appreciate LOWELL'S talents, and regret the rarity of his appearances in public, will be disappointed to observe how thin is the staple of the work. It is composed of four or five magazine articles, originally published, ten years ago, in Putnam's Monthly and the Graham of that period, and having served their turn in this capacity, were scarcely worth rescusitating in all the luminous emblazonment of Messrs. TICKNOR's clear open type and hot pressed paper. Two of them relate to home subjects ""Cambridge Thirty Years Ago"" and a ""Moosehead Journal."" These are decidedly the most attractive portion of the book, and are written con amore, with a far-searching wealth of allusion and occasional happy grotesqueness of idiom that recalls not faintly some of CHARLES LAMB's descriptive essays. ""Leaves from a Journal in Italy"" occupy the remainder of the volume, and have additions from old letters and journals written on the spot. Though they suffer from the immense mass of printed matter extant on the same perennial topic, they are redeemed from commonplace by the individuality of the writen who says his wish was ""to describe not so much what he went to see, as what he saw that was most unlike what one sees at home."" Fireside Travels must be accepted as an earnest of greater things from Prof. LOWELL, and we hope their favorable reception will incite him to further confidences with the public.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; FIRESIDE TRAVELS.

Cooperative Movement Toward Richmond,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/01/archives/the-grand-advance-the-cooperative-movements.html,Cooperative Movement Toward Richmond,"Of the sudden, rapid, bold and remarkable series of movements around Richmond, inaugurated by Gen. GRANT on Thursday morning, we know just enough to leave us in considerable bewilderment. To the dashing and unexpected movement on the north bank of the James, were yesterday added two other movements of equal or greater magnitude on other lines -- making altogether three great, distinctive and simultaneous operations in progress upon the enemy's position -- not to speak at all of the movement of Gen. SHERIDAN in the Shenandoah Valley. Yesterday morning Gen. WARREN, who has been for six weeks planted on the Weldon Road, about a couple of miles south of Petersburgh, and who formed the left wing of our army, attacked and carried the enemy's line on their extreme right, and, says GRANT, ""immediately prepared to follow up his success."" The third of the cooperative movements is under Gen. MEADE; and regarding this -- perhaps the most important of all -- the Lieutenant-General simply gives the following sentence: ""Gen. MEADE moved from his left this morning, and carried the enemy's line near Poplar Grove Church."" This sentence was probably not intended for the popular eye, and neither in its grammar nor its topography is it very easily defined. But we suppose the pronoun his refers to Warren's ""left,"" and that from the latter's position on the Weldon road MEADE struck in a northerly direction for the railroad running from Petersburgh to Burksville Junction, and thence diverging to Danville and to Lynchburgh. GRANT says that MEADE ""carried the enemy's line near Poplar Grove Church,"" and we find ""Poplar Grove"" where we should suppose the Church ought to be, indicated in our map on the above mentioned railroad, and located only about fifteen miles from WARREN's position, or left, on the Weldon road. GRANT's dispatch is dated at half-past three yesterday afternoon, and MEADE might have made this fifteen-miles march between the time he started in the morning and that hour. This would undoubtedly be a bold and perilous march and movement, and we shall wait further advices before endeavoring to clear up the entanglement. The operation, however, has long been anticipated by strategists, and it is one that, according to what is understood to be GRANT's programme, is essential.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Grand Advance The Cooperative Movements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Grand Advance The Cooperative Movements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d6f79d16-d19a-5c85-b1e5-5320c7d10201,567,nyt://article/d6f79d16-d19a-5c85-b1e5-5320c7d10201,

We believe all our readers are aware, by this time, that the ruling classes is England have been from the outset as anxious for the disruption of the Union as any men could be, who were not actually engaged in a conflict with us. They desired it for several reasons, none of which they have had any hesitation in avowing. They feared that this Republic was becoming so vast and powerful that its existence would upset what is called ""the balance of power,"" the creation and preservation of which, have taxed the resources of all European nations during the last three centuries. They feared, too, that the continued success of the experiment of democratic government in this country, would give immense impetus and support to the democratic movement in Europe, which, in the opinion of most observers on the other side of the water, threatens, in a generation or two, the complete destruction of all the existing aristocracies, and the resolution of all European Governments into democratic despotisms like that of France. To this tendency the Southern rebellion has been considered likely to give a most decided check, as it has been made in support of thoroughly oligarchic ideas, and in direct opposite to the government of majorities, and to the prevailing idea of human equality. We were clearly mistaken at the outset of the war in attributing so much of the English hostility to us to the effect which the war was likely to have on the cotton supply.

It was exposure here, together with my arduous and unpleasant duties at Fort Hamilton, where I was required, in addition to the hospital duties, to attend night and day over one hundred camp families, together with officers, including even naval officers and their families anywhere within a circuit of a mile and over, that finally led to broken health, which, together with other causes, obliged me to resign my position. The fort is somewhat in the shape of a card diamond, presenting the angles nearly in the direction of the cardinal points of the compass. It stands upon a foundation about four hundred feet square, containing an open area within its walls. The casemates on the ground floor, together with some rooms with vaulted ceilings constitute the prisoners habitations. These vaulted rooms -- about twenty feet in length by about twelve in width -- were the more honored receptacles of prisoners of State and such as require close or solitary confinement. The number of prisoners generally ranged from 60 to 100. It will be remembered that these prisoners were by no means all prisoners of war. They may, for convenience sake, be divided into two classes, viz: 1st, prisoners of war, comprehending such as were captured while acting with and confessedly aiding the enemy, and 2d, political prisoners, embracing such as were considered as giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and such as were discovered in contraband trade. In regard to the suspension of the writ of Habeas Corpus by Government as a war necessity and the consequent placing of so many objects of suspicion within the walls of Fort Lafayette, I have little or nothing to say. That many have been placed there unjustly is not denied by Government, as is confessed in the act of setting them free upon a due investigation. By far two little consideration is given by the masses as regards the perplexing and harrassing dilemma in which Government has been placed all through this war from the first attack on Sumter to the present, full as much by foes within as without, and it is a matter of doubt whether any Administration, of whatever political phase it might be, would not have pursued the same course. Admitting its propriety in the midst of such tempestuous emergencies, it would certainly be not a little surprising if some of the innocent should not be made to suffer with the guilty. But, on the other hand, supposing such a political course to be necessary, what should be done, it strikes me, is this: When, upon due inquisition, the parties arrested and incarcerated are found faultless, let Government proclaim their innocence, duly remunerate them for their losses, and then ferret out and properly punish their false accusers. Such a course, I am sure, would diminish arrests upon mere suspicion, and go far to remove the furrows that cloud the brows of many who hesitate not to utter hard things of our Government, and speak bitterly of American bastiles.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reminiscences of Fort Lafayette,', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reminiscences of Fort Lafayette,', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0b0b1ebc-6f4d-5dd9-8d6e-e32b80da8f76,2014,nyt://article/0b0b1ebc-6f4d-5dd9-8d6e-e32b80da8f76,

Under the lead of such a man it was no wonder that his old regiment, the Sixth Maine, loved him, and followed his brilliant example through many fiery streams of death. That regiment never broke -- side by side with the gallant old Fifth Wisconsin, we have seen them go into battle, or supporting each other, seen them charge and take such fortresses as the heights of Fredericsburgh. They were worthy of such a leader, and their leader was thrice worthy of all the honors he ever received. He was a man who never failed to do his duty, and the promotion to a Brigadier-General's commission, last Winter, was but small recompense for such distinguished gallantry as he exhibited in the great charges at Fredericsburgh and Rappahannock Ford.

Prussia and Her Poles,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/02/archives/prussia-and-her-poles.html,Prussia and Her Poles,"The Germans of Schleswig-Holstein, at the outbreak of the war of liberation, were not the only oppressed nationality under the sun. Beneath the sway of the very Powers which drew the sword against Denmark, lived peopies whose lot was still more unenviable than that of the inhabitants of the Duchies. The lot of the Prussian Poles, for instance, is by no means a happy one; and, if we may judge from a trial now in progress at Berlin, other races beside the Teutonic need champions to redress their wrongs, and other sovereigns beside King CHRISTIAN need correction. There are at present arraigned before one of the high judicial tribunals of the Prussian metropolis, at the suit of M. VON BISMARK, for the crime of treason, several Polish gentlemen, natives of the Grand Duchy of Posen, and subjects of the Brandenburgher. The indictment against these men is of so voluminous a character that twenty-four consecutive audiences had to be held ere its reading could be completed, the natural inference from which would, of course, be that the crime of the accused must have been of a very atrocious complexion. But what were the acts which imparted to it this somber die? Did the traversers conspire to raise an insurrection against their King, or plot the massacre of the Prussian garrison quartered in their Duchy? Did they, by uttered word or overt act, give any indication that they harbored disloyal and treasonable designs, inimical to the safety of the State, and the monarch's supremacy? Not at all. In none of these respects were they guilty. The head and front of their offending consisted merely in the expression of sympathy for their brethren, and in aiding them so far as they were able. This, however, though well calculated to rouse the ire of WILLIAM and VON BISMARK, could hardly be made to amount to treason. The Prussian King may have regarded the Russian Poles as common enemies of himself and the Czar, but his Polish subjects did no violence to their oaths of allegiance, and committed no offence against their proper Sovereign; and anxious as the Minister-President is to establish against the prisoners the charge of treason, it is not very probable that he will succeed. Even in Prussia, the prosecutor must furnish some proof of the imputed crime, in order to obtain the condemnation of the accused. But VON BISMARK is totally unable to do this, unless reckless assertion is accepted in lieu of proof. ""Where are the facts?"" asks Dr. GUEIST, the eloquent advocate of the defendants, ""and if there are no facts, then are these men being prosecuted for their thoughts and sentiments -- a mode of proceeding which would carry us back to the trials of the Jews in the dark ages.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Prussia and Her Poles.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Prussia and Her Poles.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/86da2a25-9eaa-57d3-aff2-15c5116fd554,610,nyt://article/86da2a25-9eaa-57d3-aff2-15c5116fd554,

The rebels cheered for McCLELLAN in the trenches before Petersburgh, and there are many men who support McCLELLAN who do not hesitate to say they would rather have JEFF. DAVIS for their President than Mr. LINCOLN. Both alike feel the importance of Union defeats to MCCLELLAN's success. They have the same ends in view in case he is elected. Says Hangman FOOTE, in a letter to the Richmond Whig: ""If MCCLELLAN and PENDLETON are elected, outraged and indignant public sentiment will demand the arraignment, trial and deserved punishment of the enormous traitors and murderers who are responsible before God and man for all the abominable crimes and mischiefs which this unpardonable war has produced."" How completely the McClellan men agree with him in charging the responsibility of the war not upon the rebels who rose in arms to overthrow the Government, but upon those who have striven to keep the oath which they had taken to maintain it. FOOTE expects to see President LINCOLN and his Cabinet executed as traitors it MCCLELLAN is elected. So does VALLANDIGHAM, who said in his recent speech in favor of MCCLELLAN at Sydney, Ohio: ""If the war stops, the war power perishes with it, and in the hands of a Democratic President, his (Mr. LINCOLN's) head and the heads of those around would come to the block.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Community of Purpose North and South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Community of Purpose North and South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ab420ff0-80aa-528f-8f17-c5b4be8918dc,598,nyt://article/ab420ff0-80aa-528f-8f17-c5b4be8918dc,

While the most powerful party in the North was proclaiming its abomination of the war and its resolute demand for peace, the Northern armies in Virginia and Georgia were engaged in the most obstinate and sanguinary conflicts. In Virginia the advantage remained with the Confederates, who had been the assailants; in Georgia the Federerals, if the occupation of Atlanta is truly reported, may claim the credit of the day. But, though Atlanta may at last have been occupied, the covering army has not been routed, and a successful combination of Confederate forces threatens SHERMAN with serious embarrassment. At Mobile Admiral FARRAGUT is displaying that tenacity of purpose which has characterized the Federal tactics throughout the present campaign, and, if his progress be slow, he exhibits at least no signs of discouragement. But in the meanwhile a voice has gone forth which may still the thunder of the cannon. The Chicago Convention has not only declared the principles on which the great Democratic party is prepared to act, but has demanded, in the name of the people, that negotiations shall be immediately instituted for the suspension of arms.

and the Spanish Bondholders,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/02/archives/spain-and-the-danish-bondholders.html,and the Spanish Bondholders,"The English who were so green as to exchange their cash for Spanish bonds may cheer up -- there is some prospect of their being paid. Her necessities are moralizing Spain. Those schemes of conquest which she is attempting to carry out in the Western World cannot be realized without gold -- those public works which are needed to facilitate the developement of her internal resources, cannot be undertaken without gold; and Spain has none to spare for such purposes, neither can she borrow it, for her credit is at so low an ebb that she could not raise a cent on any bourse in Europe. The pressure of circumstances then, is beginning to convince at length the Spanish press and Spanish statesmen that repudiation and roguery have their disadvantages, and that, in the long run, honesty is the best policy as well for nations as for individuals. This conviction has brought about a marked change in the tone of the editors and politicians of Madrid, quoad the case of the Spanish bondholders. Up to a very recent period said writers and publicists treated the claims of their unfortunate creditors with the greatest contempt, invariably repelling them with the stereotyped rejoinder that they could not recognize the existence of a debt which had been long ago canceled by the State. Now, however, that the Dons find themselves under the necessity of redeeming their credit ere they can get the needful, they seem disposed to discuss the question of their liabilities, and in a late number of the Diario Espanol, a Ministerial journal, there appears a three-column article on this distasteful theme. The author of this essay, while admitting the fairness of the bondholders' claims, endeavors to palliate Spanish wrong-doing in relation to them by ascribing it to the vituperation of the British creditors and British press. The dignity of Spain was so shocked, forsooth, at the rude violence of these angry English and their advocates, that to punish their insolence she withheld from them their cash. It is probable, however, that this British outcry contributed not a little to bring the Spanish Government to a sense of its delinquency, since it put all Europe on the qui vive as to the unreliable nature of Spanish pledges, and served as a proclamation of financial outlawry against Spain. But be this as it may, the time has come, even in the opinion of the Diarion redacteur, when the case of these bondholders should be brought before the Cortes, with a view to a liberal settlement of their claims; and he urges the industrial corporations and financial establishments of the country to make manifest to the Government and the nation the pernicious consequences which have resulted from Spain's backsliding in this matter.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Spain and the Danish Bondholders.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Spain and the Danish Bondholders.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Spain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f2a0b8f1-0627-59af-9708-6193294b5e5d,572,nyt://article/f2a0b8f1-0627-59af-9708-6193294b5e5d,

"-In our dispatches from Cairo, some months ago, a strange charge who made against Mrs. Major BOOTH, WIDOW of the gallant officer who was murdered at Fort Pillow.

It is safe to say that the like of them, considering the advantages they have enjoyed, has never appeared in any country or in any age. England had her Jacobites, men who plotted against the public peace and public liberty in unison with foreign governments, who took pay from foreign despots for bringing confusion into the councils of their own country, who betrayed the navy and sought to betray the army, to the public enemy, to whom the national honor and independence were jests, and to whom the triumph of the Court party, or, in other words, their party, was their first and dearest aim. But then the Jacobites were courtiers, or were bred under Court influences, men who had been taught from their very cradles to despise liberty, and to think of the country as the royal domain, and of the King's prerogative as the only thing in it worth preserving. They grew up in an age when the great political principles which are now familiar in our mouths as household words, were but imperfectly understood, when but few peoples in Europe had solidified into nations, and when the claims of country were only beginning to asert themselves against those of creed and caste.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Disgrace of America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Disgrace of America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a77376b3-edb2-5d74-a931-9dbf76813139,1229,nyt://article/a77376b3-edb2-5d74-a931-9dbf76813139,

It does seem, however, comparing the reports of the various correspondents in the Valley with SHERIDAN, that LEE's conscripts are getting tired of their work; that they are getting tired, moreover, in large numbers, and that EARLY has actually lost more by desertion than he has in killed, wounded and prisoners. Every mile of the army's march up the Valley, our army has found squads of fugitives eager to get protection from their late military employers, and ready to march as far as their limbs could carry them away beyond the bounds of the Confederacy. The number of guns deserted by EARLY in his Southward flight is, in a measure, proof in itself, that his men could not be depended on. One great battle, and one only, has been fought since SHERIDAN crossed Opequan Creek -- the battle which began at Darkesville at gray dawn of Monday, the 19th of September, and closed on the outskirts of Winchester at nightfall of the same day.

In one case however, facts have justified the earnest warnings we have uttered. Two years ago, during the canvass for Governor, we ventured to warn the public in the most serious manner of the possible consequences of the election of SEYMOUR. We predicted that the time might come in which, under a public man like him, the whole influence of the State of New-York might be thrown against the National Government; we warned patriotic Democrats, and especially disaffected Republicans, who were disposed to vote for SEYMOUR from motives of discontent with the National Administration, that their vote, if successful, might endanger the Republic. We foresaw that he would be in secret sympathy or open collusion with the treasonable and disaffected elements of our Northern society. We apprehended -- and we urged our fears on our conservative readers -- that a rude shock might be given even to property by the factious course which he might be led to adopt. We knew that if ever revolution against the National Government should break out among the worst element of our City, as was so much hoped by the South, he would be its natural leader. We warned all men, who desired to conserve the great public interests, to be seriously thoughtful, even about the duty of a vote for a State Governor.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The State Election The Importance of a Vote.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The State Election The Importance of a Vote.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'New York City', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1bc4f4c0-8746-5efe-9f49-3258a4b82455,860,nyt://article/1bc4f4c0-8746-5efe-9f49-3258a4b82455,

The first result, as usual, has taken the form of a popular uprising against the defaulting institutions. Instead of trying to quell the disturbances, caused by the bank failures, by quietly employing the police force of the city, they rushed to the military for help. In the most extreme cases of popular riot, the city magistrates are only justified in calling for military aid, after the utmost strength of the local police has failed. No practice in the Municipal Government of Anglo-Saxon communities is better established than this, that the military can only be used on the most urgent requisition, and after it has been shown that the ordinary executive power of the municipality has failed. Forgetting this, the authorities of Chicago have brought needless odium on a posse of national troops, stationed near the city, by dragging them into this wild-cat riot, which should have been settled by a few score of non-commissioned constables, and a common-sense city magistrate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CIVIL AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES OF; CHICAGO.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CIVIL AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES OF; CHICAGO.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'CHICAGO BANK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1fc0a71e-a8ec-543b-9d13-1f29ff8b547a,178,nyt://article/1fc0a71e-a8ec-543b-9d13-1f29ff8b547a,

HOOKER, in his order assuming command of the Department of the Northwest, addresses a sentence to his military subordinates which deserves to become one of the golden aphorisms of our country and of the English language. He first announces that he requires energy, earnestness and fidelity in the performance of duty, on the part of every officer and soldier, and then adds: ""No one will consider the day as ended until the duties it brings have been discharged."" This profound moral remark is applicable not only in the department whose headquarters are at Cincinnati, not only to those engaged in military duties, but to every man and woman in every sphere of life. Were every one to learn it and put it in daily practice, it would give our national character an elevation, a faithfulness and a truthfulness now sadly lacking. The sentence ought to be given to all our young boys and girls at school, to write in their copy books, so that it might be impressed upon their minds, and become of practical power in their lives; and now that some of our preachers depart from the Sacred Word for their texts, they could find no better text to preach upon than this: ""No one will consider the day as ended until the duties it brings have been discharged.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A GOLDEN APHORISM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A GOLDEN APHORISM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/46094eea-3cc3-571f-960b-975c48f5df47,223,nyt://article/46094eea-3cc3-571f-960b-975c48f5df47,

After several years of missionary service in China, being consecrated Bishop in 1844, he fixed his mission at Shanghai, where, by the munificence of Hon. WM. APPLETON, of Boston, a handsome edifice was erected, by the name of Christ Church. The English Bishop of VICTORIA (Hong-Kong) then exercising jurisdiction over the English residents and missionaries in Shanghai, having decided, in violalation of the ancient canon, that two Bishops should not rule in the same city, a long and curious correspondence sprung up between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Connecticut, acting as Presiding Bishop or Primate of the American Church. The difficulty was finally settled by conceding to the American prelate episcopal jurisdiction in Shanghai over the English as well as the others. The deceased Bishop was of a singularly elevated and spiritual character, and was held in high esteem, both here and in China.

The enemy are now harping that we can never take Richmond; but have they not in past times harped equally loudly that we could never take Vicksburgh, that we could never take Atlanta, that we could never take Chattanooga, that we could never take Memphis or Columbus, that we could never take Donelson or Nashville, that we could never take Bowling Green or Mill Springs, that we could never take or keep New-Orleans, that we could never take Fort Morgan, and many a score of other cities and strongholds? As all these, one after another, have fallen, so in due time will Richmond, Charleston, Wilmington, Augusta and Columbia fall. As the Mississippi, the Arkansas, the Tennessee, the Cumberland and the Potomac are now dominated by our army, so in due time will we dominate the Alabama, and the Savannah, and the Roanoke. As the State of Tennessee, and one half of Georgia, and the greater part of the Mississippi Valley, are now conquered, so in like manner will we yet conquer all Virginia, and the Carolinas, and the whole of the Atlantic seaboard. Just now, the rebels are proclaiming that the great army of LEE can neither be forced from its position nor whipped behind its intrenchments; but how long is it since we heard the same thing declared as loudly about the great army of JO. JOHNSTON, and about other great armies which will never fight again on this side of Hades? Only a few weeks ago, it was proclaimed beyond our power to whip or drive the army of EARLY, so strongly was it posted, and so many impregnable positions there were to which it could fall back, one after the other.

The first article, ""A Night on the Water,"" by Col. THOMAS W. HIGGINSON, is descriptive of some nocturnal adventures of outpost duty on the border of the line of rebeldom in the South.

Judging from internal evidence only, we doubt very much whether LAMB ever wrote a line of one of the articles here ascribed to him, ""Juke Judkins,"" and think some others are mistakenly attributed to him; Fiction is represented by Miss PRESCOTT's ""True Story of Luigi,"" and an attempt at a continuation of THACKERAY's unfinished novel, ""Paul Jones and Denis Duval,"" by FELIX CARTER, not more happy than such experiments generally are; ""Communication,"" by Mr. WASSON, is no doubt inserted as a concession to the metaphysic loving tendencies of Eastern readers; ""The Wellfleet Oysterman"" is a graphic sketch by THOREAU, pleasant from its direct straightforward style, and freedom from the besetting sin of affectation.

We shall probably betray our ignorance to the piscatorial world when we say that the antecedents of ""Thad. Norris' are unknow to us, nor can we gather from the work itself whether he is a new author or one as much accustomed to handle the pen as the fly-rod. At all events he has produced what may almost be called an encylopedia of the subject, so copious is the book in instruction respecting the fish themselves, and the various devices practiced to withdraw them from the domain of the naturalist to that of the culinary ""artiste"" and epicure. The illustrations of fish, drawn from nature, are beautifully executed, and have great merit, and many of the vignetts show a quaint humor, reminding one of BEWICK's tail pieces to his Birds and Fishes. The author says, ""I had collected most of the matter contained in this book when the present unhappy rebellion broke out. I then thought it doubtful whether the following pages would ever be printed,"" but the advice of angling friends overcame his scruples. There is a remarkable precedent for the time of its publication, as WALTON's Complete Angler, the prototype of all fishing books, made its first appearance in the midst of a similar stirring season, in 1633, the first year of CROMWELL's sole rule, just as MONCK and the Dutch Admiral, VON TROMP, were fighting a desperate battle for the supremacy of the seas in the British channel. Mr. NORRIS is a true disciple of WALTON, and besides the technical and scientific information so liberally supplied, the book bears evidence of refined feeling and cultivated taste.

HOOD, under the desperate sting of repeated defeat, and the inspiration of JEFF.

With an extra dash of the pen, the rebel editors announce that at last the scale is turned -- ""the great flanker is flanked."" But all this while SHERMAN has kept a sharp watch on the enemy. He has fortified Atlanta so that five thousand may hold it against twenty thousand. And no sooner does any considerable force turn up in SHERMAN's immediate rear, than he is promptly on hand to thrash it. Thus the fight at Allatoona, twenty-five miles north of Atlanta, on the 5th, assumes significance. A large force of HOOD's army attacked our troops there, seven thousand strong, and were badly whipped, with a loss of one thousand, leaving their killed and wounded in our hands, and the main body of the rebels retreating in the direction of Decatur, or southeast from where the battle was fought, thus showing that they have already had enough of flanking. How ridiculous this movement of HOOD becomes, when we consider that the real rebel front is the maintained military line of the Confederacy, and that SHERMAN has been aiming to get in the rebel rear during the whole campaign -- just where the rebels have at last placed themselves.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Situation in Georgia.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Situation in Georgia.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b76529e5-0418-583c-bf53-70be8053395d,364,nyt://article/b76529e5-0418-583c-bf53-70be8053395d,

"Indiana, Political Campaign in",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/08/archives/the-political-campaign-in-indiana.html,"Indiana, Political Campaign in","The remarkable political campaign which has been in progress in the State of Indiana for the last three months, is about to come to a close. There has been no State campaign in our political history which has been conducted with a greater amount of vigor, which has more deeply stirred the people immediately involved, or attracted a keener interest in adjoining States. It has been of a far intenser character than the great VALLANDIGHAM campaign in Ohio last year; for the reason, that in the present case, the strength of the opposing parties was much nearer equal and the contest much closer than in Ohio, where the Unionists felt sure of defeating the enemy, and the question was more one of majorities than of actual success. The campaign of MORTON against MCDONALD for the Governorship resembles in many of its features the famous campaign of LINCOLN against DOUGLAS for the Senatorship. In this case, as in that, the lines were closely drawn; and in this case as in the other, the opposing candidates traversed their respective States together from end to end, discussing in the best of spirit, and in the utmost courteousness, yet with extraordinary power and earnestness, the grand and solemn questions on the solution of which depends the nation's fate and which remain with the people for of decision. As in Illinois in 1858, so now in Indiana in 1864, immense crowds of people have everywhere come forth from their farms, stores and workshops to listen to the great debate, to take a sympathetic part in the contest of the two champions, and to make up their minds as to their duty. If any comparison might be madd between the prominent actors in the present campaign and those in the Illinois campaign of six years ago, it might be said that Gov. MORTON, in the qualities of his mind, the character of his oratory, and his immense popular power, compares not inaptly with Senator DOUGLAS. He had, however, an opponent who was in every way far inferior to Mr. LINCOLN; and it seems to be generally conceded by both parties that in every encounter MORTON achieved a triumph over MCDONALD as complete and crushing as any of the greatest triumphs on the American stump. The campaign has given him a reputation for oratorical ability and power in moving masses of men by the force of eloquence, quite equal to the reputation he had previously acquired for high executive genius, by his splendid administration, under the greatest difficulties, of the military and financial affairs of the State of Indiana.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Political Campaign in Indiana.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Political Campaign in Indiana.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Indiana', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/de1f6963-0d31-5317-a427-0bf7a9bb2b0a,850,nyt://article/de1f6963-0d31-5317-a427-0bf7a9bb2b0a,

"Brother Ignatius, (Rev. Mr. Lyne;) Letter of",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/09/archives/miscellaneous-a-novel-shipofwar.html,"Brother Ignatius, (Rev. Mr. Lyne;) Letter of","A bold and novel scheme, involving, a revolution in the construction of vessels-of-war, has lately been submitted to the Admiralty by Mr. A. MCLAINE, a naval architect of Belfast. It is probably one of many similar contributions to the pending contest between armor-plating and rifled ordnance, but it has the merit of being simple, if not original, in conception, and capable, it sound in principle, of adaptation to existing models. Its main feature is the abandonment of broadside guns, and even of revolving turrets, and the substitution of fore-and-aft guns, ""to fire only on the line of the keel."" The advantage alleged to be gained by the adoption of this expedient is two-fold. In the first place, a ship thus armed and carried into action would present to the enemy her breadth only, instaad of her length -- that is a front of some fifty feet instead of a front of some two hundred and fifty. She would become, as Mr. MCLAINE contends, ""five times more difficult to ""hit, and when hit"" (owing to the difference in the angle of impact) ""perhaps five times more difficult of penetration."" In the second place, her aggressive power would be proportionably increased by the enormous weight that might be given to guns mounted on the new principle. The practical limit to the calibre of broadside batteries is the range of their ""lateral training."" but Mr. MCLAINE proposes that his guns should have no training at all, in the ordinary sense. They would be incapable of firing except in one direction, and while the elevation of each would still be regulated by the captain of the gun, it would be virtually pointed by the steersman. The effect of this system, if it should realize all the hopes of its inventor, would be to solve two great difficulties by one stroke -- the difficulty of making efficient seagoing vessels with invulnerable sides, and the difficulty of making such vessels of such a form as to carry, not only 600-pounders, but the still more titanic artillery which engineers assures us will soon be forged.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; A NOVEL SHIP-OF-WAR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'MISCELLANEOUS.; A NOVEL SHIP-OF-WAR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the London Times', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/03b9f824-9944-526a-9e88-cd15ecf639a7,2543,nyt://article/03b9f824-9944-526a-9e88-cd15ecf639a7,

"Sir Charles Lyell on; Lyell, Sir C., on the Glacial Period",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/09/archives/the-glacial-period-from-an-address-delivered-by-sir-charles-lyell.html,"Sir Charles Lyell on; Lyell, Sir C., on the Glacial Period","The more we examine the monuments of the ages which preceded the historical, the more decided become the proo's of a general alteration in the position, depth and height of seas, continents and mountain[???] since the commencement of the glacial period. The meteorologist also has been learning of late years that the quantity of ice and snow in certain latitudes depends not merely on the height of mountain-chains, but also on the distribution of the surrounding sea and land even to considerable distances. M. ESCHER VON DER LINTH gave it as his opinion in 1852, that, if it were true as RITTER had suggested, that the great African desert, or Sahara, was submerged within the modern or post-tertiary period, that same submergence might explain why the Alpine glaciers had attained so recently those colossal dimensions which, reasoning on geological data, VENETZ and CHARPENTIER has assigned to them. Since ESCHER first threw out th[???]e hint, the fact that the Sahara was really covered by the sea at no distant period has been confirmed by many new proofs. The distinguished Swiss geologist himself has just returned from an exploring expedition through the eastern part of the Algerian desert, in which he was accompanied by M. DEBOR, of Neutchatel, and Prof. MARTIN, of Montpelleir. These three experienced observers satisfied themselves during the last Winter that the Sahara was under water during the period of the living species of testacea. We had already learned in 1856, from a memo[???] by M. CHARLES LAURENT, that sands identical with those of the nearest shores of the Mediterranean, and containing, among other recent shells, the common cockle, (Cardium edule,) extend over a vast space from West to East in the desert, being not only found on the surface, but also brought up from depths of more than twenty feet by the Artesian auger. These shella have been met with at heights of more than nine hundred feet above the sea-level, and on ground sunk three hundred feet below it; for there are in Africa, as in Western Asia, depressions of land below the level of the sea. The same cockle has been observed still living in several salt lakes in the Sahara; and superficial incrustation of salt in many places seem to point to the drying up by evaporation of several inland seas in certain districts. Mr. TRISTRAM, in his travels in 1859, traced for many miles along the southern borders of the French possessions in Africa lines of inland sea-cliffs, with caves at their bases, and old sea-beaches forming successive terraces, in which recent shells and the cas[???]s of them were agglutinated together with sand and pebbles, the whole having the form of a conglomerate. The ancient sea appears once to have stretched from the Gulf of Cabes, in Tunis, to the west coast of Africa north of Senegambia, having a width of several hundred (perhaps where greatest, according to Mr. TRISTRAM, 800) miles. The high lands of Barbary, including Morocco, Algeria and Tunis, must have been separated at this period from the rest of Africa by a sea. All that we have lea[???]t from zoologists and botanists in regard to the present fauna and flora of Barbary favors this hypothesis, and seems at the same time to point to a former connection of that country with Spain, Sicily and South Italy. When speculating on these changes, we may call to mind that certain deposits, full of marine shells of living species, have long been known as fringing the borders of the Red Sea, and rising several hundred feet above its shores. Evidence has also been obtained that Egypt, placed between the Red Sea and the Sahara, participated in these great continental movements. This may be inferred from the old river terraces, lately described by Messrs. ADAMS and MURIE, which skirt the modern alluvial plains of the Nile, and rise above them to various heights from thirty to one hundred feet and upwards. In whatever direction, therefore, we look, we see grounds for assuming that a map or Africa in the glacial period would no more resemble our present maps of that continent than Europe now resembles North America. If, then, argues ESCHER, the Sahara was a sea in post tertiary times, we may understand why the Alpine glaciers formerly attained such gigantic dimensions, and why they have left moraines of such magnitude on the plains of Northern Italy and the tower country of Switzerland. The Swiss peasants have a saying, when they talk of the melting of the snow, the sun could do nothing without the Fohn, a name which they give to the well-known sirocco. This wind, after sweeping over a wide expanse of parched and burning sand in Africa, blows occasionally for days in succession across the Mediterranean, carrying with it the scorching heat of the [???]ahara to melt the snows of the Apennines and Alps. M. DENZLER, in a memoir on this subject, observes that the Fohn blew tempestuously at Algiers on the 17th of July, 1841, and then crossing the Mediterranean, reached Marseilles in six hours. In five more hours it was at Geneva and the Valais, throwing down a large extent of forest in the latter district, wh[???]le in the can[???]ons of Zurich and the Grisons it suddenly turned the leaves of many trees from green to yellow. In a few hours new-mown grass was dried and ready for the haystack; for although in passing over the Alpine snows the sirocco absorbs much moisture, it is still far below the point of saturation when it reaches the sub-Alpine country to the north of the great chain. M.M. ESCHER and DENZLER have both of them observed on different occasions that a thickness of one foot of snow has disappeared in four hours during the prevalence of this wind. No wonder, therefore, that the Fohn is much dreaded for the sudden inundations which it sometimes causes. The snow line of the Alps was seen by Mr. Irscher, the astronomer from his observatory at Neutchatel, by aid of the telescope, to rise sensibly every day while this wind was blowing. Its influence is by no means confined to the summer season, for in the winter of 1852 it visited Zurich at Christmas, and in a few days all the surrounding country was stripped of its snow, even in the shadiest places and on the crests of high ridges. I feel the better able to appreciate the power of this wind from having myself witnessed in Sicily, in 1828, its effect in dissolving, in the month of November, the snows which then covered the summit and higher parts of Mount Etna. I had been told that I should be unable to ascend to the top of the highest cone till the following Spring; but in thirty six hours the hot breath of the sirocco stripped off from the mountain its white mantle of snow, and I ascended without difficulty. It is well known that the number of days during which peculiar winds preva[???], from year to year, varies considerably. Between the years 1812 and 1820 the Fohn was less felt in Switzerland than usual; and what was the consequence? All the glaciers, during those eight or nine years, increased in height, and crept down their former limits in their respective valleys. Many similar examples might be cited of the sensitiveness of the ice to slight variations of temperature. Capt. GODWIN AUSTEN has lately given to us a description of the gigantic glaciers of the western Himalaya in those valleys where the sources of the Indus rise, between the latitudes 35° and 36° N. The highest peaks of the Karakorum range attain in that region an elevation of 28,000 feet above the sea. The glaciers, says Capt. AUSTEN, have been advancing, within the memory of the living inhabitants, so as greatly to encroach on the cultivated lands, and have so altered the climate of the adjoining valleys immediately below, that only one crop a year can now be reaped from fields which formerly yielded two crops. If such changes can be experienced in less than a century, without any perceptible modification in the physical geography of that part of Asia, what mighty effects may we not imagine the submergence of the Sahara to have produced in adding to the size of the Alpine glaciers? If between the years 1812 and 1820 a mere diminution of the number of days during which the sirocco blew could so much promote the growth and onward movement of the ice, how much greater a change would result from the total cessation of the same wind! But this would give no idea of what must have happened in the glacial period; for we cannot suppose the action or the south wind to have been suspended; it was not in abeyance, but its character was entirely different, and of an opposite nature, under the altered geographical conditions above contemplated. For instead of passing over a parched and scorching desert between the twentieth and thirty-fifth parallels of latitude, it would plentifully absorb moisture from a sea many hundreds of miles wide. Next, in its course over Mediterranean, it would take up still more [???]queous vapor, and when, after complete saturation, it struck the Alps, it would be driven up into the higher and more rarified regions of the atmosphere. There are aerial current, as fast as it was cooled, would discharge its aqueous burden in the form of snow, so that the same wind, which is now called ""the devourer of ice,"" would become its principal feeder. If we thus embrace ESCHER's theory, as accounting in no small degree for the vast size of the extinct glaciers of Switzerland and Northern Italy, we are by no means debarred from accepting, at the same time, CHARPENTIER's suggestion, that the Alps in the glacial period were 2,000 or 3,000 feet higher than they are now. Such a difference in altitude may have been an auxiliary cause of the extreme cold, and seems the more probable now that we have obtained unequivocal proofs of such great osciliations of level in Wales within the period under consideration. We may also avail ourselves of another source of refrigeration, which may have coincided in time with the submergence of the Sahara -- namely, the diversion of the Gulf-stream from its present cour[???]. The shape of Europe and North America, or the boundaries of the sea and land, departed so widely in the glacial period from those now established, that we cannot suppose the Gulf-stream to have taken at that period its present northwestern course across the Atlantic. If it took some other direction, the climate of the north of Scotland would, according to the calculations of Mr. HOPKINS, suffer a diminution in its average temperature of 12° F., while that of the Alps would lose 2° F. A combination of all the conditions above enumerated would certainly be attended with so great a revolution in climate as might go far to account for the exessive cold which was developed at so modern a period of the earth's history. But even when we assume all three of them to have been simultaneously in action, we have by no means exhausted all the resources which a difference in the geographical condition of the globe might supply. Thus, for example, to name only one of them, we might suppose that the height and quantity of land near the North Pole was greater at the era in question than it is now. The vast mechanical force that ice exerted in the glacial period has been thought by some to demonstrate a want of uniformity in the amount of energy which the same natural cause may put forth at two successive epochs. But we must be careful, when thus reasoning, to bear in mind that the power of ice is here substituted for that of running water. The one becomes a mighty agent in transporting huge erratics, and in scoring, abraiding and polishing rocks; but meanwhile the other is in abeyance. When, for example, the ancient Rhone glacier conveyed its moraines from the upper to the lower end of the Lake of Geneva, there was no great river, as there now is, forming a delta many miles in extent, and several hundred feet in depth, at the upper end of the lake. The more we study and comprehend the geographical changes of the glacial period, and the migrations of animals and plants to which it gave rise, the higher our conceptions are raised of the duration of that subdivision of time, which, though vast when measured by the succession of events comprised in it, was brief, if estimated by the ordinary rules of geological classification.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE GLACIAL PERIOD.; From an Address Delivered by Sir Charles Lyell before the British Association.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE GLACIAL PERIOD.; From an Address Delivered by Sir Charles Lyell before the British Association.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/770f226a-7546-579d-8e03-b80b6bf9c4de,2122,nyt://article/770f226a-7546-579d-8e03-b80b6bf9c4de,

The charge is, that at the point on GRANT's left, where the Ninth Corps operated on Saturday week, the bodies of the Union soldiers that fell in battle were completely stripped, and many of them mutilated besides. Some, it is added, presented an appearance which indicated that they were the bodies of wounded men who had been murdered. Accusations of this sort should not be lightly made. There is exasperation enough now in the loyal ranks -- looking to Libby and to Andersonville. Let us hope to be spared the record of a further accumulation of such horrors.

HENRY M. NAGLEE, once, but not now, an officer in the Army of the Potomac. We have read and re-read this letter, in order to find out what is novel or startling in it, or what there is about it that should be thought worthy of printing or writing; but we have utterly failed to find anything in its assertions, or its rhetoric, or its spirit, that is either wonderful or admirable. Its main feature is vituperation of the Secretary of War -- its main assertion, that Gen. MCCLELLAN had a plan of campaign in the Spring of 1862, which was approved by some of his Generals and disapproved by others; approved by the President and disapproved by the Secretary of War, which he was allowed to carry out as regards its chief feature, but compelled to modify in its minor details; while its main misstatements are as regards the relative strength of the Army of the Potomac at different times, and the relative strength of the rebel army at corresponding times. Now, if after all that has been said and printed upon this subject -- if, after all the facts, official documents and positive proofs furnished to the country -- Gen. NAGLEE can still assert in a random way that ""on the 26th of June Gen.

He loosely says that GRANT's army, on crossing the Rapidan in May last, was variously estimated at ""from 120,000 to 180,000,"" to which was added BUTLER's force of 40,000, other reinforcements 45,000, not to speak of SIGEL's cooperating column of 30,000; that GRANT lost 130,000 or 150,000 of these men, and so on, and so forth; statements which are untrue and preposterous in themselves, and the equal of which can only be found in the Richmond papers, or the ""Baltimore correspondence"" of one of our City cotemporaries.

Strategy; Forcing Lee to Attack,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/10/archives/grant-and-lee.html,Strategy; Forcing Lee to Attack,"The recent strategical movements of Gen. GRANT are having one peculiar effect -- they are compelling the rebels to come out from their works and attack ours. The dreadful fatality of these attacks to whichever side makes them, is now well known, and GRANT, during his whole campaign, has avoided them as much as possible. But he has so planted himself, in frequent instances, that LEE must come out and assault.When GRANT threw a corps over on to the Weldon road, LEE could not well give up such an important line without at least making a great attempt to wrest it from us; and hence the fierce assaults on WARREN's works, in which, with the contemporary assault on our extreme right, Gen. GRANT estimated that the rebels sacrificed ten thousand men. The same result has followed our movements of the last ten days. LEE was compelled to assail our men in their new positions, and behind their fortifications, both on the left and the right. Upon our right especially, that is, on BUTLER's army north of the James, the rebel assaults have been very desperate. It was on Thursday, the 29th, that BUTLER, by a skillful movement and with comparatively small loss, seized their first line of defense; and on the following day (Friday) the rebels came up, and by two successive and furious assaults attempted to dislodge us from our works. Their loss was great, and their gain nothing. A week afterward, or on Friday last, they renewed the attempt, and though at first they gained some ground and a few guns, we quickly regained our position and works -- indeed, were stronger than ever, for we hold by a strong infantry force, ground previously only held by our cavalry pickets. Having thus failed in these attacks on BUTLER, as they failed weeks ago in their attacks on WARREN, we suppose the rebels will now be likely to attempt the forcing of MEADE's new position on our left. But our corespondent with that wing gave in Saturday's issue, an account of MEADE's fortifications which would make it appear that LEE will have as poor luck and as great loss there as he has had in each of his other attempts.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Grant and Lee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Grant and Lee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1a0d1c07-b88f-5435-b22e-715aa854a582,371,nyt://article/1a0d1c07-b88f-5435-b22e-715aa854a582,

They who seek this unity are not the humanitarian theorists, who look upon man as not lost, and upon Jesus Christ only as a teaeher, nor the sacramental theorists who make the water give birth to the very faculty of faith, but the evangelical theorists who look to Christ's atonement as the ground of faith. Between these advocates, so antagonistic, there can be no unity of faith or feeling. There may be charity, but not unity. How can success be attained? They are made one by the love of Christ.

DODD, at Indianapolis, throws much light upon the plans of the conspirators in the north west, who have been, it would seem, not unjustly suspected of a design to overthrow the Government in the interest of the rebellious States. The cross-examination of FELIX S. STIGER, the Government witness, brought out the fact that the revolutionary programme of the ""Order of the Sons of Liberty,"" of which a Dr. BOWLES is military chief, included a rebellion in the West in cooperation with an invasion by the rebels. According to this programme, Illinois was to furnish 50,000 men, who were to concentrate at St. Louis, and to cooperate with Missouri, which was to furnish 30,000, and these combined forces to cooperate with PRICE, were to invade Missouri with 20,000, or what force JEFF. DAVIS could furnish, and that the 100,000 in all were to hold Missouri against any Federal force brought against them. Indiana was to furnish 40,000 or 60,000 men to cooperate with whatever force Ohio might send, and all these were to be thrown on Louisville, and were to cooperate with whatever force JEFF. DAVIS could send to Eastern Kentucky, under BUCKNER and BRECKINRIDGE, or whoever JEFF. DAVIS might deem best to conduct the operations. This was the programme Dr. BOWLES gave witness in the early part of May, 1864. Early in June of the present year Dr. BOWLES told the witness that the uprising would take place if they could obtain the cooperation or the rebel Cols.

Speech at Brooklyn Academy of Music,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/11/archives/the-campaign-great-speech-of-gen-carl-schurz-at-the-brooklyn.html,Speech at Brooklyn Academy of Music,"MR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: To ascribe great effects to small, far-fetched, and merely incidental causes is a manner of explaining historical events which weak minds pass off and weaker minds take as an eveidence of superior sagacity. Even in those cases where individuals are powerful enough to produce great commotions on their own private motives, such an historical theory is but rarely admissable; but where a nation acts upon the impulses of the popular heart, it is never so. There are those who find the origin of the great religious Reformation of the sixteenth century in the desire of some German ecclesiastics to get married. There are those who find the origin of the English Revolution in the meanness of one John Hampden, who refused to pay a few shillings of ship money. There are those who tell us that the French Revolution never would have happened but for the secret organizations of the Free Masons. Such ridiculous exhibitions of human ingenuity might amuse us had they not frequently exercised a most dangerous influence upon the actions of large classes of people; for even in our days there are those who pretend to find the origin of the great struggle which is now convulsing this country in a few Anti-Slavery tracts circulated by a few Abolitionists from New-England; and what is worse, there are many who are prepared to act upon that belief. True, the first origin of great developments is sometimes apparently small, but only apparently so. It requires an acorn fallen from an oak tree to make another oak tree grow. Ever so large a quantity of mustard seed will never do it. And even an acorn will not if it falls upon a rock. In order to make clear to our minds the true nature of the struggle in which we are engaged, you must suffer me to look back upon the original composition of American society. The men who established the first settlements in New-England were almost all plebeians -- true children of the people. They had not abandoned their old homes merely for the purpose of seeking in the wilds of the New World a material fortune which the Old World had refused them. They were the earnest champions of a principle, and they left their native shores because there that principle was persecuted and oppressed. They sought and found upon the rocky soil of New-England a place where they could conform their social condition to their religious belief. Equal in their origin and social standing, inspired by the same motives, engaged with equal interest in the same enterprises, pursuing the same ends, and sharing the same fortunes -- their instincts, however crudely developed, were necessarily all democratic. Their natural tendency was not to produce in the New World a social inequality, which in the Old World had heavily weighed upon them, but had never existed among themselves. Every institution they founded had in view the equality of the citizens, and by originating a system of public education for all the children of the people they endeavored to perpetuate that equality which originally was the characteristic feature of their society. It is true there was a great variety in their occupations: agriculture, handicraft, commerce, industry, learned professions: but all these occupations being equally respectable they produced no permanent distinctions in society, for what one might be another might become. Equality, and the democratic spirit arising from it, was the basis of their whole social and political organization. These tendencies they and their descendants carried all over the Northern States, and although the Puritans gradually dropped most of their religious and social peculiarities, and although they, as a race, became largely intermingled with other classes of people, yet those original tendencies pervaded the whole social and political system as a powerful leaven, and thus determined the character of Northern society and civilization. This is the spirit to which the North owes her thrift and industry, her education, her liberty, her progressive enterprise, her prosperity and her greatness. It was not so with the original settlers of the Southern country, especially Virginia. Some of them were scions of the noblest houses of England; they belonged to the privileged class at home. They went to the new country, those that were rich and powerful, in order to increase their wealth and power, and those that were poor and insignificant, in order to gain in the New World what they had been vainly striving to find in the Old. All were seeking new fortunes upon a new field of action. Such were the Cavaliers; and those who followed them were not permitted to forget here the difference of station which had separated them from their patrons at home. The aristocratic gradations of European society, natrally modified by the necessities of American life, were as much as possible imitated or rather retained, and the general tendency of things was more favorable to the preservation than to the abolition of social distinctions. This manifested itself clearly in the business enterprises of the New World aristocracy. Large landed estates were formed, the cultivation of which required the labor of a vast number of subordinates. Various ways were devised in which this labor could be made obligatory; a peculiar system of white serfdom was attempted, and everything seemed to concur in making the superiority of the few over the many a hereditary and permanent institution. This tendency fixed the character of Southern society and civilization. This is the spirit to which the South owes her domestic tyranny, her lack of enterprise, the poverty and ignorance of her masses, the slowness of her progress. It is probable -- nay, it is almost certain -- that the aristocratic character of Southern society would have been unable to maintain itself, and to impress its mark permanently upon their political institutions, had not the importation of a class of persons, of whom it was taken for granted that they had to labor not for themselves, but for others, furnished a welcome expedient. But for the introduction of Negro Slavery the aristocratic landholders of the South would not have succeeded in fastening upon any class of people the burden of obligatory labor; aristocracy would have lost its foundation, and been obliged to yield to the democratic spirit natural to the inhabitants of a new country. But in Negro Slavery is found a congenial element; Slavery was the soil which nourished and fostered and sustained the roots of aristocracy against the democratic breeze. I may remark here, by the way, that by tracing the aristocratic tendency of Southern society back to the Cavaliers who founded the settlements in Virginia. I do not mean to admit the ridiculous claim of the latter-day chivalry, that they are a superior race of people, and have all sorts of noble blood in their veins. Society became somewhat mixed, and among the proudest slave-barons of the day there are certainly a good many descendants of men who, if England had to dispose of them again, would be sent to Botany Bay instead of Virginia; [applause] while other Southern nobles may run up their pedigree to some speculative Yankee peddler. [Laughter.] What I mean to say is, that the character of the original settlers determined the character of social and political institutions, while subsequently these institutions in their turn determined the character of the inhabitants. I am also well aware that political doctrines were cultivated in the two groups of colonies and States which apparently contradict this representation, but only apparently, for in democracies practice frequently goes ahead of theory, while in aristocracies frequently theories are cherished the full realization of which would greatly disturb the society which cherishes them. Thus we trace in the first stages of American history two distinct currents -- one running in the direction of social and political equality, and the other in the direction of permanent social and political distinctions -- the one essentially democratic, the other essentially aristocratic. These currents were running smoothly side by side as long as they were kept asunder by the separate colonial Governments. But they became directly antagonistic as soon as by the organization of the different colonies into one republic a field of common problems was opened to them where they had to meet. Then the question arose, which of the two currents should determine the character of the future development of the American republic? and this question, meanwhile expanded to gigantic dimensions, is the one we have been so warmly discussing these forty or fifty years, and which we are now about to decide. [Applause.] Pardon me for having commenced my speech with the Pilgrim Fathers and the first settlers of Virginia. I desired to show that WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON and GERRIT SMITH are not altogether responsible for the great rebellion. [Applause.] And if you give me leave I will proceed to show that the Republican party is not altogether responsible for that event either. I may then arrive at some conclusions having a direct bearing upon the burning questions we have at prevent to solve. The struggle against Great Britain commenced, and the two great elements, the democratic and aristocratic, went harmoniously together. They had one great common problem to solve -- that was the problem of the first historical period of the American people, the achievement of political independence, the foundation of the new American nationality, and like the defence of that incipient nationality against its enemies abroad. While struggling together for that common object, they had every conceivable inducement for going hand in hand. The natural antagonism had as yet but imperfectly disclosed itself. And, indeed, at that time there was another possibility of permanently harmonizing the conflicting elements. The spirit of the leaders, as well as the instincts of the masses, had risen above the range of ordinary feelings. The philosophy of the eighteenth century had made the statesmen of the revolution Anti-Slavery men on principle. The elevation of mind and the generous emotions nourished by that great struggle for liberty had confirmed them in their faith. They had expanded their desire for colonial independence into a broad assertion of the rights of human nature. From such convictions and impulses grew that grand platform of human liberty and equality -- the Declaration of Independence. [Applause.] All their public acts relating to the subject are based upon the conviction that the abnormity of Slavery was to be put upon the course of ultimate extinction. Hence the great ordinance of 1787, and the legislation about the Slave trade. And, indeed, had that spirit continued to govern the destinies of this republic, Slavery would have been gradually abolished, the foundation of the aristocratic tendency would have been taken away, and the future development of the country would have been placed upon the solid and fertile ground of social and political harmony embodied in truly Democratic institutions. But this healthy development was suddenly interfered with -- ""by the Abolitionists,"" our opponents will say. No, not by the Abolitionists, for the general Abolition spirit of that period had brought Slavery near its death. No, it was interfered with by the invention of the cotton-gin; and strange enough, a progress in manufacturing industry worked a most deplorable reaction in moral and political ideas. Slavery, drooping in most of the States, became suddenly profitable, and the sordid greediness of gain crushed down in a great many hearts the love of principle. Slavery, instead of being an evil, a scourge and a disgrace, became suddenly a great economical, moral and political blessing. New theories of Government sprang out of this economical revolution, and the same system of social organization which a short time before had been the foulest blot on the American name, was suddenly discovered to be the corner-stone of Democratic institutions. Even ministers of Christianity joined in the frantic dance round the golden calf, and anointed the idol with the sanction of divine origin. [Applause.] Such was the interference which prevented the abolition of Slavery. Then the aristocratic character of Southern society was developed to a stronger and more obnoxious form. The old Cavalier element lost most of its best attributes; but its worst impulses found a congenial institution to feed upon, and out of the Cavalier grew the slave-lord. The struggle between the two antagonistic elements began now in earnest, and out of it grew the germs of the rebellion as an almost inevitable consequence. * * * The slave interest held the balance of power between the political parties of the country. In an evil hour, an evil hour indeed for this Republic, a political party inaugurated that most demoralizing, that most pernicious principle, that to the victors belong the spoils. And the slave power rose up and said, ""Only to him I will give these things who falls down and worships me."" And they fell down and worshipped in turn, but the ""Democratic"" party worshipped most. [Cheers.] To the victors belonged the spoils, and victory with the spoils could only be obtained by cooperation with and untiring subserviency to the slave power. This was one of those dark periods in our political history which may send a blush to every manly cheek, and make us almost doubt of the innate nobility of human nature. The fate of a democratic republic seemed almost decided by the self-degradation of freemen. What the united energy of the slave power might have vainly attempted, the inexhaustible obsequiousness of its Northern allies would have accomplished had there not been a residue of virtue in the people. But in the course of this struggle for absolute dominion the slave power showed one tendency which gave it an entirely new aspect. At the time when it had intrenched itself in its doctrine of State rights, and was about to try its strength in offensive operations, it raised the threat of separaration, secession, disunion, in order to enforce its demands. And that cry remained ever since its staple threat; and, fostered and strengthened by Northern obsequiousness, it became its most formidable weapon. What did this cry mean? It meant this: ""If you will not permit us to rule this nation, we are determined to ruin it."" This cry was raised and reiterated again and again, long before you heard of a Republican party. Then the slave power established its disloyal character, its anti-national tendency. It was then -- mark what I say -- it was then the great Rebellion began. [Cheers.] The slave power, which fomerly had been only the adversary of an opposite element in the nation, became then the enemy of the nation itself. [Loud applause.] To be ruled by one who continually threatened to murder her -- that was the situation of the American Republic. Then the Northern people had to struggle, not only for their rights and liberties, their dignity and prosperity, but in struggling against the pretensions of the slave power they fought for the life of American nationality. [Cheers.] By one of the most singular perversions of human logic, the party of the slave power called itself the National party. While it was admitted in the North that Freedom was national and Slavery was seetional, the party of freedom was stigmatized as sectional, the party of slavery eulogized as national. A party, the main body of which continually flourished the knife of the asassin over the head of the nation -- that party national! A truly loyal and national man will never feel tempted even to threaten the life of the nation. [Applause.] The slave power disclosed its enmity to the nationality first by the threat, and then the earnestness of the theeat by the attempt. At last, when under BUCHANAN's administration the asumptions and usurpations of the slave power culminated in the DRED SCOTT and Lecompton policy, the people of the North, the democratic element of the country, rose up, and at the election in 1860 it vindicated its liberties and its manhood. [Cheers.] It rescued the Republic from the grasp of an anti-democratic as well as anti-national power. Then the second great period of the history of the American people arrived as the crisis of its development. The first had solved the problem of achieving the foundation of the new nationality and defending it against its great enemy abroad; the problem of the second is to maintain the American nationality by defending it against its great enemy at home. [Applause.] The election of 1860 was a notice given to the slave power that the American nation meant no longer to live in cowardly fear of the murderous knife pointed at its heart by a set of imperious aristocrats, but that it meant to take its Government into his own hands. [Cheers.] This was the first grand uprising of the democratic spirit of the people against the absolute control of the slave power. The high-handed attempt of the latter to force the people to surrender the attributes of our Government, springing from the Northern spirit of equality, to the Southern spirit of aristocratic dominion was foiled, and the slave power, seeing that its arrogated privilege to rule the nation was denied, began to execute its threat to ruin it. It withdrew at once into its doctrine of Slave States rights, and, carrying it to the criminal extent of secession, struck its murderous blow at the life of the nation, it transferred the contest from the forum to the battlefield, and once more roundheads and cavaliers, democracy and aristocracy, meet each other in army. [Cheers.] This is the history of the origin of this revolution. I call it a revolution, for it is a rebellion only on their side; it is a revolution for the American people. [Loud applause.] This is the true character of the great struggle for the preservation of our nationality; a struggle which was initiated, not when the first gun was fired upon Fort Sumter, but when the slave aristocracy uttered the first threat of disunion, [cheers,] which arrived at its crisis when the slave aristocracy failed in its attempt to obtain complete control over our National Government, and struck the blow against the life of the nation; and which cannot end until the anti-national spirit is extinguished by the destruction of the institution which begot and fostered it. [Enthusiastic cheers.] I have led you through this long and perhaps tidious summary of our social and political history for the purpose of showing that our present struggle is the natural outgrowth of an antagonism of which we find the germs in the first organization of American society. I have shown, also, that the aristocratic element, after having identified itself with the system of Slavery, acted upon the command of its necessities. Its principal crime consisted at the beginning, and consists to-day, in identifying itself with Slavery instead of yielding to the democratic principles upon which a healthy National organization could be founded. But remaining faithful to Slavery, it was impelled by the irresistible power of logic, from step to step, until at last it landed in the domain of high treason. Finding Slavery endangered by public opinion, it was natural that it should shut itself up against that dangerous influence. But being yoked together in a common national organization, with the threatening influence of the expensive Democratic element, it was natural that it should endeavor to control or suppress it by all the expedients of corruption and intimidation. But failing in this finally, it was natural that it should try to shut itself up more effectually; to isolate itself completely, by breaking up the national organization which held it under an influence so dangerous to its existence. Thus Slavery, impelled by its necessities from step to step, was the real, the natural traitors against the American nationality, and the Southern people are only the victims of its inevitable treason. [Loud applause.] But if Slavery, the enemy of American nationality, could act otherwise without giving itself up, how are you to act, the defenders of American nationality? The answer would seem to every unprejudiced mind as plain as the question. Still, strange as it may appear at first sight, there is a difference of opinion. Only three lines of policy suggest themselves. The most feeble ingenuity could not invent any beyond these three. Either we must permit the slave aristocracy to isolate itself territorially as well as politically -- that is, we must consent to the breaking up of the American nationality; or secondly, we must preserve our Union and nationality by striking down its enemies in arms, and by extinguishing the social and political agency which in its nature is disloyal and anti-national; or thirdly, we must invite the slave aristocracy back into the national organization, offering to it that supreme and absolute control of our national concerns without which it cannot insure its permanency in the Union. On the first proposition the people have already pronounced their judgment. To accept it was impossible. The question has been discussed thousands of times; and every enlightened mind, every true American heart, has always arrived at the same conclusion. Considerations of policy, national existence, safety, liberty, civilization, peace, all lead to the same result. The old cry, ""The Union must and shall be preserved!"" is not a mere watchword of party. It is the instinctive outcry of the deepest convictions, of the immovable religious faith of the American mind. [Loud cheers.] This conviction, this faith, is proclaimed by the thunder of our artillery; it is confirmed by our victories; it is sealed with the blood of the people. This question is no longer open to discussion. [Continuous applause.] But the conflict between the two other propositions is the real point at issue in our present controversy. Our opponents may speak of tyranny, but the violence of their own denunciations gives the lie to their own assertions. [Applause.] It is dust thrown into the eyes of a deluded multitude. They may no longer have the courage to say that they are for Slavery; they are still base enough to say that they are not against it. [Cheers.] All their tirades and declamations hang loosely around this sentiment. The true issue divested of all its incidental questions, is this: A nation ruled by the slave power, or a nation governing itself. [Applause.] For the first they are ready to imperil victory, and peace, and Union; for the second, we are ready to destroy Slavery forever. [Enthusiastic cheers.] The second line of policy before-mentioned has been consistently acted upon by the party holding the reins of government during this struggle. On some occasion President LINCOLN uttered the following words: ""I am not controlling events, but events control me."" These words, applicable, or course, only to the leading measures of policy, have been denounced and ridiculed as a confession of weakness; I see in them a sign of a just; understanding of his situation. Revolutionary developments are never governed by the preconceived plans of individuals. Individuals may understand them, and shape their course accordingly; they may aid in their execution and facilitate their progress; they may fix their results in the form of permanent laws and institutions; but individuals will never be able to determine their character by their own conceptions. Every such attempt will prove abortive, and lead to violent reaction. A policy which is so controlled by the spirit of the times, and is based upon a just appreciation of circumstances, may, perhaps, not be very brilliant, but it will be safe, and, above all, eminently democratic. [Applause.] And I venture to suggest that a great many of those who indulge in the highest sounding figures of speech as to what great things they would do, if they had the power, would hardly be capable of conceiving so wise an idea as that which the President expressed in language so simple and so modest. [Loud applause.] And thus the Government has steadily followed the voice of events -- slowly, indeed, but never retracing a step. Slowly, did I say? We are apt to forget the ordinary relations of time, at a moment when the struggle of a century is compressing itself into the narrow compass of days and hours. What was to be done, and what was done, is plain. I showed you how, after the establishment of the first colonies, the democratic spirit natural to view organizations failed to absorb the aristocratic element, on account of the introduction of Slavery. I showed you how the philosophy of the eighteenth century, and the lofty spirit of the Revolutionary period failed in gradually abolishing Slavery, in consequence of an economical innovation. Those two great moments were lost; the full bearing of the question was not understood. But now the slave power itself made us understand it. Now at last Slavery rose in arms against our nationality. It defied us, for our own salvation, to destroy it. Slavery itself, with its defiance, put the weapon into our hands, and in obedience to the command of events, the Government of the Republic has at last struck the blow. Treason defied us, obliged us to strike it, and we struck it on the head. [Tremendous cheering.] The Government has not controlled events, but resolutely following their control, proclaimed the emancipation of the slave. Mr. LINCOLN was not the originator of the decree, he was the recorder of it. The executors are the people in arms. [Loud applause. * * * * * Let us return to the crisis in which we are engaged. We went into the war for the purpose of maintaining the Union and preserving our nationality. Although it was the slave power which had attempted to break up the Union, we did at first not touch Slavery in defending the Union. No, with a scrupulousness of very doubtful merit, Slavery was protected by many of our leaders -- especially one of them, who at that time held the highest military command, made it a special object not to hurt Slavery, while fighting against the rebellious slaveholder, and he exhausted all the resources of his statesmanship for that purpose. [Long continued laughter.] It is true, he exhausted at the same time the patience of the people. [Laughter.] That statesmanship threatened to exhaust all our military and financial resources; but if, indeed, it did threaten to exhaust the resources of the rebellion, the threat was very gentle. [Continued laughter and cheers.] You remember the results of that period of kid-glove policy, which the South found so very gentlemanly; reverse after reverse; popular discontent rising to despondency; ruin staring us in the face. The war threatened, indeed, to become a failure; and if the resolution of the Chicago Convention, which declared the war a failure, had special reference to the period when the distinguished candidate of the Democrat party was General-in-Chief, then, it must be confessed, the Chicago Convention snowed a certain degree of judgment. [Shouts of laughter and applause.] Gradually it became clear to every candid mind that slavery, untouched, constituted the strength of the rebellion; but that Slavery, touched, would constitute its weakness. The negro tilled its fields and fed its armies; the negro carried its baggage and dug its trenches; and the same negro was longing for the day when he would be permitted to fight for the Union instead of being forced to work for the rebellion. [Applause.] To oblige him to work for the rebellion instead of permitting him to fight for the Union would have been more than folly; it would have been a crime against the nation. [Loud cheers.] To give him his freedom, then, was an act of justice, not only to him, but to the American Republic. [Continued applause.] If the rebellious slave power had submitted after the first six months of the war, it is possible that Slavery might have had another lease of life. But its resistance being vigorous and stubborn; and not only that, but its resistance being crowned with success, it became a question of life or death -- the death of the nation or the death of Slavery. Then the Government chose. It chose the life of the nation by the death of Slavery; and the revolution rolled over the treasonable institution and crushed it wherever it found it. [Enthusiastic cheers.] Could an act which undermined the strength of the enemy, and in the same measure added to our own -- could that be callen diverting the war from its original purpose? Was not the object of the war to restore the Union? How, then, could we refrain from using for our purposes an element which was certain to contribute most powerfully to that end? Was it not the object of the war to make the Union permanent by restoring loyalty to the Union? But by what means in the world can loyalty be restored, if it is not by crushing out the element which breeds disloyalty and treason as its natural offspring? But if it is the opinion of our opponents that it was the original object of the war to lay the North helpless at the feet of the South, then it must be admitted the war is now much perverted from its original object (loud cheers). The matter stands clear in the light of experience. Every man who professes to be for the Union and shows any tenderness for an agency which is bound to destroy the Union, has in his heart a dark corner into which the spirit of true loyalty has not yet penetrated, (tremendous applause). And on the other hand, every man, whatever his previous opinions may have been, as soon as he throws his whole heart into the struggle for the Union, throws at the same time his whole heart into the struggle against slavery (cheers). Look at some of the brightest names which the history of this period will hand down to posterity: your own DANIEL S. DICKINSON, BENJAMIN F. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, the venerable BRECKINRIDGE, of Kentucky, the brave ANDREW JOHNSON, of Tennessee, (tremendous cheers) and many thousands of brave spirits of less note. You cannot say that they were Abolitionists; but they are honestly for the death of Slavery, because they are honestly for the life of the nation. [Loud applause.] Emancipation would have been declared in this war even if there had not been a single Abolitionist in America before the war. The measure followed as naturally, as necessarily, upon the first threatening successes of the rebellion, as a clap of thunder follows upon a flash of lightning. Nay, if there had been a life-long Pro-slavery man in the Presidential chair, but a Union man of a true heart and a clear head -- such a man as will lay his hand to the plough without looking back -- he would, after the first year of the rebellion, have stretched out his hand to WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, and would have said to him, ""Thou art my man."" [Cheers.] Listening to the voice of reason, duty and conscience, he would have torn the inveterate prejudice from his heart, and with an eager hand he would have signed the death warrant of the treacherous idol. [Loud applause.] And you speak of diverting the war from its legitimate object? As in the war of the Revolution no true patrict shrunk back from the conclusion that colonial rights and liberties could not be permanently secured but by the abolition of British dominion, so in our times no true Union men can shrink back from the equally imperative conclusion that the permanency of the Union cannot be secured but by the abolition of its arch enemy -- which is Slavery. [Loud applause.] The Declaration of Independence was no more the natural, logical and legitimate consequence of the struggle for colonial rights and liberties, than the Emancipation Proclamation is the natural, logical and legitimate consequence of our struggle for the Union. The Emancipation Proclamation is the true sister of the Declaration of Independence; it is the supplementary act; it is the Declaration of Independence translated from universal principle into universal fact. [Enthusiastic cheers.] And the two great State papers will stand in the history of this country as the proudest monuments not only of American statesmanship, American spirit and American virtue, but also of the earnestness and good faith of the American heart. The Fourth of July, 1776, will shine with tenfold lustre, for its glory is at last completed by the first of January, 1863. [Loud applause.] Thus the same logic of things which had driven the naturally disloyal slave aristocracy to attempt the destruction of the Union, impelled the earnest defenders of the Union to destroy Slavery. * * * * * * But the Emancipation Proclamation did us still another service. It is well known that at the beginning of the war not only the sympathies of the most powerful European Governments were against us, but that the sympathies of European nations were doubtful. Our armies were beaten, our prospects looked hopeless, and to the current running against us we had to offer no counterpoise. The nations of Europe looked across the ocean with anxious eyes, and asked: Will not now at last the great blow be struck against the most hideous abomination of this age? are they so in love with it that they will not even destroy it to save themselves? For you must know every European is a natural Anti-Slavery man. His heart, although burdened with many loads, has not been corrupted by the foul touch of that institution, which seems to demoralize everything that breathes its atmosphere. [Applause.] And when they saw, to their utter astonishment and disgust, that at first Slavery was not touched, their hearts sunk within them, and they began to explain the reverses we suffered by the weakness of our cause. At last the Emancipation Proclamation came. A shout of triumph went up from every liberty-loving heart. Once more the friends of freedom in every hemisphere joined in a common sympathy. Once more the cause of the American people became the cause of liberty the world over. Once more our struggle was identified with the noblest aspirations of the human race. Once more our reverses found a response of sorrow in the great heart of mankind, and our victories aroused a jubilant acclaim which rolled around the globe. [Continued applause.] Do you remember the touching address of the workingmen of Manchester? While the instincts of despotism everywhere conspired against us; while the English aristocracy covered us with their sneering contempt; while the laboring men in England began to suffer by the stopping of the cotton supply, and the nobility and the princes of industry told them that their misery was our fault, the great heart of the poor man raise in its magnificence, and the English laborer stretched his hard hand across the Atlantic to grasp that of our President, and he said: All hail, Liberator! Although want and misery may knock at my doors, mind it not. I may suffer, but you be firm! Let the slave be free, let the dignity of human nature be vindicated, let universal liberty triumph! All hail! American people! we are your brothers. [Enthusiastic cheers.] And this sympathy did not remain a mere idle exchange of friendly feelings. That sympathy controlled public opinion in Europe, and that public opinion held in check the secret desires of unfriendly Governments. Mason and Sifdell slink from ante-chamber to ante-chamber like ticket-of-leave men, [loud laughter] and they find written above every door the inscription, ""No slavery here!"" [Cheers.] No Government would dare to recognize the slaveholding Confederacy without loading itself down with the contempt and curses of the people. [Applause.] The irresistible moral power of a great and good cause has achieved for us victories abroad no less signal than the victories our arms achieved for us at home. Our arms will lay the enemies of the nation helpless at our feet, but emancipation has pressed the heart of the world to our hearts. [Loud cheers.] But our opponents are not moved by all this. They come with their most pitiable quibble, and I beg your pardon for answering that also. They say Your Emancipation Proclamation was nothing but wind after all. The proclamation did not effect the emancipation of the slaves. It is true, Slavery is not abolished by the proclamation alone, just as little as by the mere Declaration of Independence the British armies were driven away and the independence of the Colonies established. But the declaration was made good forever by the taking of Yorktown, and I feel safe in predicting that our proclamation will be made as good forever by the taking of Richmond. [Great applause.] But there is one point at which all parallel with the Revolution fails. If in those times a person had proposed to make an anti-independence man Commander-in-Chief, he would have been put into the madhouse, while in our days these are running around loose who seriously try to persuade the people to make an anti-emancipation man President of the United States.

Macon Speech; Davis a Gentleman Once,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/12/archives/jeff-davis-new-omens-of-the-approaching-end.html,Macon Speech; Davis a Gentleman Once,"It is not to be wondered at that so many people should have doubted the authenticity of the report of JEFFERSON DAVIS' extraordinary speech at Macon, published in the Times of Friday last, in advance of our cotemporaries. It certainly had the air of a hoax. DAVIS, up to the present time, has acted a part before the world very different from the character which belonged to him before the War, or from that manifested by his public actions since. It was understood in former years, when he was Senator of the United States from Mississippi, that he was a man of no great personal courage, of irritable temper, and unbounded ambition, but one who, in general, could cover up the most dishonorable schemes or the most intense hatred, with the manners of a gentleman. His forte throughout his administration of this rebellion, has been that he has personally acted ""like a gentleman."" With the most suave propriety of manner, he has let loose a whirlwind which will desolate this continent for years to come. With perfect good-breeding he, more than any other one man, has instigated hundreds of thousands of men to cut the throats of their brethren. Seldom losing his self-control of manner, he has wielded an iron and relentless despotism over his own subjects. With mild words, and even with the phrases of a Christian, he has carried on war, as no despot of Asia would suffer it to be carried on; permitting prisoners to be starved, negroes to be murdered in cold blood, and the most astounding barbarities to be committed. Yet, through it all, he has preserved his propriety; with one or two exceptions, his speeches have shown comparatively little temper, and he has had the immense self-control of being able to conceal the fearful wounds which war was continually making in the resources of his insurgent followers. Now at length, however, he has lost his temper; he lets out the savage Southern wild beast which the slaveholders' civilization keeps so carefully under concealment; he blackguards his enemies; he blurts out his secrets; he betrays to the whole world his weakness; he is almost maudlin.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Jeff.

Northwest Conspiracy and Flight of Dodd,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/12/archives/the-conspiracy-in-the-northwest.html,Northwest Conspiracy and Flight of Dodd,"DODD, the Grand Master of the Sons of Liberty, in Indiana, who has just been on trial in Indianapolis for treason, has managed to effect his escape by breaking his parole, and has fled the country. Only a portion of the testimony against him had been put in by the Government, but the guilt was fastened upon him, and the organization of which he was the head, so conclusively, that flight was his only resource. It was proved that the organization extended through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and other of the Northwestern States; that its members were bound to secrecy under the penalty of death, and that their plan was to arm and drill all of its members, and to prepare them for a rising against this Government whenever word should be given from the chiefs of the Order. The developments of this infamous conspiracy have made a great sensation in Indiana. Among the persons implicated and arrested is the editor of the Indianapolis Sentinel, the principal Copperhead organ of the State. It is put beyond question that many of the members of the Chicago Convention were also members of this treasonable combination, and among them VALLANDIGHAM himself, the framer of the Chicago Platform. It was the discovery and seizure by the Government of a few of the arms belonging to the ""Sons of Liberty"" that prompted the charge against the Administration, in the fourth resolution in the Platform, of ""interference with and denial of the right of the people to bear arms in their defence,"" and which also instigated HORATIO SEYMOUR to denounce President LINCOLN so vehemently in his Milwaukee speech, for attempts to disarm the people. Though DODD has taken to flight, we trust that the Government will bring to trial some of his companions in this infernal treason, and visit upon them condign punishment. These miscreants should be made to understand that they are living in a land of law. The people will quickly settle accounts with the party which has given them its countenance.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Conspiracy in the Northwest.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Conspiracy in the Northwest.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NORTHWEST', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/729ba541-ad59-5454-a486-39d486377bf3,337,nyt://article/729ba541-ad59-5454-a486-39d486377bf3,

He was born in 1775. His first book, a volume of ""Poems,"" was published in 1795, when young LANDOR, the eldest son of wealthy parents, of the old English squirearcny, had declined, with characteristic independence, the military and legal professions for which his father successively intended him, and started on a life of freedom and literature. Though diversified by many incidental changes, this programme he steadily adhered to through the long term of nearly 90 years, and of more pronounced individuality than any of his cotemporaries, on succeeding to the family estates in Warwickshire, in the early part of this century, the routine life and narrow aims of a ""large acred man"" could not long confine the restlessness of his spirit. Before many years were over he had become disgusted with his ungrateful tenants, dissatisfied with his neighbors, and out of sorts generally with the rural world. The resolution to sell the property that had belonged to the LANDORS for seven hundred years, was soon taken and acted on. In 1808, he stood clear of all such trammels, and rushed with ardor into the contest then waging by the patriotic Spaniards against the Napoleonic lust of conquest and universal dominion. His participation in this struggle occupied him until the pacification of Europe in 1815, when he purchased the mansion and estates near Florence, where the greatest part of his life has since been spent. As a writer be flowered late. At his residence in Italy commences the period of his greatest literary productiveness. His noblest and most original work, Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen, was brought out in London, in two series, in 1824-'29, and was followed by a succession of other books, partly of the same character, as Pericles and Aspasia, (with a remarkable dedication to Gen. JACKSON omitted in the American reprint.) The Tentameroy, &c., -- partly poetical, as Gehr, Count Julean, &c., and partly personal and political, springing from the intense and highly wrought feeling that LANDOR exhibited toward every object that excited his love or his hate, and between the two passions, there was no middle-ground. Though spending most of his time 'in Italy, he kept up a home at Bath. Some of his appearances in England do not redound to his credit, and must be attributed to the perversion rather than the decay of his faculties, arising from extreme age. Mr. LANDOR married in 1811 a lady of Swiss extraction. He leaves a family of three sons and one daughter, to whom he some time ago made over the bulk of his fortune, reserving but little for himself. He presented the copyright of his works to MOXON, the publisher, by whom they were brought out in ten volumes, royal 8vo., 1847,",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Walter Savage Landor.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Walter Savage Landor.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dec62951-d2f4-5b92-a232-cc84c0237647,648,nyt://article/dec62951-d2f4-5b92-a232-cc84c0237647,

"A ROBBERY WHICH IS NO CRIME -- REMARKABLE CASE. -- THOMAS CUMMINGS, who for the last fourteen years has been a waiter at the Astor House, was arraigned yesterday before Justice DOWLING, at the Tombs Police Court, on the charge of having stolen from one of the rooms of that Hotel, $2,480, under the following circumstances: In April last. Mr. T.W. PARK, President of the First National Bank at North Bennington Vt., and Mr. C.G. LINCOLN, Cashier of the same, put up at the Astor House, and while there, were one day engaged in their room in signing bills of the denomination of $10, for their bank. While the room was left unprotected for a short time, bills to the amount of $2,480, signed only by the President, were abstracted therefrom. The Detective Police were notified of the theft, and Officers KELSO and RADFORD were commissioned to work up the case. No clue to the thief could, however, be obtained for a long time. About the middle of September last, two of these ten dollar bills came into the possession of Messrs. FISK & HATCH, bankers, of this City, and they noticed that the Cashier's signature was wanting. From this point the officers were able to trace the matter to the wife of CUMMINGS, and thence to CUMMINGS himself. He was arrested, and his residence at No. 53 Greane-street was searched. They there found about $1,600 of the missing money. The remarkable part of the case is, that when CUMMINGS was arraigned yesterday afternoon before the Justice, that official came to the conclusion, after an examination of the law of Congress, which authorizes the formation of National banks, that he had no authority to hold him for larceny. CUMMINGS was therefore set at liberty. It seems that the law in question provides that the bills must be signed by either the President or the Vice-President of the bank, and also by the Cashier.

Great Campaign; Progress of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/13/archives/the-great-campaign-its-progress-and-prospects.html,Great Campaign; Progress of,"The vast line of investment which Gen. GRANT is forming around the great ""intrenched camp"" which the rebels have established at Petersburgh and Richmond, is ceaselessly progressing toward completion. In the execution of a task so formidable and complex as that which the Lieutenant-General has undertaken, much time is necessarily consumed. The drawing of what constitutes a strict line of siege around a city, stronghold or fortress may be very quickly done, as was illustrated in the cases of Vicksburgh, Port Hudson and Fort Morgan -- the only real cases of investment that we recall in the course of the war; and the final result in such instances is not long in being reached, as was shown in each of the sieges mentioned. But, at Richmond, Petersburgh and LEE's army are located, and as GRANT's army and lines are located in reference to the former, nothing more difficult in war could be conceived than the drawing of a cordon militaire around the enemy's position. The line must be of great length, must cross rivers and intersect railroads, and must maintain itself at every point. The advantages are largely on the side of LEE. With a powerful army in a central position, he can constantly menace and at pleasure strike at any part of our long line, or at either of our flanks; and if he should succeed in breaking or piercing our line, or turning our flank, the consequences might be disastrous to our operations. But though he has made several very furious and desperate attempts to effect this he has in all of them totally failed. He tried it against WARREN on our left -- tried it twice, and achieved nothing. He tried it against BUTLER on our right -- tried it twice, and achieved nothing. We have been steadily gaining new positions and extending our lines, and on each new advance LEE has attempted to drive us back; but in all he has only succeeded in temporarily checking us once. We refer to the late check of Gen. MEADE in his attempted advance on the Southside Railroad. Even there, however, it is evident the check was but a momentary check. Our correspondent at the left, in a letter of yesterday, made mention of the reconnoissance in force of the entire Fifth Corps, and Second Division of the Ninth Corps, on Sunday last, in the direction of the Southside railroad; and there is reason to believe that news of success in that quarter will soon reach us, even though LEE should ""move a heavy column from Richmond"" to prevent it. But although the Southside railroad were gained, GRANT's task would by no means be completed. There would yet be the Weldon road that must be reached, and still other and more difficult work to be done.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Great Campaign Its Progress and Prospects.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Great Campaign Its Progress and Prospects.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/292124a9-745d-52d7-bff8-0b47734e2348,566,nyt://article/292124a9-745d-52d7-bff8-0b47734e2348,

SHERMAN, embracing a carefully-prepared narrative of military operations in the Southwest, from the day of his appointment as Commander of the Grand Division of the Mississippi, down to the entry of Gen. SLOCUM's corps into Atlanta, has been published officially. It was on the 14th of March that Gen. SHERMAN received notice from Gen. GRANT that he (Gen. GRANT) had been commissioned Lieutenant-General and Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the United States -- an appointment which would compel him to go East, and that he (Gen. SHERMAN) had been appointed to succeed him as Commander of the Mississippi. Immediately thereafter, Gen. SHERMAN began a tour of inspection, visiting Athens, Decatur, Huntsville, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and other military points within his new command. The new Commander, in this preliminary tour of observation, had interviews with Major-Gen. MCPHERSON, commanding the Army of the Tennessee, at Huntsville, with Major-Gen. THOMAS, commanding the Army of the Cumberland, at Chattanooga, and with Major-Gen. SCHOFIELD, commanding the army of the Ohio, at Knoxville. A general programme of the campaign in their interviews with the Lieutenant-General, and the various suboridinate army commanders was arranged. On the 27th of April all the troops, thus organized under SHERMAN's command were in motion towads Chattanooga, and on that day he himself was there in person. His aim was to have the army of the Cumberland 50,000 strong, that of the Tennessee 35,000, and that of the Ohio 15,000.

So that, if they do not vote for him, it is hard to say who will. One great argument which has always been used by the Copperhead faction for having him in chief command of the army, and letting him do as he pleased, has been this boundless devotion of the troops to him -- a devotion so great, in fact, that at one time it was alleged that it would prevent them from fighting under any one else. It was always easy to make this statement in the newspapers and on the stump, and as it was just as difficult to disprove it as to prove it, thousands, of course, believed it, just as thousands believe, on much the same kind of evidence, that MCCLELLAN is a great General.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'POLITICAL SENTIMENTS OF THE SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'POLITICAL SENTIMENTS OF THE SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bffb740b-4253-5612-8282-5b2b693d0074,355,nyt://article/bffb740b-4253-5612-8282-5b2b693d0074,

"-- The recent Fall Book Trade Sale went off with reasonable animation in view of the exciting topics of the coming election, &c. Events of this nature, inevitably demanding a large share of the public attention, are notoriously unfavorable to the circulation of books in the same quantities that are consumed by the general demand, when there is an absence of any absorbing subjects, and the minds of people are free to amuse themselves with the products of literature. One fact was satisfactorily established by the sale which is, that the manufacturers' call for higher prices in consequence of the increased cost of book-making, was responded to without a murmur. In fact, the additional expense attending every branch of the manufacturing process was so well known to all the parties concerned in the sale, that the justice of the rise in prices was self-evident and could not be resisted. It may, therefore, be safely asserted that until some other turn of the monetary wheel takes place, the reign of cheap literature is over for the present. Scarcely any book can be published for one dollar, and the same class of publications that were formerly issued for that sum will now command one dollar and seventy-five cents to two dollars and a half, and the same proportion nearly, will hold good with larger books. How far this new state of things prepares the way for the reception of the English system of circulating libraries, some acute business man will probably show us before long. The quantities of books sold were not large, though, as mentioned above, the prices were generally satisfactory. There was an absence of the customary Western buyers, partially made up, by the presence of a number of the Canadian Book Trade, who on the prevailing state of the currency, are enabled to lay in stock on very advantageous terms. Scarcely any new publications were offered at the sale, but full assortments of standard books went off in the usual channels for distribution among the public. Of miscellaneous articles, photograph-albums were the most abundant. Several invoices of these showed an undiminished demand.

DIX which we published on Monday, contains some admirable remarks on the effect upon our polical condition, evoked by the practice in which all public parties have indulged, for the last forty years, of considering nothing but "" availability "" in the choice of candidates for the Presidency. Gen. DIX ascribes, and with great reason, most of the toils which now beset us to this most unfortunate tendency. Conspicuous ability, and experience in the conduct of public affairs, were, for a long time previous to the war, almost complete barriers to political advancement. A man no sooner made his mark in Congress, or in office, than he lost all chance of reaching the highest political prize. The great thing with conventions was to find men for their nominations who had no bitter enemy, -- not because they were general favorites, but because nobody knew enough of them either to like or dislike them. This was, however, not so much the fault of the conventions after all, as of the general popular contempt for all training and experience -- a contempt bred in a great measure by the circumstances in which the country was placed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Public Office in America--The New State of Things.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Public Office in America--The New State of Things.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/473e6911-26ea-5ce1-b1df-1bf27870bbcf,1044,nyt://article/473e6911-26ea-5ce1-b1df-1bf27870bbcf,

Powell's Picture of Perry Transferring his Flag,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/14/archives/article-1-no-title-fine-arts-amusements.html,Powell's Picture of Perry Transferring his Flag,"Mr. W.H. POWELL's picture of PERRY transferring his flag, comes opportunely with the anniversary of the battle of Lake Erie. The work, indeed, is at the present moment, on exhibition at Rhode Island, the natal place of the hero, and where it is proper that his deeds should be commemorated. It is not intended, however, for that gallant little State. Ohio claims it for her new and beautiful capitol at Columbus, and has patiently awaited its completion for more than five years. Beyond waiting, we have not been able to discover that Ohio has acted with any unusual degree of liberality toward the artist. Mr. POWELL has completed the picture entirely at his own cost. We mention this fact as creditable to the gentleman, and as evidence that in painting it he has been actuated by other than the mere motives of pecuniary gain. A patriotism not unworthy of the subject, it seems to us, is exhibited in the devotion of an artist who, for so long a time, bestows the best energies of his mind upon a work which can only be inadequately recompensed in the future. Mr. POWELL's happiest reward will come, not from the Legislature of Ohio, but from the hearty approval of his countrymen, and the consciousness thence derived, that he has interpreted a brilliant incident of naval history in a large and noble manner.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title; FINE ARTS.

This distinguished American jurist was born in Calvert County, Maryland, March 17, 1777. He was descended from an English Roman Catholic family, which settled in Maryland about the middle of the seventeenth century. He received his education at Dickinson College, in Pennsylvania, where he was graduated in 1795. Four years later he was admitted to the bar, and began to practice in his native county, from which he was elected a delegate to the General Assembly. In 1801 he removed to Frederick. He was elected a State Senator in 1816; and six years afterward, on retiring from that office, he removed to Baltimore, where he continued to reside until his decease. In 1827 he was appointed Attorney-General of Maryland; and in 1831 President JACKSON conferred upon him the office of Attorney-General of the United States. Upon the dismissal of Mr. DUANE, Secretary of the Treasury, in 1833, for refusing to obey the order to remove the Government deposits from the United States Bank, President JACKSON appointed Mr. TANEY to succeed him. He immediately issued the order to remove the deposits to the local banks selected by him as agents of the Government. The Senate, which was opposed to the Administration, refused in 1834, by a vote of twenty-eight to eighteen, to confirm his nomination. The following year he was nominated by the President as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court; but the Senate virtually rejected him. On the death of Chief Justice MARSHAL, Mr. TANEY was nominated as the successor of that distinguished jurist; and the Senate, which, meantime, had changed its political complexion, confirmed his nomination in 1836.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY; Obituary Notice--Proceedings of the Courts-- Honors to His Memory.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY; Obituary Notice--Proceedings of the Courts-- Honors to His Memory.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Supreme Court', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/92606a8b-0f7f-56ff-a1f9-291ead0a7a49,1402,nyt://article/92606a8b-0f7f-56ff-a1f9-291ead0a7a49,

They shrink constantly from the occupation of posts which it is especially their duty to occupy, and which nobody else can occupy, and the result is, naturally enough, that they find themselves unceremoniously thrust aside when more desirable places are put up to competition. The Legislatures of our States and the Common Councils of our large cities ought, for instance, to protect the poor against the unscrupulous exactions of the great corporations. It is their duty under any circumstances, but it is peculiarly their duty, as they are generally composed of men who owe their places to profuse professions of democratic zeal, and of devotion to the rights of the working classes. But as everybody knows, the comfort of the people, and especially of the poor, are not really of the smallest concern to them.

Winsor vs Ship Cornelius Grinnell; Salvage,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/16/archives/law-reports-interesting-admiralty-decision-salvage-united-states.html,Winsor vs Ship Cornelius Grinnell; Salvage,"Henry Winsor et al. vs. The Ship Corneltus Grinnell. -- This was a libel for salvage filed by the owners of the steamship Saxon. The facts of the case were as follows: The ship had left London bound to New-York on the 23d of March, 1863, with a valuable cargo and a large number of passengers. On the 2d of April she hove to in a severe gale of wind, her master supposing he was off Fire Island. She lay to till next morning at 4 o'clock, when she was run in west-northwest, toward New-York as was supposed, and between 12 and 1 P.M. she made the land, which was thought to be the New-Jersey shore. She was then headed off east-southeast, and in half or three-quarters of an hour, struck in shoal water. She wore ship to the westward and immediately anchored in five and a half fathems of water. She lay there for about an hour, head to the wind, which was blowing fresh from the northeast, accompanied with rain, her officers being ignorant of her real position, when the Saxon, which ran regularly between Philadelphia and Boston was discovered passing on her trip to Boston. Signals of distress were immediately set and the Saxon [???] down, and Capt. Spencer, of the Grinnell, was informed, on his inquiring where he was, that he was on Five Fathom Bank, off Cape May. Capt. Spencer informed the Saxon of the condition of the ship, and asked if the Saxon would take him to a port of safety. Capt. Matthews, of the Saxon, said he would try. The Grinell's cable was slipped, and the Saxon took a hawser from her to take her in tow; but in attempting to get the ship off before the wind, the hawser parted near the Grinnell's knightheads, from inavitable accident, and though the Saxon's engines were stopped as soon as they could be, and every effort was made on the Saxon, it got foul of her screw, and 20 or 30 fathoms of it were found on her screw when she reached Boston. The Saxon then ordered the Grinnell to make sail and follow her, which was done, the two ships steering toward the mouth of Delaware Bay. After going five or six miles the Saxon stopped to let the Grinnell come up, when Capt. Mathews told her he should have to get another hawser to her before night, as it would be ebb-tide before they reached the mouth of the Bay, and he could not get him to a safe anchorage without it. Capt. Spencer then asked if he could not take him to sea. Capt. Mathews said he could; and thereupon the Saxon led the way, and the ship followed out to sea, clear of all the shoals, when the Grinnell hauled up on her course for New-York, and the Saxon went on her way to Boston. The ships had been together about five hours. The Grinnell was found to be in good condition on arriving at New-York. She was valued at $22,500, and her cargo at $100,000. The Saxon was worth over $100,000, and had on board a cargo worth $400,000. She was injured while coming in contact with the Grinnell while taking the hawser, to the amount of $260. White pursuing her voyage to Boston, she arrived at Pollock's Rip about an hour before low water, and in attempting to cross she struck, and was injured to about $2,500. If she had not been detained by the Grinnell, she would doubtless have reached he Rip at high water, and passed it in safety.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Interesting Admiralty Decision Salvage.

It is believed here that Gen. MCCLELLAN's letter of acceptance has hit the happy mean,"" &c. Now if it be true, as we think it is, that there is a peculiar significance in men like ALEXANDER LONG being ""left in the lurch,"" this is certainly very cold comfort for LONG and VALLANDIGHAM's ""valued friend,"" GEORGE H. PENDLETON, whose turn is to come next. If the people can't tolerate LONG, what is to become of PENDLETON? On what ground is it, we may safely ask, that the opinions of the two do not coincide? To be sure, PENDLETON expressed, at the convention, his regard for the Union, and his desire that it might be restored. But LONG and VALLANDIGHAM ""love the Union,"" and desire its restoration just as much as he. LONG has never said he didn't-think the Union a good thing, or didn't wish it would be preserved. What LONG has said is, that he, for his part, does not think it worth fighting for, or that it is of any use to fight for it; and as it is this that has caused him ""to be left in the lurch,"" we strongly advise him to be of good cheer, for in three or four weeks more he will find himself in respectable company. He will have at least one man in the same predicament with himself, whom we shall not indicate more particularly than to say that his name begins with P.

SHERMAN than is commonly imagined. We suspect he edits half of the newspapers in the Southern Confederacy. There are very many reasons for thinking so, but our latest reason is this. It will he remembered that while SHERMAN was laying slege to Atlanta, a couple of months ago, an apparently shrewd suggestion was made by a rebel newspaper, that the Confederate cavalry should be sent north of Atlanta and into Tennessee to operate on SHERMAN's rear. The suggestion was quickly taken up by rebel journals all over the Southern Confederacy. They demanded this action -- demanded it loudly. They roared and shrieked for it, and ever louder grew the roar and shriller the shriek. The cry of ""Cavalry to the rear!"" resounded through the length and breadth of the South in general chorus, till finally the tympanum of JEFF. DAVIS' ear was cracked, and his soul distracted, by the noise of the general uproar; and he ordered the cavalry of HOOD's army to hasten to the rear and to Tennessee. Now, of all things, this was precisely the one thing that was necessary for the success of Gen. SHERMAN, and the thing that actually secured for him the victory at Atlanta. In SHERMAN's order to his army upon its triumphant entry into Atlanta, he says, after recounting the various obstacles and embarrassments that had stood in the way of success: ""At last, the enemy made the mistake we had waited for so long, and sent his cavalry to our rear, far beyond the reach of recall."" And again, in his report of his entire campaign which we gave in the TIMES last week, he alludes to the same blunder of the enemy in sending their mounted forces northward, and says: ""I could not have ask ed anything better. . . . I renewed my orders for the movement of the whole army.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'DOES GEN.

Some of the ports themselves -- such as Charleston, Savannah and Mobile -- we do not hold; but we command their entrances by the possession of the works controlling those entrances. The rebels understand that it is now in the order of things that Wilmington should be reduced -- or, at all events, that we should gel control of its outworks, so as to seal it up effectually; and, accordingly, half a dozen of their organs are loudly warning the Confederate Government and the rebel military authorities at Wilmington to prepare for attack by a grand naval force, which, they say, is being gotten ready near Fortress Monroe. The Richmond Sentinel, the Whig, the Christian Sun, the Charleston Mercury, the Augusta Constitutionalist, and other papers, contain news and notes of warning on the subject, and, of course, they show the utter impossibility, of our obtaining any success at Wilmington. The Augusta Constitutionalist, after announcing that the Yankees are now bent upon the destruction of Wilmington, congratulates the rebels that ""this point bids fair to put a period to the audacious luck of FARRAGUT."" It is stated that no more tremendous earthworks exist on this continent than those that bulwark the inlets of Cape Fear. Nature, besides, has done much for its protection. The bars are shallow, the channels narrow and immediately under rebel guns.

But our Copperheads, in themselves firing a salute, as they did last evening, over their victory in Pennsylvania, evinced a cool contempt for the people that makes the coolness of the Chinaman quite tropical in comparison. Pennsylvania has given a positive popular majority for the Union candidates on the home vote, which will be increased by the returns from the army to at least fifteen thousand, and probably eighteen thousand majority; and has elected seventeen, and perhaps eighteen, members of Congress, out of twenty-four. The Copperheads have not the grace simply to affect an unconsciousness of all this, but must claim it as a victory for themselves, fit to be celebrated with salutes and illuminations.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/18/archives/amusements.html,,"MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC. -- The most agreeable opera of the sesson, and the freshest, was given on Wednesday evening. VERDI's ""Balio in Maschera ""still ranks as a novelty. It is the latest important work that has issued from the composer's pen, with the exception of ""La Forza del Destino."" The melodies are piquante, the musical combinations and finales ingenious and effective, whilst the instrumentation is extremely interesting. When Mr. MARETZEK first introduced the ""Ballo"" to the attention of the public it was with a vocal combination that demanded instant recognition. The various roles were rendered with great spirit, but the work as a whole was not so well rendered as on Wednesday night. We can say so without any hesitation and despite the fact that the contralto -- being a deputante -- was in a nervous plight, and that in several portions of the opera it became apparent that the tenor had but a slight and timid acquaintance with the music. It is due to Signor MASSIMILIAM to say that he undertook the part of Richard for the first time, and that if he seldom did injustice to the composer. His study of the part will, we are persuaded, prove amply sufficient on the next representation. The contralto to whom we have referred is Mlle. FRIDA de GEBELE, a young lady of decided promise, with a ponderous voice and an insufficient command of it. The role of Ulrica does not present any unusual satlencies, and the lady could do no more than display her voice, and ask an obvious tremulousness a kindly consideration for her inexperience. The opera, we need scarcely say, does not depend on any one artist. The ensembles are its chief attractions, and after these the interest centres principally on the soprano and the baritone -- both of whom were simply superb. The third act was given with a clearness which we have never heard equalled at the Academy, and only on rare occasions elsewhere. The fourth act was hardly less admirable, but the brilliancy of the ball room scene was marred by the paltriness of the dominoes which smothered the guests. Mr. MARETZEK is paying so much attention to the matter of costume, that it is a pity his laudable object should be frustrated by the dingey calico remains of past seasons. We lack space to enlarge further on the merits of the ""Ballo."" The opera will be repeated to-morrow night, and we recommend, it unhesitatingly to the attention of the public.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/36e75748-44ef-5ee2-a1af-748eb6d44e18,2169,nyt://article/36e75748-44ef-5ee2-a1af-748eb6d44e18,

His peculiar success has been owing to great executive abilities, combined with a public devotion, which not only nerved him to tireless endeavor, but which elevated him above all personal jealousies and challenged universal respect. An absolute singleness of loyal purpose has characterized him from the beginning. The people of Indiana have marked it well. It not only gives weight to every act in his executive chamber, but to every word on the stump. And the result has been an election triumph so signal as quite to take the country by surprise.

"The Freeman's Journal gives the following account of the measures adopted by the Irish authorities to prevent the threatened combat between MACE and COBURN: ""Notwithstanding the result of the meeting for the appointment of the referee, the general belief on Tuesday was that the fight would take place. Mr. E. JAMES and others interested in the pugilistic encounter took their places in the mail train on Monday evening, the 3d, and a large number of detectives were hovering about the platform and book-office. The lovers of 'the manly sport of self-defence' took tickets for various stations beyond Goold's Cross, at which they were to stop, for the purpose of baffling the constabulary, who were to be seen in all kinds of strange costumes, and keeping a sharp look-out. Every male passenger was closely scrutinised for the object of coming at either of the champions, and questions were asked in the most insinuating manner with a view of finding out the place where COBURN had taken up his headquarters. As the train stopped at the several stations bodies of constabulary were to be seen drawn up on every platform, and crowds of country people all most eager to get a view of the pugilists whom they believed were in the train. Those who knew the real state of affairs were perfectly aware that the contest, of which so much had been written and spoken, would not come off, and that Mr. JAMES was only going down for the purpose of keeping an appointment with COBURN, who had pitched his ground in a farmhouse not many hundred yards from Goold's Cross Station, to tell him of the result of the meeting to appoint a referee, and to make arrangements for his appearing on the battle-ground between 12 and 2 o'clock, on the following day, in accordance with the stipulations contained in the articles. At Sallins, Newbridge, Kildare, and all the stations down to the Limerick Junction, the constabulary showed in great force, and, nothwithstanding the fact that the night was bitterly cold, with a sharp, freezing breeze from the eastward, crowds were congregated at all the places where the train stopped. It was clear from the concentration of a large force of constabulary at Goold's Cross Station, that the people in authority were well aware that that was the place selected by COBURN's friends for those concerned in the fight, to take their departure for ""the trysting place."" The ground selected was within a short distance of the ""Rock of Cashel,"" a secluded place. On the arrival of the train at Goold's Cross Station there was no one to be found who could give any information about COBURN, and the absence of any of the reporters from the London sporting journals clearly proved that there was not the slightest chance of the fight taking place. One Hundred of the constabulary were drawn up under arms round the station, and after the Sergeants had taken stock of the passengers who had left the train, they retired to take shelter behind the nearest wall from the bitter wind that was blowing. Those who had come down to see the fight, and who  had not abandoned the hope that the ""mill"" would come off, pushed on for Cashel on outside cars in the piercing cold, and on arriving at the ""City of the Kings,"" they found that every bed in the hotels had been engaged, principally by the friends and backers of COBURN, several of whom had come over from Liverpool. It was positively stated that COBURN was in the neighborhood, but, strange to say, his own agent did not know where to find him or CUSICK, his trainer and backer. On Tuesday morning, COBURN's friends and several members of the Dublin press, proceeded from Cashel to Goold's Cross, a distance of five miles. The constabulary were even more numerous than on the day previous, and the men looked rather exhausted after their long term of duty in weather severely cold. On the approach of every train, constables were placed behind walls, and distributed along the platform, and horse-police were in readiness to dash off at a moment's notice, to bring skirmishers in to prevent a fight that was never to take place. Military men and others who had come long distances to be present at the pugilistic encounter, were loud in their complaints at the manner in which the principals, or those acting for them, backed out of their engagements. Much amusement to the knowing ones was occasioned on the arrival of the train which left town at 7:30 o'clock, by the constabulary having arrested a man named RYAN, from Tnurles, whom they mistook for MACE. Nothing could be more comic than the bewilderment expressed on the face of Mr. RYAN, who is a jolly-looking farmer, on being taken captive. He insisted that he was himself, and not JEM MACE, but he would not be believed by the sub-inspectors and sergeants, who took him into the booking office, and interrogated him with the most laughable solemnity; and it was not until two military gentlemen had pledged themselves that Mr. RYAN was not JEM MACE that he was allowed to go at large. While this scene was being enacted, JOE COBURN, it is stated, escaped from a house in the vicinity of the station, where he had been ""lying up,"" and which the police searched shortly after the pugilist had got away. MACE, however, did not appear during the day, nor any of the pugilistic corps, and all those who appeared to be in the ""secret"" returned to town by the mid-day trains. It appears that shortly before two o'clock COBURN, accompanied by his trainer, CUSICK and his second J. MACKESY, succeeded in getting to a spot about a mile behind the Goold's Cross station, named Ballack. Here in the presence of CHARLES WESTHALL, of the Sporting Life, and Mr. JAMES, of the New-York Clipper, CUSICK formed the outline of the square which is miscalled the ring by planting four upright poles in the ground. Within the ring COBURN pitched his cap, the usual gage, and then followed it himself. MACE not putting in an appearance, COBURN claimed the &#194;&#163;1000 stakes, on the ground that the articles specify that the men were to be on the spot named for the contest between twelve and two o'clock, and MACE had failed to keep the engagement.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/19/archives/great-britain-the-prize-fight-how-it-was-stopped.html,,"The Freeman's Journal gives the following account of the measures adopted by the Irish authorities to prevent the threatened combat between MACE and COBURN: ""Notwithstanding the result of the meeting for the appointment of the referee, the general belief on Tuesday was that the fight would take place.

DAVIS beat about him like a madman abusing everybody; STEPHENS is smooth, sophistical, plausible and inoffensive.

The Lincoln Veteran Club, an association composed exclusively of officers and soldiers who have served during this war, and numbering 2,000 members, held their first grand mass meeting at the Cooper Institute last evening. No such meeting has been held in that hall since the campaign of 1860. In point of numbers, respectability and enthusiasm, it excelled anything that has been seen for years. It was a war meeting. The stage was not alone decorated with the favored banner of the Republic, but the implements of warfare, the cannon, the musket, the bayonet, and many a brave man who had used those weapons in support of that flag against the enemies of his country testified that the Lincoln Veterans meant war and no ""cessation of hostilities"" with armed rebels. Many of the most distinguished military men now in the city, numbers of eminent private citizens, and over one hundred wounded soldiers were on the stage. The audience, which filled the hall to suffocation, was plentifully sprinkled with the blue uniforms, and sunburnt faces of the heroes of the Potomac and Georgia. In the course of the address of Col. VAN BUREN, the question as to where Gen. MCCLELLAN was at the battle of Malvern Hill was raised and referred to the veteran soldiers present. In answer they sang out in one voice, ""Gunboat;"" ""Galena."" To the credit of the Lincoln Veteran Club, it can be said that they convened last night an enthusiastic war meeting, which will thrill with joy the hearts of their comrades in the field.

"Birney, Major-Gen. D. B.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/20/archives/obituary-majgen-db-birney.html,"Birney, Major-Gen. D. B.","Notwithstanding the statement made some days since that a severe attack of fever had compelled Maj.-Gen. D.B. BIRNEY. Commander of the Tenth Army Corps, to leave his post with the Army of the Potomac, the announcement of his death in yesterday's TIMES took the country by surprise. Gen. BIRNEY, was a son of JAMES B. BIRNEE, the Alabama planter, who gave practical testimony of his hatred for slavery by freeing all his negroes, and who was some years afterward nominated by the Abolitionists as their candidate for the Presidency. When the war broke out, Mr. BIRNEY was engaged in business in Philadelphia as Mercantile Collection Agent. He had been a member of the Republican party from the date of its organization. All the military knowledge that he possessed he had gained while connected in the State militia, but promptly upon the inauguration of hostilities by the South, he set about raising the Twenty-third Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, of which organization he was named Lieutenant-Colonel. At the expiration of his term of service he determined to organize another regiment, and within a few weeks again left Philadelphia at the head of Birney's Zouaves, one of the largest regiments which have gone from Pennsylvania. The organization was ordered to the Army of the Potomac, and Col. BIRNEY was soon after appointed Brigadier-General. The gallantry and bravery which he displayed during the Peninsular campaign, and the promptness and skill with which he handled his troops, secured his promotion to the command of the Third Division of the Second Corps in May last. His division performed its full share of service in the actions which forced LEE to retreat through the Wilderness, and which subsequently compelled him to fall back from the Rapidan to Petersburgh. In the march from Todd's Tavern to Spottsylvania Court-house, it occupied the right of the Army of the Potomac, and at the latter place, some days before the movement toward the North Ana, it distinguished itself and its determined Commander by carrying the whole line of rifle-pits in front of the rebel position -- an exploit which doubtless hastened LEE's retreat. Then, again, under Gen. BIRNEY's leadership, the same division did its duty brilliantly and well in the crossing of the North Ana and the Pamunkey, and at Hanover Court-house and Bethesda Church. At Cold Harbor, May 31, BIRNEY's division, which was on the north bank of the Totopatamoy, forded the creek, scaled the steep bank on the opposite side and carried the works held by BRECKINRIDGE, almost without firing a gun. Gen. BIRNEY has borne a prominent part in all the operations before Petersburgh and Richmond, and on July 23d Gen. GRANT promoted him to the command of the Tenth Corps in the Army of the James. A few days since he was taken sick with the premonitory symptoms of malarious fever, and there is every reason to believe that his vigorous constitution would have enabled him to resist the disease, had it not been for the exertions which he made upon the occasion of the rebel attack upon KAUTZ's cavalry corps. Immediately upon receiving information of the disaster which had befallen this detachment, Gen. BIRNEY, as will be remembered, left his bed, and at the head of his division recovered and held all the ground that had been lost. The excitement aggravated his complaint, and a day or two afterward he was found to be so much worse that his removal to his home in Philadelphia became a matter of necessity, and there, as has already been announced, he died on Tuesday night. In him the army loses one of its best and bravest leaders, and our cause one of its most consistent and earnest defenders.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Obituary. MAJ.-GEN. D.B.

"Great Speech at Covington, Ky.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/20/archives/speech-of-hon-salmon-p-chase-delivered-in-odd-follows-hall.html,"Great Speech at Covington, Ky.","KENTUCKIANS -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Four years ago I stood where I now stand, and spoke to an audience in this hall upon the issues which were then before the country. Then, as now, I advocated the election of ABRAHAM LINCOLN to the Presidency of the United States, and I endeavored to show to my fellow citizens that the Republican plan -- what we now know as the Union plan -- for the settlement of the great controversy before the country, was the true plan. Four parties then claimed the suffrage of American citizens. One supported Mr. BRECKINRIDGE and asserted as their fundamental principle that slavery should be extended throughout the Union; not only that it should be secure in the States where it existed under local constitutions and laws, but that it should be carried beyond those limits, into all the territories of the Union; not only so, but that under claims of transit and reclamation it should be established practically in all the States. I endeavored to show you at that time that upon this platform there could be no peace. Another party supported Mr. DOUGLAS, and their theory was, that subject to the construction of the Constitution by the Supreme Court, and to the action of the Federal Administration, slavery should be disposed of in the Territories of the Union, according to the will of the inhabitants of these Territories. The objection to this theory, which I deemed to be insuperable, and which I then stated to you was, that under the practical operations of the Government, and under judicial constructions of the Constitution by the Supreme Court, no practical liberty of choice was left to the people of the Territories. Another party, of which Mr. BELL and Mr. EVERETT were the representatives, took for their, platform the simple motto, the Union, the Constitution, and the enforcement of the laws. That this was a good platform, I fully conceded; but maintained that, as as all parties claimed alike to stand upon it, it could not form any substantial issue before the American people. That no issue was, in fact, made by it, is plain enough, from the disposition which the rebellion has made of its candidates. Mr. BELL as you all know, is now among the rebels, and openly arrayed against the Constitution and Union, and the enforcement of the laws, while Mr. EVERETT in his vigorous age, (long may he live, the pride and ornament of his country,) upholds with all his energies the Constitution and the Union, and insists that throughout every foot of American soil, every constitutional law must be enforced by the whole power of the Government. [Applause.] Having considered these plans of settlement and shown them to be impracticable and defective, I invoked your attention to that proposed by Mr. LINCOLN and his friends. Its substance was simply this: That we should let slavery alone, in all the States which it existed, subject only and absolutely to the disposal of the people of those States; but that beyond State limits, where the Government of the United States and the people who make the Government, are directly responsible for the existence of slavery, there ought to be, and could be, no allowance of the institution. I endeavored to show you that acquiescence in that simple proposition would give peace to the country. Slavery, except by the free action of the citizens of the State, would be disturbed in no State where it existed; it would simply be excluded from the territories and portions of the country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of the United States. In the States it would remain absolutely undisturbed. No guarantee of the rights of any State would be invaded or jostled. With this principle established, no just cause of complaint could remain. This I endeavored to show you on that occasion.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""SPEECH OF HON. SALMON P. CHASE.; Delivered in Odd Follows' Hall, Covington, Ky., Thursday Evening, Oct. 14, 1864.

The great question of a representation basis, it appears to us is ""settled"" in a way which will prove neither permanent nor satisfactory. They are to have a Lower House of Parliament, constituted on the principle of representation according to population. They are to have an Upper House, constituted by nomination of the Crown, with conditions attached to it which must make it, ultimately, a more dangerous instrument in the hands of an Executive than it was twenty-seven years ago. This proposed House of Lords was universally condemned in Lower Canada before the radical French Canadians rebelled in 1837. And the Liberals of both nationalities agitated until they secured an amendment of their Constitution, which gave them two elective Chambers, instead of one. They are now going back to the old system, under a provision which must ultimately make it more dangerous to popular liberty than ever. They propose to have seventy-six nominated legislators in their Upper House, distributed among the different Provinces, on a rule-of-thumb scale -- the Canadas having twenty-four each, for the twenty-eight assigned to the maritime Colonies. This distribution of Senatorial power will have to be kept up according to the new Constitution. There will be no means of increasing the number, as in the case of the House of Lords, in the event of a dead-lock taking place between the Lower and Upper Legislative Chambers. The British Reform Bill of 1832 could not have been law to-day, if the power of increasing the number of ""Lords"" had not vested in the King and his advisers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Federation of the British Provinces.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Federation of the British Provinces.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8699aa27-b89c-5046-b7ec-e8b48749eeeb,796,nyt://article/8699aa27-b89c-5046-b7ec-e8b48749eeeb,

These Confederated ruffians shot several citizens of the town, wounding two seriously, and it is feared fatally -- assailed three banks, and plundered them of a very large sum of money -- supplied themselves with horses, and threatened to burn the town, -- after which they left in the direction of Canada.

SHERIDAN, who was at Winchester, on his return from Washington, hastened to the battle-field, twelve miles distant, ""took the affair in hand,"" as he tersely says, and by 1 o'clock had reformed his lines compactly, just in time to repulse, in good style, a second attack of the enemy. At 3 o'clock Gen. SHERIDAN took the offensive himself, made an impetuous assault upon the rebel lines, which soon gave way in complete rout, leaving many prisoners, forty-three pieces of artillery and one hundred wagons and ambulances in our hands. The enemy were pursued beyond Strasburgh, which town SHERIDAN occupied at night. The losses on either side are not yet reported. Gen. BIDWELL commanding a brigade in the Sixth Corps, was killed, and Gens. WRIGHT, RICKETTS and GROVER were wounded, the first-named but slightly. The rebel Gen. RAMSEUR fell into our hands mortally wounded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7b1c30e4-3a6c-57b1-b1ea-66121ed97dff,553,nyt://article/7b1c30e4-3a6c-57b1-b1ea-66121ed97dff,

W. Moore vs. James Gordon Bennett. -- This was an action for libel against the New-York Herald, plaintiff laying his damages at $10,000. Plaintiff, who is the general agent of the Central Railroad Company in this city, alleges that defendant published against him a malicious libel in a letter from Mrs. Helen M. Kimball, widow of Col. Kimball, of the Ninth New-York Volunteers, which appealed in the Herald of the 17th of June, 1863. In this letter Mrs. Kimball said, among other things, that even the letters of her deceased husband were returned to her after his death ""through the hands of a prostitute called Mary Ann Smith, who was living under the protection of J.W. Moore, agent of the Central Railroad Company."" This was the libelous matter complained of by plaintiff. Before the case was opened, David Dudley Field, counsel for Mr. Bennett, stated that the defendant desired to amend his answer. In the original answer the defense set up was a justification of the publication by alleging the truth of the matter called libelous. Since that answer was served the defendant had ascertained from Mrs. Kimball and others, that the charge contained in the published letter was unfounded in fact, as far as Moore was concerned. Defendant had then offered Mr. Moore all the reparation in his power, and had published a retraction of the libel. Plaintiff not being satisfied with this retraction, defendant offered to publish a retraction written by plaintiff himself, and such an article was prepared by plaintiff's attorney and published in the Herald, but plaintiff was still dissatisfied. Counsel now moved to strike out all that portion of the original answer which set up that the libelous matter was true. Plaintiff's counsel objected to this, but the objection was overruled and the motion granted.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Libel Suit Against the Herald. SUPREME COURT TRIAL TERM.

Desperate Hopes and False Statements,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/21/archives/the-desperation-of-rebel-fortunes.html,Desperate Hopes and False Statements,"Nothing proves more clearly that the fortunes of the rebels are more desperate now than ever before, than the false hopes and false statements which have been entertained and uttered in regard to HOOD's last movement. The condition of rebel public sentiment is now so gloomy, that their papers are resorting, with renewed vigor, to the old dodge of gross exaggeration and downright lying. They feel so greatly the necessity of throwing some gleam of light upon their failing fortunes, that the merest rumors -- even their hopes -- are printed as facts and sent forth, to cheer the despondent hearts of their people. All manner of concealment in regard to their reverses is now more uniformly resorted to than ever before, and you might as well expect the truth from the father of liars as from a rebel newspaper in these days. Witness their reports about HOOD's attack on Allatoona. The bare, actual facts of their attack and repulse are first given, just as they reached us. But that would not do. The desperate rebels follow it up by a statement that after the attack by one division failed, a whole corps was brought up, the town carried by assault, and four thousand prisoners, with immense munitions of war captured. Our readers will remember the bloody repulse of the rebels by five regiments of infantry and one battery of artillery, and their inglorious retreat afterward. So in regard to the capture of Rome. The rebels first reported that the city had been taken, and three thousand negro soldiers captured with it. What is the truth? Why, from their own sources we learn that Rome was empty when the rebels marched into it, our troops having been sent to the relief of Allatoona. Rome was not on our line of communication, and, therefore, it was not necessary to hold it. Again, with regard to affairs in the Valley. The rebel papers stoutly denied that they lost more than a dozen pieces of artillery in that whole campaign. SHERIDAN can show 35 in his actual possession -- not to speak of the 43 he took on Wednesday last. But the truth, after a while, sometimes gets out through rebel sources. A ""well-informed officer of EARLY's army,"" as the Richmond Enquirer calls him, in a letter deploring the utter uselessness of their cavalry, admits that SHERIDAN has taken thirty-one guns from them. This desperate shift of the rebel papers to sustain their rapidly sinking cause, will possibly help to sustain the hearts of their people a short time longer. But how will the miserable dupes feel when they discover that they have been made the victims of such an outrageous system of falsehood? Will they have halters long enough and strong enough to hang the villains who daily and hourly deceive them?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE DESPERATION OF REBEL FORTUNES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE DESPERATION OF REBEL FORTUNES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0e6870b-e516-50ae-a9b3-e8f26b36b8a3,470,nyt://article/a0e6870b-e516-50ae-a9b3-e8f26b36b8a3,

CARPENTER's picture, representing the Cabinet-meeting at which President LINCOLN promulgated for the first time his Emancipation Proclamation, is now on exhibition in this city. It will repay an examination. The subject possesses great interest, and will improve with the growing civilization of the age. Public virtue must always be satisfied with an act that contemplates the happiness of a down-trodden race, and no more fitting subject for the brush of an artist can be found than the illustration of those great principles of human freedom which, in this moment of intense conviction, have happily actuated the minds of some of our best and most prominent statesmen. The subject chosen by Mr. CARPENTER does not lend itself to any other treatment than that which he has bestowed upon it. The picture will be viewed with satisfaction by succeeding generations for its special merits of portraiture. When slavery has become a surprise and a horror to everyone in the land; when the Proclamation of President LINCOLN has passed into history as a splendid trophy of a sanguinary war; when the gratitude of a people that no longer knows a bondsman reverts to the heroes that made them glorious, then will such a canvas be gazed upon with respectful admiration, and the features that are familiar to us to-day be regarded as typical of a stronger race of men than the world can always claim for its leaders.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FINE ARTS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FINE ARTS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bbdfcbd1-e16e-516c-855f-5ae00f18dcf1,434,nyt://article/bbdfcbd1-e16e-516c-855f-5ae00f18dcf1,

This is the second discussion of the subject by the Enquirer, and it tells us that since it first formally and favorably advanced the idea of creating a negro army for the South, it ""has received many assurances of its popular favor, and none whatever of opposition to it."" It adds that the ""planters in the extreme Southern States favor the proposition, and some have signified their readiness to free five, ten, or fifteen of their slaves if they will enter the army."" It says there is in the South a ""half million of fighting material which is property; shall we use that property for the common cause?"" It argues that the ""conscription of negroes should be accompanied with freedom, and the privilege of remaining in the States,"" and that ""justice and sound policy demand that we make free men of those who fight for freedom."" The whole subject is discussed at once with an earnestness, and absence of bombast, that shows it was intended to have a practical effect, and the closing words are these: ""If there are any reasons against extending the conscription to slaves, we should like to have them stated, but we are decidedly of the opinion that the whole country will agree to the proposition, and that at an early day the next Congress will be called upon to provide for it by law.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A New and Starting Development The ""Richmond Enquirer"" on Arming Negro Slaves.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A New and Starting Development The ""Richmond Enquirer"" on Arming Negro Slaves.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d43880b3-509b-5c00-a574-8e87c66df745,1216,nyt://article/d43880b3-509b-5c00-a574-8e87c66df745,

PERINE, Esq., at Williamsburgh. Quite a number of distinguished persons were present, among them Admiral: F.H. GREGORY, Capt. BOGGS and Chief-Engineer HALL. The launch passed off nicely, and the vessel entered the water amid enthusiastic cheering. The Nabuc was designed, with nineteen others, by Chief-Engineer ALBAN C. STIMERS, United States Navy. Thus far they have been failures. In the case of the Nabuc, she promises better success. Over one hundred and sixty tons of dead weight have been set aside, including the turret and its appurtenances. Much extraneous matter has been taken out of the vessel, the surface condenser has been removed and a jet concenser fills its place. The diameter of the screws have been increased, and the propeller well cut out"" so that she will not drag so much water in her wake. A pilot house will take the place of the turret, and one 11-inch gun will be placed in pivot on the forward deck. The gun's crew will be protected by portable wrought iron shields. The Nabuc is of the following dimensions: Length, 225 feet; beam, 45 feet 3 inches; depth, 8 feet 11 inches; tons. 614. She has two engines, built by DORLAN & FARRON, Williamsburgh, with 30-inch cylinders, and 32-inch stroke of piston. She has two four-blocked screws, 9 feet in diameter, with 9 feet pitch. After launching, her average draught of water was ascertained to be 5 feet 7 inches. She was 3 feet out of water forward, two feet three inches aft, and two feet five inches amidships. This is better than any of them have done yet. In addition to the eleven-inch gun, the vessel will be filled with WOOD's torpedo machine. When complete for service, this vessel, as well as those which are being subjected to the same alterations, will be of some service, but nothing to comparison to their cost. It is expected to have her ready for sea by the first day of November, when she will be sent out to do duty. The Cohoes, bul[???]ding at the Continental Iron Works, and Modoc, building by J.S. UNDERHLL, will soon be ready to launch, which will complete all of the monitor iron-clads building in this immediate vicinity.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE; Navel.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE; Navel.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/575bf225-c252-59d5-8486-728fad810d58,718,nyt://article/575bf225-c252-59d5-8486-728fad810d58,

SHERIDAN turned what bade fair to be an overwhelming disaster into a glorious victory. The attack on the enemy was made about 3 in the afternoon, by a left half wheel of the whole line, with a division of cavalry turning each flank of the enemy. The enemy made a brave and stubborn defence; but such was the impetuosity of the attack that they could not long withstand it, and they finally broke and fled, leaving, it is estimated, over fifty pieces of artillery in on hands. At least sixteen hundred prisoners were captured, and large numbers of wagons and ambulances.

The two poets are contemporaries, and started on the race for fame at a nearly corresponding period of their youth. BROWNING's first poem, Paracelsus was given to the world in 1835, when he was in his twenty-third year, and so natural to him is the mode of expression adopted in his poetry, that succeeding years have done little to deepen the characteristics, or bring into more prominent relief the idiosyncrasies exhibited in his first work. In one respect the fortunes of the poets have been different, while half the writing world (especially the more juvenile portion of it) are weighing their syllables and measuring their versification, in the vain hope of reproducing the magic flow of TENNYSON's heroic metre, or the wild and airy charm of his lyrics -- BROWNING can scarcely be said to have found a single imitator. Though the style of no other writer presents so many obvious peculiarities, they are not for every one's use. His involved and cumbrous sentences are double-shotted with knowledge, reflection and poetical insight. Wanting these, the imitation would be mere blank cartridge, scarcely a passable echo of the original. BROWNING's range has been a wider one than that of TENNYSON. Narrative poems, dramas, (three of which have met with favor on the stage,) lyrics, and pieces that come within no recognized arrangement, have all flowed freely from his pen, and attest a breadth, and variety of power that has left undying traces in the minds of his readers, and has affected, in a manner we are yet too near to estimate, the national poetical literature of the age. It is a shallow aspiration that would desire to see the excellencies of BROWNING, cleared of his eccentricities and open to the current comprehension of all. The poet is homogeneous, and his radiancies and obscurities are all cognate in their origin. In much of his writings, ROBERT BROWNING is less a poet than a ""subtle souled psychologist,"" flinging himself with all the resources of vast learning and creative art into attempts to reconstruct the mental processes of personages the most remote from ordinary comprehension or sympathy. Such are in the present volume --""Caliban upon Setebos, or Natural Theology in the Island,"" ""A Death in the Desert,"" ""Mr. Sludge, the Medium,"" and the greater part of his previous collection, Men and Women. Success in this field is not for the plaudits of ordinary readers; for them each poem wants a commentary, and is scarcely intelligible without. We do not believe that there are twenty people in New-York -- and are not sure that there is one -- who could at the first reading understand the drift of the author in the poem, ""A Death in the Desert,"" or make out the machinery by which it is introduced, and apportion to each of the characters his share of the narration. Though nothing can be finer than the conception, or more vividly touched in single lines and epithets than the situation. Its subject is the aged apostle St. John dying in the desert, tended lovingly by disciples in the cool of a cave, and uttering a protest against the heresies of the time, while a wild Bactrian convert keeps watch, where ""outside was all noon, and the burning blue."" An author who designedly adopts this abstruse form for the communication of his ideas must necessarily be ready to relinquish the suffrages of the many; but there are indications in ""Dramatis Personae"" of a capacity for clearer things, where the poet permits himself expression in his own person, instead of vivifying with strange speech the dusky spectres of past ages and remote countries. Some of the shorter poems are admirable is conciseness and strength, and are written in such excellent English as must disgust the painful students of the original Browningese dialect; and make them fear that their oracle is gradually coming down to the vernacular. That a really great poet may in time work himself clear of many willful obscurities, and so become more appreciated by the mass of readers is sincerely to be hoped. We give a short poem, severe in its simplicity, that all will appreciate, and which derives additional interest when the writer's relation to the highest woman's intellect of the century -- his lately lost wife -- is considered, alluded to at the end --",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; DRAMATIS PERSONAE.

"-The Monongahela Republican contains the following: ""Parties engaged in exhuming the bodies of the MERCER family for removal from the old graveyard to Monongahela City Cemetery on Friday last, found the body of Mr. J.B. MERCER in a singular state of petrifaction. The graves of Mrs. MERCER and the two children on each side were about sixteen inches lower than that of their father, yet while their bodies had returned to dust and were perfectly dry, his grave was filled with water, and his body turned to stone. Mr. MERCER was drowned in May, 1843, at what is called the old wharf, and his body, remaining in the river for eighteen days, was found on the 'riffle' near Parkinson's; he was forty-five years of age, and was buried on the hill in the above described grave. Through the kindness of Mr. FILSON we were permitted to examine the body closely. It was solid and firm, turned to stone, from the ankle joints to the neck; the feet had fallen off and were mouldered to dust, but the head, which had also fallen off, was petrified, and the hair well preserved. The body was solid, and upon being struck, gave out a dead heavy sound; the petrification was so perfect that the pores of the skin were distinct, and the proportions of the form well preserved. This has been attributed by many to the length of time the body remained in the water before interment. As petrification is never caused by internal action, but is always the result of external deposites and surroundings, this theory cannot explain the circumstances fully. The bodies of the family were reinterred in the Monongahela Cemetery by the M.E. Church of this city, and a handsome marble shaft placed above their graves by that congregation, to which, it will be remembered, Mrs. AGATHA MERCER bequeathed some $1,000 at her decease.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/23/archives/remarkable-case-of-petrifaction.html,,"-The Monongahela Republican contains the following: ""Parties engaged in exhuming the bodies of the MERCER family for removal from the old graveyard to Monongahela City Cemetery on Friday last, found the body of Mr. J.B.

Mr. MERCER was drowned in May, 1843, at what is called the old wharf, and his body, remaining in the river for eighteen days, was found on the 'riffle' near Parkinson's; he was forty-five years of age, and was buried on the hill in the above described grave. Through the kindness of Mr. FILSON we were permitted to examine the body closely. It was solid and firm, turned to stone, from the ankle joints to the neck; the feet had fallen off and were mouldered to dust, but the head, which had also fallen off, was petrified, and the hair well preserved. The body was solid, and upon being struck, gave out a dead heavy sound; the petrification was so perfect that the pores of the skin were distinct, and the proportions of the form well preserved. This has been attributed by many to the length of time the body remained in the water before interment. As petrification is never caused by internal action, but is always the result of external deposites and surroundings, this theory cannot explain the circumstances fully. The bodies of the family were reinterred in the Monongahela Cemetery by the M.E. Church of this city, and a handsome marble shaft placed above their graves by that congregation, to which, it will be remembered, Mrs. AGATHA MERCER bequeathed some $1,000 at her decease.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REMARKABLE CASE OF PETRIFACTION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REMARKABLE CASE OF PETRIFACTION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b39981b-c83e-5b61-90e7-b95e08493ce3,314,nyt://article/5b39981b-c83e-5b61-90e7-b95e08493ce3,

The FrancoItalian convention, the text of which has recently appeared in the Moniteur and in our own columns, is evidently a compromise. The French Emperor, on certain conditions, agrees to withdraw his garrison from Rome within a fixed period, and the Italian King, in order to rid Italy of these foreign troops, assents to the conditions specified. He promises to remove his Court and Government to Florence in six months from the date of the convention; he undertakes the liquidation of that portion of the Papal debt which belongs to those States of the Church lately annexed to his Kingdom; and he binds himself to protect the ""Patrimony of St. Peter"" from all external aggression.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Franco-Italian Convention.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Franco-Italian Convention.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5c315d66-d088-567c-8b0e-c9a3263d9456,621,nyt://article/5c315d66-d088-567c-8b0e-c9a3263d9456,

Bands of their ruffians seem to be already engaged on the Canadian frontier in robbery and murder. There are one or two other little expedients for bringing the North to terms which the Whig seems to have overlooked, but which we do not object to mentioning. One is, the poisoning of reservoirs and wells. There are plenty of cutthroats who can be hired to do jobs of this kind all over the North, and the matter ought to be brought under the notice of the rebel Senate at that secret session which the Whig recommends for the consideration of the town-burning project. The subject is one well fitted for the deliberations of such an august body. The poisoning scheme has many advantages over the other. Hecatombs of ""Yankees"" might be killed in this way at a very small expense to the Confederacy.

Churches Outspoken for and for War; Religious Element of Country Strongest for War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/24/archives/the-war-and-the-christianity-of-the-land.html,Churches Outspoken for and for War; Religious Element of Country Strongest for War,"It is a most significant thing that the religious and moral element of the nation is precisely the element which is strongest for war. The fact is indisputable. It is not only manifest to every man within his own sphere of observation, but it has its official proof in the emphatic resolutions, approving the war, which have been adopted by nearly every great ecclesiastical organization, with entire, or almost entire, unanimity. It found an irrepressible utterance in the annual meeting of the American Board of Foreign Missions, the other day, in Worcester, the largest religious association in America, when this fact being announced that out of more than one thousand missionaries abroad there was not one who was not sustaining the cause of national unity and human freedom, with sympathy and prayer, the great gathering of four thousand clergymen and laymen from all parts of the North, united to a man in a regular vote that the Government must be sustained and the rebellion crushed. There are about one hundred and fifty religious newspapers in the loyal States. Nine out of ten of them are outspoken for LINCOLN. There are about twenty-five thousand clergymen in the loyal States; of this number there are probably not five hundred who are not for the reelection of our President. Of course, an absolute unanimity, with human nature as it is, must be impossible. There are some minds so curiously made up that even the grace of God cannot prevent their sticking, limpet-like, to the past. There were Tory clergymen in the revolution -- and godly men too. There were bishops in England who clung to the slave-trade to the last, and who, on the episcopal bench in Parliament, voted against WILBERFORCE's resolution, that the slave trade was ""inconsistent with justice, humanity and sound policy."" There are ministers of the gospel, and even doctors of divinity, here in the North, who worship slavery even after it is dead, as the priests of of Isis did their sacred crocodile. Such exceptions are always sure to exist, but the anomaly is rather mental than moral. It has little moral consequence. The fact still stands, that the whole force of the religious and moral sentiment of the country is on the side of the Baltimore platform, and against that of Chicago.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War and the Christianity of the Land.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War and the Christianity of the Land.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lincoln, Abraham', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0db000f8-a1e4-5639-a24e-ecbd534cb294,976,nyt://article/0db000f8-a1e4-5639-a24e-ecbd534cb294,

The truth evidently is that the rebel horsemen have become a band of roving thieves and guerrillas, have lost discipline and organization, and are no sort of match for the splendid body of hardy, disciplined and well-armed cavalry which TORBERT and CUSTAR command. In the battle of Wednesday last they did not even bring any cavalry into action, though they might have proved of very great service to them. They were, doubtless, so used up by the drubbing administered to them a fortnight before, as to be incapable of making an appearance. On the other hand, the triumph of our arms, which was really achieved by one man's genius and resolution, was greatly aided by decisive charges in flank by the splendid cavalry which SHERIDAN commands; and after the decision of the battle our horse pursued the enemy with great energy.

They have long foreseen that a movement which, at first was felt as a relief to an over-populated country, would eventually become an exhausting drain upon their military resources. Yet they were powerless to check the movement. Summary laws against emigration would have provoked revolution at once; and in spite of numberless restrictions and vexatious regulations, designed to throw obstructions in the way of the emigrant, and to make leaving the country as difficult as possible, the stream of emigration grew in volume from year to year. In vain the Government employed newspapers and book-makers to depict the horrors of American society, and the dreadful fate that awaited the too-confiding wanderer who trusted his life among the wilds, the beasts and savages of the Western world. Some of these attempts were exquisitely ludicrous; and had they been credited, no German who valued his life a penny would ever have ventured to set foot in such a land of horrors as America was represented to be.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'German Emigration to America.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'German Emigration to America.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'America', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4ddb8513-9972-50e8-90a4-e158313b675b,759,nyt://article/4ddb8513-9972-50e8-90a4-e158313b675b,

"A singularly effective performance of DONIZETTI's opera of ""Il Poliuto"" was given at the Academy of Music on Friday evening. The work has always been a favorite with our public, and at one time (when Mmme. CORTESI was here,) excited a genuine furore. It deserves the same fate now, for the singers are as good as they ever were, and so far as the prima donna is concerned, Signora ZUCCHI will certainly compare favorably with any of her predecessors. The earnestness and intelligent freedom of her rendering of the difficult role of Pauline are in fact perfect. The enthusiasm of the audience was absolute, and manifested itself in tumu[???]tuous and almost frenzied outbursts of applause. The extraordinary vigor of the representation has become a matter of town talk, and had it taken place in any European opera house, there cannot be a doubt that ""Il Poliuto"" would again renew its early triumphs. There are few works in the repertoire whose saliencies in the way of melody are more grateful. The plot, too, is simple and affecting, lending itself readily to situations of great emotional interest, and to s[???]enes where a brilliant display of numbers and costumes is not superfluous. Long before the opera found its way to our stage, the choruses were known to our musical societies, and thoroughly appreciated. They are extremely interesting, and are superbly interpreted by Mr. MARETZEK's forces. The entire performance, indeed, was all that could be desired. Signor MASSIMILIANI has never been heard to such decided advantage as in the role of Poliutus, and Signor BELLINI, although a little hoarse at the beginning of the evening, rapidly recovered himself and sang with his customary excellence. We look forward with much pleasure to the repetition of this opera to-morrow night.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/24/archives/amusements.html,,"A singularly effective performance of DONIZETTI's opera of ""Il Poliuto"" was given at the Academy of Music on Friday evening.

Food Question in; Richmond Sentinel Gratified by,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/24/archives/richmond-and-the-food-question.html,Food Question in; Richmond Sentinel Gratified by,"It is important that we should analyze with great care the evidence of Southern journals touching the question of supplies. They have frequently good reason for seeking to deceive the outside world on this point, beyond all others. In a singular article, however, which we reproduce to-day from the Richmond Sentinel, we find a series of admissions which go far to prove that there is, at this moment, something approaching to actual famine in both Richmond and Petersburgh. The journalist endeavors to condemn, with as much earnestness as he can command, the absolute military law which requires that the provision markets shall be under military control; that the army must be fed first, and the people second. He puts the point with logical impressiveness, as well as with pathetic earnestness, when he says: ""It is contended that the army must be first fed; but yet it is evident that all must be fed."" Nothing, surely, can be clearer than this -- if there is to be any but a military population left in Richmond and Petersburgh, ""all must be fed."" It seems, however, by the rebel reasoning, that the effect of giving the military this right of preemption over the populace is, that only the rich portion of the latter get anything like a regular supply. And this they get solely by setting the military law at defiance. ""Men must eat,"" observes this practical philosopher. Hence, if private consumers cannot get a wagon for transportation purposes, they will find a mule-cart. If they are forbidden the railroads, ""the wits of the ingenious are thereby but quickened for evading the prohibition, and it is evaded."" Moreover, he takes heart of grace, to tell the Military authorities that, after all they have done to cheat the common people of their grub, and ""after all they can do, the agents of the Government cannot avoid dividing the food of the country with the non-producers.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Richmond and the Food Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Richmond and the Food Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6fb57a46-7fb5-53f7-801c-d17083818b3e,531,nyt://article/6fb57a46-7fb5-53f7-801c-d17083818b3e,

It seems to us that the whole project, if it can be got into a workable shape, will be of an exceedingly Conservative, if not Tory, character. A Governor-General or Viceroy, nominated by the Crown; four Lieutenant-Governors for the two Canadas, Acadia and Newfoundland, nominated by the Viceroy; a general Parliament, with 200 elected members in the lower branch, sitting five years, and 76 nominated or Crown members in the Upper House, retaining their seats for life, a system of ministerial responsibility similar to that of the mother country. Such are the leading features of the proposed Colonial Union. We have before pointed out in these columns that a fixed number of ""Lords"" in the second branch of the Legislature cannot possibly work without bringing the two Houses sooner or later, into collision. The rate at which changes could be introduced in such a House, as it is proposed to make this legislative council, would probably not exceed two members a year. Vacancies by death, on the average, would probably be represented by this number. And that would be all the safety-valve the Constitution would furnish. Upper Canada, we see, is to be well represented in the Lower House of the Federal Legislature, so that she will have no longer reason to complain that one-third of the people have practically had no representation in the Provincial Parliament.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Article 1 -- No Title; THE BRITISH AMERICAN CONFEDERATION.

It is curious to observe how difficult they find the work.

If they concoct a calumny against Mr. LINCOLN, like that of his demanding his salary in gold, it is exposed, and they only get contempt for it. If they try to take issue on any of the incidentals of the war, as, for instance, bad management in the field, or the enlisting of colored soldiers, or the system of conscription, or the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, or the making of paper money legal tender, they get no substantial benefit from any of them.

He opens by remarking that ""there are critical moments in the life of nations, when the course that is taken decides their future; the greatness and liberty of the nation are at stake; an instant of weakness and all is lost; an instant of energy, a last effort, and all is saved. It is in one of these crises that the United States is involved. The Presidential election may insure the triumph or ruin of the North.

It simplifies the case exceedingly, to have SANDERS vouch, as it seems he is prepared to do, for the good standing of these miscreants as commissioned soldiers of DAVIS' Confederacy. And if he can persuade the Canadian authorities that organized gangs of burglars may appear in this way at any point on the frontier with duly attested proof of their ""belligerent"" character, he will probably help to bring to a solution at once the simple question whether the Province can afford to become their base of offensive operations. Much more satisfactory than a surrender of these ruffians under an extradition claim would be to find the Canadians manly and honest enough to assert the authority of their own municipal law. With Mr. SANDERS as a witness, they may do this, in preference to giving up the so-called refugees as murderers and burglars.

Ripe Old Age of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/27/archives/a-ripe-old-age-prof-chester-dewey.html,Ripe Old Age of,"D.D., of Rochester, reached the advanced age of 80 years on Tuesday last. Prof. DEWEY graduated at Williams College in 1806, and was tutor and professor in that institution from 1808 to 1827. In the latter year he took charge of the Berkshire Gymnasium in Pittsfield, Mass., which was for many years a celebrated and successful school for boys. In 1836 he removed to Rochester, and was principal of the Collegiate Institute there until 1850, since which time he has filled the chair of chemistry and the natural sciences in the University of Rochester. During most of the period from his graduation until 1850 he was professor and lecturer on chemistry and botany in the Medical College at Pittsfield, and for a part of the time in the medical school of Woodstock, Vt. Prof. DEWEY retains his faculties of mind and body in a remarkable degree, and is in better health now than for some time past. His eightieth birthday was made the occasion of a family gathering and the offering of the congratulations of many of his fellow-citizens. Thousands of Prof. DEWEY's pupils, scattered over the whole Union, will hear with pleasure of the vigor and health which attends his advanced age. During the past year some of Prof. DEWEY's college pupils have presented to the Alumni Hall of Williams College a fine portrait of their former instructor. The donors of this portrait were Hon. E.C. Benedict and Hon. D.D. Field, of New-York; Hon. Emory Washburn, Hon. Homer Bartlett, Judge Charles A. Dewey and Rev. Dr. Orville Dewey, of Massachusetts; Hon. A.C. Paige, of Schenectady; and Rev.

Speech at Columbia and Rebel Programme,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/27/archives/davis-programme.html,Speech at Columbia and Rebel Programme,"-- The remarkable speech of JEFF. DAVIS, at Columbia, which was published in the TIMES of yesterday, deserves more careful study by those who would comprehend the real feelings and purposes of the rebel leaders at this crisis, than anything heretofore uttered by any other man. Unlike his speech at Macon, it was evidently carefully prepared, and was characterized by a cool desperation the very opposite of the hot and furious passion of his first Georgia speech. The military programme which he announced is the necessary programme of the rebels in the Southwest under their present circumstances. They were to make an incursion northward and assume the offensive, because they must do so. We possess the great strongholds and control the great water-lines of the Southwest, and as it is impossible to drive us from these by direct assault, the only alternative is to try and force their evacuation, by making desperate efforts to strike northward with an army. Hence after asserting that his western army has increased in strength since the fall of Atlanta, that it has risen in tone, that its march is onward and its face to the front, he says that HOOD's eye is now fixed upon a point far beyond that where he was assailed by the enemy; and further on adds, ""I believe it is in the power of the men of the Confederacy to plant our banners on the banks of the Ohio, where we may say to the Yankee, 'be quiet, or we shall teach you another lesson.' Within the next thirty days, much is to be done, for upon our success much depends."" HOOD and BEAUREGARD are now struggling to carry out this programme, but their success thus far certainly does not hold out much prospect of ultimate success.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""DAVIS' PROGRAMME."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""DAVIS' PROGRAMME."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4331834b-d030-5515-8fe8-9f7d2f53af3f,429,nyt://article/4331834b-d030-5515-8fe8-9f7d2f53af3f,

The sovereign principality of Lichtenstein, one of the ""Powers"" of Europe, has ceased to exist in a state of independence. It had a territory of sixty-four square miles. It had a high-spirited population of over seven thousand souls. It had a representative voice in the Federal Diet. It had a guaranteed existence from the Congress of Vienna in 1815. It had the privilege of contributing to the German army a force of ninety full privates and one drummer. But failing in the exercise of this latter privilege, on the technical point of whether the people or the Sovereign should provide for the military items in the budget, a secession feeling arose, and incontinently, the sovereign State of Lichtenstein merged its sovereign existence in that of the Empire of Austria.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STATE SOVEREIGNTY WITH AN ILLUSTRATION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STATE SOVEREIGNTY WITH AN ILLUSTRATION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a3bcae4b-139a-583f-9244-e0c08fc29bf4,252,nyt://article/a3bcae4b-139a-583f-9244-e0c08fc29bf4,

At the hour announced, 12 o'clock, for the first loading of the heaviest piece of ordnance in the world, the parapets of the Fort were thronged with distinguished officers and ladies and gentlemen all anxious to witness the trial of the great gun. Considerable delay was experienced in the proper adjustment of the piece, as it was not until half past two o'clock the first discharge, a blank cartridge, of one hundred pounds of powder was fired. The concussion following the discharge was slight, and the recoil of the gun much less than was anticipated. The piece was next loaded with a charge of fifty pounds of powder and a thousand pound shell. The time taken in loading was about half an hour. The second trial was as successful as the first, the bail, in consequence of considerable depression of the gun, striking the water at a quarter of a mile distance recocheting several times. The gun, on examination, being found to have received no strain, preparations were made for the final test. At 5 o'clock the piece was again loaded with a charge of one hundred pounds of powder and a ball weighing one thousand and eighty pounds -- one of the largest ordnance projectiles ever cast. Owing to the rather impromptu arrangements for raising the ball, it was found to be anything but an easy task to adjust it. However, at the hour mentioned, the piece was loaded, and everybody stood clear for the last grand trial. The gun was raised to an elevation of twenty-five degrees, and the discharge was deafening. The ball was twenty-four seconds in the air, and tell at the distance of about three miles and a half. Considerable applause followed the final shot, and all concerned in the management of the piece were warmly congratulated. The following are the dimensions of this last great achievement of Capt. RODMAN: Weight of gun, 110,497 pounds; length, 21 feet; bore, 20 inches; usual charge of powder, 100 pounds; average weight of ball, 1,000 pounds. Previous to the trial of the gun, the revenue cutter Bronx. Capt. MARCEL, arrived at the Government dock, having on board a large number of ladies and gentlemen. Prominent among the latter were Gen. DIX, Gen. HAYS, Gen. DYER, Gen. SMITH, Commodore PAULDING, Commodore WISE, Commodore RODGERS, Maj. VAN FLEET, Capt. RODMAN and PETER COOPER. During the afternoon an elegant collation was served on board the cutter, and to the music of the Fort Hamilton Band the guests joined in a dance on the deck.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LARGEST GUN IN THE WORLD.; Successful Trial of the Twenty-Inch Rodman Gun at Fort Hamilton.

Will Neither Write Acceptance Nor Withdraw,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/28/archives/pendleton.html,Will Neither Write Acceptance Nor Withdraw,"We have heard, on very good authority, that a select meeting of Democratic politicians was held, a few evenings ago, in this city, at the house of a prominent Copperhead, to consider the propriety of requiring Mr. PENDLETON either to write a good rampant war letter, expressing his ""views,"" or to withdraw from the canvass. Since this gentleman's selection for the Vice-Presidency, he has proved nearly as great a nuisance to the Democratic party as the bull in the china shop to the proprietor of that establishment. They have so far failed in getting him to write a letter with any meaning to it, or which gives the public any clearer idea of his opinions about the war, than it had already. The recent epistle, in which he avowed his attachment to the Constitution, throws about as much light on his political position, as an expression of admiration for the planet Mars. A man may adore the Union, as everybody knows, and yet refuse to fire a shot or spend a cent to save it. It is now generally admitted that his speech the other night, at the New-York Hotel, was not a success. His sole reply to the charges made against him of hostility to the war, hostility to the army, and sympathy with the rebellion is, that the printer made the mistake of substituting ""June"" for ""Jan."" or ""January.""

It is considered highly gratifying, moreover, that the Chief Magistrate of the first city of the American Union should have vouchsafed his testimony in so open and explicit a manner.

In the evening, the rebels attacked HANCOCK vigorously, but the latter gained a decided success, repulsing them and holding possession of the field until midnight.

He did so foment, by his letters and speeches against the draft, and he did so countenance by his hailing the miscreants on the afternoon of the second day of their work as ""friends,"" and by his assurance that he had sent his Adjutant-General to Washington to ask the President to stop the draft.

They would, at all events, represent to the actual President that they could never honorably lay down their arms until they had secured their political independence. They would rely upon the forbearance of the North not to exterminate them, having a regard to ""the opinions of the world and the doctrines of Christianity."" And such being the case, the South, ""upon consideration of a Federal recognition of its independence, would be prepared to enter into a treaty of free trade with the North; to place an export duty of ten cents upon cotton, for the express benefit of New-England, and to give that industrious community, and all the rest of the 'Federal States,' an advantage to that extent over Great Britain and France and every other part of the world.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Southern Independence A New Lever Power.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Southern Independence A New Lever Power.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/73141625-e67e-5993-a342-29edf9e61b49,653,nyt://article/73141625-e67e-5993-a342-29edf9e61b49,

Consequently, there are few Copperheads who look forward to the failure of the negotiations which they propose to open after ""the immediate cessation of hostilities"" with the slightest chagrin of despondency. In fact, it is very doubtful whether one in a thousand of them has in his secret soul the smallest expectation that any such negotiations would have the smallest chance of success.

The financial difficulty, at all events, has been set at rest, Denmark having consented to fix at the round sum of 9,000,000 rigsdalers the share which the Duchies are to have in the public property of the Kingdom. It is evident, however, that the Copenhagen Government yielded its assent to this proposition with the greatest reluctance. The amount named is more than equal to the whole annual revenue of the Danish monarchy, and msut press heavily on the resources of a State, already exhausted by war, by the loss of rich Provinces, and by the exactions of its enemies. Nothing, in fact, save hard necessity, could have wrung the concession from Denmark, and, deserted though she was, by her allies and advisers, she defended her position with obstinacy as long as it seemed tenable. At first her representative in the conference received instructions to reject the claim altogether as inequitable and unjust. Then he was authorized to propose that the question should be settled by arbitration; and not till it was found that the German Powers were inexorable, and that there remained no alternative for the Danes, but concession, or a renewal of the conflict, was their plenipotentiary permitted to succumb.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Dano-German Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Dano-German Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d0dad5a9-53f2-5c88-aa97-f5bf720ff916,584,nyt://article/d0dad5a9-53f2-5c88-aa97-f5bf720ff916,

His first venture, so far as is known, was in Williamsburgh, Long Island, where he became acquainted with a young woman of poor but respectable connections, whom he eventually made his wife. After marriage, they went on what is technically called a ""honeymoon"" tour throughout the West, stopping at the leading hotels by the way, and stepping out to the tune of the ""Free list."" Arriving at an extreme point West, the ""Lieut."" finding that he was ""played out"" on that line, left his wife as security for the hotel bill. The landlord in this case declined the agreement, and the young wife returned to Williamsburgh, where she resided for a series of months in the family of a gentleman not remotely connected with one of the Brooklyn journals, where she was retained as an object of mercy. At length the ""Lieutenant,' dropped her a note, and she left. This was about the time when the rebellion broke out. A few months only elapsed before Mrs. B. returned to Williamsburgh, loaded down with luxurious apparel, so much so as to astonish her old friends with the splendor of the transformation. Her purse was lined with gold, and she was unaccountably rich. Lieut. BRAINE was engaged in the secret service of the rebel Government. This was the secret of the ""change"" on the part of his wife. Mrs. B. departed from that region, and nothing was heard of the Braine family again till the Chesapeake affair came off, and after another interval, in the capture and burning of the Roanoke. For a young man, he is about as reckless as is necessary to make a dashing pirate. It appears that he has fallen into British hands at Bermuda, but under a very different exercise of governmental policy than that which prevailed at the time of the Chesapeake piracy.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Who is Lieut.

They had first been confined for several months in Libby prison, Richmond, and from there had been remoted to Macon, Ga., then to Charleston, where they had been placed under fire, and lastly to Columbia. During their stay at Charleston only one of them was wounded. A shell from one of Gen. FOSTER's batteries fell into the Marine Hospital, and exploded, wounding one of the prisoners in the leg. A few of the prisoners, unfit to be removed from Charleston, were left in the infirmary there. Our informant states that boxes containing clothing and provisions have been received lately by a few of the prisoners, and he is of the opinion that they are still passed through the lines to them if sent by the way of Hilton Head, to which place Government transports are constantly sailing.

In regard to the Congressional canvass, he said that he had no other motive for being a candidate except a desire to be of service to the country and the Union cause, and that as the Union men of the District, with a very considreable degree of unanimity, had thought he could do so best by going to Congress, he had accepted the nomination. He had done so, however, with the distinct statement that he reserved the right to withdraw whenever he should be satisfied that any other Union candidate could stand a better chance of carrying the district. He had made repeated personal attempts to secure an adjustment of the differences which seemed to stand in the way of harmony, but had entirely failed. He saw no way, therefore, of evading the labors and chances of the canvass, but felt bound to submit the whole matter to the action of the voters of the district. He then spoke of the importance of securing for the Union cause two-thirds of the next Congress in order to submit to the people the question of amending the Constitution so as to provide for the abolition of slavery, and said that a gain of four more members would give us the requisite number. The remainder of his speech was devoted to a discussion of the general subject. After Mr. RAYMOND closed, some eloquent remarks were made in support of his nomination by C.S. SPENCER, Esq., and a resolution was unanimously and enthusiastically passed, declaring that it was for the interest of the city and of the whole country, as well as of the sixth District, that Mr. RAYMOND should be elected.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Sixth Congressional District.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Sixth Congressional District.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-10-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/bd0f3084-c4ec-57f3-9ef8-ddc9827956e3,351,nyt://article/bd0f3084-c4ec-57f3-9ef8-ddc9827956e3,

a State of the Union,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/10/31/archives/nevada-a-state-of-the-union.html,a State of the Union,"The President has issued a proclamation, agreeably to an act passed in the last session of Congress, declaring the admission of Nevada into the Union as a State. By the last census Nevada had a population of only about twenty-six thousand, two-thirds of whom were Indians; but the great increase of the population of the territory, and its great growth in wealth, has taken place within the last six, indeed within the last four years. Silver was discovered there in great abundance and purity, and the mining of it at once became the great interest and industry of the region. As California lay directly west of Nevada, Utah north of it, and Colorado to its eastward, it at once secured from these regions, and particularly from California, vast numbers of emigrants acquainted with mining. Our readers must remember the intense excitement which prevailed on the Pacific coast four years ago about the ""Washoe"" silver region, which was the first profitable mining done in what now constitutes the State of Nevada. Various fortunes waited on the territory and on its mining prospects; but it has grown with unprecedented rapidity -- distancing completely all the contiguous territories.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEVADA A STATE OF THE UNION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEVADA A STATE OF THE UNION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Nevada', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-10-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fb56b6c3-af5f-5d4a-b7f2-ef73379d42dd,240,nyt://article/fb56b6c3-af5f-5d4a-b7f2-ef73379d42dd,
