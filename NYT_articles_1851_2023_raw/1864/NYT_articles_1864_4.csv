We are receiving immense numbers of unskilled laborers, invaluable, no doubt, for agricultural and other purposes, but all branches of industry are suffering severely, and likely to suffer still more, from the want of mechanics and artisans. There are thousands of such, both in England and on the Continent, in a half-starving condition, who would be only too glad to get over here if they got a chance. The most desperate efforts are being made by the Secessionist Press, and persons working in the Secessionist interest, to prevent emigration to America, by the circulation of the grossest misrepresentations as to the condition of the country, and the effect of the war on the laboring classes. General statements in our newspapers are not sufficient to counteract this. They do not reach the persons whom it is desirable to influence, and if they did would not remove their doubts or difficulties. What is wanted is personal and well accredited agency, and funds to help the movement. And it ought not to be confined to England. If anything of this kind were attempted on a great scale, the habits and intelligence of the class of persons from which the immigrants would be drawn, ought to be duly considered. With our system of Government, the moral and mental condition of those who come to settle in the country is of the highest importance.

Breach of Contract; Philidelphia Steam Propeller Co. vs. Steamship George Washington; Barge Sunk in Slip,"The Philadelphia Steam Propeller Company vs. The Steam Propeller George Washington. -- This was an action of a somewhat novel character. The facts of the case were as follow: The George Washington, a large screw steamer, was, on the 24th of November, 1862, lying on the north side of Pier No. 9 in the North River. She was a new vessel and was in process of completion, and for the purpose of trying her machinery she had been turning her screw through the day. Her screw was a large one, 13 feet in diameter, and the effect of its revolution was to cause a powerful current to set toward the screw from the other side of the slip. On this opposite side of the slip lay the libelant's barge, Fair Lady, and the barge Garibaldi -- the Garibaldi being outside. Another propeller lay ahead of them nearer the end of the pier. During the day it became necessary to move the Fair Lady out toward the end of the pier, which could not be done safely while the screw of the George Washington was in motion. The engineer of the George Washington was therefore requested to stop it, while the barges were being moved. He stopped it accordingly, and the barge Garibaldi was moved out, and made fast near the end of the pier. The Fair Lady was then breasted out from the pier to be moved forward. While she was so being moved, and when she was about two-thirds of her length past the screw of the George Washington, her engineer started her engine and set her screw in motion. The current caused by its motion at once sucked the Fair Lady over to the stern of the George Washington, where one arm of the screw as it revolved, struck the bottom of the barge and cut a hole in her, from the effects of which she sunk, causing about $20,000 damage to her and the goods on board of her, for the recovery of which this suit was brought.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; IMPORTANT DECISION IN ADMIRALTY Barge Sunk in a Slip by the Screw of a Propeller Custom-Waiver.UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT.Before Judge Shipman.

"THE MATCH FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP. -- Mr. TIEMAN, accompanied by a delegation from Cincinnati, arrived here on Wednesday afternoon, and at once proceeded to KAVANAGH's Broadway and Tenth-street establishment, which he will make his headquarters during his stay in this City.

It was at once removed to a private room at KAVANAGH's, where it is now employed to practice upon. Our reporter has witnessed several tilts by these experts since that time, and in a match of 250 points up, KAVANAGH, for the first time in several months, exhibited the full scope of his well-known brilliant manipulation, and reassured his numerous friends that his chances of winning are equal to their expectations. TIEMAN was travel-weary, and although there was a decided improvement over the play he displayed here in October last, yet there was evidence that he wanted to get over his journey before he would be able to show his full prowess. On Thursday, Messrs. PHELAN and TIEMAN played five games of 500 points each. TIEMAN won three of them; his highest run was 104; PHELAN's, 87. The average of the whole was about 15. Every game TIEMAN plays is an improvement on the last, and he is rapidly arriving at his best speed.

"System, Reforms proposed",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/02/archives/our-public-school-system-reforms-proposed-in-the-law.html,"System, Reforms proposed","A bill, making some important changes in the School Law of this City, has been reported in the Assembly by Hon. ERASTUS C. BENEDICT. The most material change is in the manner of appointing and removing the teachers employed in the Ward Schools. The total number of these teachcrs is about two thousand. They are now appointed and may be removed by the uncontroled action of a majority of the trustees of the ward in which the school is located, and it is notorious that the power has often been grossly abused. It is proposed by the new bill, that hereafter the principals and vice-principals of these schools shall be appointed and removed only by the concurrent action of the Board of Education of the City, and the Board of Trustees for the ward. Assistant teachers are to be appointed, as heretofore, by the Board of Trustees for the ward; but the more reliable tenure of office secured to the principals of the schools, upon whom the main responsibility for their management actually rests, will give to them such a degree of courage that they will apply to be relieved from the imposition of useless assistants. The means for removing teachers, though guarded by careful checks, are so fully provided that there will be little probability of the retention of teachers who are incompetent, inefficient or otherwise unworthy. Assistant teachers may be removed by concurrent action of the trustees and inspectors; but in such case the teacher removed has a right of appeal to the Board of Education, which body, after hearing the trustees, may reinstate the teacher. The Board of Education is to have an absolute power of removal, not only upon the recommendation of a majority of either the inspectors or trustees having the school in charge, but also upon that of the City Superintendent of Schools.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Our Public School System Reforms Proposed in the Law.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Our Public School System Reforms Proposed in the Law.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/61bb058c-c391-53f7-845e-8d4e0585ccc5,1363,nyt://article/61bb058c-c391-53f7-845e-8d4e0585ccc5,

"HOMICIDE ON SHIPBOARD -- THE PERPETRATOR ARRESTED. -- An inquest was held yesterday by Coroner COLLIN, on board the ship Albert Gallatin, lying in the harbor, opposite Bedloe's Island, on the body of WM. HENDERSON, a sailor, who died from injuries received on Thursday evening at the hands of a shipmate named PATRICK CLARK. The testimony given in the case tended to show that the Albert Gallatin cleared from this port, on Thursday afternoon, for Liverpool, and that after going down the bay a short distance she anchored for the night. The crew, who had just been shipped, were for the most part intoxicated. Between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening they became involved in a serious quarrel among themselves, during which HENDERSON was knocked down, beaten and kicked about the head and face by CLARK. The injuries were so serious that the victim died in a few minutes afterward. The evidence disclosed the fact, however, that deceased had made a deadly assault on CLARK, and that the latter, to some extent, acted in self-defence. The jury rendered the following verdict: ""We find that WM. HENDERSON came to his death by blows at the hands of PATRICK CLARK; and we think, from the evidence, that it was partly justifiable."" Deceased was 37 years of age, and a native of Scotland. CLARK was arrested by the Harbor Police, and upon the rendition of the verdict he was committed by the Coroner to await the action of the Grand Jury. He is 26 years of age, and was born in Ireland. He does not deny having inflicted the injuries, but he says that the act was done purely in self-defence.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/02/archives/general-city-news.html,,"HOMICIDE ON SHIPBOARD -- THE PERPETRATOR ARRESTED. -- An inquest was held yesterday by Coroner COLLIN, on board the ship Albert Gallatin, lying in the harbor, opposite Bedloe's Island, on the body of WM.

There are thirty-four thousand seamen in the naval service; there are thirty-five vessels-of-war now awaiting crews, and the number is increasing; and the immediate and imperative wants of the naval service require the transfer of twelve thousand seamen from the army. No transfers of sailors from the army to the navy have been effected thus far; but many sailors have been drafted into the army, or drawn thither by bounties and other causes, and are now serving as soldiers. While experienced men are thus misemployed, or, at least, not employed to the highest advantage, the enlistments into the navy during the last year have been mostly of inexperienced landsmen.

H., Ex-Congressman","-- Rev. Dr. CAMPBELL, a well-known divine of Albany, has just died in that city. The Albany Evening Journal sketches the main points of his history as follows: ""Dr. CAMPBELL was a native of the City of Philadelphia. His pastoral life commenced, we believe, in Petersburgh, Va. He subsequently accepted a call at Newbern, N.C., from whence he went to Washington. Gen. JACKSON was a member of his congregation. During the Mrs. Eaton imbroglio, which occasioned a breaking up of the Cabinet. Dr. CAMPBELL, who spoke as plainly, to the President as he would have done to the humblest citizen, incurred Gen. JACKSON's displeasure. In 1830, the late Chief Justice SPENCER, then a member of Congress, attended Rev. Dr. CAMPBELL's Church, and became much interested in him. This circumstance led to his call and settlement in Albany -- a circumstance auspicious alike to pastor and people, and out of which endearing relations grew up and have existed for thirty-four years. Dr. CAMPBELL will be most missed, outside of his family and church, in the Board of Regents, and at the State Library, where for many years his knowledge, judgment, diligence, taste and tact, have been invaluable.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be218d1b-6309-58ac-b464-4c1b8f7d37fc,908,nyt://article/be218d1b-6309-58ac-b464-4c1b8f7d37fc,

He defends the pell-mell style of warfare upon a great variety of grounds. ""In the first place,"" says he, ""it showed a proper spirit of bravery before the armed foe; it showed them that our army were not afraid or unwilling to fight."" Farther on, he argues that ""to wait, and parry, and manoeuvre for some advantage of ground, at an expense of millions per day is simply to confess our inability to crush the rebellion, and that the rebels will fight better against our Government than we will for it."" It is melancholy to find any man who has had sufficient brains and pluck to right and bleed for his country, writing thus. War is not merely a trial of brute strength, with the object of crushing or killing an enemy, nor is it a trial as to which of two combatants will come out best or display most bravery in a ""straight, standing-up, knock-down fight"" The proper object of war is to discomfit the enemy in his aims and in the field, and to do this with the least possible loss to your own side. To this end, intellect plays as prominent a part as muscle and skill subserves equally with strength Nothing in the course of this was illustrates finer the value of consummate strategical ability than the operations of Gen. GRANT immediately prior to the investment of Vickbburgh. When he crossed his forces to this side of the Mississippi, had he Simply stood his ground until PEMBERTON's army came up, and had he then entered upon a simple trial of brute strength, there can be little doubt that he would have been defeated and the war on the river have been postponed indefinitely, at an ""expense of millions per day."" But by the most brilliant series of strategical manoevres that have been witnessed for the last half century, he succeeded in completely circumventing the enemy, dividing their forces, making their conjunction impossible, defeating them in detail, discomfiting them in their purposes, opening the Mississippi River, and ending the war in the Great Valley. Had the critic whom we are now criticising been in command, instead of GRANT, on that occasion, the army of the Union would have suffered the fate which Gen. Jo. JOHNSTON excoriates PEMBERTON for not administering to it. From this illustration our correspondent will see the value of ""parrying and manoeuvering"" more clearly than probably he would from a column of reasoning; and had the officer whom he praises for fighting pell-mell possessed and exercised the genius for strategy, his battle might have been a victory instead of a bloody defeat.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STRATEGY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STRATEGY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'STRATEGY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0c706aa3-a0e0-5926-8e02-b5482797f6d6,473,nyt://article/0c706aa3-a0e0-5926-8e02-b5482797f6d6,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/03/archives/the-privileges-of-french-citizens.html,,"The privileges of French citizens under the Second Empire, are not of a very enviable character. The most insignificant meetings in relation to politics, cannot be held without the sanction of the imperial authorities, and even with that sanction, they are not secure from interruption. In France, every man's house is by no means his castle. A case illustrative of French freedom under the BONAPARTES, has lately occurred in Paris. The Prefect of the Police having intimated to the candidates for the unrepresented districts that they were at liberty to hold assemblies of their friends, provided they convoked them by personal letters of invitation, M. GARNIER PAGES, one of the candidates for the Fifth District availed himself of the license, and addressed a circular to his supporters, inviting them to meet at his residence to discuss the prospects of his election. The object of the meeting being perfectly lawful, one should have concluded that the sanction of the Prefect would have saved it from annoyance. Despite authorization, however, M. GARNIER PAGES and his friends were not allowed to close their proceedings in peace. Monsieur PAGES had rendered himself obnoxious to the present regime by publishing a History of the Revolution of '48, and, especially, by inserting therein the text of a letter written by M. FOULD, in republican times, in which that now notable Imperialist financier recommended national bankruptcy as a convenient method of escaping from the burden of public debt. The manuscript of this letter, and other papers very compromising to some of the prominent actors on the political stage, being in the possession of Mons. PAGES, it occurred to the police authorities that if any pretext could be found for the outrage, this would be an excellent opportunity for seizing the coveted documents and clearing scores with the opposition candidate. An inadvertence on the part of M. PAGES afforded the wished-for pretext. The circulars had unfortunately been signed by his son-in-law, instead of by himself. This irregularity was pronounced subversive of the gentleman's right to hold the meeting, and an ample justification for police interference. A raid on the domicile of M. PAGES was accordingly determined on, and while the host and his guests were engaged in the discussion of electioneering affairs, a bevy of gendarmes suddenly rushed into No. 45 Rue St. Roch, dispersed the company, and instituted a general search for the documents referred to. The outrage, however, proved as unprofitable as it was shameful. The dispersion of a meeting, composed of about one hundred in offensive civilians, could not have been the real object of the raid, and the search for the papers turned out fruitless, since, though in the possession of M. PAGES, they were not there.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Privileges of French Citizens.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Privileges of French Citizens.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/12a2d8d5-852d-5f03-8f45-349e9c480959,692,nyt://article/12a2d8d5-852d-5f03-8f45-349e9c480959,

"-- Yesterday afternoon, a volunteer Surgeon, went to the ordinance office of the yard to exhibit a torpedo, of which he claims to be the inventor, when, finding that some alterations were necessary to insure its success, he was directed to the plumbers' department, where Mr. HARLEY T. HICKS was set to work upon it, and while in the act of applying the solder, the torpedo, which was ascertained afterward to be filled with chloride of potash and nitric acid, exploded. Mr. HICKS' arm, face and neck were badly burnt, and the inventor was also badly burnt about the face. Some of the workmen had their clothes scorched. The injured men were at once taken to the dispensary, where their wounds were dressed.

The venerable Dr. BRECKINRIDGE, who exercises more influence than any man in the State, has lately taken strong ground for emancipation, and has had more than one ""deliverance"" upon the subject. He made a speech, a few days since, at an excited meeting in Danville, in which he confessed himself an ""Emancipationist, though a large slaveholder, and could not understand why people could not exercise an ordinary amount of common sense upon the negro question as well as upon any other."" His speech, we are told, had a wonderful effect. The Hon. GREEN CLAY SMITH, also a member of Congress from Kentucky, delivered a speech the other day, at Lexington, in his own State, in which he not only took Anti-Slavery ground, but argued ably in favor of drafting negroes, slave as well as free, into the army, for the purpose of crushing out the slaveholder's rebellion.

Boats with heavy freight and crowded with passengers are constantly passing to and fro between New-Orleans, Natchez, Vicksburgh, Memphis, etc; and from the last-named point diverge to St. Louis and Louisville, of course, safely as ever. In the long stretch of hostile country from the Delta up o Cairo, the rebel interruptions and eruptions, which were foreshadowed as something so terrible as well as effective, have never amounted to very much, since the fall of Vicksburgh, and of late months have hardly amounted to anything. Boats are rarely fired upon by guerrillas, and still more rarely damaged. We do not think that there have been two dozen commercial steamboats attacked since the opening of the year, although many hundreds have passed down and up.

Thus was it yesterday. The people came from their counting-rooms, their stores, their factories, workshops and dwellings, and the Great Heart of New-York beat warmly and encouragingly toward a purpose consecrated by humanity and patriotism to the sick and suffering soldier. Although the suggestion that the day should be a holiday was made but on Sunday, it was eagerly accepted and promptly observed. All public offices were closed, and at noon there was a general cessation of business. Early in the morning the City had put on her holiday attire. Flags waved from every building where there was a flag to wave, and the shipping in the harbor were gaily decked.

"Philadelphia, Margaret Baer shot in box of Theatre by Maguire",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/05/archives/the-homicide-in-philadelphia.html,"Philadelphia, Margaret Baer shot in box of Theatre by Maguire","-- MARGARET BAER, reputed to be a young and handsome German woman, was shot on Saturday evening, while sitting in a private box at the Continental Theatre, by WILLIAM MAGUIRE, a young man known to many as William Howard Mitchell, from Wilmington, Del. The parties had been acquainted for some months, and MAGUIRE had, it is said, manifested considerable fondness for her. They had met often at a drinking saloon, corner of Chesnut-street and Hudson's alley, called the Red Robin Saloon, and they had been together so often to the Continental Theatre as to be well-known to the frequenters of that house. Lately she had rather avoided him, and this had caused him to make threats to take her life. On Saturday they met at the Red Robin Saloon, but nothing occurred there to induce the belief that he intended to carry his threats so soon into execution. He drank freely and passed the time at card playing. After dark he went to the Continental Theatre, where she was seated in a private box. He was observed to be excited, and to the officer of the house he remarked that he was going to New-York, and bade him good bye, saying he would not see him again. To his request to go to the back part of the theatre the officer objected, but he was finally permitted to go. He went directly to the private box in which MARGARET BAER was sitting, and going toward her in an excited manner, said, loud enough to be heard by all in the box, ""MAGGIE, are you going to do what I asked you?"" She made no reply, and he repeated it. A companion sitting at her side said, ""Say yes, for if you don't it may cost you your life,"" and she then replied ""Yes."" In the meantime, however, MAGUIRE had drawn a revolving pistol from his pocket and commenced to fire. There were three discharges of the weapon in rapid succession, and it snapped at the fourth attempt. Three bails entered her body, two proving fatal wounds, the third a slight one. One ball passed through the brain, and one through the lungs and aorta -- the latter causing death almost instantaneously. MAGUIRE gave himself up at once, saying that he had loved her and was ready to die for her. He was removed to the Central Station, where he many times repeated the remark that he loved her and was ready to die for her. Coroner TAYLOR held an inquest on the body yesterday, when the above facts were disclosed by persons who were acquainted with the prisoner and deceased, some of whom were in the theatre when the shooting took place.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HOMICIDE IN PHILADELPHIA.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE HOMICIDE IN PHILADELPHIA.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b56ae2a-04dd-58b8-9481-47bae5f75114,573,nyt://article/5b56ae2a-04dd-58b8-9481-47bae5f75114,

Under the gentle pressure thus applied, of course, the greater portion of what of it there is in the country has been funded; whilst some hundreds of millions, (there are $700,000,000 of it in all,) which are at the North or abroad, and cannot get back in time, will be a dead loss to the owners, although, we need hardly say, no more a loss than if they had been at home, and secured their bonds for it. The consequence is that prices are tumbling all over the Confederacy.

Industrial Biography; Kirkland, Mrs. C. M. School-girls' Garland; Furness, Rev. W. H. The Veil Partly Lifted; Biography of; Lee Holme; Annie Warleigh's Fortunes","Any new book of Mr. SMILES as scarcely needs critical recommendation to insure its meeting with thousands of readers. The happy discernment that led him to select a class of subjects strangely neglected until his day, is only equaled by the felicitous treatment that makes the annals of mechanical inventions, and the struggles and sufferings of their originators, in his hands, hardly second in interest to the exciting scenes of fictitious romance. He has put on record in one of his works the doubts entertained by men, the most thoroughly acquainted with mechanics and engineering, as to the possibility of making them the themes of books that should command the attention of the public, but these doubts were finally and effectually solved by the production of the series of works that includes the present volume of Industrial Biography. It is an off-shoot, or continuation of Mr. SMILES' Lives of the Engineers, his most important contribution to industrial history, but not yet (we regret to say) reprinted in this country. While engaged in the preparation of that work -- Iron -- the material that enabled his heroes to carry out their vast conceptions, and its workers -- the men who founded the modern industry of Great Britain -- were always before him, and their tracks were constantly crossing the field of view embraced in his general survey. He has consequently chosen, as the subject of a separate volume, the history of the production of that metal in England, with biographical sketches of the most eminent men connected with the progressive improvements of its manufacture. Starting with the aboriginal stone age in Britain, he traces the first appearance of metallic arms and implements, shows the close connection existing between the use of iron and civilization, and accounts for the curious fact that the most useful and indispensable of the metals should be the last to come into general use. All through the middle ages the importance of a supply of iron in war, was daily felt, and became still more essential after the discovery of artillery. What little is known of the mediaeval history of the manufacture is well related by Mr. SMILES; but it was not until near the commonwealth period that the records of individual discovery are preserved, which add a biographical interest to the historic detail. The eventful and romantic history of ""Dud Dudley,"" the first man who attempted to smelt iron ore with pit coal, and thereby laid the foundation of England's future greatness in the manufacture, when the gradual scarcity of wood and charcoal threatened its extinction, will be new to most readers. His name is the first of a long series, occurring from the year 1600 to the well-known living ones of MUSKET, HEATH and BESSEMER, all of whom are identified with processes of the utmost importance in cheapening the cost, and, consequently extending the use of metal as an industrial agent. The second portion of the work deals with the well-known names of BRAMAH, MANDSLAY, FAIRBAIRN, NASMYTH, and others of equal eminence. The details of the careers of these self-made men are derived from original sources, and have never before been published; in fact, Mr. SMILES was fortunate in commencing his work while the memory of these men is yet cherished by their pupils and successors, and thus preserving to future generations facts so full of encouragement and instruction to their fellow workers of every age and clime. Mr. SMILES' books present to us the real essence of history -- compared to which the story of Kings and battles is a mere external plating on the surface of society that only distracts attention from what underlies it -- the actual life of the people and all that constitutes true human progress.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; INDUSTRIAL BIOGRAPHY--IRON WORKERS AND TOOL-MAKERS.

"Niagara, Steamship;Perilous Voyage of",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/05/archives/perilous-voyage-of-the-niagara-her-cruise-for-the-italian.html,"Niagara, Steamship;Perilous Voyage of","The United States steam frigate Niagara returned on Sunday, having left this port March 18, to go in search of the Italian frigate Re Galantuomo, and has therefore been absent fifteen days. The Niagara has experienced very severe weather the whole time. On Wednesday, 23d, in latitude 40 45' north, longitude 33 27' west, her situation was appalling. The whole of the day was exceedingly rough; a severe rain-storm and a heavy gale. About 11 P.M., the storm increased, and the gale assumed still greater violence; the waves were mountains high, the ship rolled franticly and labored heavily. In the middle watch, the scene on this vessel beggars description; cutlasses, mess-chests, muskets, and, in fact, every movable thing were tossing about the decks promiscuously, and it required much courage to pass from one part of the ship to the other. At 1 1/2 A.M., her situation was so critical that the officers deemed it necessary to call all hands. At this time, the vessel was shipping heavy seas, and the main deck had some four feet of water upon it. This immense body of water would roll from side to side, carrying all with it; it had washed the ashes in the bilges, which rendered the pumps useless, and all momentarily expected it would extinguish the fires; two of her boats, the third and sixth cutters, were torn from their davits and carried away by the angry sea; for a while, her situation seemed utterly hopeless; at each roll of the ship her lower yard-arms dipped the water. But even more was to be endured, as two of the guns were broken adrift by the great violence of the winds and water, were rolling about the deck, and all were fearful of being crushed; great apprehensions were felt lest they would break down the engine hatch, and be precipitated upon the engine. At the risk of their lives, some noble fellows succeeded in lashing the guns fast; the gun-carriages were mashed to pieces. After hours of danger and suffering, and by the energetic and untiring exertions of both officers and crew, the hatches were battened down, the ship rid of much water, all hands made sail, and the Niagara safely rode the storm, but with a great amount of damage to the vessel. About daylight on the morning of the 24th, one watch was relieved, and the fury of the storm was somewhat abated. On the succeeding morning, the topgallant masts, maintopsail sheet and main-trysail were carried away. On the night of the 28th, in lat. 42°, lon. 53°, the Niagara again experienced a severe storm of hail, rain and sleet, and an intensely violent gale, and but for having a fair wind it would have been more terrible than the one above described; the vessel shipped heavy seas over her gangways, and the violence of the waves were such that some of her ports were stove in; nearly all her sails were literally torn in shreds, and flying at the mercy of the winds; at this time the vessel had all canvas spread, was running before the wind, which as it sent the info to New-York made all hands feel cheerful. On the morning of the 20th the Niagara presented a sorry picture on deck. On the 30th every one on board was pleased to see the sunshine, the first since the ship left port. On the days succeeding the trying scenes described the Chaplain summoned all hands to render thanks for their safe delivery from the very jaws of death; this was indeed a solemn time; the officers, the hardy sons of Neptune, young and old, all devoutly united in gratitute to the Almighty for His merciful protection while the storm-king reigned with such fearfulness. Indeed it seems almost a miracle that this ship has returned, or that one lives to tell the tale. The terrible scenes through which she and her noble crew have passed cannot be adequately described. All honor to the noble fellows who, while upon an errand of mercy, have so bravely encountered perils, and so miraculously escaped.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PERILOUS VOYAGE OF THE NIAGARA.; Her Cruise for the Italian Frigate--Fearful Storm--Damage to the Frigate.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PERILOUS VOYAGE OF THE NIAGARA.; Her Cruise for the Italian Frigate--Fearful Storm--Damage to the Frigate.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'NAVAL', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e60e7392-6643-5f72-8e7d-e7aab5eda6ce,929,nyt://article/e60e7392-6643-5f72-8e7d-e7aab5eda6ce,

Method of Receiving,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/05/archives/the-soldiers-vote.html,Method of Receiving,"-The method by which the soldiers' vote shall be sent from the field, and deposited in the ballot-box at his home, proves a puzzle to our Legislature. A bill has been reported by a select committee, which provides that the ballots shall be enclosed in envelopes marked on the outside ""Soldier's Vote,"" and that such envelopes may be sent by mail to the inspectors of election, in the district where the soldier resides, any time within sixty days before an election. This proposition seems very much like offering a chance to corruption. Why should the soldiers' vote be thus advertised, or exposed to such risk from mail carriers, Post-office officials, or election inspectors? Would he be willing to thus hazard his money? Certainly not; he would demand it as his right to send it to a friend whom he could trust, if he wished to deposit it in bank, and the Legislature could not deprive him of this right. Is a citizen's vote of less value than money, or is it less his own or less under his control?

We are glad the resolution was couched in the simplest form -- that it was kept entirely free from the high-flown rhetoric which usually overlays such Congressional manifestoes, as if there were something imposing in the mere accumulation of words. A fixed purpose, in common life, always announces itself in brief terms. A man who is really determined not to submit to a wrong act never declaims. The more in earnest he is, the briefer he is apt to be. There is no reason why public deliverances should not follow the same natural method. It may not, in fact it would not, tell quite as forcibly in the way of buncombe, but so much the better. The prime motive of such a declaration is that it is meant for the calm consideration of statesmen abroad, and not for domestic buncombe. If it carried on its face that it was prompted by the latter, it would neither receive nor deserve respect. The conciseness and simplicity of that resolution, though not agreeable to such flamboyant Democrats as Mr. COX, will only give it consequence abroad.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anti-Maximilian Declaration of the House.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anti-Maximilian Declaration of the House.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68b2e568-5dd6-56fe-a65a-78cf3bf8fc76,991,nyt://article/68b2e568-5dd6-56fe-a65a-78cf3bf8fc76,

The members of Congress are wanted just now in Washington. They have business of importance which should keep them there. Besides, these explorations of traveling committees rarely result in any important discoveries. The members seldom come back any wiser than when they went away, at least on the ostensible subject of their inquiries. These expeditions are usually little more than protracted sprees, in which the business in hand plays a very subordinate and unimportant part. If they really want trustworthy information, in order to guide their action, they would do well to send some person familiar, from actual experience, with the requirements of the service, entirely disinterested in the decision of the question, and who will act upon his own judgment, and not upon the representations of interested parties.

Owing to the excellent arrangement for the sale of tickets there was no confusion, and everything moved in a very orderly and systematic manner. The various departments were all very well filled. The Art Gallery was one of the great features, and was continually filled with an admiring crowd. The Department of Arms and Trophies, and the Indian Department, were also great points of attraction. In the latter several performances were given during the day and evening, at each of which the room was so crowded as to leave not even standing room. The Indians appear in their full Indian dress, and are ornamented and painted the same as when living in their forest homes. The ladies and children particularly viewed this scene with great interest, giving them, as it does, so good an idea of the habits and customs of the original owners and inhabitants of this land. The sword surrendered by Gen. BURGOYNE to Gen. GATES at the battle of Saratoga, in 1777, and an autograph letter of Gen. LYON, both of which are exhibited in the department of arms and trophies, received much notice. The machinery department is not yet complete, but one or two machines are in operation; they, however, are very perfect, some of them very novel in their construction, and are both instructing and interesting.

"-- The Ceylon Times, of Feb. 7, tells of the following disaster to a Government immigration vessel, on the ferry between Paumben and the Coast: ""The Audy Letchemy, a bark of 150 tons, was bound from Vengalle to Paumben, having on board 120 coolles and a crew numbering 14. At 7 o'clock on the morning of the 5th inst., the tindall noticed a large waterspout about 10 miles to the northeast, but as he was steering due N.W., its presence did not occasion him any uneasiness, and he went below. There was a good breeze blowing at the time, and there had been a little rain in the early morning, confining the coolies to the hold. It seems that shortly before 8 o'clock the waterspout was seen rapidly approaching the vessel, and the tindal accordingly put her about to try and avoid it. However, all his efforts proved fruitless; the spout came nearer, and from the whirling motion at its base lifted the doomed ship about three feet out of the water and instantly capsized her. All this had occurred so rapidly that the result was wholly unexpected on board, and most of the coolies were still below. Out of the 120, only 7 escaped, by holding on to floating pieces of timber until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when a passing ship picked them up. One of the crew was also drowned. The vessel became a total wreck, and sank in 31 feet of water.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/07/archives/foreign-items.html,,"-- The Ceylon Times, of Feb. 7, tells of the following disaster to a Government immigration vessel, on the ferry between Paumben and the Coast: ""The Audy Letchemy, a bark of 150 tons, was bound from Vengalle to Paumben, having on board 120 coolles and a crew numbering 14.

The justification of this seeming attempt to trench on the domain of private enterprise, is found -- first, in the fact that the Government has already, by authority of Parliament, recognized the principle of interference with the enterprise of ordinary assurance companies or loan associations, in exempting friendly societies from taxation, and in having established, through the post-office department, national savings banks in nearly every parish of the kingdom. A second justifying plea is found in the fact, that large and safe companies do not want the kind of business offered by the industrial poor; but on the contrary, as a rule, favor the intervention of the Government. Still another argument is supplied by the startling report of the Government Commissioner on the actual condition of those minor assurance companies and friendly societies which employ agencies to tout up subscribers.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Life Assurance by Government An English Scheme.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Life Assurance by Government An English Scheme.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78c02835-f4f5-5d89-9dc8-0dc6d2cf5195,1379,nyt://article/78c02835-f4f5-5d89-9dc8-0dc6d2cf5195,

Probabilities of Fighting,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/07/archives/the-long-suspension-of-serious-fighting.html,Probabilities of Fighting,"Since the battles of Chattanooga and Knoxville, in the last week of November, more than four months ago, there has not been a serious conflict between the Union and the rebel arms, with the single exception of SEYMOUR'S faux pas at Olustee, an affair which don't deserve a military name. There have been raids -- SHERMAN's, AVERILL's, KILPATRICK's, and two or three minor ones -- which have inflicted considerable damage upon the railroads and other material interests of the rebels, but even these were attended with almost no effusion of blood. This general quiet has not come simply from the fact that the season of the year has been unfavorable for military operations. During the two previous Winters, battles were numerous. During the four months previous to April, 1862, we had Mill Springs, Roanoke Island, Fort Donelson, New-Madrid, Pea Ridge, Winchester, and the fight between the Monitor and Merrimac. During the four months previous to April, 1863, we had Prairie Grove, Stone River, SHERMAN's attack on Vicksburgh, Arkansas Post, Fredericksburgh, and a great number of smaller fights. In fact, probably quite as many blows have been struck heretofore during the cold months as during any other season of the year. But during the present year there has been almost an absolute suspension. And what is more, it is probable that this suspension will continue through this mild month of April.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Long Suspension of Serious Fighting.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Long Suspension of Serious Fighting.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ff5cbaa0-2a2f-53e0-b232-75f50973d021,931,nyt://article/ff5cbaa0-2a2f-53e0-b232-75f50973d021,

The incumbent takes from the City Treasury $2,500 a year, and does not one cent's worth of work. If he does, let him deny the assertion. He has drawn this amount ever since the bureau was created, and has not returned one cent's worth of service. It is a sinecure of the most shameful kind. The entire work of the License Bureau is and always has been done in the Mayor's office, at one-half the cost contemplated in the bill lobbied through the Legislature for this License Bureau. How Comptroller BRENNAN can sign monthly warrants for pay for duties which he well knows are not and never have been performed, puzzles those who attribute to him the characteristic of jealously watching the interests of the City and his own fair fame.

The situation was such that he might hope, not merely to defeat, but to destroy that portion of our force. Two corps -- to wit, those of KEYES and HEINTZELMAN -- were on the right or Richmond bank of the Chickahominy, the other three corps -- to wit, those of SUMNER, FRANKLIN and PORTER -- were on the left bank. The great flood gave the rebels hope that it would sever the two portions of our army, leaving the right wing on the left bank helpless spectators of the destruction of the left wing on the right bank. With this view, Gen. JOHNSTON made the following dispositions: Gen. HILL, (D.H.,) supported by the division of LONGSTREET, to advance by the Williamsburgh road and attack in front; G.W. SMITH to move to the junction of the New-bridge road and the Nine Mile road, to fall on KEYES' right or cover LONGSTREET's left.

It effected a complete revolution in financiering, adding one more, and this no small one, to the list of democratic triumphs. The practice of all governments, ever since governments first began to borrow, has been to obtain their loans from a few great capitalists, and, until very recently, this was the only course open to them. Up to the beginning of the present century accumulation, on ever so small a scale, was almost unknown among the poorer classes. What with ignorance, social and political degradation, and insecurity, the desire of saving was generally wanting, even if the power of saving existed. There is probably no surer indication of the extent to which the working classes have risen in the scale, mentally and morally, than the extent to which they accumulate money and invest it; and the plan of offering government stock in such sums as to place it within their reach, was all that was wanted to inspire them with the same conservative feeling which, in all previous ages, has been the characteristic of the rich exclusively.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Popular Loans.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Popular Loans.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'LOANS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/61586dcb-e5a7-548c-9cf5-988163fee542,737,nyt://article/61586dcb-e5a7-548c-9cf5-988163fee542,

We believe we state a fact, when we say that at no period of the war have so many names been on the pay-rolls of the Government as during this month of April. The effective force, also, of the United States is, at the present time, immensely large, and of a high order. The soldiers are more hardy, vigorous and inured to campaigning than ever before, and their discipline and drill are far superior to what they were in the first years of the war. Unworthy officers have been weeded out to a great extent, and those in command have been tested by battle and danger, so that our troops will be better commanded than they have ever been. The Government is able now to concentrate heavy and efficient bodies of veteran soldiers wherever it desires them. Coming down next to such details as have been published, it is said that an army of formidable dimensions is being gathered at Annapolis. We observe also that an officer of tried service and great skill, Gen. SMITH, is placed over the military forces of Gen. BUTLER's Department. We note furthermore that Gen. MEADE still keeps his position on the Rapidan, with an army increased in number and refreshed after the Winter's rest and the liberal furloughs. Gen. GRANT's presence at these various points in Virginia indicates that he is preparing for some stroke, and that he himself intends to guide and direct it. The very silence and inaction through the whole Union, under a Commander-in-Chief of such well-known energy as GRANT, is ominous of great blows in preparation. It is generally understood that Gen.

Surrender of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/09/archives/the-navajoes.html,Surrender of,"-- That fierce and untameable tribe of redskins, the Navajoes, whom we have been fighting for the last eighteen years, are reported to have lately surrendered to our forces in New-Mexico; and on the heels of this news, we have the announcement from Washington that an appropropriation of one hundred thousand dollars is asked from Congress for the subsistence of the tribe. It is thought in official circles, we are informed, that it will be more economical to support the Navajoes than to fight them. We doubt the accuracy of this theory; though on grounds of humanity, we might concede the wisdom of giving these galloping wretches rations of bread and beef rather than of bullets and cold steel. In the meantime, our soldiers, who have just got through with a big fight with the Navajoes, are dividing their daily rations with them, being themselves put on short commons for the purpose of feeding the savages. This is certainly very nice. In future it is proposed to give each individual of the tribe, numbering seven thousand in all, a daily allowance of one pound of flour and one pound of fresh meat, which, if they consume it all, will, it is thought, leave them little stomach for the fight. But the Navajoes are very treacherous, and pay little regard to treaties or agreements with white men. Col. DONIPHAN beat them and made a treaty with them in 1846, but they soon forgot it; Col. WASHINGTON did the same thing in 1849, with the same result; Col. (subsequently Major-General) SUMNER repeated the operation in 1851, but we have heard of their depredations almost every year since. The fact is, fighting has been the ceaseless and immemorial occupation of the Navajoes; and we fear that the bread and beef now furnished to them will only give them strength and muscle to fight us again the coming Summer.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE NAVAJOES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE NAVAJOES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e7a2da8f-057d-5176-8ec7-f97eb7fc32da,315,nyt://article/e7a2da8f-057d-5176-8ec7-f97eb7fc32da,

The imperative demand for high speed in shipsof-war is leading some of our builders and engineers to make exertions to accomplish in this respect all that can be desired.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/speed-in-naval-vessels.html,,"The imperative demand for high speed in shipsof-war is leading some of our builders and engineers to make exertions to accomplish in this respect all that can be desired. Fast vessels of light draft may not be able to carry a sufficiently heavy armament to cope successfully with the Alabama, but they may be armed with another weapon which would settle the Alabama's case much quicker than a broadside, viz., a ram. This, with sea-going qualities, and power, would render a light vessel the equal of a much larger one, whose strength lay entirely in her armament. The numerous blockade-runners that have been captured and brought to this port, have attracted much attention for their models and peculiar construction, with reference to the chief quality -- great speed. We have lately seen a model of an iron-clad vessel, constructed on the combined principles of speed to be found in these blockade-runners, and in the fast steamers on the Mississippi, and possessing, moreover, great power, as well as sea-going qualities, with a formidable ram as a leading feature of its offensive character. The dimensions of this craft are: Length, 216 feet; depth of hold, 16 feet; beam, 20 feet; condensing engines, cylinder 60 inches in diameter, 30 inches stroke, direct acting, connected at right angles with the boilers, one forward and the other aft of the engine, with sufficient power to produce 60 pounds of steam to the square inch; propeller, 16 feet in diameter, with 30 feet pitch; the ram to project 12 feet from the stem, in the form of a lance, and three feet thick in the centre. The bow is so constructed that, when a ship is struck by the ram, she is keeled over by the blow, and the sharp blade of the ram crashes into her bottom. The natural return roll of the ship then following, aided by the backing of the ram's engines, would completely disengage the blade. The sea-going qualities consist in placing the boilers, engine, coal, provisions and everything but the armament below the waterline, in the bottom of the ship. The model is exceedingly beautiful, and seems fully adapted for the attainment of the very highest speed.

Paris Election; Elections of Libergis,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/the-paris-electionsanother-warning-to-the-emperor.html,Paris Election; Elections of Libergis,"Paris has again registered her protest against Caesarism. At the recent elections in the First and Fifth Districts, she has returned the Opposition candidates, MM. CARNOT and PAGES, by an overwhelming majority. These gentlemen are something more than Constitutionalists. Both of them were members of the Provisional Government of '48, and both of them are still republicans, so staunch that for twelve years they have steadfastly refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Empire, and merely take it now in obedience to the call of the democracy. There is not a little of significance in the election of such men. Though several worthy candidates of liberal views and undoubted honesty, had come forward to contend for the honor of representing the districts named in the Corps Legislatif, yet the ex-members of the fallen Republican Government were preferred before all. By this preference, the Parisians at once paid a tribute of respect to the principles of liberty, and marked their indignation at the arbitrary dispersion of the electoral meetings. The popular victory is the more notable, because it was won under every disadvantage, and over the nominees of the Court; for the Government did, at the eleventh hour, bring out its candidates, and contest the election, notwithstanding the general impression which prevailed to the contrary. The fact is, that the Emperor, from the first, was determined to give his opponents battle, and only held back his men to throw the enemy off their guard, so as to have the better chance of carrying the day by a coup de main. But the trick failed. The appearance of the Court candidates in the field was the signal for the concentration of the popular forces, and NAPOLEON sustained, in both districts, a Waterloo defeat -- M. PINARD, his candidate for the First, receiving only 4,888 votes out of 18,497, and M. FREDERIC LEVI, his candidate in the Fifth, only 6,430 out of 20,936. From the conquerors in this encounter His Majesty must expect a more earnest opposition, and more radical demands, than from those representatives of obsolete factions and obsolete ideas, who have hitherto made their way into the Legislature in defiance of the Government, and who would be content with a partial modification of the present system. The new deputies are the representatives of the opinions and desires of the populations of the great cities of France -- of those populations who, from the period of the old Revolution, have been always thorough republicans at heart, and who chafe at the restrictions which absolutism has imposed on them. The new deputies are enemies of Caesarism, and, saving their allegiance, will do all they can to undermine and destroy it. M. CARNOT's address to the electors of the First District embodies the initiatory programme which they mean to put forward. They will proclaim that France aspires to regain those lost liberties which are so dear to her. They will demand greater freedom for the citizen in his individual capacity; greater freedom for the elector in the exercise of his political rights; greater freedom for the operative in the regulation of his industrial interests; greater freedom for writers in the expression of their thoughts, and a more perfect system of education for all. There is here certainly no indication of anarchical designs -- no open declaration of war against the Empire; nothing, in short, of which the eloquence of a THIERS or a BERRYER cannot undertake the advocacy. But let these concession be denied, let ""the crowning of the political edifice"" be postponed, let the outrages of power against liberty continue, and who can foretell the ultimate result? The Emperor may contemn the numerical feebleness of the Opposition, and influenced by evil counsellors, may hold on in his present course -- nay, may be able to control the elements during the residue of his reign. His Majesty is, however, advanced in years, his constitution is broken, his reign cannot last forever; and it is when he is laid in his grave -- when a weak and inexperienced boy guides the helm and wields the sceptre, that the tempest whose mutterings we now hear may burst forth and sweep away Imperialism and the BONAPARTES from France.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Paris Elections--Another Warning to the Emperor.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Paris Elections--Another Warning to the Emperor.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3221f653-9ab0-5dcf-99c7-227a4603c66a,703,nyt://article/3221f653-9ab0-5dcf-99c7-227a4603c66a,

"-- Letters from Munich give us some additional particulars of the last moments of the King of Bavaria. The original cause of the King's death was a trifling wound which he accidentally inflicted upon himself with his breast-pin while hurriedly dressing. This injury produced a small abscess beneath the skin, which, in the King's delicate state of health, who was always complaining, very susceptible to the slightest influence of temperature, and subject to great excitement, rapidly assumed a dangerous character. The King took no notice of the wound, however, and had, at 9 o'clock, his customary bath, having his person well rubbed with flannel towels. By this fatal operation, it appears, the poison beneath the skin was communicated to the blood. At noon, on the 9th inst., he had an interview with Archduke ALBRECHT, and then received his Ministers. By that time the pain in the chest had become so excessive that he sent for his physician, Dr. GIELL, who immediately recognized the dangerous character or the case, and called for four other physicians to consult with them on the subject. It was found that the King was afflicted with pyramy, with a strong addition of erysipelas. Toward midnight the physicians became aware that the cure was hopeless. The Queen, the Princes and Ministers were at the Royal sufferer's bedside during the whole of the night. At 5 o'clock in the morning of the 10th, while prayers were being read in all the churches for the King's preservation, the dean of the cathedral, BEINDEL, presented himself to the King, in order to prepare him for the approaching transition. The King, it appears, had even then no idea of his position, and it was only on being asked by the priest whether he would take the Sacrament, that he remarked, ""Is my case so bad as that?"" Soon afterward he became delirious, and consciousness was not restored for a moment until 10 o'clock, when His Majesty took leave of the Queen and Crown Prince; lockjaw then ensued, and the King was no more.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/foreign-items.html,,"-- Letters from Munich give us some additional particulars of the last moments of the King of Bavaria.

These fights, we may say, would have been a primary feature in any project emanating from the rival cliques and circles, which together give tone and temper to Cockney literature. Thus, the coteries which own the leadership of HEPWORTH DIXON and WENTWORTH DILKE and their fellows, would find it as impossible to agree with the Punch clique on the question of doing homage to the great dramatist, as they have always found it to agree on the merits of SHAKESPEARE's most notable living interpreter on the British stage.

In January last, a Convention of Delegates, elected by a portion of the people, met at Little Rock, remodeled the Constitution of the State, and appointed me for Governor. The new Constitution differs from the old in this -- that it abolishes Slavery in Arkansas forever. The members of the Convention were sober, earnest men, on whom events had made a deep impression. They were tired of war, and the desolation that war produces: they remembered the security and happiness that they enjoyed when law and order prevailed, and the flag of the free was the only emblem of their nationality. They remembered, too, when in an evil hour, a combination of insane politicians, forced their State into rebellion against their own Government. Not one of the traitors had been wronged -- not one of them had ever been deprived of a right. On the contrary, they had always been protected in their special and exclusive rights -- especially in their right to hold slaves. Yet, in their insane madness, they rejected that protection, and sought to overturn the Government that protected them in the possession of their slaves.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'RECONSTRUCTION IN ARKANSAS.; Addresses by Gov.

"British Policy on; Ionian Isles, British Policy on",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/england-and-the-ionian-isles.html,"British Policy on; Ionian Isles, British Policy on","A recent debate in the British House of Commons on the Septinsular Republic has given fresh interest to the subject, and placed the shameless conduct of England in relation to that little State in a new and more striking light. The foreign policy of England is characteristic. She observes one rule of action when dealing with the powerful, and another when dealing with the feeble, cringing to the former and crushing the latter. She keeps a kind of balance-sheet, in which her concessions to the Brobdignagians of the earth are set off against the outrages which she perpetrates on its Lilliputians. But among the small States that have suffered wrong at her hands, none has had more reason to complain than the Ionian Commonwealth. In 1809, when she took possession of said islands, her Government proclaimed that she came not as a conqueror, but as an ally, and formally recognized in official dispatches the independence of the Republic; and the treaty which constituted her its protectress by no means authorized her to overthrow the popular government, and to establish her own supremacy on its ruins. This usurpation, and their being deprived of the right of self-rule and subjected to the dominance of a foreign race, were the original sources of the discontent of the Ionians. The incessant bickerings between the British and their proteges which this abnormal state of things naturally gave rise to, at length fairly wore out the patience of the former, and when the Prince of Denmark offered to accept the crown of Greece in consideration of the Ionian Isles being annexed thereto, the British Government assented to the transfer. This act, had it been performed in a decent spirit by England, would have made her respected by both Greeks and Ionians. But England cannot perform even an honest act gracefully, and though the Treaty of Vienna contained a distinct recognition of the right of the islanders to the fortresses of Corfu, though Earl RUSSELL in the debate of last July on the cession of these islands, admitted that it was only the people of the new kingdom who could rightfully decide whether the fortresses in question should be dismantled, though the Ionian Legislature had from time to time voted over £200,000 for their repair and restoration, it was yet suddenly, capriciously and in open defiance of treaties, determined that, ere the islands were surrendered to King GEORGE, the Corfu fortresses should be blown up. This shameful and perfidious resolution was adopted out of complaisance to Austria. FRANCIS JOSEPH, it seems, would not consent to the cession of the islands to Greece if the fortresses of Corfu were not destroyed. They command the entrance of the Adriatic; and were Italy to get possession of them, what damage might she not do, perhaps, to the commerce and marine of Austria? Italy, be it remembered, could not seize those fortresses without attacking Greece, which would rouse the indignation of Europe, therefore the apprehension of Austria does not seem to have been very well founded. England, however, took a different view of the matter, and concluded that it would be better to do a grievous wrong to a feeble people, than to reject the counsel of her circumspect ally.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'England and the Ionian Isles.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'England and the Ionian Isles.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8a475cbe-bc1c-5243-b403-421a3cc13235,678,nyt://article/8a475cbe-bc1c-5243-b403-421a3cc13235,

"A few days ago, ISAAC JOHNSON, a sailor residing at No. 92 Baxter-street, appeared before Justice HOGAN at the Tombs Police Court, and entered a complaint against THOMAS HADDEN and PATRICK WADDLETON, charging them with kidnapping and robbing him.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/curious-case-of-alleged-kidnapping-a-sailor-shanghaed-and-robbed.html,,"A few days ago, ISAAC JOHNSON, a sailor residing at No. 92 Baxter-street, appeared before Justice HOGAN at the Tombs Police Court, and entered a complaint against THOMAS HADDEN and PATRICK WADDLETON, charging them with kidnapping and robbing him. He alleges that he called on WADDLETON and was desirous of shipping as steward on board the schooner Prince of Wales, bound for Porto Rico. WADDLETON shipped him for $35 a month and one month's wages to be paid in advance. JOHNSON signed articles as he supposed of the above import, and instead of receiving his advance pay was given some clothes of small value, and that he left a trunk of clothes valued at $185 in the possession of the accused. When he got ready to leave, WADDLETON took him down to Peck-slip, where he fell in with HADDEN, the notorious ""shangaeher."" who advised him to go on board without delay. They all got into a small boat and rowed alongside the British vessel Lydia, bound for Callao and thence to Valparaiso. On reaching the side of the ship, JOHNSON, finding that he had been deceived, refused to go on board, when he was seized by the accused, who struck him on the head with a billet of wood, which rendered him powerless. A rope was then passed about his body and he was hauled up to the deck of the ship. When he returned to consciousness he informed the mate of the vessel that he had been kidnapped, but the mate held him and refused to allow him to go ashore. After he got out to sea he found that his chest was on board the ship, but that it had been sold by WADDLETON to one of the crew. JOHNSON claimed his trunk but received a severe thrashing in answer. He also alleges that WADDLETON received advance pay of $100 for him, which he had appropriated to his own use. After being three weeks at sea, the Lydia returned in a leaky condition, when the complainant called on WADDLETON and found HADDEN there, and HADDEN made all manner of violent threats toward him and would give him no satisfaction.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Curious Case of Alleged Kidnapping.; A SAILOR ""SHANGHAED"" AND ROBBED.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Curious Case of Alleged Kidnapping.; A SAILOR ""SHANGHAED"" AND ROBBED.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/995b16f2-0c56-5bf8-86b7-d0aa385d6962,420,nyt://article/995b16f2-0c56-5bf8-86b7-d0aa385d6962,

It is amendatory to an act approved July 16, 1862, the object of which was to establish and equalize the grade of line officers of the United States Navy. This act, which now bids fair to become a law, provides that no line officer of the navy upon the active list, below the grade of Commodore, nor any other naval officer, shall be promoted to a higher grade until a board fully empowered to make the necessary investigations shall be satisfied regarding his mental, moral, and professional fitness to perform all the duties likely to devolve on him at sea. A Board of Surgeons is to pass upon his physical qualifications, and all officers who may not be recommended for promotion by both these boards are to be placed upon the retired list. It is also provided that all officers not recommended for promotion under the fourth section of an act entitled ""An Act to Establish and Equalize the Grades of Line Officers of the United States Navy,"" approved July 16, 1862, shall have the right to present themselves for examination, according to the provisions of this act, and if found duly qualified, and such finding be approved by the President of the United States, they shall be promoted to the same grade and place as if they had been recommended by the Board, and shall receive the corresponding pay, according to the service which they have performed from the date of their rank to that of their promotion.

Municipal Reform--The Citizens' Association,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/10/archives/municipal-reform.html,Municipal Reform--The Citizens' Association,"It has always seemed that one of the most practical methods for gradually reforming our City Government would be by instructing its constituency. The reader must remember that the game of peculation and plunder which is going on continually with the property of our citizens is, in fact, played by comparatively few persons. The ""Ring"" is not a large or crowded body. In every ward there are a few shrewd and good-natured men, either American corrupt politicians or Irish who have ""worked up"" from degradation. These persons have become thoroughly familiar with the machinery of local politics. They know the chances of every candidate and almost the vote of each voter. As liquor-sellers, or agents of houses, or ""City contractors,"" or Aldermen, they are able to do favors to a few individual workingmen, and impress the others with their great desire to serve them. Gradually, from ""jobbing"" and managing in a petty district, they come to have a share in the great City jobs. They have no especial sense of character or position. Their constituents will back them in everything which is not open and legal robbery. They have acquired great skill in their iniquitous schemes, so that they have little to fear from any interruption from whatever source. The upper and respectable classes can seldom be induced to combine against a particular candidate, and if they do, the immense vote of ignorant people which these politicians can command insures them success. Thus they go on, from year to year, shamelessly cheating and plundering the City. They give us the most ill-governed and uncomfortable City in the world, at the highest cost. Nothing seems to influence them or to check them. The property-holders simply bear it, and appear as if bound hand and foot. If it were only the plundering of the non-voting rich by the voting poor, we could hope for no cessation until both democracy and the wealth of the City came to an end. But it should be remembered that this is, in the long run, merely putting into one pocket of the laboring class of the community by taking out of the other; or, more definitely, it is enriching a few politicians and contractors, with their followers, by plundering all the rest of the working people. The jobs of the ""Ring"" are paid for in the rents of the poor and middle classes. For every dollar jobbed from the City, stolen from the Treasury, squandered in junketings, wasted by non-performance of public duties, each man, woman and child of all classes has to pay. Those who pay the taxes on real and personal property must, of course, raise the price of real estate, and the rent of all houses and lands to meet their diminished profits. Every petty dealer whose rent is raised, or who buys of those paying higher rents, must make up the deficiency by charging more for his wares. Every house agent must ask a higher price for the rooms of his tenement houses. There is no ""corner grocery"" which does not charge upon the laborers some of the expenses which the iniquities of the Common Council lay upon the City. It is this great fact in economics which gives us our hope for future reform.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Municipal Reform.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Municipal Reform.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e9a7a450-27d8-519f-b94c-d2e9815fb294,996,nyt://article/e9a7a450-27d8-519f-b94c-d2e9815fb294,

"Bushnell, Horace. Work and Play",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/11/archives/new-books-work-and-play-or-literary-varieties.html,"Bushnell, Horace. Work and Play","This volume takes its name from the first article of its contents, an oration delivered before the Ph Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University in 1848. It is mainly composed similar addresses, called for by different public occasions, and now collected together in a shape that secures their preservation, in obedience to the frequent calls that continued to be made for them in the original fugitive form. We are not surprised at this steady demand for these papers, for if any one can be relied on for new applications of old topics, Dr. BUSHNELL is the man. He may be regarded as a man of letters first among the class that is most typical of the American mind, in its highest stage of development. The light of his clear, fresh and vigorous intellect diffuses itself over every subject he touches. He could not if he would take a common-place view of any question presented to him. Remote analogies become near and obvious, consequences undreampt of before, are seen to be inevitable, and a wider range of thought opens out to the reader, while under the influence of a style always nervous and animated, and often rising to true eloquence that mirrors without a shadow the bright and sharply defined conceptions of the author. If any one wishes to see the novelty a man of genius can evolve from what is generally called a worn-out theme, let him compare ""The Founders, Great in their Unconsciousness,"" an address before the New-England Society, with his recollections of the usual platitudes current about the Pilgrim Fathers, and it is impossible to avoid being struck with the difference. Like smoke before the breeze, he dissipates in a moment the popular theory that what they sought was political liberty and general freedom to worship God. He is not afraid to own their intense and conscientious intolerance, their perfect identification of the Church and the State as a joint power having dominion over the bodies and souls of men, and the utter distastefulness for anything like democratic principles that their whole theory of life and its relations inculcated. Accepting in their widest extent these facts, Dr. BUSHNELL eloquently shows how much we still owe them, because the end of the Pilgrim movement ""was religion, simply, and only religion;"" but a religion that required the cultivation of intellect -- a personal matter that demanded of every one the independent exercise of thought and reflection; and that the true paternity and spring of our institutions must be sought --",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; WORK AND PLAY; OR LITERARY VARIETIES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.; WORK AND PLAY; OR LITERARY VARIETIES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'By Horace Bushnell. 12mo.

Tax Levy; Explanation by Aldermen,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/11/archives/the-tax-levy.html,Tax Levy; Explanation by Aldermen,"In the discussion which has arisen in regard to the Tax Levy, the Aldermen thus explain their action. By ordinance, the Comptroller is directed to submit the Budget to the Common Council on the 1st November. This year it was found impossible to submit until Jan. 15. It was then sent to the printers, where, between corrections and the necessary delay, it was detained until about the 28th February, when it was again placed in the hands of the Board of Aldermen. On the 9th March the Finance Commute reported the Budget substantially the same as received from the Comptroller, and it was passed on the 11th. The Comptroller had reduced the amount called for by the different Departments over one million and a half of dollars, and the Board of Aldermen reduced appropriations to sundry Departments and Commissions, as submitted by him, nearly $200,000. But certain additions were made by the Board for matters deemed of special importance, such as $100,000 for the improving of the Russ pavement; $40,000 for a parade ground, recommended by the Mayor and Special Committee of the Common Council; $40,000 for resetting monument stones, and $100,000 for reception of regiments and burial of soldiers. The 20th March was the last day for presentation to the Legislature; the Board of Councilmen had prepared amendments making appropriations from the departments far in excess of what the Aldermen would assent to, and all efforts to induce them to unite on the Aldermanic budget failing,they ceased to be consulted, and it was forwarded to Albany.

There is an air of good sense and simplicity about the author that recommends strongly to the reader this story of his experience. He has something to tell, and he tells it clearly and without affectation. Though at this present moment he is not likely to meet with many willing listeners -- if all auguries are true -- the time may return when the details here set forth will afford hope and consolation to those who may find themselves in like circumstances with the writer, Ten Acres Enough will naturally be compared with another recent book, My Farm at Edgewood, equally good and true in its way, but representing an opposite end of the agricultural scale; one giving the experience of a gentleman farmer who employs means derived from other sources in the improvement and embellishment of a favorite site, satisfied if the outlay returns a small interest on the capital expended; the other, ""one of that numerous band of patient tollers in city, town and village, who have struggled on from year to year, anxious to break away from the bondage of the desk, the counter or the workshop, to realize in the country even a moderate income, so that it be a sure one."" Harassed almost to death, and his business prospects destroyed by the rapid succession of commercial ""crises"" and ""revulsions,"" the writer in 1855 converted his stock into cash; and after settling up his affairs, found himself, with a wife and six children, in possession of four thousand dollars -- ""the net gain of many years of most laborious toil."" Half this sum secured him, by good fortune, the possession of a garden farm, within a few miles of Philadelphia, near a railroad that opened to him the markets of that city and of New-York. The raising of fruit and vegetables for these great centres of consumption was the business he devoted himself to, and the energy and success with which it it was pursued in the subject matter of the book. The statement of annual cash profits for the first three years may be given as a specimen of the information conveyed in the work, where each item of outlay and profit is separately enumerated. The result was. First year's net gain, after deducting all expenses, $336; second year's gain, $1,025 05; third year's gain, $1,327 02, without reckoning the portion of the family's support derived from the farm.

The Legislature on which we have been in the habit of relying, seems to have surrendered itself completely to their hands. No remonstrance, or protest, or expression of opinion from the public seems to have the slightest influence in preventing the sanction of every fraud or imposition which any board of speculators in the City may take it into their heads to attempt. The facility with which charters have for some time been granted to proprietors of street railroads, without the exaction of a single guarantee for either their responsibility or good faith, has been scandalous enough, but it is hard to find an epithet strong enough to characterize the indifference to public comfort and decency evinced in the resolute and steady refusal to enact a single clause for the regulation of the conveyances to be run under the grants -- their size, cleanliness, number of passengers, and times of running. The streets are handed over remorselessly to hordes of speculators, and they are left to work their placers with a single eye to their own profit, which is enormous. The taxation has reached a point which threatens the whole property of the City with depreciation, and seems not unlikely before very long to drive business away to other parts; the poor are suffering severely from the consequent high rents and high prices of clothing and provisions, and yet it is impossible to secure the sanction of the Albany legislators to a measure so eminently just and expedient as the levy of a tax of ten per cent. upon the receipts of the companies who have obtained the monopoly of our streets, and are reaping enormous gains from carrying us up and down on them in cattle-boxes. As soon as anything likely to interfere with their profits is proposed, they rush up to Albany, and though these operators are never visible, we see the result in after days in the tabling of the obnoxious bill.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'City Interests at Albany The Underground Railroad.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'City Interests at Albany The Underground Railroad.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e41ae0f2-40ab-5edb-9017-edc57539f92f,742,nyt://article/e41ae0f2-40ab-5edb-9017-edc57539f92f,

It comprises nearly four hundred oil paintings, including specimens of almost every American artist of note, together with a very large number of the works of distinguished foreign painters, some of which are of great excellence, and which are rarely or never seen away from the galleries of their princely owners. Objects of great pecuniary value, they have been intrusted to the dangerous keeping of the fair, with a sacrificing liberality that deserves the warmest commendations of all lovers of art. The private galleries of the wealthiest collectors of New-York and vicinity have been liberally drawn upon to enrich this collection; and it now stands a superb monument of the art wealth of our metropolis, and a school in which the student at a glance can trace the progress of art in his own country, and compare it with the finest examples of the Old World.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ART NOTES.; The Art Gallery of the Sanitary Fair.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ART NOTES.; The Art Gallery of the Sanitary Fair.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/eed1ce20-419f-5dda-8fda-a312bc401e86,1590,nyt://article/eed1ce20-419f-5dda-8fda-a312bc401e86,

THAYER, left Fort Smith, Arkansas, on the 21st ult., destined also for the Red River; and this body was to be joined in Southern Arkansas by a fourth army, from Little Rock, under Gen.

The Example of England,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/15/archives/taxation.html,The Example of England,"In the day of England's trouble the Government firmly pursued the policy of providing for the current, expenditure by adequate concurrent taxation. Of the total revenue of the period of war with NAPOLEON and with the United States, about seventy per cent. was raised by the annual taxes, and the remaining thirty per cent. by loans, permanent and temporary. In the year 1815, the ratio was still higher; the expenditures reached five hundred and fifty-five millions of dollars, of which, not more than one hundred and ninety millions were raised by loans, or as three by taxes to two by loans. Specie payments had been been suspended for 18 years, and gold was at a premium of from 30 to 41 1/2 per cent. for three consecutive years. Is it wonderful that gold in our money market should command so high a premium as its range for some months back, while our revenue is raised at the rate of but one-sixth from taxes and five-sixths from loans? Need we look' further for the cause of the condition of our money market, than the prolonged delay and the manifest hesitation of Congress to call upon the ample resources of the country for a contribution fairly proportioned to the outlay demanded by the sustenance of our vast forces in the field? In the face of such irresolution and postponement as the present Congress has shown, the credit of the Government is a marvel, and the gold price of its demand notes is anything but a marvel.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Taxation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Taxation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9d7c6b66-371c-51e2-abcb-da0e251a8e87,505,nyt://article/9d7c6b66-371c-51e2-abcb-da0e251a8e87,

Campaner Thal; Smith, Philip, B. A., History of the World, Part II","This elegant volume is a continuation of the series undertaken by Messrs.

It forms the fifth volume of the set, commencing with Mr. BROOKS'S version of ""Titan;"" and will be followed by a new translation of ""Hesperus,"" so there is ground to suppose. JEAN PAUL does not lack readers and admirers among us at the present day. The contents of the volume are varied, and have the advantage of presenting the author in different moods. It opens with ""The Campaner Thal,"" or discourses on the immortality of the soul, translated by JULIETTO BAUER. This work, which RICHTER was employed in enlarging and remodeling, when under the visitation of recent and almost total blindness at the time of his death, is pronounced to be ""the life of his whole philosophy, glimpses of which look forth on us from almost every one of his writings."" The two following articles are: ""Life of Quintus Fixlein,"" and ""Army Chaplain Schmelze's Journey to Hatz."" The version of these works, characterized by RICHTER himself as ""Portraits or little sketches of character, voluntary or involuntary comedy pieces,"" is by THOMAS CARLYLE, and will be remembered by all his readers as among the most remarkable attempts to transfer, not the matter only, but the manner of an author from one language to another, that has ever been made.

That on that day every one should pay twenty-five cents. Ticket-holders who have probably already visited the fair many times, could surely afford to miss one day or else pay twenty-five cents extra.

Improvement in Manufacture,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/16/archives/improvement-in-the-manufacture-of-gas.html,Improvement in Manufacture,"We have received a small pamphlet describing a new and improved method of manufacturing gas, for lighting and heating purposes, which is likely to be of marked benefit to every class of the community. It seems to be very simple in its character, and, according to the evidence furnished by experience, and the opinions of the most skillful and scientific judges, there can be no question of its practical value. It is not proposed to produce gas from any new material; bituminous coal is still used for this purpose. But at a particular stage of the manufacture a supply of hydrogen and other gases, produced by the decomposition of superheated steam introduced into a retort containing anthracite coal, is conveyed to the retorts charged in the common way with bituminous coal; and in this way, while the quality of the gas produced is decidedly improved, its cost is reduced more than twenty-five per cent. This fact rests on the testimony of Mr. JOSEPH BATTIN, who is widely known as the constructing engineer of a great number of gas-works in various sections of the country, and on the experience of the City of Elizabeth, in New-Jersey, where it has been thoroughly tested by experiment.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Improvement in the Manufacture of Gas.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Improvement in the Manufacture of Gas.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'GAS', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb092727-c8c4-5f28-84c6-d2f813e54a4f,396,nyt://article/cb092727-c8c4-5f28-84c6-d2f813e54a4f,

The attack on Fort Pillow by the rebels under FORREST, which was announced yesterday, was followed up by frequent demands for its surrender, which were refused by Major BOOTH, who commanded the fort, but while these flags were being sent FORREST took occasion to make more favorable dispositions of his forces. The flags being refused, the fight was kept up until 3 P.M., when Maj. BOOTH was killed, and the rebels, in large numbers, swarmed over the intrenchments. Immediately upon the surrender ensued a scene which baffles description. Up to that time comparatively few of our men had been killed; but, insatiate as fiends, the rebels commenced an indiscriminate butchery of the whites and blacks, including the wounded. Both white and black were bayonetted, shot or sabred; even dead bodies were horribly mutilated, and children of seven and eight years and several negro women killed in cold blood. Soldiers unable to speak from wounds were shot dead, and their bodies rolled down the banks into the river. The dead and wounded negroes were piled in heaps and burned, and several citizens who had joined our forces for protection, were killed or wounded. Out of the garrison of six hundred, only two hundred remained alive. The steamer Platte Valley came up at about half-past 3 o'clock, and was hailed by the rebels under a flag of truce. Men were sent ashore to bury the dead, and take aboard such of the wounded as the enemy had allowed to live. Fifty-seven were taken aboard, including seven or eight colored. Eight died on the way up to Cairo. Six guns were captured by the rebels, and carried off, including two ten-pound Parrotts, and two twelve-pound howitzers. A large amount of stores was destroyed or carried away. They seemed to be moving toward Memphis.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edd50146-e290-519d-bb7c-6be07479d89b,715,nyt://article/edd50146-e290-519d-bb7c-6be07479d89b,

"the Steamer, Wreck in 1853",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/16/archives/a-long-neglected-matter.html,"the Steamer, Wreck in 1853","-The terrible wreck of the steamship San Francisco ten years ago, just after she had left this port on her way to California, must yet be fresh in the memory of hundreds of thousands of people. It will be recollected that the San Francisco left here on the 22d Dec., 1853, having aboard some eight hundred souls, among whom were the Third Regiment of United States Artillery. On the night of the 22d she encountered a furious storm, which rendered her unmanageable, and on the morning of the 24th she was struck by a violent wave, which shattered her quarter deck, her hurricane deck and carried away her upper saloon, and all the officers and soldiers, (some 200,) who had taken shelter in it from the storm. The ship was so damaged by this shock that it required the utmost efforts of all on board to save themselves from going to the bottom. While in this perilous condition, within the next few days three vessels -- the Kilby, Capt. Low; the Three Bells, Capt. CREIGHTON, and the Antarctic, Capt. STAUFFER -- hove in sight; and though they had suffered greatly themselves from the storm, they tendered assistance and succor to those on board, and promised to stand by the wreck at all hazards. They did so faithfully; and a report on the subject, presented to the Senate by JEFF. DAVIS, thanked and praised one of these officers, who, ""for six tempestuous days and nights, in a spirit of disinterested humanity, and at the imminent peril of himself and crew, stood by the sinking steamer until her gallant Commander, the last man on board, abandoned the doomed and deserted vessel.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A LONG NEGLECTED MATTER.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A LONG NEGLECTED MATTER.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'SAN FRANCISCO', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f55a4e88-31e1-5382-8142-127aec028324,532,nyt://article/f55a4e88-31e1-5382-8142-127aec028324,

"-- The Wheeling Intelligencer tells a curious story of a widow by the name of Mrs. BRIGGS, who formed an attachment for a guerrilla named GEORGE DUSKY, now confined in jail at Wheeling. She supplied him with delicacies of all kinds, until the jailor caught her trying to send in contraband articles, when he forbade further communication. The other night, he heard a noise under DUSKY's cell, and on going out a package dropped to the ground. As he stooped to pick it up, a woman, Mrs. BRIGGS herself, suddenly alighted on his back, having jumped from a wall twelve feet high, to the top of which she had climbed in order to pass the package which had been dropped to the prisoner, DUSKY. In jumping from the wall, the woman broke her right leg just above the ankle, but she nevertheless struggled violently for the possession of the parcel, and during the struggle a small bottle containing nitric acid was broken, and the contents spilled upon the jailor and Mrs. BRIGGS, both of whom were stained and burned by the liquid. Mrs. BRIGGS at last sunk to the ground in an exhausted condition, when she was taken into the jail, where medical attendance was called, and where she still lies in a suffering condition. The jailor, upon examining the parcel, found that it contained a bottle of chloroform, a bottle of nitric acid, a chisel, a box of steel pens, and two love letters from a Mrs. BRIGGS, a copy of the Freeman's Journal, and a copy of the Cincinnati Enquirer. Mrs. BRIGGS had the package attached to the end of a long pole, and was endeavoring to put it in the cell occupied by DUSKY, which she would doubtless have succeeded in doing had not the appearance of the jailor startled her and caused her to drop the package. DUSKY, the Intelligencer says, appears to entertain a sincere attachment for the woman who has risked so much to secure his liberty. He told the jailor that he hoped he alone would be made to suffer for what had occurred, and he offered him a thousand dollars to release Mrs. BRIGGS, and say nothing about the adventure of Wednesday night, but the jailor scorned the bribe. DUSKY is a very powerful built man, and it was doubtless intention after having everything else prepared, to seize the jailor when he came to the cell, administer the chloroform by force, and make his escape.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/17/archives/a-devoted-woman.html,,"-- The Wheeling Intelligencer tells a curious story of a widow by the name of Mrs. BRIGGS, who formed an attachment for a guerrilla named GEORGE DUSKY, now confined in jail at Wheeling.

Plunder by,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/17/archives/plundering-trade-combinations.html,Plunder by,"The stage proprietors, who have added 67 per cent. to their fares within the past week, supply the latest illustration of the illicit combinations which have sprung into existence in nearly every branch of the retail business of the City within the past year. These proprietors have followed the profitable example of the butcher, the petty tea and coffee merchant, the green-grocer and the general furnishing dealer; and as they constitute the most recent notable instance of the total depravityof those who have marketable commodities to dispense, they come in temporarily for an almost exclusive share of popular censure. Let us not, however, be supposed to offer any palliative for the extortions of the stage men, or to deprecate in any degree the opprobrium they have earned, if we turn aside for a moment to look at the position in which the combinations known to exist among other crafts has placed the honest householder who desires to live in even the most moderate comfort, and pay his lawful debts. The invariable reply to any protests, however temperate, against the butcher's and grocer's and general dealer's bill, is an appeal to the currency. Yet, every one who takes leisure to reflect, knows that during February and March, 1863, the market value of gold averaged almost the same, counting one week with another, as it has done in the months of February and March, and the first two weeks of April, 1864. During these last-named months, however, almost every necessary of household consumption -- we speak, of course, mainly, with reference to the larder -- is from 75 to 100 per cent. higher than it was a year ago. Thus, taking the average quality of the following articles, we find butter advanced within the twelve months from 25 and 28 cents a pound to 50 and 54 cents; cheese from 14 cents to 22 cents; eggs from 20 and 25 cents per dozen to 30 and 36 cents; coffee from 40 cents as pound to 56; sugar from 14 cents to 20 and 22 cents; roasting meat, from 16 to 25 cents; pork from 10 and 12 to 18 and 20 cents; vegetables of every description from 60 to 100 per cent.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Plundering Trade Combinations.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Plundering Trade Combinations.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-17 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3dc91e17-87b2-5d16-abb0-a7f3f33f8131,890,nyt://article/3dc91e17-87b2-5d16-abb0-a7f3f33f8131,

"-- The Pacific Mail steamship Constitution, Commodore WATKINS, yesterday completed her armament, in mounting a hundred-pound Parrott rifled gun, in addition to her two Dahlgren rifles. This monster piece of ordnance is placed forward on the main deck, and its working gear is so arranged that it will have full play when called into action. It carries a solid shot of sixty pounds, and has a range of four miles. Her Dahlgrens are twelve-pound rifled guns, carrying a solid shot of sixteen pounds. With this armament, Commodore WATKINS entertains no fear of piratical cruisers, and taking into consideration the vast size and speed of the Constitution, even if he should encounter the Alabama, he could easily capture or sink her. These guns are to be manned by the crew, who are au fait at artillery practice. Few, if any, vessels afloat can equal the Constitution and Golden City; and, now that they are completely armed, no fears need be entertained of a safe and speedy voyage -the great desiderata of travelers.

Chenango Explosion; Further on the,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/17/archives/the-chenango-calamity-appearance-of-the-vessel-scenes-at-the-naval.html,Chenango Explosion; Further on the,"The terrible catastrophe which happened to the Chenango, last Friday, opposite Fort Hamilton, is being thoroughly investigated. Efforts are being made by Government officials, to ascertain the cause of the disaster. A visit to the steamer is the most convincing proof of the destruction that followed the explosion. The port side of the vessel, from the deck to the engine-room is completely demolished. The wheel-house over the exploded boiler is a blackened wreck. On every side the evidences of destruction are apparent. The deck between the centre-house and port-wheel, is torn asunder, and the evidences of the powerful effect of the explosion is seen in the warped planks, the started bolts, and the almost entire disruption of every portion of the vessel. The appearance of the furnace under the exploded boiler, is one of the strongest proofs of the force of the concussion occasioned by the explosion. Pieces of coal were imbedded into the sides of the vessel, making holes like round shot. The imminent danger of the ship's being fired was only prevented by the coolness and bravery of the few men on duty uninjured by the explosion. Conspicuous among the number of those who were foremost in their efforts to assist the wounded, and extinguish the flames, was Capt. FILLEBROWN. During the excitement occasioned by the catastrophe, several men jumped overboard, but all, except in one case, that of a man named MARTIN, were rescued from drowning. To add to the confusion and horror of the scene, the steering apparatus of the vessel broke, and the helmsman lost all control of the ship. As soon as the wounded men could be conveyed from the engine-room to the deck, the fire-pumps were put in motion, and the conflagration which would undoubtedly have followed, was avoided. The shrieks of the dying and wounded men, as they lay prostrate on the gundeck, are described as most heartrending. Dr. D.P. GOODHUE, the Surgeon of the ship, was prompt and untiring in his attentions to the injured men. Every remedy known to medical skill was applied, and the anguish of the sufferers was relieved as far as the extent of the physician's skill could go. The timely appearance of the revenue-cutter Bronx was most fortunate. As the accident, happened late in the afternoon, it could hardly have been noticed by outward-bound steamers, as most of them sail early in the day. The wounded men were, as soon as possible after the explosion, removed from the Chenango to the Bronx and other vessels near by, and taken to the Naval Hospital. The sight at that institution was heartrending. The agony of J.A. CAHILL and JOHN WHITE, First and Second Assistant Engineers, is described as excruciating. The poor men writhed in agony, literally flayed alive, till relieved from their sufferings by death. Fireman BEMAN BOYLE could hardly be recognized. The flesh was stripped front his bones. Second-class fireman ARCHIBALD FLEMING met with a similar fate. Of the nineteen who died on their passage from Fort Hamilton and at the Naval Hospital, all came to their death from scalding. Those injured by the explosion, and who did not meet their death by scalding, were comparatively few. Most of the deceased were engaged in the Engineers department. At the Naval Hospital, the scene was most painful. In the different wards at the Naval Hospital, where the wounded men were lying, nurses were seen administering to their relief. For some distance from the Hospital the shrieks of the wounded could be distinctly heard. Almost every hour some one of the unfortunates would pass away. The attention of Surgeons FREELAND, RHODES, LYMAN and SMITH were unremitting. Valuable assistance was rendered by Stewards MCGURK and KIRBY. Many of the friends of the wounded residing in New-York and Brooklyn were admitted to the wards, and did all that lay in their power to relieve the sufferings of the wounded men. It is stated that, before Engineer CAAILL died, he exclaimed: ""Doctor, thank God, the boiler was full!"" -- a dying evidence of his faithfulness. Several of the men were recently enlisted, many of them resided in Brooklyn, and leave large families unprovided for. The Second Engineer, Mr. ROOT, of the vessel, was a resident of Brooklyn, and leaves a widow and three children. He has been in the United States service during the rebellion, and was for several months Chief Engineer of the Potomska. Mr. WHITE, the Third Assistant Engineer, who died on Friday night, was also a married man, and leaves a large family. He died a few hours after being admitted to the hospital. Mr. MURRAY, one of the Second Assistant Engineers, who died from the effects of his wounds almost immediately after being removed to the Bronx, was a resident of Baltimore.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CHENANGO CALAMITY; APPEARANCE OF THE VESSEL.

Sir HENRY BULWER, the British representative at the Porte, has been away on vacation, and has been devoting his leisure to the promotion of English interests in Turkey and Egypt. He has had repeated interviews with the Emperor of the French, and the result has apparently been that NAPOLEON is perfectly willing to let PALMERSTON have his way in the East, if PAM. will only consent to allow his Majesty to do what he likes in Mexico. The programme in relation to the East is as follows: A conference of the guaranteeing Powers is to be immediately assembled to settle the questions appertaining to the Principalities. This conference will base its proceedings on the act of secularization recently passed by the Roumanic Legislature, and on the second article of the Treaty of Paris, and it will compel Prince COUZA not merely to equitably indemnify the convents for their secularized territories, but also to reduce the military force of his little State to the measure prescribed by the said treaty.

Illustrated Horse Management",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/18/archives/new-books-the-national-almanac-and-annual-record-for-the-year-1864.html,"Wells, D. A. Annual of Scientific Discovery; North American Review, April; National Almanac, 1864; Mayhew, Edward. Illustrated Horse Management","Though the present volume is but the second issue of this truly named ""National"" work, it is established in public favor, firmly and substantially. Its appearance has been retarded, slightly, by the difficulty of obtaining skilled workmen, in the printing as well as in other branches of business; but the public are gainers by the delay, and are amply compensated for it, by the later date of the statistics, and the careful revision that the whole work has undergone in the interval. The National Almanac for the past year fairly took people by surprise -so evident was the vast labor bestowed on the volume, so rich its body of information, and so moderate the price at which it was afforded. The sale of fifteen thousand copies furnished a gratifying proof to Mr. GEO. W. CHILDS, the projector and publisher, that his exertions were appreciated by the public, and he has thrown all his customary energies into the task of making the new volume superior to its predecessor. It is claimed, and with undoubted justice, to be an advance on that, in several particulars. Old statements, formerly repeated on trust, have been rigorously scrutinized and verified from the original authorities. Direct application has been made, regardless of toil or expense, in every quarter where trustworthy statistics were to be obtained, and an unusual degree of intelligent labor and care has been bestowed in tabulating and condensing these statistics, so as to exhibit the valuable results in a form proportioned to the scale of the work. The topic that, per force, touches every one -- taxation -- is one on which the fullest information is afforded. Our internal revenue system, the laws that govern its operation, and the returns showing their proceeds, as levied on the various branches of industry in the shape of ad valorem excise duties, licenses, &c., are here for the first time brought together, and afford materials of the highest importance to the statesman, the historian, and the statistician: Thus, would it be believed without the figures to prove it, that the number of retailers who sell liquor is more than one-half that of all the retail traders in the country. Yet such is the fact, the. Ten dollar retail dealers' license producing $1,227,912; while the twenty dollar liquor retail license is credited for $1,477.754. The most costly article in the ad valorem tax list, diamonds, contributes to the national revenue $65,948. This, at the rate of three per cent, shows that more than two million dollars worth of that precious stone was manufactured in jewelry of various kinds, and absorbed into use during the past year. A thousand similar curious facts might be deduced from this portion of the ""National Almanac"" alone. In all that relates to the great military and naval operations of the country, equal care has been exercised in bringing down the information to the last minute. Here will be found, in condensed detail, the description, tonnage, number of guns, station, &c, of each of the ships that compose our grand national armada. In the Military Department an entirely new feature has been introduced, a mass of special intelligence concerning the volunteers of the United States armies, of the same character and extent as that heretofore mainly confined to the regular troops. This was only to be obtained by a most extensive correspondence and a laborious compilation from scattered and voluminous State official returns, and cannot be found in any other shape. The editor rightly says: ""As a permanent record of the marvelous development of the military power and resources of the United States, and of the patriotism of its citizens at the hour of need, it is worth more than the price of the whole volume."" The record of the events of the war gives a full diary of every prominent occurrence connected with its progress, and also a special history of each of the national armies and its services in its own theatre of action, in a separate division. The statistics of mortality and sickness in the army and the obituary list of deceased officers are matters of engrossing and painful interest to thousands. For the politician, the returns of electoral votes, &c., for each Congressional District of the different States are given with great fullness; the lists of the Judiciary, Executive officers, Legislatures, &c., of each State and Territory, are minute and exhaustive, embracing every particular of general interest. Seventy-five pages devoted to foreign countries, their sovereigns, governments, ministries, areas, populations, finances, armies, navies, commerce, navigation and affairs generally placed within the reach of the reader, -- a great summing up of the world's progress, the result of all man's labors, the reward of all his toil, condensed by the skill of the statistician into a nutshell. For an intelligent American citizen, whose privilege it is to think and act on all questions that affect the interests of his country and fellow-men, we can imagine no companion more indispensable than the ""National Almanac for 1864,"" and the oftener he consults it, the fitter will he be for the exercise of his civic functions.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE NATIONAL ALMANAC AND ANNUAL RECORD FOR THE YEAR 1864 12mo.

These two facts should go a long way toward securing crowded houses for the short term that remains. But there is yet another circumstance worth placing on record for the benefit of those whose purses are not plethoric. The prices of admission at the Academy of Music, and, indeed, at all places of amusement in the City will shortly be raised. Mr. MARETZEK, with the best of intentions and the largest of companies, finds it impossible to pay expenses, even with more than average houses, at the present rates of admission. Many of his artists are paid in gold, and those who are not, demand, like every one else, an increase of currency, so that there is not much difference. The orchestral and choral forces have long since raised their prices. They can do it with impunity, because they cannot be replaced and have the power in their own hands. Every article used in the mimic scene has more than doubled its value since the commencement of the Fall (1863) season. This increase in fact is so onerous that nothing but the most extraordinary run of luck in the matter of operas has enabled Mr. MARETZEK to struggle to the end without a positive loss. Early in May he intends resuming operations, devoting the interval to rehearsals of ""Les Huguenots,"" which he will then produce in a style of great magnificence. It would be impossible to give this superb work at the present prices; hence an advance must and will be made. We are persuaded that no legitimate admirer of Italian opera will object to it, whilst those who simply go there for curiosity will take no heed of the extra quarter or half dollar that is demanded of them. It should be remembered, too, that Mr. MARETZEK has been the last to think of making a change. All the other theatres in the City have quietly tacked on an extra twenty-five cents for reserved seats in the balcony circle, and we do not remember to have heard a single complaint on the subject. It has been paid cheerfully, the houses have been crowded to their greatest capacity, and the managers have reaped the full benefit of the advance, without, we are afraid, always having shared it with their companies. It is clearly Mr. MARETZEK's turn. Whoever wants opera must pay for it -- not extravagantly as in Europe, or in any proportion with other imported luxuries, but at a fair valuation, so that the manager may be able to fulfill all his duties to the public and to the company. The performance of ""Faust"" to-night is, therefore, the last of that opera at cheap prices -- the last, too, for many months. To-morrow the company appears at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, playing for the first and only time ""Robert le Diable."" The rest of the week will be set aside for benefits.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/94f1fc84-bc8a-504b-ac9f-970bdb65c3a1,1335,nyt://article/94f1fc84-bc8a-504b-ac9f-970bdb65c3a1,

WASHBURNE, lately on duty in the Department of the Gulf, has been appointed to the command of the Department of West Tennessee, in the stead of Gen. HURLBUT, who has been relieved and ordered to report by letter to the Adjutant-General at Washington. We trust and believe that this appointment will prove an excellent one. Gen. WASHBURNE has seen service in Tennessee before, and has an excellent repute both as a soldier and administrator. There is no secondary department which requires more eminent capacity and a more honorable character for its proper management than this. It is most tempting ground for the rebel Generals, both for such operations as those now being carried on by FORREST, and for larger movements such as have been threatened by Dr. POLK. Unless the rebels are driven entirely out of the department, they can give us great annoyance, and neutralize a very large body of our troops. Beside his important and difficult military duties, the Commander at Memphis has great labor of an administrative kind. In the first place, Tennessee is undergoing the process of political reorganization, which has been almost entirely baulked in the western section of the State by the everlasting irruptions of rebels. In the second place, Memphis is the seat and centre of the great speculative and cotton-trading operations on the Mississippi River, and a commander whose integrity is less than perfect is apt to become the tool of knaves. In the third place, the City of Memphis itself, which at the present time has a population of between thirty and forty thousand, is under military rule, and requires firm and just executive direction.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW COMMANDER FOR WEST TENNESSEE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW COMMANDER FOR WEST TENNESSEE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2d5ef47f-1876-502e-a8ac-c96bb7734b39,425,nyt://article/2d5ef47f-1876-502e-a8ac-c96bb7734b39,

For some years, Mr. SPENCE, and his co-laborers in the Anglo-rebel Press, have been picturing to an admiring public the gallant and heroic chivalry of the South struggling for independence, and the slave bound by a thousand ties of affection and respect to his patriarchal master. The aristocratic class of England and the polished circles of France have been appealed to for sympathy with ""the only aristocracy"" on the Western Continent. The North has been painted as sordid, vulgar and low-born; the South as chivalrous and noble.

The voice of the public, as expressed through the press, is now strongly in favor of the imposition of as heavy burdens as may be necessary to meet at least the larger portion of the public expenditure; but the indisposition of the House of Representatives to comply with this demand seems now fully as great as ever it was. The Tax Bill is postponed till the latter half of the session -- is introduced slowly and heavily, and apparently with much groaning and moaning; and when ready for action, it is made to stand aside for that most unprofitable of all occupations, the discussion of declamatory resolutions. Moreover, the rapid depreciation of the currency, involving as it inevitably does irretrievable injury to the public credit, and threatening us with national bankruptcy -- the calamity which we have all of us always most dreaded, which our enemies have steadily predicted, and on which they now most rely for our overthrow -- though it sends a thrill of alarm and anxiety throughout the entire country, seems to produce no more impression on Congress than a railroad accident or a Copperhead riot.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Congress-The People-Taxation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Congress-The People-Taxation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f4e280c3-09f3-54d1-b47b-7dd7c5322a52,914,nyt://article/f4e280c3-09f3-54d1-b47b-7dd7c5322a52,

The liberal subscriptions for the Government Ten-Forties, the heavy payments for duties at the Custom-house, the calling in of loans and the rapid contraction of the volume of circulating notes by the banks, all tended to increase the stringency in the money market and the panic in stocks and merchandise. At the various sessions of the Stock Boards, as well as in the open Street, stocks were thrown on the market unreservedly, and prices were depressed -- lightly on Government securities, but most fearfully on nearly the whole list of ""fancies."" Principals were mercilessly sacrificed by their brokers, margins wiped out, contracts repudiated, abusive epithets lustily interchanged, and some lively pugilistic exercise indulged in, much to the entertainment of disinterested and patriotic spectators of ""the slaughter of the innocents.""

The secret of this remarkable success consists in the fact that the officers of the Home determined at the outset to make their company the foremost undertaking in the nation -- to make it known, and trusted, and esteemed, and admired everywhere. And they have faithfully labored for the attainment of this end. They increased their capital from $500,000 to $1,000,000, and they found that the million capital would pay, and now they have increased it to two millions! When we state that during the year 1863 the Home received in premiums the sum of $1,286,000; that the dividends declared on its capital stock of $1,000,000 amounted to $100,000; that it has a gross surplus of $1,210,487 09, the intelligent reader perceives at once that its Directors were wise in trusting to the principle of doing business on a large and constantly increasing capital.

We now know that cannon are radical, and whatever stands in their way will be battered down. To-day we complete three years of this warfare.

They are both powerful plays, and when acted with anything like passion, are sure to excite the attention of the public. Mr. BOOTH was, we believe, the first to introduce the ""Marble Heart"" to an American audience, playing the principal role during his California engagement, and, by the popularity he obtained in it, sweeping all before him. The fanciful and interesting frame work of the play exhibits a remarkable amount of skill and imagination; the situations are frequently intense; the contrasts always effective, and the dialogue generally good and sharp. The character of Raphael affords a fine scope for Mr. BOOTH's powers. In its earlier phases of subdued, but consuming passion, and in the more painful culminations of frenzy and death, with which the piece terminates, it requires exactly the poetic earnestness and giddy grief that he infuses into it. The scene of the interview in the fourth act, and of his return home in the fifth, illustrate these extremes, and we can hardly recall better instances of the range and elevation of this admirable artist's style. It is a poor compliment to say that he is the best Raphael we have ever had in New-York; but it may serve the purpose of directing attention to what must be regarded as a very remarkable performance.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/806c79f1-b28e-5697-aff5-e71c71cbe911,507,nyt://article/806c79f1-b28e-5697-aff5-e71c71cbe911,

The Cap tain of the United States steamer Kearsage had adressed a letter to Lord CLANRICADE, denying that he had enlisted any British subjects, and remarking that his complement of men was always full, with a large number of idle American sailors in British ports ready to ship at any time. In the House of Commons, on the 8th, Mr. LAYARD said, in answer to a question, that the British Government was taking measures to investigate the alleged kidnapping of Irish emigrants into the service of the Federal Army. The particulars of the rebel cotton scheme are published. A large company has been formed with a capital of $1,000,000, to purchase steamers and run the blockade, for the purpose of bringing out cotton to redeem the rebel loan. COLLINS J. MCRAE is the rebel agent in the matter. The Financial Budget was announced in the House of Commons on the 7th, by Mr. GLADSTONE, and made a very favorable impression. The estimated expenditure for the past fiscal year was £68,283,000, but the actual expenditure was £67,056,000. GARIBALDI was still at the Isle of Wight, where he had been treated with the greatest consideration. The freedom of the City of London had been accorded to him, and on his arrival Lord PALMERSTON would entertain him at a banquet. The Danish war was being vigorously prosecuted by the Germans. On the 7th the Prussians opened a terrible bombardment on Duppel and Sonderborg, and it is stated that in the latter place 80 women and children were killed, they not having had notice to leave. The German steamer Rembrandt had been captured by a Danish man-of-war. The Conference would meet in London on the 13th. Another positive announcement was made that MAXIMILIAN's troubles were all settled, and that he would positively leave Trieste for Mexico on the 13th. A very valuable and fast blockade-runner, called the Matilda, had been lost at sea off Landy's Light.

It adds little or nothing to what we already know of Mexico, its main object being to explain and justify the Imperial policy with regard to that country. He undertakes to show that, in interfering in Mexican affairs, France, so far from being guilty of innovation, simply gives force and result to tendencies already existing. He maintains that the ""monarchical principle,"" as it is now the fashion of continental publicists to call it, so far from being extinct in Mexico, is the only one which retains much vitality, and that it has exercised a powerful influence on all Mexican revolutions. It raised ITURBIDE to the imperial throne; kept a strong party round his son FELIX after his own deposition, and led SANTA ANNA to try to induce some European prince to assume the crown. Having, to his own satisfaction, proved the existence of a desire for a monarchy, M. CHEVALIER next proceeds to prove its necessity, and he does this, of course, by simply dwelling on the failure of republican government.

This has been their game from the time MCCLELLAN was in command. The object is two-fold -- first to foment all the jealousy and ill-will possible between the army and the Government, and again to cast all the responsibility of military failure upon the Aministration, at the same time forestalling all credit to the Administration for military success. There never was such impudence as in the pertinacity with which this system of misrepresentation was maintained during the fifteen months of MCCLELLAN's leadership. Subsequent developments have shown that the Administration, during that period, never ceased to urge upon MCCLELLAN the extreme importance of the most vigorous action, and that it furnished every possible facility to that end; and yet these unscrupulous sheets Kept up an incessant clamor against the Administration for standing in the way for the triumphant march of the eager MCCLELLAN! Precisely as they abused the Administration for the delays of MCCLELLAN, they abused it for the advance and defeat of BURNSIDE at Fredericksburgh, not flagging in that abuse until that General, over his own signature, demonstrated that the Washington authorities were free from all blame in the premises. Upon no one subject has their vilification of the President expended itself more recklessly than upon his alleged interference with the plans of the Commanders of the Army of the Potomac. It is simply in keeping with this vile game that the World of yesterday says: ""By retaining Gen. HALLECK as his chief military adviser, and keeping Secretary STANTON at the head of the War Department, Mr. LINCOLN retained in his hands the means of quietly thwarting the new General-in-Chief whenever it should suit his purpose,"" and predicts that Gen.

Two organizations claim to be regular, and each warns the loyal public against being deceived by the other. The first query that occurs to us, in pondering this matter, is why the District of Columbia elects delegates to the National Convention at all. That Convention is expected to nominate a President, and to represent, in the selection of a candidate, the opinions and wishes of those whose votes are to elect him. There is to be a certain number of deligates for each State, or for each district of a State, that has votes to cast; and a majority of these delegates is to select a candidate whom all pledge their constituents to support. But the District of Columbia has no votes to cast for President. The wishes and preferences of the citizens of that District have no weight in the election of a President: why should they have in the nomination? They may prefer one man, while those whose votes are to decide the result prefer another.

He then proceeded to make a speech, in which he discussed the loyalty of the Border States; the absurdity of the Copperheads; the constitutionality of the admission of Western Virginia to the Union, and the circumstances attending that event; the extent to which the new State had contributed men to the army; the consequences that would have followed her failure or refusal to do so; and it was only at the close of his long speech, if we are to judge from the summary, that he found time and opportunity to say a few words upon the subject before the Senate. That ""these remarks were not particularly applicable to the bill under consideration,"" so far from being a matter of no great moment, as Mr. VAN WINKLE seems to think, did, in fact, render them peculiarly inappropriate; and the erroneous notions of the nature and objects of parliamentary discussion, which he seems to entertain, are so widespread, and are just now doing so much mischief, that we seize this opportunity of protesting against them. Congress is not a debating club, in which discussions are carried on for the sake of discussion. It is an assembly for the prosecution of serious and important business -- just now the most serious and important that was ever laid before any deliberative body. There are a great number of questions before it, all of them of the highest moment, and each of them, every time it comes up, demands the serious and undivided attention of every member present. This cannot be given, and will not be given, as long as anybody who has possession of the floor is permitted to make long, rambling speeches upon everything that comes into his head, except the subject that is legitimately before him. The waste of time which this practice causes, the restless, scatter-brained, indolent style of thinking which it inevitably produces, the extent to which it protracts the debates on every measure, are just now evils of the first magnitude, and something ought to be done to put an end to them. The practice itself is a legacy bequeathed to us by the old times -- for they are now old times -- before the war, when the one subject of discussion was Slavery -- and when everybody knew so well what everybody else would say about it, that it made little difference what he said, particularly as Congress had little else to do than to listen to him. As there was plenty time, and no other means of keeping himself before the public, every member felt it his duty to give, at least once in every session, a full history of the Slavery controversy from the foundation of the Government down to the year 1850; then to castigate his opponents severely, and finally to expose the immorality, cruelty and waste of slaveholding, ending with some caustic remarks upon the trouble and dismay that would be caused amongst the European aristocracies, by the prospective growth of the Republic.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Bunkum Speeches.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Bunkum Speeches.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4978bb3a-8e0c-559b-a4bd-674166251b79,868,nyt://article/4978bb3a-8e0c-559b-a4bd-674166251b79,

Magazines for April,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/23/archives/the-magazines.html,Magazines for April,"-- Harper's New Monthly Magazine, for May, makes its appearance in advance of the usual time, no doubt in kindly consideration for New-Yorkers, who, in obedience to immemorial custom, devote the first days of that month to pursuits far other than literary, and for ""moving incidents"" have no need to turn to the pages of history or fiction. It opens with an interesting sketch of ""Life with the Esquimaux,"" condensed from Mr. C.F. HALL's narrative of his ""Arctic Research Expedition"" for the recovery of Sir JOHN FRANKLIN, in 1860-62, about to be published by Messrs. HARPERS. The paper abounds with illustrations, of unusual merit, that depict nature in some of her wildest moods. The other matter-of-fact article is ""A Visit to the convent of Sittna, (Our Lady) Dameane,"" by Rev. G. LANSING, American Missionary at Cairo. The trip it records is entirely out of the usual beaten track of Egyptian travel. The convent is in the Delta, near the ancient city of Bulestes, and its patroness is identified by curious coincidences with the Goddess Latona, formerly worshipped there. With the exception of two short articles, ""The Second Division at Shiloh,"" and ""A Suppressed Princess,"" occupied with the claims of an English pretender to royal blood, the remainder of the number is entirely dedicated to fiction: TROLLOPE's ""Small House at Allington,"" and the second instalment of THACKERAY's post-humous story, ""Denis Duval,"" being the pieces de resistance, interspersed with several novelettes, mostly of American life, and an Italian sketch, of more pretensions, ""Psyche.""

Illustrations of Universal Progress; Cleveland, W. S. Hints to Riflemen","Mr. SPENCER occupies at this time a position entirely unique and exceptional among philosophical thinkers not only of England, but also of the people of English speech in the New World. A marked want of comprehensiveness and breadth of thought has been always alleged by continental writers as characteristic of English inquirers into the mysteries of nature. Each man has worked in the sphere of his selection, polishing some corner-stone of the Temple of Science, but unable or scarcely seeking to realize the grand ideas that dominate and define the all-embracing relations of the structure itself. This exclusive devotion to limited practical views, and actual shrinking from the generalizations that more brilliant geniuses might draw from them is deplored by some writers, as Dr. WHEWELL and others who have pointed out the positive benefits of theory and hypothesis, even if not the truth itself, yet as an arrangement and coordination of ascertained facts, lending support to each other, and leading, when studied in this light, to results that isolated observation could never attain. Mr. SPENCER, however, alone among his countrymen, belongs the distinction of aiming to grasp in one grand symmetrical arrangement the two worlds of Matter and Spirit. He proposes no less a task than to unfold a complete philosophy of nature, physical, organic, mental and social, such as science now, for the first time, made possible -- such as, if successfully executed, will constitute a momentous step in the progress of thought.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8311976a-6125-5eb5-8e40-00bc6790c58d,1214,nyt://article/8311976a-6125-5eb5-8e40-00bc6790c58d,

We have had, and have given, the evidence of eye-witnesses, the evidence of victims offered in their last moments, the evidence of persons who visited the scene of the butchery immediately after it, and we have had other evidence not less conclusive, such as the arrival at Cairo of some of the bodies, which bore upon them marks of the worst barbarities charged against the rebels. It now only requires the official statement of the officers appointed to investigate the matter, to furnish irrefragable proof for history. It was superserviceable labor on the part of any one to deny the massacre, in behalf of the rebels. JEFF. DAVIS officially proclaimed this to be his policy, and he was backed up in his ferocious proclamation by the whole rebel press. To deny that the rebels would carry out their measure is preposterous to the perception of all of us who know that, atrocious as rebel threats have been, their deeds have always been more bloody than their threats.

Soc.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/23/archives/a-metropolitan-art-gallery-the-bryan-donation-the-jarves-collection.html,"Bryan, Mr., Donation of his Picture Gallery to N. Y. Hist. Soc.","The surprise and delight exhibited by the thousands of all degrees, who have visited the Picture Gallery of the Metropolitan Fair, have suggested to many, for the first time, and renewed in other minds more emphatically, the need, desirableness and practicability of a permanent and free gallery of art in this City. The third metropolis of the civilized world should not longer be without such a benign provision for and promoter of high civilization. Within the last few years the advance of public taste and the increased recognition of art in this country, have been among the most interesting phenomena of the times. A score of eminent and original landscape painters have achieved the highest reputations, private collections of pictures have become a new social attraction, exhibitions of works of art have grown lucrative and popular, buildings expressly for studios have been erected, sales of pictures by auction have produced unprecedented sum-of money, art-shops are a delectable feature of Broadway, artist-receptions are favorite reunions of the Winter, and a splendid edifice will soon be completed devoted to the academy, and owing its erection to public munificence, while a School of Design is in successful operation at the Cooper Institute. Nor is this all; at Rome, Paris' Florence and Dusseldorf, as well as at Chicago, Albany, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Boston and New-York, there are native ateliers, schools or collections, the fame whereof has raised our national character and enhanced our intellectual resources as a people. These and many other facts indicate, too plainly to be mistaken, that the time has come to establish permanent and standard galleries of art, on the most liberal scale, in our large cities. Heretofore the absence of fire-proof buildings has prevented many Americans of wealth and taste from contributing to such institutions as include the Fine Arts in their objects. Only last week a fire occurred in Boston, whereby several invaluable historical portraits were destroyed, and the risk of such catastrophies deters prudential lovers of artistic treasures from indulging at once their public spirit and private taste, by presenting works of art to such institutions as already exist. No sooner did the New-York Historical Society possess a fire-proof edifice than valuable donations began there to accumulate; the Nineveh marbles, the Egyptian museum, the Audubon collections, portraits, statues and relics were gratefully confided to this secure and eligible institution. It was soon found inadequate as to space, and the late President, with some of the more enterprising members, obtained a charter from the Legislature for a museum of art and antiquities, to be erected in the Central Park, and open to the public, as are similar institutions in Europe, As a nucleus for the statuary department the casts from CRAWFORD's Roman studio are most appropriate and valuable; they are already stored in the old Arsenal. It has been proposed that a permanent collection of arms and trophies, such as have attracted such crowds of delighted visitors at the fair, should constitute another feature. But our present object is to call attention to the munificent donation of THOMAS J. BRYAN, of his rare and costly gallery of pictures to the New-York Historical Society. It numbers two hundred and fifty pictures, and is valued at one hundred thousand dollars. It is no casual gathering of odds and ends, such as may be brought together in any European capital by the mere expenditure of tasteless ambition. During many years of residence abroad, Mr. BRYAN collected, one after another, of these interesting works. To him it was a labor of love. At Paris he enjoyed signal advantages; and there are many exquisite specimens of the early French, Flemish and Italian schools in his gallery, such as are now not to be obtained at any price. As a collection it is remarkable for the number of small master-pieces -- those gems which the amateur loves to hang in library, boudoir and salon, and contemplate habitually, and with unsated relish. We remember pictures of TENIERS, RUYSDAEL, WALTCAN, WOUVERMAN, etc., which discover new charms the more they are studied; add to these the fine examplars of Italian masters, and several valuable historical portraits acquired in this country -- such as a WASHINGTON, by STUART, and PRIESTLEY, and JEFFERSON, by PEALE -- and its not easy to estimate the importance of such a collection as the basis of a Metropolitan gallery. We remember when Mr. BRYAN first brought his pictures to New-York, that a call upon him was like visiting a venerable burgomaster of Holland, or a merchant prince of Florence, in her palmy days. He had collected his treasures in the second story of a building corner of Broadway and Thirteenth-street; and seated there a vigilant and enamored custode, in an old arm-chair, with his snow-white hair, gazing round the walls covered with mellow tints, delicious figures vivid or picturesque landscapes -- chef d'oeuvres or pictorial art, hallowed and endeared by memorable names -- he seemed to belong to another sphere, and we to have wandered from Babel to Elysium in thus entering his gallery from bustling and garish Broadway. And now that he has bestowed these treasures on our City, let us appreciate the gift by making it the starting point of an enterprise worthy of a cultivated people in a prosperous republic. There is an essential element to every national gallery, and that the most difficult to supply; we mean a series of the earliest pictures down to the highest phase of the art in the fifteenth century -- in other words, a chronological series. By a remarkable coincidence one of our countrymen, through years of vigilant activity in Italy, succeeded in making such a collection at a cost of sixty-six thousand dollars. This collection is about to be broken up and sold piecemeal, unless it can be secured by the contributions of our citizens, to be added to Mr. BRYAN's splendid donation, whereby a complete and invaluable gallery would be formed. A committee of the Historical Society has been appointed to receive subscriptions, in order to accept the very generous offer of Mr. JARVES to present his collection to the institution provided it is relieved from a mortgage of twenty-five thousand dollars. We cannot doubt that a sum so insignificant compared to the value and importance or the acquisition, will be at once forthcoming when the project is made known to our wealthy and art-loving citizens. We subjoin the names and address of the committee:",,9,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A METROPOLITAN ART GALLERY.; The Bryan Donation The Jarves Collection.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A METROPOLITAN ART GALLERY.; The Bryan Donation The Jarves Collection.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Art', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f92b10fb-92f1-5723-a44d-65eb37c9f699,1247,nyt://article/f92b10fb-92f1-5723-a44d-65eb37c9f699,

It was fitting. It was, the day on which America paid homage to the memory of SHAKESPEARE, and sought to honor his genius and give tangible and permanent form to the demonstrations. Certain Dramatic circles had decided upon a monument, and yesterday being the three hundredth anniversary of his birth, was selected as the time on which to lay the corner stone. The design, it is supposed, will be intrusted to our accomplished countrywoman, Miss HOSMER; the desire is that the monument shall be purely American. The location given, and cordially given, by the Par[???] Commissioners, was at the southeast corner of the Ma[???]l, a most prominent and beautiful one. The hour designated for the ceremonies was 12 M., and at the moment they began. A not very large but indisputably a very elegant and intellectual audience was assembled; very many ladies, fair, beautiful and bright; the poet, the sculptor, the painter, the historian and the jurist, the ministers to the mind and those to the body; those famed and honored in the profession, which to the Bard of Avon owes so much, and those who seek fame and honor in it; critics of the keen yet just, generous pen; the journalist and the literateur -- some of all were there.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE SHAKESPEARE TERCENTENARY.; INTERESTING COMMEMORATIVE EXERCISES.

The object of this reduction appears at first sight to be, to offer a premium upon international trade. A closer examination shows it to be the very reverse. The purpose the new Ministry have in view is to divert as much as possible of the trade of the West from the ports of northern New-York to Montreal. The canal tolls are to operate hereafter differentially in favor of the St. Lawrence route. Thus, shippers in passing through the river canals will have the tax they paid on the Welland Canal refunded. The Oswego shipper, of course, loses the benefit of all this.

As an instance, we have the late painful case of accidental poisoning at Yorkville, to which reference is made in a communication from Dr. STUDLEY, published in another column. Here, the evidence went to show that a local apothecary, almost blind from old age, mistaking the text of a prescription, made up a dose of rank poison for a patient suffering from kidney disease. The patient swallowed what she supposed was the remedy prescribed by her medical attendant, and as a consequence, died in great agony a few hours afterwards. To find the cause of the unfortunate victim's death was not difficult; to determine justly the measure of blame which belonged respectively to the apothecary and the practitioner, might have puzzled other tribunals. The Yorkville inquest seems to have reached the ends of justice by a quick and almost supernatural sagaciousness. The verdict, as it came from Coroner COLLIN's jury, deserves to be put on permanent record for future reference.

Rev. JOSEPH HOLDICH, D.D., one of the Secretaries of the Parent Society, presided; the devotional services were conducted by Rev. ALBERT S. HUNT, of the First-place M.E. Church, Brooklyn; an excellent report, prepared by the Secretary, Mrs. Dr. OLIN, was read; and addresses were delivered by Rev. WM. ADAMS, D.D., of this City, and Rev. WM. J.R. TAYLOR, D.D., one of the Secretaries of the American Bible Society. The exercises throughout were of an exceedingly instructive and interesting character. The receipts of the society for the year amounted to $6,877 97; of which $4,659 64 was appropriated for the support of Bible-readers; and the remainder was paid over to the Parent Institution; for Bible distribution, $885 24; and as a donation, $1,333 68. The character and the benevolent design of this noble association may be seen from the following extracts from the annual report: ""Having added to the work of collecting money, the personal oversight of its distribution, we can follow our Bibles, not only in imagination to the far off nations crying for help, but to the crowded tenement houses of our own City, where the sight of the eyes affects the heart. The monthly reports of our Bible-women, now twenty-seven in number, give us the 'Missing Link' to these homes of poverty and privation. We see them brighten under the influence of patient, persistent effort; neglected children, with newly-awakened ideas of order and neatness, learning to make the garments purchased by their own industry and economy; weary spirits strengthened, and darkened minds illumined by the entrance of God's Word. Visits are made to forlorn ones, overlooked even by the comprehensive sweep of our benevolent societies; and we trust that the records of eternity will bear the names of many ransomed ones, who have gained their heavenly home through the helping hands we have been enabled to extend to them."" The report throughout is exceedingly able and interesting, and will amply repay a careful perusal. No person can read it without devout gratitude to God for raising up an institution of this kind in the heart of this great Metropolis. It contains an eloquent appeal to all the friends of the Bible to aid in the work. Affecting incidents are stated, which give a vivid idea of the work of the Bible reader. The report concludes in this wise: ""We send light-bearers into the darkest places, and seek to help those for whose aid no hand is stretched out. We need increased means for the work; and we appeal with confidence to the great heart of the public to aid us in supporting and enlarging it."" The officers of the society are: Mrs. David Codwise, First Directress; Mrs. Wm. B. Astor, Second Directress; Mrs. James Brown, Third Directress; Miss Cornelia L. Westerlo, Recording Secretary; Mrs. Dr. Olin, Corresponding Secretary and Mr. Jacob Le Roy.

The London Conference on Danish Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/24/archives/the-london-conference-on-the-danish-question.html,The London Conference on Danish Question,"The conference for the settlement of the Dano-German imbroglio is now sitting in London. It is composed of the representatives of all those Powers which were parties to the Treaty of May, 1852. But it Federal Germany also is not represented there, what does this conference resemble, save the play of ""Hamlet"" with the Prince of Denmark omitted? The Treaty of 1852 was of little more validity than so much waste paper, because the Federal Diet refused to sanction its provisions; and if that Diet declines to participate in the debates or the decisions of the present conference, how can the diplomats effect the object which they have in view? Prussia and Austria are indeed members of the conference, and may make what concessions they please, but it is the Teutonic Confederation which is the real respondent in the pending case, and without its assent no compromise on the part of the Cabinets of Vienna and Berlin can avail. The note of M. DROUYN DE LHUYS to the French Ambassador in London, explanatory to the position which France meant to take in the Conference, shows very plainly that the Emperor, was fully aware of the existence of this difficulty, and intended to obviate it, if possible. Notwithstanding the alleged revival of the entente cordiale between the allied Governments, it would appear that NAPOLEON has no notion of making the Treat of '52 the basis of operations. Were all the other Sovereigns disposed to respect the provisions of this instrument, the mere inspiration of His Majesty's traditional sympathies with Denmark would, of course constrain him to do likewise. But ""in presence of the diversity of opinions which exists touching the validity of that treaty,"" it becomes his duty ""to examine the interests concerned in the war, without preoccupying himself exclusively with the letter of said convention."" In other words, the Emperor proposes to throw the obnoxious treaty overboard, and to substitute ""the wish of the populations as the basis"" of action. He would take the business completely out of the hands of the diplomatists who have so sadly mismanaged it heretofore, and would consign its settlement to the ballot-box and the Schleswig-Holsteiners. Now, this mode of disposing of the question will certainly not meet with much favor from Prussia, Austria, Denmark or England. The two former Powers will oppose its adoption, since it would establish a precedent which, if followed in their non-German provinces, would prove fatal to absolutism. While the two latter will be equally averse to it, because that, under present circumstances, it would inevitably lead to the dismemberment of the Danish monarchy. But the scheme has been tried in Italy with the sanction of England, and has succeeded there; why then should it not be alike applicable, and alike successful, in the Danish Duchies? In no other way can the objections of the Germanic Confederation be obviated, and in no other way can the parties most interested -- the Schleswig-Holsteiners themselves -- be conciliated. The impossibility, therefore, of arriving at a satisfactory arrangement diplomatically, may contribute to overcome the opposition to the Napoleonic suggestion, and to secure its author a triumph at the expense of England. The protest of the Holstein estates against the anticipated encroachment of the Conference on the rights of the Duchies and of the Prince of Augustenburg, will likewise operate not a little in favor of the Emperor's proposition, by reminding the Plenipotentiaries that the popular voice cannot be safely disregarded.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The London Conference on the Danish Question.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The London Conference on the Danish Question.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e593a475-6c32-5777-8926-00d23c13c1ca,663,nyt://article/e593a475-6c32-5777-8926-00d23c13c1ca,

HUNTER came to a sudden and gratifying, but not an unexpected, termination on Saturday. Its close was as extraordinary as its origin and progress. It grew out of the fact that two checks, one for $5,200, and the other for about $700, signed J.W. HUNTER, were presented and paid at the office of Mr. CISCO, the Assistant Treasurer, and the money not paid over to the Government. When the fraud was discovered, some days afterwards, Mr. HUNTER, on seeing the checks, pronounced them forgeries. The District-Attorney, however, took the very unusual step of making an affidavit, accusing Mr. HUNTER of having drawn them fraudulently, and appropriated the money to his own use. On this affidavit Mr. HUNTER was arrested. The District Attorney associated with him Messrs. O'CONOR and GERARD, two of the most eminent counsel in the City, to aid him in the prosecution. Mr. CISCO, sworn as a witness, testified in the most positive and peremptory manner that the signatures were genuine, -- that he was not and could not be mistaken, -- that Mr. HUNTER's denial, under oath, would have no weight with him, and that if any person should turn State's evidence and swear that he himself signed Mr. HUNTER's name, he would not believe him.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CLOSE OF THE HUNTER CASE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CLOSE OF THE HUNTER CASE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/44363ffc-cadc-581f-b3e8-130e04a8a838,467,nyt://article/44363ffc-cadc-581f-b3e8-130e04a8a838,

Re d' Italia; American built Italian frigate,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/25/archives/an-americanbuilt-ironclad-on-the-high-seas-the-re-ditalia.html,Re d' Italia; American built Italian frigate,"After the many unsuccessful attempts of European iron-clad vessels to encounter the rough ocean weather, we were scarcely prepared to hear of so triumphant a success for an American-built cuirassed ship, as has signalized the late voyage of the frigate Re d'Italia. In a letter from an officer on board, which we published yesterday, most reliable testimony was given as to her great sea-going qualities. Her whole passage from New-York to Naples seems to have been beset by weather that tested to the fullest degree her speed and strength. With a wind, and in a sea which has always caused the English and French iron-clads to roll and plunge to a degree that threatened their instant destruction, the Re d'Italia sailed pleasantly along, not only without apprehension of danger, but with an amount of comfort to her crew, and an avoidance of the disagreeable vicissitudes of a mid-Winter Atlantic voyage, known only to the larger class of steamships. She seemed, as this officer expresses it, ""rather a yacht sailing with a fair breeze, than such a monster ironclad of over 6,000 tons burden."" And, although it is rare for ships of any kind to encounter such weather without leaking, it appears that during this whole long, stormy passage she took in no water, and there was no use whatever made of the pumps. This is the strongest evidence possible of her great and sufficient strength, and places her at once and indisputably far in advance of all other wholly iron-clad ships that have been hitherto tested. Her speed is also very satisfactory. Indeed, it would have done credit to any war-steamer, or even a first-class passenger-steamer, to perform the voyage from New-York to Gibraltar -- a distance of three thousand five hundred miles -- in fourteen days and twenty hours. From Gibraltar to Naples she averaged thirteen miles an hour, and at times, during the voyage across the Atlantic, she moved, with steam and, sail, at the rate of fifteen miles an hour.

In addition to the accounts we have already published, we give in this issue a concise statement from our New-Orleans correspondent. There were three days' fighting of varied character and magnitude, and each of them with strikingly different results. The first day (the 7th inst.) there was only heavy cavalry skirmishing, such as generally occurs when two hostile armies are approaching each other; and our horsemen whipped the enemy handsomely after a stiff fight, and chased them far from the field. The next day, other portions of our troops having joined the advance, they attacked the enemy again, and fought till two o'clock, about which time another portion of Gen. BANKS' army came up and took part in the struggle. Gen. BANKS himself now arrived on the field, and dispatched an order to Gen. FRANKLIN to bring forward his command. Fighting had been going on with great fury for three hours, when FRANKLIN, in person, came up, and took part in the battle. But things were continuing to go against us, when EMORY'S division of FRANKLIN's corps, also in its turn joined the previously mentioned bodies, and the battle raged until night closed in upon them all. But we had lost very heavily in officers and men, very heavily in artillery, and had lost the field. The morning of the third day Gen. BANKS had fallen back to Pleasant Hill, where Gen. ANDREW JACKSON SMITH, the hero of Fort De Russey, had arrived with his troops. An excellent disposition of our forces was now effected, and when the rebels advanced to the attack, and fell upon our lines, they were met with courage and intelligence, but continued to push our advance until they reached nearly the summit of a hill behind which SMITH was posted, when suddenly and unexpectedly he sprang up with his whole force, poured a tremendous volley with artillery and musketry into their lines, and this was quickly followed by a charge which drove the whole rebel force in rout. Having effected this sanguinary success, our army fell back to the line of the Red River, and took up position at Grand Ecore, near Natchitoches.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Three Days' Fighting on the Red River."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Three Days' Fighting on the Red River."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Red River', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e3e70e7c-4d46-58a7-95f1-4ad97c7dd73d,807,nyt://article/e3e70e7c-4d46-58a7-95f1-4ad97c7dd73d,

It was soon found that the majority of the merchants never made their appearance before noon, and that the bulk of the sales of produce effected on the floor were made in the half hour immediately preceding the formal adjournment or each day's meeting. Several merchants have of late been in the habit of lingering on the floor, for a quarter to half an hour alter the last whacking of the sonorous gong, protracting business hours to 1 1/2 o'clock, and not infrequently to 1 3/4 o'clock P.M., leaving only from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half to ""bolt down"" what is oddly called ""lunch,"" to write letters for the early afternoon mails, and to finish up banking and other incidental details of business. It has also been found that a reform in this matter was imperatively called for; that Change should be adjourned earlier, and that there was no valid reason why all sales and purchases of produce could not be made before, as well as after the hour of noon. Memorials have been in circulation for some days past, urging the directors of the institution to open the doors punctually each forenoon at ten o'clock, and close them promptly at twelve o'clock, midday. These memorials have been very extensively signed by the produce merchants. Including nearly all the leading receivers of breadstuffs, provisions, &c., and the great majority of the regular purchasers for home use and shipment. It is obvious that the contemplated change is generally approved of, and it is believed that, in response to the memorials of their subscribers, the Directors of the Produce Exchange will decide to inaugurate the reform with the incoming month of May.

They took care that, as far as possible, each of these little operations should be a success, and, indeed, they made extravagant exertions to secure success to all of their outpost operations, whether acting on the offensive or defensive. We recall this fact for the purpose of adding to it another one -- that the rebels have of late set on foot several small, dashing, and unfortunately successful operations analogous to those of last year, both in the East and in the West.

He states the bare fact honestly and plainly. There can be no issue on the subject, and we shall not provoke one by a useless discussion. Mr. MARETZEK's record is clear. He has given us opera cheaper and better than any other manager. With opportunities that may never be equaled of raising the prices, he has steadily refused to do so. Who doubts for a moment that he could have made a marked increase in the rates of admission when he first came from Havana? We had been plodding through a series of brief seasons with the meanest of resources; had heard ad nauseam, the oldest of operas. He came with a double company -- a company so admirable, be it observed, that it has swept away every fragment of opposition -- and a new repertoire. Either we paid too much for the old prices or too little for the new. Which was it? There can be no doubt on the subject, unless indeed, we freely admit that we pay top little for any kind of a company. The present advance will not place Mr. MARETZEK in a better pecuniary position than the meanest of his predecessors. It is the child of necessity; the offspring of a monetary moment where to hesitate is to be lost. Without it the opera must be suspended; with it there is a possibility of going on until a further advance is rendered imperative. This is the state of the case. We are persuaded that no true lover of music will breathe a word of objection to the course taken by Mr. MARETZEK. If he were to double the rates of admission he would still offer us a cheaper entertainment than can be found either in Paris or London.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7d5037d9-4718-54f4-8dc1-5bdd264402cb,379,nyt://article/7d5037d9-4718-54f4-8dc1-5bdd264402cb,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/28/archives/the-shakespeare-monument-the-way-to-expedite-its-erection.html,,"There has been no little regret evinced in regard to the manner in which the preliminary acts for the laying of the corner-stone of the Shakespeare Mounment, on last Saturday, were committed or omitted. Mr. HACKETT, who for so many, ever so many, years has made us laugh at Falstaff and love sack, had, as is understood, charge of the matter. While he is en-titled to the utmost credit for the active and zealous part he has taken, yet there seems to have been a lack of consideration as to preliminaries, and an unfortunate exclusiveness and haste in regard to them. SHAKESPEARE belongs to all the dramatic world, and so belongs he equally to all the literary. He is of the other quite as much as he is of the one; and in this contemplated tribute to him, the feelings, interest and enthusiasm of both should have been enlisted. Instead of that, the one was only partially consulted and invited, and the other not only was not consulted or invited, but was, if information be correct, purposely ignored. Now this is not referred to in any other than a suggestive war. As above stated, Mr. HACKETT deserves the utmost credit; but errors will occur ""in the best regulated families."" Had there been an appeal to all the dramatic and literary world hereabouts, had their joint interests been enlisted, had their joint enthusiasm been aroused, we have no doubt that, instead of a gathering of some two hundred at the Central Park on Saturday last, there would have been as many thousands; and that, instead of the laying of the corner-stone with the prospect that it will stay laid and unsurmounted during the present generation, there would have been the certainty that in a short time the funds would be ample for the rearing and the rearing perfected or a structure worthy of the genius it was intended to honor. As the matter stands now, isolated from the general interest of the two circles which should feel most interested in it, it looks as though the corner-stone was destined to be a buried fact, and the monument a myth. Messrs. WHEATLEY, WALLACK, HOYM and BARNUM, who have equal share with any in the honor of the movement, have most generously responded to the appeal for the fund; they should not be asked to do more and yet the munificent sums they have given would scarce raise a monument beyond Falstaff's shoulders. Now the suggestion is, that this matter be made not an exclusive but a general one. In the dramatic circles there is not one from him who nervously hurries on to tell ""My Lord, the carriage waits,"" to him who suppositiously lords it in the carriage, who would not give his mite if he felt he was desired or expected to do so. Nor is there one in the literary, (and art circles, too, we imagine,) whether renowned or no, who would not do likewise. That neither have been taken into proper consideration, inconsiderately, we believe, seems to be true. But all can be remedied, and the monument can be made a fact, if only it be chosen that it shall. Entertainments could be gotten up which would swell the funds beyond fund-swelling precedents, and the Treasurer, whoever he may be, no one knows yet, would soon be plethoric with the means for the proposed object. These are mere hints, which are believed to be worthy of note. But it is unjust to expect any one man to carry a monument upon his back, and it is no refection upon the will, strength or endurance of Mr. HACKETT, to believe that he will entirely fail if he attempts to.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SHAKESPEARE MONUMENT; The Way to Expedite Its Erection.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SHAKESPEARE MONUMENT; The Way to Expedite Its Erection.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/10d52a28-8206-5785-9d7c-dcf6a3e877bb,619,nyt://article/10d52a28-8206-5785-9d7c-dcf6a3e877bb,

GARIBALDI had entered London, and had been received with great pomp and considertion by both nobility and people. He had been entertained by the Duke of Sutherland, had called on Lord PALMERSTON, and was soon to dine with him. In the British House of Lords the Government had been defeated on an unimportant question. The Conference on the Danish question had not yet met, and the opponents of the Government were predicting no favorable results from it. The siege of Duppel was progressing slowly. Several assaults had been made by the Prussians, in which the Danes claim to have repulsed them. The allies, however, assert that some of the Duppel batteries are silent, and that the Danes are preparing to evacuate the intrenchments. MAXIMILIAN had received the Mexican Deputation at Miramar, and in a speech accepting the Mexican Crown expressed his belief that the tender of the sceptre of Mexico was by the wish of an over-ruling majority of its people.

We are, therefore, still far from doubting our ability to pay all we now owe and a great deal more, if the National Legislature only displays common sense, and even third-rate business capacity. But if anything could lead us to fear a financial crash it would be such bits of legislation as the resolutions adding fifty per cent. to the import duties for sixty days, without even two days' notice to the public. There is hardly a single rule of taxation which this does not violate. There is a suddenness and capriciousness about it, which entitles it rather to be classed amongst the means of raising revenue resorted to by Turkish Pachas than those of an enlightened Constitutional Government. It deranges the whole course of foreign trade, without the slightest warning; destroys the calculations of all those who have already sent their orders abroad, as well as of those who have cargoes on the way home; fills the minds of home dealers with confusion and uncertainty as to the stock they have on hand; leaves them totally unable to decide what they had better ask for it, or when, or on what terms they can renew it; and what is worse than all this, it fills the whole community with apprehension and doubt about the future -a feeling which does more than any other to paralyze industry; for there is no telling what freak a body which has been guilty of this one will be guilty of next.

"There was a considerable muster of the leading men of the trotting turf at the Union yesterday, perhaps the large majority of whom were far more interested in ascertaining the form of the equine candidates than any direct interest in the trot for the purse of $60.

This deficiency of transportation facilities is attributed to the withdrawal of a large number of coal-barges from regular traffic for the use of the Government, and the scarcity of labor, which prevents the railroad companies from obtaining an adequate supply of engines and cars, to meet the increased and increasing demands of railway traffic.

"WINTER GARDEN. -- Miss AVONIA JONES is not fortunate in the selection of her pieces. Her ambition is creditable in itself, but it soars in so murky a sphere that it is productive of no result. Plays like ""Judith"" and the ""Sorceress"" cannot elevate her to any position in art. Indeed, they are so infinitely beneath her powers that we are compelled to ignore their existence when speaking of her merits. The ""Sorceress"" produced here on Tuesday evening is probably from the French. The question of its paternity is of no importance. It is -- so far as Miss JONES is concerned -- essentially a bad piece. The role of the Sorceress is long-winded, verbose and monotonous. It has no relief. From the opening to the close it presents nothing but words. There is but one phase of emotion -- maternal solicitude -- and but one passion -- revenge. Properly handled, these grand elements of human life and struggle might be made effective; but they are not properly handled. They are word-drawn to the uttermost tenacity of human patience. If a good sentence occurs it is immediately marred by a dozen sentences that are bad. In two words, the play is duil, and the leading part monotonous. We shall, therefore, ignore in a great measure its existence, and repeat our praises of Miss JONES despite the adverse circumstances that surrounded her performance. The lady has unquestionable talent. Her appearance is pleasing, her bearing self-possessed and easy, her style well-disciplined, if not large. The discipline, to be sure, has to some extent been in a wrong school, but it is still discipline, and teaches her the absolute proprieties of the stage. Better than this meagre catalogue of merit is the fact that Miss JONES is thoroughly intelligent, and invariably makes more of the part intrusted to her care than the author contemplated in writing it -- otherwise how wretched would have been her fate. In the ""Sorceress,"" she saves herself by voice and discretion. There are so many speeches to deliver, that any enexpected burst of passion is out of the question. It is praise, therefore, to say that she succeeds in making little culminations in all these very little speeches, and leaves us with a better opinion of her powers than before they were uttered. The piece succeeded last night by reason of Miss Jones' excellent performance, and because there are two or three scenic situations of great potency with the audience, although of little relative value to the play.

The piece succeeded last night by reason of Miss Jones' excellent performance, and because there are two or three scenic situations of great potency with the audience, although of little relative value to the play. The scenery and dresses, we may add, were very good -- although in the working of the former there were many misnaps.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d1ef7cdf-7154-5d06-9576-faea4a927b2b,794,nyt://article/d1ef7cdf-7154-5d06-9576-faea4a927b2b,
"American Journal of Science and Arts; McWhorter, G. C. Church Essays",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/28/archives/new-books-the-american-journal-of-science-and-arts-may-1864.html,"American Journal of Science and Arts; McWhorter, G. C. Church Essays","The May number of this standard periodical contains an unusual amount of interesting and valuable scientific intelligence. The different papers are quite brief -- and while there is, therefore, a greater variety of subjects discussed, the topics are in general of a popular nature. The leading article is a translation by Baron OSTEN SACKEN, of a lecture on the ""Diptera, or Two-winged Insects of the Amber Fauna,"" delivered some months since at a meeting of the German naturalists in Koenigsberg, by Director LOEW. Herr LOEW sums up hastily in this lecture the results of seventeen years labor in this fascinating field of scientific research, during which time no less than 850 species of Diptera in amber have passed under inspection. It is noted as a remarkable fact that all these specimens belong to the division of the Diptera proboscidea, while, so far, not a single species of the Diptera eproboscidea has been found to occur. Of these 850 species, however, there are only 656 in so complete a state of preservation that their specific characters can be determined with absolute certainty. These are distributed over 101 genera, of which 50, with 395 species, belong to the Diptera nemocera, and 51, with 261 species, to the Diptera brachycera. In the case of the latter, Director LOEW remarks that the chemical decomposition of their larger bodies, the more vigorous resistance which they have made to their entombment in the yet soft resin, the slighter development of their antennae and legs, (organs which furnish such important characters for the ready distinction of the Diptera nemocera.) and still more, the few characteristics points in the neuration of the wings in most of them, for the distinction of species, of genera, and even of famines, all conspire to render the proportion of fragments quite useless for exact determination much greater among the Diptera brachycera than among the Diptera nemocera. If such specimens could be turned to account, the above-mentioned proportion of species would be greatly increased on the side of Diptera brachycera. While the conclusions at which Director LOEW arrives in this article are of high scientific value, the manner in which be discusses the subject gives it a really romantic interest. Prof. H.A. NEWTON, of Yale College, submits the first part of an elaborate paper upon ""The Original Accounts of the Displays in former times of the November Star-Shower; together with a Determination of the Length of its Cycle, its Annual Period, and the Probable Orbit of the Group of Bodies around the Sun."" A number of curious translations, from ancient writers describing these phenomena as far back as A.D. 902 are given. Mr. JAMES D. WHELPLEY, of Boston, in a letter to Prof. SILLIMAN, which finds a place in the Journal, gives a description of a new process for preparing quartzose ores of gold for amalgamation. The hardest copper ores of Vermont and the quartz of Nova Scotia have been ground in the pulverizing mills described by Mr. WHELPLEY. Among the other papers are contributions to chemistry from the Lawrence Scientific School and from the Sheffield Laboratory of Yale College; a summary of MEISSNER's Researches on Oxygen, Ozone and Antozone; a discussion of Glacial Action about Penobscot Bay, by Dr. LASKI; a description of the Cretaceous and Superior Formations of West Tennessee, by JAMES M. SAEFORD, of Lebanon, and an account of the Influence of Ozone and some other Chemical Agents on Germination and Vegetation. The summary of scientific intelligence is even fuller and more satisfactory than usual, and in every respect the May number of the Journal is the best that we have had for months.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND ARTS.

"West, the Glorious Patriotism of the",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/04/29/archives/the-glorious-patriotism-of-the-west.html,"West, the Glorious Patriotism of the","The offer of the Governors of the Western and Northwestern States of a large number of men according to report, one hundred thousand to man the Union garrisons and forts, thus freeing for service an important force of veterans, is one of the most inspiriting events of this war. When one remembers that for three years these States have been pouring forth men with lavish hand, in communities where every man is of especial value -- Illinois alone having sent forth more volunteers, in proportion to her population, than any other State of the Union; and Illinois and Indiana having put into the field an army as large as that of a first-class European Power; and when we recall that at this season of the year every man is needed, and can hardly be spared, for the tilling of the ground, we shall appreciate the patriotism of this offer. A hundred thousand men taken from the West and Northwest now, are so many men withdrawn directly from the Spring labors of the farm. As almost every one either own farms or labor on them, they will in fact leave their plow in the furrow, even as last Summer in Indiana they left their ""reapers"" on the wheat-field. It is not only wealth but the very source of wealth, which these States thus offer to their country. Three years of weary war, defeats and disaster, incompetent Generals and blundering policy, have not in the least cooled the fire of the Western patriotism. The people are as determined as they were when the first Western soldiers occupied Cairo, that one Government, founded on Liberty, shall reach from Maine to the Gulf. For they belong especially to that vigorous race, who, having once undertaken a thing and set their will upon it, have it not in them to turn back, but, on the contrary, are inspired and spurred on by obstacles and delays.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Glorious Patriotism of the West.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Glorious Patriotism of the West.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WEST', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-04-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/914fda14-e9ed-5db8-bf22-411660726b31,956,nyt://article/914fda14-e9ed-5db8-bf22-411660726b31,

The officers lost nearly all their clothing, and were compelled to endure great hardships until their arrival at Terceira, which was thirty-eight days after their departure from this port. Capt. ISOLA endeavored to return to New-York, but, after a vain effort, was obliged to make for Terceira. Capt. ISOLA further states that he hailed an American ship while his vessel was in distress, and asked for assistance, which was refused. The Star of the West, to which Capt. ISOLA probably refers, failed to afford the assistance asked for simply because the storm prevailing at the time made it utterly impossible for her to communicate with the frigate.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-04-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cb537a0c-8394-5408-b994-f542c39ed778,899,nyt://article/cb537a0c-8394-5408-b994-f542c39ed778,

Trade-marks","Henry H. Sterling vs. Edward Kendall and Robert Kellam. -- This was a motion to dissolve an injunction in the above case. Dr. Sterling, the proprietor of an article to promote the growth of the hair on bald heads, obtained an injunction against the proprietors of another article of the same nature, called Kendall's Amboline. The matter in controversy is mainly the right to use the portrait of a longhaired lady as a trade-mark. On the part of the defendants making the motion, it was shown that Sterling's Ambrosia never could have made the lady's hair grow to such a preternatural length, and an affidavit was read from a postmaster in the land of steady habits, who swore that he had known the lady in question in former times; that her hair had always been unusually long, but it was the natural growth of her head and not produced by the use of any lotion; that Kendall had an equal right to use her portrait for his ""Amboline;"" that it was common practices to use such pictures. All charges of fraud against Mr. Kendall was withdrawn, and the question turned upon the similitude of the trade-marks. On the part of Dr. Sterling affidavits were produced, from both Mrs. Brown and her son, showing that her hair had been short and thin, but that in 1858, she had been presented by her brother with some of Sterling's Ambrosia, which had caused her hair to grow to a great length, that after this she had been on exhibition at Barnum's Museum as a curiosity, and that her portrait was used as the disputed trade-mark. The court said that to maintain the injunction the case must be a clear one; that it would come on for trial soon on the merits, and that, therefore, the injunction must be dissolved.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Trade-Marks The Injunction Against Kendall's Amboline Dissolved.; SUPREME COURT SPECIAL TERM.
