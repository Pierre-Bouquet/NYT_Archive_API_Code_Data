for Half a Million Men,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/01/archives/the-draft-for-half-a-million-of-men.html,for Half a Million Men,"An Executive order, published to-day, fixes the long-delayed draft for the 10th of March. It also carries the number for which the drawing will be made from three hundred thousand men, which was the number called for last October, up to Half a Million. Against this number, however, will be credited all who may have enlisted or been drafted prior to the 1st of March and have not been credited to other calls. We have no data regarding the number that is thus to be subtracted from the 500,000, and can, of course, form no precise estimate how many may enlist during the month of grace yet remaining. We are thus left in doubt as to the exact number that will need to be drafted; but as volunteering has been quite brisk and gives promise of being so, a very handsome subtrahend should appear. There is reason to believe that the number needed will not go over three hundred thousand men.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Draft for Half a Million of Men.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Draft for Half a Million of Men.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/01fd9ea5-cd15-5ab4-b473-dad75329e1e0,561,nyt://article/01fd9ea5-cd15-5ab4-b473-dad75329e1e0,

Temper of the Public regarding the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/01/archives/the-public-temper-regarding-the-war.html,Temper of the Public regarding the War,"In estimating the value of public judgments on a great and complex question, such as the prospects of the war, it is, perhaps, worth while bearing in mind that these judgments are partly controlled by a principle belonging rather to the mind itself than to the circle of facts which enter into the given problem. We mean that remarkable law of oscillation by which any strongly marked tendency of popular opinion is sure in time to be brought round and given a direction diametrically opposite. Of this principle, the present changing, if not changed tone of public sentiment in regard to the war affords a striking illustration. For several months past, and up almost to the present hour, the dominant mood of the public mind has been pitched in the upper keys of confidence and hope. Men read the future all bright. If the rebellion was not absolutely crushed, it must crumble at the grand blow our armies were preparing to deal it in the Spring. Beyond that period few extended their anticipations of active operations in the field; and, as the imagination loves to fasten on special points of prophecy, it was currently accepted that the Fourth of July would see the war at an end.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Public Temper Regarding the War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Public Temper Regarding the War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84613c7d-9adc-5787-8ba2-15d0d8dec1c2,1151,nyt://article/84613c7d-9adc-5787-8ba2-15d0d8dec1c2,

History of Christian Doctrine","In any case, this elaborate work would deserve notice as being the first attempt in English literature to write an account of the gradual Construction of all the doctrines of the Chris- tian religion. That a subject of this nature should so long have awaited a historiographer is remarkable; that it is now satisfactorily filled by an American author is another proof of the energy and vigor with which our scholars are addressing themselves to new fields of inquiry, where the harvest of a virgin soil is to be reaped. How powerful is this tendency a glance at some of the books published within a short time will prove, and our libraries are every day increasing by the presence of original works from native authors, that take immediate rank as standard authorities on their respective subjects. Dr. SHEDD's book is a favorable specimen of this class. It is the result of several years devoted to the study while the author hold the professorship of Ecclesiastical History in the Theological Seminary at Andover, Mass. Rich as English literature is in historical works, it is the history of events that has had the greatest attraction for writers. The history of ideas and opinions -- the main springs of action and precursors of events -- is almost a blank, and waits for illustration from minds of a less practical and more speculative cast than are usually met with among the literati of England. Finding no models existing for his work. Dr. SHEDD was compelled to originate his own method of treatment, so that it is in every respect an original production, and no doubt gains in unity and symmetry from this fact. The plan he adopted is to take up separately each grand doctrine of the orthodox Christian belief by itself, investigating the first beginnings of c[???]tific reflection upon it, and following down to the latest and most developed form of statement that it has received. After an introduction on ""Methodoxy,"" as including the idea and definition of history, and a specification of the system followed in the work, Book I. discusses the ""Influence of Philosophical Systems upon the Construction of Christian Doctrine."" In it the course of free Philosophic thought is surveyed from the prevalence of Platonism and Aristotlelianism through the Mystics and the Scholastic divines of the Middle Ages to the English and American Theologies of the Nineteenth Century, and the recent Philosophic movements of the German mind, Book II. is a ""History of Apologies,"" and reviews the Defences of Christianity, called forth by the changing circumstances of Pagan, Mediaeval and Modern times. In the succeeding Books -- III., IV., V., VI. -- are considered the cardinal doctrines of Christianity, as ""Theology""' proper, or the doctrine of the Divine Existence, in its various manifestations, including ""Christology,"" ""Anthropology,"" or the relations of Man to the Divine,"" Sotenology,"" the doctrine of Atonement, Justification. &c., and ""Eschalology,"" the doctrine of final things, the winding up of the great drama of human existence.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PUBLICATIONS.; A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE.

Twelve years have now elapsed since he was hurried off from that same legislative hall, with a felon's guard, in a felon's van, to a felon's prison, as were two hundred other representatives of the people. Since that memorable night, Parliamentary eloquence has lain dead in France -- buried forever, it seemed, from the hearing of men. There has, indeed, been a so-called legislative body still holding a place in the upper air -- but it has been a mere automaton, without a vestige of personal volition, and used simply to register decrees. It was as impossible for that Assembly to discuss political affairs with free-doom, as for the press itself. But within the last year, the Emperor has been moved by the threatening aspect of liberal opinion throughout Europe, or some other cause, to concede a certain range of utterance; and the Parisian people have shown their appreciation of the privilege by sending to the new Assembly several of their most effective orators. Now, for the first time, under Napoleon III., mind is reinstated in that Parliament hall, with some freedom to use its powers. The world of mind everywhere is watching the effect with keen interest. Can the sheer brute strength which has been controlling France during the last decade stand against the intellectual forces of France once more in free play, even though limited to this parliamentary arena? It used to be taken as an accepted truth that no form of established authority, with whatever number of bayonets at its back, could cope with the combined intellect of the nation in a fair encounter. How is this upstart imperialism in France, which began its career by consolidating the whole talent of France, almost as a unit, against it, to be an exception?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Speech of M.

"The meeting for the relief of needy soldiers' families, held at the Cooper Institute last evening, was very largely attended. The announcement that Gen. ANDERSON would preside and that Gen. BURNSIDE would speak, was sufficient to fill the house, irrespective of the charitable object of the meeting. The audience, therefore, was considerably disappointed, when, after some delay, it was announced that neither of the distinguished soldiers expected would be present. Subsequently, however, the disappointment was very considerably relieved by the appearance of Gen. BURNSIDE in the absence of Gen. ANDERSON, HORACE WEBSTER, LL.D., presided. On taking the Chair, the Doctor remarked that he hoped the audience would sympathize with him, as it became necessary for him to state that neither Gen. ANDERSON nor Gen. BURNSIDE would be present during the evening. The former was detained by sickness in his family, the latter by official duties.. Before resuming his seat, the sneaker was informed that General BURNSIDE was expected at 8 o'clock. The announcement was received with loud cheers from the audience. At the conclusion of the presiding officer's remarks the Harmonic Glee Club sang a hymn. After prayer by Rev. Mr. BURTIS, and the song, ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee,"" by the Glee Club, Rev. Mr. C. C. Goss, pastor of the Christian Alliance, was introduced. The reverend gentleman stated briefly the objects of the Christian Alliance, which was the means of the meeting being called. The organization had been established with a view to do good everywhere in the most speedy manner. The members of the Christian Alliance were guided by none but the One above. They were to assist men, but not ""pauperize"" them. They never gave articles, they lent. If those assisted could ever pay, ""all right."" It not ""well and good."" The plan, having for its object the relief of poor soldiers and their destitute families was not his own. For several months the members of the Christian Alliance had been brought in contact with soldiers both in camp and City. They knew the necessity of doing something. The Alliance brought to the office of the Medical Director a knowledge of the wants of poor soldiers. There was no society for the relief of discharged soldiers.

"A Committee of the House of Representatives have now before them the question of a bill to establish a uniform system of bankrupt laws throughout the United States. The action of Congress in the last session, in postponing the consideration of this important question, occasioned much disappointment to the mercantile community. An efficient and practical measure, to adjust the relations of creditor and debtor, ought not longer to be delayed. Our attention has been called to this subject by a pamphlet written by Mr. EDWIN JAMES containing suggestions for a bill to enact a uniform law of bankruptcy. He proposes a system of voluntary and compulsory bankruptcy, and suggests that through the means of stamps on the various proceedings the administration of the new law would be inexpensive to the country. The author of these suggestions, when in the House of Commons, assisted in passing the English bill of 1861, which made great amendments in the practical operations of the existing laws of bankruptcy, and codified the whole system. We can commend these suggestions to the careful consideration of the Committee now organized upon this important subject, and we trust their labors will result in the passage of a just and equitable enactment, which, while it affords relief to the embarrassed and unfortunate debtor, will secure the distribution of the estate of the dishonest debtor equally among his creditors. In the Senate, in1840, DANIEL WEBSTER urged strongly the passing of a measure very analogous to that now proposed, and the suggestions of Mr. JAMES have been sent to the Committee, with the indorsement of the two Judges of the United States Court (Judges BETTS and SHIPMAN.)

New Phase of Question,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/02/archives/new-phase-of-the-danogerman-dispute.html,New Phase of Question,"-- The advices from Halifax, brought by the 'Hibernia, put an altogether different aspect upon the Dano-German dispute. War seems none the less imminent, but the great Powers, Prussia and Austria, have determined to do the fighting with Denmark, if any is to be done, and the minor German Powers must content themselves, at least for the present, with watching the combat. It will be remem-bered that our last advices told of an Austro-Prussian proposition which, with pacific design, was presented on the 14th ult. to the Federal Diet, demanding that the Confederation should require Denmark definitely to suspend the November Constitution with regard to Schleswig, and notify King CHRISTIAN that in case of refusal, the Confederation would be compelled, in fulfillment of its demands, to occupy Schleswig by a military force. This proposition the Diet refused to entertain, when Prussia and Austria declared that they would themselves take the matter in hand, and offer the plan to Denmark as an ultimatum. It now appears that Denmark had just as strong an aversion to this mode of settling the matter as had the Federal Diet, for she met the proposition with a flat refusal. The Austro-Prussian Ambassadors at once quitted the Danish capital, and of course the two great Powers have no alternative but formally to declare war and carry out their threat of occupying the disputed duchy. It is not so sure, however, that the dispute will resolve itself into active hostilities after all. It is shrewdly surmised that the Austro-Prussian alliance has taken this bold step in order to snatch the responsibility out of the hands of the minor Powers, and themselves become masters of the situation. With Austria and Prussia as the belligerents on one side, and Denmark on the other, the minor German States would have no power to interfere between them, and the pending dispute would be settled on conditions of which they alone would be the arbitrators. Meantime the military preparations on all sides are being hurried.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW PHASE OF THE DANO-GERMAN DISPUTE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW PHASE OF THE DANO-GERMAN DISPUTE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4534a964-8284-53bb-9a87-5dff2df0f280,333,nyt://article/4534a964-8284-53bb-9a87-5dff2df0f280,

This latter resolution the Councilmen concurred in. A resolution to allow a coal merchant at the foot of West Twentieth-street to erect an elevated railway over a bulkhead, for private business uses, and which had been adopted by the Aldermen at a former meeting, the Councilmen sent to the Committee on Streets. Both boards adopted a resolution reported by the Joint Committee on National Affairs, requesting the Comptroller to arrange transfers to the City Contingent Fund, to the amount of $25,000, expressly to be used in extending a reception to the returned veteran volunteers. The committee report that they conferred with the Mayor and Gen. SANDFORD in regard to giving the veterans a reception, as previously instructed to do by both boards, and afterward consulted the Comptroller as to the means available for the purpose. Mr. BRENNAN said there was no money in the Contingent Fund, and arrears existed for music bills of receptions to the two-year regiments, amounting to $6,000, but if it were desired by the Common Council, he could recommend transfers to obtain money for a reception to the veterans. The Finance Committee of the Aldermen reported themselves unable to report on the whole City budget now, but presented an ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,019,217 85 and $967,227 36, respectively for the payment of the interest on and principal of the City debt due this year, in accordance with authority heretofore[???] given by the Legislature by various laws.

Profoundly as it is to be desired that an arrangement could be effected that would restore to us the thousands of Union captives now confined in Southern prisons, the country cannot wish that this should be done at the price of such a sacrifice of justice as that on which the rebels condition a general exchange. Were we to yield to the only terms they will make, the concession would indeed give us back those in bonds; but it would restore to the rebels an army larger, probably, than that which LEE now has under his command.

Brooklyn Police and Comptroller Faron,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/03/archives/payment-of-the-metropolitan-police.html,Brooklyn Police and Comptroller Faron,"-- Notwithstanding the fact that Gov. SEYMOUR's nominations for a new Board of Police Commissioners were last week refused confirmation by the Senate, this little vagary of His Excellency has not been altogether devoid of a mischievous result. And, Unfortunately, the evil is felt in a quarter where it can be least conveniently borne. Comotroller FARON, of Brooklyn, in deference to the behests of Gov. SEYMOUR's quondam Board, withholds his signature to the warrant upon the Treasury for the funds wherewith to pay the civic guardians of that city, and their claims for wages for the present go unsatisfied. But this is not all. Comptroller FARON is Trustee of the Police Fund for the benefit of the widows and orphans of those brave fellows who have laid down the ""locust"" for the sterner weapons of the army, and who have fallen in the strife, and we are told that he even refuses to dole out the pittance upon which these helpless families depend for subsistence. How different is his course to that of Comptroller BRENNAN! Our New-York custodian of the money-bags knows the necessities of the police, and does not hesitate about taking the responsibility of paving them. The warrant for last month's money received his signature promptly upon presentation, and, as usual, on the first of the month, the entire force received their pay. Will not Mr. FARON follow this commendable example? or must private generosity be evoked to secure the $18,000 which are required to meet the demands of the case until such time as this puerile controversy is closed?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'PAYMENT OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'PAYMENT OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/50ad5add-9b00-5588-ab57-e2531e67cad5,262,nyt://article/50ad5add-9b00-5588-ab57-e2531e67cad5,

And it just now possesses greater interest than ever, owing to the fact that we not only begin to feel our burdens, but the public is generally satisfied that with a proper use of the means which the Government will soon have at its disposal, the approaching campaign may be made final and decisive. The exhaustion of the rebels is no longer a matter of speculation or conjecture. The evidence of it is so strong and clear as to make the fact almost notorious, and it does not consist simply in the stories of spies and refugees, or the inventives of opposition newspapers, but in the measures and confessions of the rebel Government itself. JEFFRSON DAVIS' exposition of the condition of their currency, and his plan for its redemption, coupled with the conscription which is now before his Congress, putting every white man into the ranks of the army, constitute proofs very much stronger than those on which the conclusions either of soldiers or statesmen are usually based.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Future Military Policy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Future Military Policy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MILITARY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ac17a34b-8add-5b37-8d49-c10420b0e762,1430,nyt://article/ac17a34b-8add-5b37-8d49-c10420b0e762,

"Enrollment Bill, House Action on",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/04/archives/the-backtrack-on-the-conscription-bill.html,"Enrollment Bill, House Action on","-- The House of Representatives seems to be doing its utmost to undo all that the Senate did for the improvement of the Conscription Bill. That body, yesterday, voted to reduce the price of commutation from $400, at which the Senate had fixed it, to $300 -- the old figure. But this is a small matter. It did much worse than that. It restored (by a vote of 79 against 49) the fatal error of making the payment of the three hundred dollar commutation work exemption for the whole period of three years! We cannot help thinking this a most unwise measure. The facts brought out in the course of the Senate debates on this point proved conclusively that the effect of this will be in a very short time to exhaust the military basis, and dry up the only fountain whence soldiers can be drawn. The experience of the last draft shows that a large proportion of those drafted will avail themselves of the privilege of exemption by commutation. Each man who pays his three hundred dollars will have in his pocket a certificate of exemption from draft for three years, and it will not take a great number of drawings to rule the whole serviceable population out of the lists. The Senate in its bill provided a partial remedy for this enormous evil by the provision that the payment of commutation should relieve the commuter from the draft in filling that quota only, and his name should be retained on the roll in filling future quotas. Another excellent feature of the Senate's bill was the division of substitutes into two classes -- those themselves liable to draft and those not liable to draft: and it provided that complete exemption for three years was only to be obtained by furnishing a substitute from the class not liable to draft, (as aliens, persons under twenty years of age, & c.,) while drafted persons furnishing substitutes from the class themselves subject to draft were to be again liable to draft on the exhaustion of the enrollment. The action of the House sweeps by the board all these provisions, restores all the demonstrated errors of the old act, and, we fear, will leave the Conscription Bill little more than an irritating nullity.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BACK-TRACK ON THE CONSCRIPTION BILL.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BACK-TRACK ON THE CONSCRIPTION BILL.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5b71408c-1c41-5529-b59f-082af9e843c5,380,nyt://article/5b71408c-1c41-5529-b59f-082af9e843c5,

Official advices from Mexico state that the army is everywhere-giving in its adherence to the new Government. It was reported that the Bank of France had lost $400,000 in gold, on the 16th instant. There is little of interest in the English news. A statement in the Edinburgh Scotsman shows that since the blockade of the rebel ports, upward of sixty steamers have left the Clyde, and their purchase price amounted to £700,000. Some of these vessels have been an immense source of profit to all concerned. The pirate 'Florida was announced by her commander as ready to leave Brest, and also to try her mettle with the Kearsage after getting out of French waters.

An effort to give this sanction, so far as the Senate is concerned, was made on Monday, but failed by an emphatic negative vote. So far the committee have enlisted 5,600 men.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/05/archives/amusements.html,,"ACADEMY or MUSIC. -- The experiment of a fourta regular night was made last night, with a degree of success that establishes at once the capacity of our public for a more liberal supply of opera than has been thought practicable or -- at all events -- desirable. Long before the performance commenced the box-office had sold out all its interest in the individual comfort of the audience, and exhibited its distress in the well-known banner inscribed ""Standing room only."" This result is ascribable to good management. Mr. MARETZEK, with the wily tactics of a prudent General, reserved his greatest strength for the occasion. GOUNOD's ""Faust"" would draw a crowded house on a far worse night than Thursday. It has, so far, only flushed the community with pleasure, and months will elapse ere the lieges are satisfied with its sweets. The performance last night was in every respect enjoyable. All the artists were in excellent voice, and the choral and orchestral masses seemed to be animated by the warmth that resulted from the general success. ""Faust"" is too complete a work to grain much from incidental encores. Its success is genuine, and will, we think, be lasting, because it is based upon a broad and general impression. Nevertheless, there were demands for repetition, and general satisfaction at what was vouchsafed in that way. Mr. MARETZEK may be congratulated on the complete acceptance of his Thursday evening experiment.

BENJAMIN F. DENTON, late of Company A, One Hundred and Thirty-third Regiment New-York Volunteers, who was at one time a highly-respected and useful officer of the force. His regiment was included in the famous Metropolitan Brigade, commanded by Brig.-Gen. BOWEN, which is now in service under Gen. BANKS, in the Department of the Gulf, where it has achieved a glorious distinction for bravery and efficiency. In consequence of the absence of his Captain, who had been detached for duty in New-Orleans, the command of his company in the field devolved upon Lieut. DENTON, and it was while bravely leading his men on the occasion of the second assault on Port Hudson, that he fell mortally wounded, and was buried on the field. His body, after several days, was recovered and buried in a soldier's grave on the ground which his blood had consecrated. Recently, however, his remains were disinterred, and forwarded to this City by the steamship Western Metropolis, which arrived on Wednesday. Few men have given their lives in this struggle of the nation who were more beloved and more deserving of honor than he to whom a fitting tribute will be paid by his late comrades, to-day. Sandy Hill, Washington Co., N.Y., will be his final resting-place. A captain and twenty men from each of the twenty-four lower precincts will act as escort. The route of the procession will be up Brordway to Fourteenth-street, and up Fifth-avenue to Twenty-third-street; thence to Ninth-avenue and to Hudson River Railroad depot.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-05 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9c3ab3fd-fa13-54ef-bd45-4fad79526d80,1008,nyt://article/9c3ab3fd-fa13-54ef-bd45-4fad79526d80,

The race of fools has not died out either, and, from present appearances, is not likely to. They have existed in good numbers throughout rebeldom from the first, but the pressure and tribulation of the mortar and pestle of civil war has divided them into two classes: the men who have learned from this bitter hard experience, and the men whose foolishness does not in the least depart from them. This latter class is largely composed of those men wise in their own conceit, whose case seemed to Solomon even more hopeless than that of the fool.

Last evening a number of the friends of the proprietors were invited to attend a private view of the ""Hippotheatron,"" by which high-sounding name the new structure is to be known. The building is constructed of corrugated and ridged galvanized iron, of SEELEY'S patent, and is supposed to combine strength and durability with the additional advantages of being fire-proof. In capacity it surpasses any of the cloues of Continental Europe, as accommodation will be afforded for over 4,000 spectators. The entrance is through a beautiful Italian arch, 23 feet in height and 22 feet in width, the columns of which are richly decorated with statuesque and arabesque work of the Italian school. The seats are spacious and comfortable, rising tier upon tier to the height of 22 feet from the ground -- so arranged as to afford an uninterrupted view of the arena. A retiring-room has been provided for the accommodation of ladles, as also another for gentlemen. In case of any emergency, two large exit doors have been pro vided, so that the entire audience of 4,000 persons can leave the building in an incredibly short apace of time. The decorations are simple, yet at the same time pleasing, the ground work being a pale pink, lighted up with, and enriched with light blue and gold. Messrs. LAWRENCE B. VALK and W.G.

Circulation among Rebels Important,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/06/archives/the-amnesty-proclamation-withiin-the-rebel-linesa-hint-to-our.html,Circulation among Rebels Important,"A HINT TO OUR GENERALS. Nothing could more forcibly evince the dangerous importance which the rebel leaders attach to the President's Amnesty Proclamation than the conspicuous omission of its publication in the rebel papers. This enjoys the distinction of being the only document of the war which has not been promptly seized and reproduced in their journals. Even the President's Proclamation of Emancipation received wide circulation in the rebel press, for it was relied on as an addition to their stock of fuel for ""firing the Southern heart,"" while it was safe from the eyes of the class immediately interested in it. But the Amnesty Proclamation has not been reproduced in a single rebel paper. It has, indeed, been spoken about plentifully, but with such utter perversions of its scope and terms as to very clearly indicate the dread inspired by the thought of the real article finding its way among the masses of the people and the armies. Now this significant circumstance makes it all the more incumbent on the Generals commanding along the front of the great rebel armies to use every effort in giving the widest possible introduction of this dreaded document within the rebel lines. By a strange oversight of our commanders, this important matter has been but little attended to. Gen. Foster seems to have tried its effect in East Tennessee, and the amusing letter, which it called forth from LONGSTREET, adds strong confirmation of the fear the rebel leaders have of its circulation. The chivalric LONGSTRET is under the impression that the diffusion of this kind of useful knowledge among his soldiers is a breach of military etiquette. ""We fear that perhaps it is open to that frightful imputation; but as business of killing men is rather a breach of etiquette anyhow, we think we shall survive this stigma. The fair retaliation would be, for the rebels to get up a similar proclamation of amnesty, promising pardon to all the deluded Yankee soldiers who may be disposed to come into the Confederate lines. If they see fit to do so, we will promise to give it all the circulation they could desire and we don't see why they should be so ungallant as to refuse to reciprocate. In the meantime, we trust our Generals will omit no opportunity to send the document into the rebel lines. Every picket guard should be provided with copies of it, and the scouts might sow the seed by the wayside. It is the unanimous testimony of deserters, that were the terms of the President's offer of amnesty generally known among the rebel rank and file, thousands would avail themselves of the first occasion to come over to our side. It was, if we remember rightly, a device of ancient warfare for setting fire to combustible stuff within the enemy's lines, to send in bulls on whose horns firebrands were fastened. The Amnesty Proclamation would prove a still more formidable firebrand to the rebels; and it is a realizing sense of this that makes the leaders so particularly punctilious on the point of ""etiquette.""",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE AMNESTY PROCLAMATION WITHIIN THE REBEL LINES--A HINT TO OUR GENERALS.; REBEL LINES', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE AMNESTY PROCLAMATION WITHIIN THE REBEL LINES--A HINT TO OUR GENERALS.; REBEL LINES', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7c4d8d50-b1f2-5b76-aeb1-4de06238783f,515,nyt://article/7c4d8d50-b1f2-5b76-aeb1-4de06238783f,

The undertaking, in the first place, was an intellectual compliment to the country. It was based on the faith that there is in this country enough of philosophy and scholarship to justify a new and complete edition of the writings which one of the greatest thinkers that ever lived has left to the world as his immortal legacy. When the edition was first undertaken, times were quiet, and the peace, the prosperity, the regular, permanent economy of the nation did not seem to be seriously threatened. There was, indeed, a small cloud in the sky, a low, grumbling noise in the air -- yet none but a prophet could have seen in that cloud the commencement of the thick gloom which has since encompassed us in its darkness, or heard in the murmur of the grumbling noise the coming of the tem-pest which has since shaken our political institutions almost to their foundations. But, amidst all this fear, trouble and uncertainty, the publication of BACON'S works has been continued, with only necessary interruptions. We praised the intelligence which commenced the publication, and we still more praise the courage which has continued it, until it is now given in its fullness to the public. Never before has the public of the civilized world -- and that is BACON'S public -- had a more complete view and exposition of BACON'S mind. Of the several editors, each is perfect in his own department; and it would seem now as if all the materials were collected, which are necessary to a full and fair judgment on BACON'S personal character and philosophical genius.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LORD BACON.; THE WORKS OF FRANCIS BACON, collected and edited by JAMES SPEDDING, ROBERT LESLIE ELLIS and DOUGLAS DENON HEATH.

S. I. Five Years of Prayer","The design of this elegantly-printed volume is quite unique. Instead of offering, like other dictionaries of quotations, a collection of, ""elegant extracts"" on selected subjects, its aim is to ascertain the paternity of the current phrases and passages familiar to the ear of every one, but whose origin is generally lost sight of and forgotten from their very adoption into the body of the written and spoken language of ordinary literary and social intercourse. Its execution implies an amount of reading perfectly appalling to think of. The whole series 'of British classics, from SHAKESPEARE, BACON and HOOKER, to TENNYSON and Mrs. BROWNING, must have been gone over and ""contents noted,"" (in mercantile phraseology) whenever the familiar word or sentence was met with. It is a curious study to observe what authors have most enriched the language with this current mental coinage -- this verbal mintage which is recognized by all as sterling. SHAKESPEARE, of course, stands first in amount, one hundred pages are taken up with the recital of his contributions to the stock of popular allusions, quotations and references. The English version of the Bible is one of the other most copious sources, and of modern poets ALEXANDER POPS ranks highest. occupying thirty-four pages, while twenty suffice for MILTON, six for YOUNG, nine for COWPER, twelve for WORDSWORTH, six for THOMAS MOORE, and seventeen for LORD BYRON. In thus tracing home the waifs and strays of literature, the editor (who is understood to be an accomplished bookseller of Boston,) has done a real service to letters, and his little manual should be on the desks of all who are studious of correctness, and conscientious in the matter of giving credit to whom credit is properly due. To that much enduring class, the editors of popular newspapers, who are expected to answer all the questions of their correspondents, from some encyclopedic fount of knowledge, this book must be a perfect treasure. There need be no further difficulty experienced in deciding in a moment to whom belong ""When Greek meets Greek,"" &c., (LEE;) ""Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest,"" (POPE;) ""Comparisons are odorous,"" (SHAKESPEARE;) ""No pent up Utica,"" & c, (SEWALL;) and the thousand and one other quotations of as general acceptance, whose source has long been the subject of wager, discussions, and disputes innumerable.

THIERS, in the French Corps Legislatif, treating of the actual political condition of France, and already the subject of dis- cussion in these columns, gives us a glimpse of her future, from which nobody who is interested in her progress can derive much satisfaction. It is impossible on laying it down to avoid asking, as so many of the best men in France have been asking for so long, what she has gained by all the changes through which she has gone in the last eighty years, except the reduction of all ranks and classes to the same level before the law. This was no doubt an immense gain, but it was achieved before a drop of innocent blood had been shed. The nobles had lost their privileges before the revolution had entered on its sanguinary phase, and all the troubles, and turmoil, and broils, and mortal anxieties, loss of life and loss of treasure, which Frenchmen have since suffered, would seem on M. THIERS showing to have been utterly wasted. It does not appear, as we remarked a few weeks ago, that a subject of Louis NAPOLEON enjoys a single legal guarantee for life, liberty or property, as against the Government, which the subjects of Louis XIV. did not enjoy. He is better off, it is true, better fed, and better clothed, and possesses general exemption from gross tyranny and outrage, but this is due to the general progress of the world in humanity, and the greater force of public opinion, which has been bred by greater publicity to politics, properly so called.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/07/archives/police-boat-no-1-what-the-force-do-aroung-the-harbor.html,,"Police Boat No. 1, Capt. James TODD, commanding has become a feature of our harbor. Although a very modest and unassuming little craft, more real service has been accomplished by her and her active crew consisting of twelve men during the last two years she has been in commission, than by any other branch of the City government, requiring no greater outlay. The vessel is: extreme length, 105 feet; breadth of beam, 33 feet; depth of hold, 12 feet, and is one hundred and thirty tons burden, the engine being very powerful for the steamer's size. The arrangements of the boat are admirably adapted to the business in which she is engaged. In its forward part is located a powerful double steam fire-pump, to which can be made two attachments, and from which immense streams of water can be thrown upon any fire within reasonable distance. Upon this pump hag depended the safety of a large amount of property at the different fires which have occurred along the river. The recent extensive conflagration of piers and shipping on the North River was checked in its progress by the Police boat, which for more than thirty hours was actively engaged throwing water on the flames, tearing down piers, scuttling vessels, and dragging burning craft to the middle of the stream. Thousands on thousands of dollars were in this manner saved to the owners of property in the vicinity of the fire. This is only one instance out of very many where the police-boat has rendered invaluable service in checking extensive fires. Frequently warehouses are so situated along the docks as to make it almost impossible for engines to reach them. In such cases, when a fire occurs, the principal reliance is upon the police-boat. This little vessel is also of great service in cases of collision, mutinies and ships on fire in the bay. In her connection with such matters, so well has she become known to our merchants, that when the slightest thing occurs on shipboard she is at once noticed by them, or the Captains of vessels hoist the usual signal of distress -- Union down. Within the last two years the brave officers and men of the Police-boat have been present at, and quelled, some of the most desperate and bloody multnies that have ever taken place in our harbor. Besides the steamer, there are two small boats which are kept in active operation in saving lives of parties falling overboard, and in search of river-thieves. These river-thieves, who for some time, inconsequence of numerous arrests, became rather shy have again ventured out more boldly than ever. Our River Police find in this class of thieves a more dangerous body of men to contend with than has and existence on land. They have bouts, and sometimes go in gangs of eight and ten, with a view to the wholesale plunder of vessels lying in the stream. When interrupted in their operations, they make a most desperate resistance. They are generally well armed, and fight under cover of darkness as coolly and with as much persistence as a cand of pirates. There are frequently disturbances on ships as they are about sailing, in consequence of the drunken condition of seamen shipped by boarding-house keepers. On such occasions it frequently becomes the duty of the Harbor Police to iron the men until they get sober.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Police Boat No. 1.; WHAT THE FORCE DO AROUNG THE HARBOR.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Police Boat No. 1.; WHAT THE FORCE DO AROUNG THE HARBOR.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0f60b636-bf26-5190-aaf4-8e0140c2a090,686,nyt://article/0f60b636-bf26-5190-aaf4-8e0140c2a090,

"In a letter from Flensburg we have the following account of the ""Dannewerk,"" the great bulwark of Schleswig: ""The Dannewerk is of very ancient origin. It is situate at the extreme southern part of the ??? of Schleswig, and is now an enormous earthwork that stretches almost across the entire country. The length of the peninsula of Schleswig-Holstein to the end of Jutland, is said to be near three hundred miles; so that it extends almost us far as the base line of our country, from the North Foreland to Land's End. The bread III of the pe???, however, is but one-third of its length, and the D ??? is a ???fication that reaches very nearly across the land from the German Ocean to the Baltic. This 'border wall' is said to have been erected in the ninth century, and. according to the accounts given of it in ??? Saga,' it was built of wood, stone and earth. in the year 937 the wall, we are told, was strengthened by Queen Turn*, whom the people, in their thankfulness for the national defence, christened Danabod, which, literally translated, means the pride of the Danes; and, as a proof of the extreme antiquity of the structure, 1 have myself seen at Fle???burg a splendid collection of flint arrow-heads and axes which have been collected from the barrows or earth mounds in the immediate neighborhood. There were spear points wrought out of splinters of flint no thicker than paper knives, and worked sharper than the best steel. Here, too, we were shown the knuckle-bone-like stones which had been used to separate the line layers of sil???eous earth from the solid mass, and which were found embedded in these same barrows with the very flint chip beside them that the people, thousands of years before, had broken from the integrel block. Here, moreover, we saw the slabs of stone that the old Celts had used to grind their spearheads on to the sharpest possible points, grooved with the toils of the workmen, and seeming as if they were destined to tell the present age how this wonderfully fine workmanship of the hardest possible material was executed. Indeed, in this collection of works long precedent to history, I saw arrow-heads made out of ??? hardly thicker than mother-of-pearl, and wrought as sharp as a needle. The fortress consists at the present day (without going into all the niceties of historical detail) of three enormous earthworks stretching across the entire breadth of the land; they are so arranged as to form the neck, or funnel, with a long outwork to protect the narrow channel through which the troops are ultimately intended to be driven. Toward the Baltic, or East Sea, there runs the 'Oster-Wolden' (or east rampart;) this lies toward the 'Eckenforde,' and is sometimes called the 'Camel-Dannewerk.' It is about two English miles long, the earthworks being from four feet to five feet high, and sixteen yards broad, and beset with a ???, the depth of which varies from six feet to ten feet. Beyond this is the great bay formed by the river Schley, which is so wide that no troops could possibly attempt to pass it. Stretching immediately in front of this is the 'Kurgraben,' which is upwards of a mile in length, beginning at the end of the Selker Lake; it is from 10 feet to 12 feet broad, and from 4 feet to 6 feet high. Behind this lies the great 'Dannewark' itself, which consists of an earthwork net less than 14 miles long. In some parts it is from 30 feet to 30 feet high, and the ramparts are from 16 feet to 20 feet broad. The whole of these earthworks are immediately in connection from one side of the peninsula to the other, with the river Treene, which fall into the Northern Ocean; so that the Danish forces have it within their power to flood not less than 64 square miles of land in front of the great bulwark of Schleswig at a moment's notice. 'But,' said the Saxon soldiers to the writer, 'what are the uses of the sluice-gates in this time of frost?' On talking with the Danish engineers, however, they told us they had flooded the country a fortnight before with the, thinnest pellicle of ice, and let the water out immediately afterwards, so that any troops attempting to cross the country would be mowed down by the artillery like corn. Indeed, from what I heard during ??? is not the least doubt that 40,000 men could hold the Dannewerk against 100,001 opposing troops; and from what I saw myself of the fortifications, and heard from the engineers as to the means of flooding the country, either with a thin sheet of ice or???slough of water, I am convinced that it would require as strong an army as united Germany could possibly muster to wrest Schleswig from Denmark.""",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/07/archives/the-denish-question-the-dannewerk.html,,"In a letter from Flensburg we have the following account of the ""Dannewerk,"" the great bulwark of Schleswig: ""The Dannewerk is of very ancient origin.

The fire originated on the sixth floor of the building, in the drying-room of the twine factory of R. HOLDEN, and spread through the whole building with fearful rapidity, enveloping everything it could reach in destruction. Owing to the great height of the premises, it was found almost impossible to throw water on the burning building, and it was owing to the almost superhuman exertions of the firemen that the flames were prevented from spreading to the adjoining buildings.

Greco Conspiracy Against the Emperor,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/07/archives/the-greco-conspiracy.html,Greco Conspiracy Against the Emperor,"Was this a real or a spurious plot? Was it a plot got up by Italian fanatics against the life of the French Emperor, or a plot got up by the Parisian police against French liberty? People are divided in opinion on this subject, but perhaps an epitome of the history of the mysterious affair will best enable us to form a correct conclusion as to its true character. On Christmas Day four Italians, named GRECO, IMPERATORI, FRABUCO and LAGLIO, arrived in Paris, with the intention, according to their subsequent admission, of killing the Emperor. They had each two uncharged shells concealed on their persons, were armed with daggers and revolvers, and possessed cash to the amount of 4,000f. They dallied away their time in the French metropolis till their money was nearly spent, when they bethought themselves of the business which brought them thither; but while they were preparing, or affecting to prepare, for the execution of their crime, the police pounced on them, and the bubble burst. Now who was it that furnished these men with the eight shells and the 4,000f.? Who was it that armed them with daggers and revolvers? Who was it that instigated their to travel from Lugano to Paris, and to attempt the assassination of the ruler of France? If we are to believe their own evidence after arrest, it was GIUSEPPE MAZZINI that supplied them with money and arms, that suggested to them the foul deed, and that invited them to undertake its commission.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Greco Conspiracy.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Greco Conspiracy.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d2687ee1-4536-5483-8330-d62e8d4ad93e,802,nyt://article/d2687ee1-4536-5483-8330-d62e8d4ad93e,

While the two were taking refreshments. the Lieutenant felt the hand or his companion in his pocker. He seized her hand and his pocket-book fell to the floor. Picking it up he thrust it into his pocket without examining to see if any of the contents were missing. Soon after he parted from JANE; a block or two from the place, and then he thought to examine his pocket-book, when he found his money was all missing. He at once pursued her and found her in a saloon in Greene-street. Officer MCPHERSON, of the Eighth Precinct, healing a disturbance mere, went in, and on the representations of the Lieutenant arrested JANE. When they were on the sidewalk the officer noticed something drop from her hand. and on examining it found ii to be $130 of the Lieutenant's money.

L.","What we call States never were such in the strict sense of the term. There never was a moment in history in which they were independent, sovereign Powers, that is -- according to Mr. LINCOLN'S most true and terse definition -- ""having no human power above them."" Take the largest of them, or the most historical among them; neither New-York nor Massachusetts were ever sovereign States, like Britain, France, Spain, or even Portugal. They never had a war with any other nation carried on in their own name, and in their own sovereignty; they never had a treaty of peace with another nation, or one of commerce, amity or alliance; they were never acknowledged as sovereignties by any other nation, or ever sought such recognition. To this day, New-York and Pennsylvania have never had conceded to them what, by the law of Nations, has been freely given to Chili, Hayti, and even Liberia. They were not sovereigns before the Revolution; they dill not assume to act as such during the Revolution. No State declared itself independent in its separate capacity. ""By the joint declaration in 177G, the colonies held themselves out to the world, and made treaties"", not an separate and Independent sovereignties, but as one united nation, known, in that capacity alone', to foreign Powers. ""As colonies, they passed from the sovereignty of Great Britain into and under the collective sovereignty of all the similar colonial Powers with whom history and the shaping God of history had connected them. If, at the close of the war which destroyed British sovereignty, any of them had thus attempted to break out of history, on the ground of the absolute right of each part to act for itself, it could only have given the same right to every subordinate municipality included within its asserted independence. It would have been theoretically and actually an entire disintegration. When the great bond of the parent country was loosed, there was no other historical unity, no other sovereignty, than that which had kept them together during the long struggle that resulted in making them a nation collectively -- one sovereignty, known as such to all the other political sovereignties of the world. It was this that had ""raised and maintained armies;"" it was this that had asserted independence; it was this that received and appointed- Ambassadors; and, finally, it was this that made the treaty of peace, securing the national independence, and so making it for the whole, that even if any part had claimed, and been permitted to stay out, it would only have been to lose ail the benefit of the treaty of recognition, and revert to the old dominion. In short, they emerged from one sovereignty to find themselves under another; and this was the only way in which the civic life could historically have its transmission as one civic life passing from the parent, unbroken in its continuity though changed in form.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'STATE SOVEREIGNTY.; Considered Historically, Conventionally and Geographically.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'STATE SOVEREIGNTY.; Considered Historically, Conventionally and Geographically.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e8dc65f8-ffbc-5d4a-82c1-dcee8ab5407a,2785,nyt://article/e8dc65f8-ffbc-5d4a-82c1-dcee8ab5407a,

TIBBETTS gained considerable notoriety for himself, by asking very heavy speculative purchase of Mixed Western Corn, at extraordinary high prices, the corn deliverable in the first ten days of the current month of February. He had subsequently some difficulty with his bankers. because of what is called Che defamatory representations of certain rivals in business. He managed, however, to work through this difficulty, and determined to gain control of the available supply of corn here, so as to render It next to impossible for those who had sold to him, to ill their contracts unless on such terms as would suit his interest or convenience. On Friday last, at about noon, he made his appearance on Change and commenced buying briskly, until he had purchased twenty-three loads at prices varying from 1 3301 40, agreeing to pay 3c. percent bushel cash on that day, and the balance of the purchase money within ten days. He also sold a single load at 51 26, cash. About one o'clock P. M., he grew very much excited, having been greatly annoyed by soma unknown parties, who had been pelting him with lumps of dough and quantities of grain; also by the persistency of a merchant, who bad been offering a load of corn at $1 40, but with whom ha. had repeatedly declined to have any direct business transactions. He began to talk loudly about combinations which had been organized to crush him; about his fidelity to principle; his determination to ???ght out the battle of principle, even if it cost him his ??? his enemies might take his corn and his money, but he would maintain his character, which he prized above everything else. Efforts were made to reason with him, but these efforts only Increased his nervousness and mental excitement. He appealed to his God for protection, and refused to be pacified or reasoned with, warning all parties to avoid interfering with him or his rights. At this lime the excitement on the floor was intense, and business was totally suspended. Shouts of ""Put him out"" were heard on all sides; he defied any one to put him out; he was fighting for principle, and he would not be put down. Two merchants then took hold of him, drew him to the stairway and down the ???airway to the street, whence he started by himself for his office.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'TRAGIC SCENES AT THE PRODUCE EXCHANGE.; A Policeman, Merchant and the Janitor Of the Exchange Stabbed by a Speculator in Corn.

They are neglected. New-York should do more for them than it does. Our places of shelter for these children are few; in fact, there are but two or three in the City, and each is capable of accommodating but a limited number. Fairs have been held, and contributions have been made, toward building a commodious house, to be ready in the Spring. But what is to become of the little ones during the cold Winter? It is a mistake to suppose that there is less poverty now than ever before in New-York. The thirfty laboring man is well supplied with work, and is paid well for it -- no more, comparatively, however, than heretofore -- but there are as many as ever suffering among a different class. The dead or disabled soldier's family -- those whom sickness or intemperance prevent from work -- the orphaned or forsaken children living on the uncertainties of the street, are as numerous and as much in want as ever. There are a thousand children in this City now, whose fathers have been or are now at the war, who are knocking in vain at the doors of the Soldier's Child's Refuge for admittance. They cannot enter, for there is no room for them. This ought not to be. Innocent childhood should not be left to starve and die, or beg and steal. Houses should be hired now, and over them should be placed kind and Christian men and women, who will open the hitherto closed avenues of life and love to those little ones.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE HOMELESS CHILDREN OF OUR SOLDIERS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE HOMELESS CHILDREN OF OUR SOLDIERS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/80f11fa7-efcc-56d1-93c9-150c38537627,278,nyt://article/80f11fa7-efcc-56d1-93c9-150c38537627,

"Reenlistments, the Farce of",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/10/archives/the-farce-of-rebel-reenlistment.html,"Reenlistments, the Farce of","The rebels have lately been getting up a great hulabaloo about the ""reenlistment"" of their troops, and the files of Richmond papers are filled with announcements of the reenlistment of regiments and brigades en masse, while the reports of the proceedings of the rebel Congress contain numerous votes of thanks to different organizations for their ""patriotism."" Now, considering that the rebel Congress had already voted the whole Confederate army into a continuation of service ""for the war,"" these reenlistments are a very pretty joke indeed. We think we see through this mockery: the rebel leaders have been alarmed at the significant contrast presented by the spontaneous patriotism of the veteran regiments of the Union armies in voluntarily coming forward for another term of service, end the despotic measures they (the rebels) were compelled to use, and they have resorted to this dodge for the purpose of spreading a thin veneer over the rot-ton fabric. Another part of the same shallow system is to represent that there are but few reenlistments among the Union armies. ""Reenlistments,"" says the Examiner of the 8th inst., ""progress slowly in the Yankee camps. They have been surprisingly numerous and enthusiastic in ours. The two facts supply a good augury for the decisive campaign of 1864. We have no evidence that enlistments are going on with alacrity in the enemy's camp. On the contrary a new draft is proclaimed, which is the last expedient that can be employed for recruiting depleted ranks."" We are doubtless greatly to be pitied at having to resort to this ""last expedient;"" but what are we to think, of the ""last expedient"" to which the rebels have been forced to come.

"ACADEMY OF MUSIC -- The peculiarities of GOUNOD's music have become so familiar to the artists who sing the various roles in ""Faust,"" that that opera is now presented in a manner that leaves little to be desired, and is infinitely more clear and direct than on the first night. This is especially the case in the part of the hero himself. I: required several performances to accustom Signor MAZZOLENI to the vagueness of some of the melodic forms, and to the mysticism that hangs so suggestively about the music of the opening scene. He has now made himself at home in the role, and it gains new strength not merely from thoroughness of study, but from intelligence of interpretation. Signor BIACHI, as Mephistopheles, has also vastly improved. The rondo in the second act is full of diabolical enthusiasm. It is sung with superb effect by this young and very excellent artist. If the serenade came in any other part of the opera than the fourth act, it would certainly be encored. It is one of the best executed and quaintest numbers in the opera. Signor BELLINI, we need scarcely say, has been a very valuable addition to the cast. The death of Valentine is a fine dramatic sketch, with musical touches of high emotional import. It requires a first-class artist to do full justice to it. The ladles in this opera saved it on the first night, and we need only say that Miss KRLLOGG is still supreme as Marguerite, Miss SULZER is good as Siebel and Miss STOCKTON acceptable as Martha, The performance last night was witnessed by an audience that occupied every nook and corner of the house.

It is pretty generally understood that thus far all types of iron-clad vessels of war introduced into this country and elsewhere are failures.  ,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/11/archives/a-new-plan-of-ironclad-war-vessel.html,,"It is pretty generally understood that thus far all types of iron-clad vessels of war introduced into this country and elsewhere are failures. The broad-side ships of England, France and America, with four and a half inches of iron plates, rolled so heavily that if they are not unseaworthy themselves, they prove the impossibility of putting a heavier armor on sea-going vessels. A novel system of armor has been introduced in the form of corrugated iron, which has the merit of imparting lightness and strength to the vessel. It, of course, permits a proper armament to be carried, by dispensing with an immense amount of superfluous solid iron. In a vessel of 1,800 tons burden, there is a saving of 400 tons, and 18 inches less draft of water. In a vessel of 7,500 tons burden, there is a saving of 1,600 tons weight of metal, and three feet six inches saved in the depth of water. This invention was presented to the Navy Department, and Secretary WELLES, with his usual discrimination, ordered a board to examine it.

Defendant stated to plaintiff, as alleged, that he had peculiar facilities for buying and selling stocks: that he transacted all his business at the Stock Exchange, with Ludlow, Patton & Co., and that he paid them so much a year to do all his business of that nature. Plaintiff employed defendant as agent and broker to purchase 100 shares of Illinois Central Railroad scrip, and deposited with him a margin of five per cent. On the following day defendant represented, as alleged, that he had bought the stock at the Board of Brokers, and presented to plaintiff a paper for him to sign, which purported that plaintiff had purchsed from defendant 100 shares of Illinois Central at $75, and paid on account $500. Plaintiff being ignoraut of stock operations, as claimed, believed it to be what was customary in buying stock and signed the paper, Subsequently plaintiff bought and sold stock through defendant to the amount of several hundred thousand dollars, in all of which transactions he gave a margin and paid commission, and he alleges that defendant pretended to acconnt to him and settle the losses and gains, but persuaded plaintiff to allow the gains to remain in his hands as a further margin.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Story of a Wall-street Speculator Who Did Not Understand His Business-A Broker Charged with Bad Faith.; SUPERIOR COURT TRIAL TERM.

We are  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/11/archives/amusements.html,,"OLYMPIC THEATRE. -- A new piece and an old piece were produced at this house on Monday, and -- such are the fearful and tragic vicissitudes of theatrical life -- the old piece carried the night. We are sorry for it. Mrs. JOHN WOOD so seldom produces a new piece, that the force of such an example may be fatal to an entire generation of American dramatists. And yet the old piece was good, and the new piece was bad. Let us hasten to explain that the latter came from the other side of the Atlantic. It is a burlesque on ""Trovatore,"" by Mr. H.J. BYRON, slightly localized by the infant of the establishment. The jokes for about ten minutes are pretty good, deriving some of their brilliancy, perhaps, from the new clothes of the actors. After that they are provocative of locked-jaw from excess of yawning. The intellectual ???tillation of a pun on a single word is sometimes agreeable, but Mr BYRON is not prodigal of his puns. He spreads them over a large surface, as the Vauxhall caterer spreads his ham. In a dozen lines there may be a single recurrence of a punistical sound, and then so far-fetched and covering such a yast abyss of emptiness, that it is hardly more inspiriting than ans elegant extract from the Directory. The relative merit of a pun is determined by its quick intellectual atrocity; never by its deliberate strain on the memory or patience. People do not laugh at Mr. BYRON's herculean efforts. They sigh, and slumberously doat upon Mrs. JOHN WOOD; or wildly leave the theatre, hurling imprecations into the box-office where they paid their money and didn't get their choice.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'AMUSEMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7a968dd9-ceb8-5d11-9e70-95e12aef1941,1218,nyt://article/7a968dd9-ceb8-5d11-9e70-95e12aef1941,

The steamer Merrimac was captured by the Iroquois. During the chase, the steamer Eagle, an unarmed merchant steamer, came in sight, and, by her presence, if not by active cooperation, aided the Iroquois in the capture of the blockade-runner. The vessel being condemned as prize, the Commander of the Eagle put in a claim to be allowed to share in the prize money. He no doubt thought that he had done as much to help the chase with his vessel as if she had carried guns, as long as she was not near enough to have used guns if she had them, and since an armed vessel would be entitled to share as being within ""signal distance,"" he and his crew ought also to be so entitled.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ANOTHER DECISION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF; PRIZE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'ANOTHER DECISION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF; PRIZE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-12 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/be3c831a-3a03-5c11-9558-c084879e77a3,550,nyt://article/be3c831a-3a03-5c11-9558-c084879e77a3,

They must not imagine, in the first place, that any number of ""appeals"" to the tax-payers will be productive of the smallest benefit, no matter how cogent they may be. The tax-payers know all about the corruption of the City Government, and all heartily detest and abhor the ""Ring,"" but they are divided into two classes: The first consists of those who, knowing to what extent they are plundered by the banditti of the City Hall, nevertheless find that it ""pays better"" to submit quietly than to devote any time to trying to bring about a reform, and will, consequently, as long as indifference pays a good dividend, not suffer themselves to be distracted into vigilance by considerations of general patriotism. The second consists of those who are shocked, disgusted, and grievously robbed, and anxious to do something to put a stop to the abuses from which they suffer. But this class is numerically so small, that when it comes to counting votes, they are one against a thousand. Even if all the tax-payers were united, however, they could do little at elections. The non-taxpayers are in the majority, and they are completely controlled by ""the Ring."" It is true that the frauds and corruption of their leaders, and their persistent plunder of the City Treasury affects them as it does the property owners, but it affects them only indirectly, through their rents, and the price of their provisions, and it is of course always easy to conceal this from them, and ascribe the increasing drafts on their wages to the war and the paper money. Moreover, they are generally foreigners, generally very ignorant, unused to thinking on any subject, and least of all on political subjects.

The deceased, who was partially idiotic, took an apple from a store in Broome-street, and attempted to escape with it. In trying to cross the street, the horses attached to car No. 41 knocked the child down and trampled upon her; the car also passed over her neck. Coroner COLLIN held an inquest on the body at the Fourteenth Precinct Station-house, when it appeared that DANIEL CLINE, the driver of the car, did everything in his power to prevent the accident. In his testimony, the driver said the brake of the car was not in good order, and that if it, (the brake,) had worked well, the child's life might have been saved. The jury rendered the following verdict: ""We find that the deceased CATHARINE MILLER came to her death by injuries received by having been accidently run over by car No. 41 of the Fourth-avenue Railroad; and we exonerate the driver from all blame in the matter, and censure the Company for allowing a car with defective brakes to be driven, and we recommend the Company to have a flagman at the corner of Broome and Centre streets.""

JOHN BRIGHT addressed his constituents at Birmingham -- making the first speech that be has delivered since the famous Cobden-Delane Controversy. Mr. SCHOLEFIELD, M.P., of the same borough, preceded Mr. BRIGHT, and said, in the source of his speech on America, that the present war was not a war for the emancipation of the slaves, and if it were, it was not the less on that account an immoral and unjustifiable war. [Cheers and hisses.] The preservation of the Union was the great idea which pervaded the minds of the Northerners, from the President downward. The President on one occasion declared: ""My promised object in this struggle was to save the Union. [Cheers.] Without freeing any slave I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would do that. What I would do about colored men and slaves, I would do because I believe it helps to save the Union."" [Cheers.] After such an expression of opinion he was surprised to hear people say that the object of the President was to put down Slavery. [""Hear, hear,"" and marks of disapprobation.] The proclamation emancipating the slaves was issued by the President solely as a war measure to crush the rebellion and restore the Union. He believed that it was impossible to restore the Union by war. [Cheers and uproar.] If this was a war for the emancipation of the slave, then he said most emphatically that it was an immoral war. If it was morally right in America to put down Slavery in that country, it was equally morally right for this country to make war upon Spain to put down Slavery in Cuba, upon Russia to put down serfdom, or upon the King of Dahomey to put down infanticide. [Cheers, hisses and great uproar.] He had never been an advocate for peace at any price, but he had always been opposed to any war that was not a defensive war. An aggressive war was to his mind a great crime, and would never meet with his sanction and assent. He was told that he was blamed not so much for the opinions he had expressed in 1862, but for having joined a Confederate association. He thought he should have been more open to condemnation it after expressing his views he had not had the courage to carry them out. He was told that in consequence of the course he had taken he would lose his seat. Deeply as he valued the honor they had conferred upon him, there was something he valued still more highly than a seat in Parliament, and that was the right to speak and act freely and independently within the scope of the powers with which they themselves had intrusted him. If for the course he had taken they deemed him no longer worthy of representing them, he should bow to their decision without a murmur.

McCLONEY, of the U.S. Navy, died. At his residence, No. 23 Smith-street, Brooklyn, on the 11th instant, in the 69th year of his age. The deceased belonged to the old school of naval heroes who participated in the brilliant engagements with the British in the war of 1812. He entered the navy on the 1st of January of that year, (1812,) and took his first cruise in the United States sloop-of-war Wasp as midshipman, and participated in the fight between that vessel and H.B.M. sloop Frolic, commanded by the late Commodore JONES, in which the latter was captured. Both vessels were subsequently recaptured by H.B.M. ship Poictiers, and carried into Bermuda as prisoners of war. The officers and crew were released by cartel in November following, and in 1813 transferred by the U.S. authorities to the frigate Macedonian. Shortly after they went to Lake Ontario, where the Commodore remained until the close of the war. He afterward commanded a schooner on the Southern Station, and then became attached to the U.S. brig Saratoga as Acting Lieutenant. In 1821, he commanded the brig Dolphin, and then the Franklin, 74, in the Pacific Ocean, where he remained for three years and four months. In 1825, he was placed in command of the frigate Constitution (the old Ironsides) on the West India Station. In 1828-29, he commanded the sloops Fairfield, Lexington and Warren in the Mediterranean. During the Mexican war he commanded the U.S. sloop-of-war John Adams, and participated in the engagements with the Mexicans under Com. PERRY until the ending of hostilities. In 1852, he was ordered to the steam frigate Mississippi, as flag-officer, but on the eve of sailing was transferred to the command of the frigate Powhatan, which vessel was fitted out at Norfolk, Va., and sailed for Japan In February, 1853. He remained absent on this cruise for three years, being attached to the expedition of Commodore PERRY. His last cruise was as Commander of the Home Squadron, in which capacity he received the Japanese Ambassadors on his flagship, the Roanoke, at Aspinwall, and brought them to this country. By the act of Congress, since passed, he was retired from active service, and took up his residence in this city. The disease of which he died was contracted during the Mexican war, but he was enabled to remain at the post of duty until within the past eight years, since which time he had been an invalid. A wife and one daughter remain to mourn his loss. The funeral will take place from his late residence, No. 23 Smith street, on Monday, 15th inst., at 2 1/2 o'clock, P.M.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OBITUARY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OBITUARY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a9e1cc8c-2420-51f6-b7bf-1a7b64ede0aa,448,nyt://article/a9e1cc8c-2420-51f6-b7bf-1a7b64ede0aa,

The measure has had a stormy passage through the House, and there were times when we much feared it would suffer shipwreck. The Copperheads exhausted every resource of their peculiar tactics to obstruct action on the bill, and if they felt it was out of their power to kill it, they resolved at least to delay it as much as possible.

The advices which from time to time have come to us respecting the cause of the French invasion of that Republic and the progress on the war have been of such a fragmentary character and generally colored to suit the French market on the one hand or the Mexican sympathizers on the other, that to the reader who has not made the matter a special study, the exact primary and present condition of the case is still likely to be a mystery. But in the speech of M. THIERS, delivered in the French Chamber on the 26th ult., which we publish this morning, this whole question will be found lucidly explained, and evidently with the highest regard to truth.

Scatteration Policy in Warfare,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/13/archives/the-scatteration-policy-again.html,Scatteration Policy in Warfare,"-- We confess to a decided inability to appreciate the wisdom of such expeditions as that to Florida, which we record to-day. Gen. GILLMORE has suddenly transferred the scene of his operations from before Charleston to Jacksonville, and we do not think the change one much to the credit of those who directed it. If the detachment of the expeditionary force does not in the least jeopardize the possession of Morris Island, if its works and garrison are still sufficient to hold their own against any enterprises into which BEAUREGARD might be tempted, it still remains difficult to see any adequate object to be accomplished by it. Jacksonville has already been twice occupied by our troops, and twice abandoned as useless, and because the forces were wanted elsewhere. There is not the smallest military importance in Florida, for the rebels have no force there worth speaking of, and the State has no strategio value whatever. Had we indeed a surplus of force which we did not know how to dispose of, it might be worth while in a purely political sense, to send an expedition to Florida which would occupy il en permanence, and enable the State to come back into the Union. We believe a majority of the people of Florida are in sympathy with us, and would gladly see the restoration of their State; but in order that this shall be made available, it is necessary to insure the permanent protection of the people. They cannot afford to show their loyalty if this is merely to be such another flying visit as they have had every Summer for the past three years. But have we the force to spare to do this? Can we afford to send ten thousand men into a kind of military coventry merely to accomplish this object? Surely not. We trust there is a wisdom in this move other than meets the eye; but, for the present, we can't see it.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE SCATTERATION POLICY AGAIN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE SCATTERATION POLICY AGAIN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d4851db3-a081-5626-8909-149420c58318,327,nyt://article/d4851db3-a081-5626-8909-149420c58318,

I arrived at the headquarters of the cavalry reserve within half of a mile of the Ford, at 10 o'clock, A.M., and halted. At 10:35 I received orders to cross the river, which I succeeded in doing, and pushed the enemy back about half a mile, and then under orders not to press the enemy too hard, but to skirmish with him if he appeared so disposed, I halted my advance and made my disposition to hold the favorable ground which I had taken. In a short time the enemy began to concentrate troops in my immediate front, and to advance a stronger line of skirmishers. I communicated this fact to Corps Headquarters, through the signal officer, and asked for reinforcements; at 3:10 P.M., Cols. CARROLL and POWERS reported to me by order of Gen. HAYS, and I massed their brigades, (First and Second of the Third Division,) under cover from the enemy's fire, and in a position whence they could be readily deployed to the right or left, as circumstances might require. The enemy kept up a vigorous fire of small arms durng the day, and, at intervals, a heavy artillery fire from a battery in position on his left. Fresh troops were arriving continuously, and in great haste. At 5:20 P.M. the enemy opened with a heavy fire from his batteries, and shortly afterward advanced and attacked vigorously our right and right centre; but it was futile, as, under the personal supervision of the General commanding the division, the enemy was met and repulsed at all points.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.; Gen.

Mr. GOUGLEMAN kindly furnished one, and the soldier went on his way contented. His journey, however, extended only to the Park Burracks, where he offered himself as a veteran for reenlistment. He passed the examination was sworn in, and received his bounty, $50 of which he sent to his mother in Massachusetts; the balance he deposited with the oculist. Before the glass-eyed recraft was fairly one of the rank and file, his former Captain, knowing of his defect, mentioned the matter to the recruiting officer, who singled BAXTER out, and accused him of dishonesty. BAXTER protested that he wanted to fight for his country again, and that nobody would know he had a glass eye if they would mind their own business. The recruiting officer, not satisfied with the argument, and imagining there was some complicity between the recruit and the oculist, waited on the doctor and threatened to arrest him if he did not produce the money BAXTER had deposited with him. This Mr. GOUGLEMAN was very willing to do, as the whole of the a[???]air both as far as the eye was concerned and the money, was the result solely of a generous motive.

Since WILLIAM and VON BISMARK deserted from the ranks of the Confederation, the breach between them and the Lower Chamber has been widening. The deputies have passed a series of resolutions denouncing the conduct of the Government, as traitorous to Germany -- have refused to sanction the loan demanded by it to meet the expenses of the war -- and have proclaimed that they will resist the Austro-Prussian ""execution"" by every means in their power. The latter avowal, however, on the part of the Chamber, was hardly necessary, for its rejection of the Minister's scheme was ample evidence of its determination to embarrass him as far as possible. But the Premier has resolved not to be incommoded by the action of the House, if he can at all avoid it. He declared to the committee that, should the deputies refuse the loan, he would get the money wherever he could, and if he can only find capitalists who will run the risk of advancing the cash to the Government, he is the very man that will not scruple to take it. Meanwhile, the ministerialists, in order to retaliate on their adversaries, have commenced a regular series of attacks on the Constitution, and the privileges of the members.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Prussian Imbroglio', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Prussian Imbroglio', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Prussia', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e18be071-8902-5c29-bf37-c0c0837ad3c3,921,nyt://article/e18be071-8902-5c29-bf37-c0c0837ad3c3,

The members think it necessary to do everything instantly, lest the chance of doing anything should be lost forever. One would suppose that the prosecution of such a war as the Government has on its hands might wisely engross the attention of the National Legislature. The raising of men, the enactment of laws for the guidance and government of our armies, the wise imposition of sufficient and judicious taxes, these, and the kindred acts which the vigorous prosecution of the war requires, would seem to be sufficient for the present session. Congress thinks differently. It is fiercely eager for the settlement of all possible questions to which the war may now or hereafter give rise. What will be the position of the rebels after they are conquered; what shall be done with the lands we intend to seize; what is the present status, and what is to be the future history of the negro race; what loyalty is, and what it is not, -- these are some of the topics which Congress finds greater pleasure in discussing than in acting upon the plain, simple matters of business which might safely and profitably absorb their whole attention.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Congressional Follies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Congressional Follies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22967e30-bc01-55de-b852-27fab23c2cdc,868,nyt://article/22967e30-bc01-55de-b852-27fab23c2cdc,

It was understood that these columns were intended to act in conjunction the one to attack, and the other to cut off the retreat of POLK and FORREST, whe were scouring Central and Northern Mississippi. This movement was generally regarded as a great flanking movement on JOHNSTON'S army. A Nashville dispatch to the Cincinnati Gazette says that Gen. SHERMAN entered Jackson, Miss., on the 5th, the rebels offering but little resistance, and falling back over Pearl River. It was thought that the rebels were receiving reinforcements from Dalton. There was a considerable fight at Clinton, Miss., on the 4th. Our troops charged a rebel battery, and lost 15 killed and 30 wounded. The enemy were driven off, and our troops continued their advance. Another dispatch from Chattanooga says that Gen. THOMAS' army is now in motion for Tunnel Hill and Dalton. All these reports indicate a grand combination of movements, having in view the complete redemption of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/572a1893-93aa-51b4-b636-d2d194ceb231,440,nyt://article/572a1893-93aa-51b4-b636-d2d194ceb231,

Grant's Initiative in the Spring Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/18/archives/grants-initiative-in-the-spring-campaign.html,Grant's Initiative in the Spring Campaign,"There is no more encouraging feature of the grand campaign that has just opened up over the vast theatre of war, under control of Gen. GRANT, than the fact that it presents our armies in the imperial attitude that befits them -- that is, with all the moral and material power of the initiative on our side. Incalculably advantageous though this power be to the side able to wield it boldly, the campaigns of the past three years have too often presented the sorry spectacle of Union Generals and Union armies, in a war whose essential theory is the offensive, reduced to a passive defensive, waiting to take blows when they should have advanced to deliver them; and, on the other hand of the side whose natural attitude is one of defence, assuming a vigorous offensive and winning great advantages in consequence. LEE has twice been able to relieve the menaced Capital of the Confederacy by a bold initiative, forcing the Union armies across the Potomac, and pushing his invasion even into the Free States. It does not turn the force of the point to say that no direct material benefit was gained by these invasions -- that in both instances the test battle turned against the invaders; they gained enough to make the movements well worth while -- they relieved their soil of the Union armies for the time being, and they won prestige abroad, an element for which they are always willing to bid high. In like manner when the Army of the Cumberland, under Gen. BUELL, had advanced to within cannon range of Chattanooga, BRAGG was able, by a vigorous and timely assumption of the offensive, to throw his antagonist first back on Nashville, and then, by a second turning movement, threatening his communications, compel him to retire to his base on the Ohio.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""Grant's Initiative in the Spring Campaign."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""Grant's Initiative in the Spring Campaign."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'RICHMOND', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/22d0b7e0-70aa-55d5-afbe-7e624eb87008,1129,nyt://article/22d0b7e0-70aa-55d5-afbe-7e624eb87008,

Land Laws of England. Cobden-Delane Controversy,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/18/archives/the-land-laws-of-england.html,Land Laws of England. Cobden-Delane Controversy,"The discussion between Messrs. COBDEN and DELANE has given a fresh impetus to the discussion of the Land Laws in England, and it is now being carried on with such vigor that there is little doubt that the Liberal party will, before very long, be forced to take it up and give it the most prominent place in their political programme. We shall probably, within the next ten years, witness as potent an agitation on this subject as that which preceded the passage of the Reform Bill, followed by a revolution still wider and more radical. It will not be due altogether, or even mainly, to the growth of democratic feeling in England, although this is perceptible. It will be due rather to the fact that the tendency to concentrate property of all kinds, and especially property in land, in few hands, which has shown itself in England during the last two hundred years, has, during the last fifty years, increased with alarming rapidity. The growth of commerce and manufactures, so far from lessening the inequality of conditions which has long been the curse of English society, has increased them. The class of yeomen or small freeholders who were for centuries the bone and sinew of the English population, disappeared in the course of the last century; the small shopkeepers and manufacturers are being fast driven out of sight by the large capitalists, and the increase of wealth among the middle classes, so far from helping to break up the land monopoly, and facilitate its distribution among a larger body of holders, has so far helped to strengthen and narrow it. In other words, the men who have made fortunes in trade become themselves competitors for the large estates, and use all their money and influence in making land more and more of a fancy article, and in increasing the obstacles to its transfer. The great ambition of every Englishman who makes a fortune in business, is to purchase an estate in the country, not simply because this is the safest mode of investing his money, but because it is the great and only way to found a family and take a place among ""the aristocracy;"" and, of course, the easier it is to keep land together and regulate its descent, the easier it is to found the family. There is probably no class in England more enamored of entail and primogeniture than magnates who began life as errand boys or junior clerks in the city.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Land Laws of England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Land Laws of England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e153cd01-bc6e-5330-8eb6-94b0887f824f,849,nyt://article/e153cd01-bc6e-5330-8eb6-94b0887f824f,

The newspapers, which have been and are heartily in the service of the leaders, indicate it by the violence with which they speak of the shifts and schemes employed by the people to escape from the tyranny which is burdening them. And it is indicated more plainly by the notes of hostility and defiance which rise, and grow louder and louder, in those parts of the Confederacy where the people have not wholly thrown away their care for their own freedom in the intensity of the struggle the past three years. In North Carolina especially, do we find these developments. Public meetings are held, whose resolutions attack the Conscription Act, denounce the despotism of the Confederate Government, and call upon Gov.

Thus we understand that hundreds of men have lately been induced, by the arts of these men, to enlist in the heavy artillery. These agents hold out seductive representations of the charms of this branch of the service, and allure their victims by telling them they will have ""good beds,"" ""no marching"" to do, etc., etc. Now, it will be as well for recruits to understand at once that these baits are all a delusion and a snare. What the service now needs is not heavy artillery, but light infantry ; and those who enlist in the heavy artillery will, beyond a doubt, in the majority of cases, be ""transferred,"" and their dreams of ""good beds,"" etc., prove as unsubstantial as the baseless fabric of a vision. There are, doubtless, a certain class of men who would be unwilling to enlist for the everyday work of the war, whom yet the large bounties would tempt to volunteer for the kind of fancy duty pictured by the recruiting agents in their alluring posters. If the agents can only swell their commissions, they probably care little for the mere fact that the promises under which they induced their recruits to enlist cannot possibly be made good.

Query as to Quotas,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/19/archives/a-query-as-to-the-quotas.html,Query as to Quotas,"-It is a matter of regret that the Secretary of War or the Provost-Marshal-General has not yet seen fit to define precisely the meaning of the call for troops, under which the draft is ordered for the 10th of March. It is shrouded in the most embarrassing obscurity, and we have been left to infer its meaning from such unauthoritative intepretations as have been put upon it by Washington correspondents. It has been generally understood that the call for 500,000 men included the call of last November for 300,000 -- that is, was simply an addition of 200,000 to that levy. But it is now claimed that Provost-Marshal-General FRY has explicitly declared that the call for 500,000 not only includes last November's 300,000, but also the draft of last Summer, and counts in, also, commuters under the $300 exemption clause. According to this interpretation, quite a number of States have already filled their full quotas; and it would appear that the call was simply made, for the purpose of adjusting the balance of dues from the States that have not furnished the requisite number. If this be the correct interpretation, why not have an authoritative announcement to that effect? -- and, if it be not correct, it would certainly be worth while that the public should be disabused of the erroneous impression. It will make a very important difference in the number of men to be added to the army. If the total reinforcement to be added to our effective force in the field is to be limited to the number that will remain from the President's call after all the deductions named have been made, it would indicate either a very great confidence in the speedy crushing of the rebellion, or else a very inadequate appreciation of the imperative needs of the country. The coming draft will certainly produce the benefit of adjusting the balance, clearing off all old scores, and making a clean sheet for future requisitions if they should be needed -- what beyond that we have no means of judging. We trust, however, it will give in addition a surplus sufficient to add handsome reinforcements to the thinned ranks of our veteran regiments.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A QUERY AS TO THE QUOTAS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A QUERY AS TO THE QUOTAS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/964efd75-99f0-547a-903c-9a797361d572,367,nyt://article/964efd75-99f0-547a-903c-9a797361d572,

Houses and Rents in New-York,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/19/archives/houses-and-rents.html,Houses and Rents in New-York,"-The advance in rents of dwelling-houses, this Spring, though not yet definitely determined, promises to equal 25 to 35 per cent. over last year, and, if we are to judge by present indications, with a very limited supply of houses. This large advance certainly seems unexplainable on any other hypothesis than that rents during the past year have been below the proportionate rates of other articles of necessity, which few people will believe. The large advance now taking place is simply owing to the unusually large demand for houses, coming mainly from a class of people, transient in their abiding-places extravagant in their habits, never before among us, and destined, by changes of circumstances, social and political to leave, ere long, as suddenly a[???] they have come. The City is overrun with refugees from the South, speculators and others from all parts of the country, who have rushed hither, attracted by the mania for speedy money-making, or by the fact that this City offers the most varied facilities for spending time and money, while the re-establishment of peace is being awaited. The hotels and boarding-houses have been thronged all Winter by crowds of Southerners, to whom, in comparison with prices current in rebeldom, everything has seemed cheap. With no faith in rebel currency, and a strong suspicion of that of this Government, real estate, especially desirable dwelling-houses, has seemed the most attractive investment they could make, and sales of such property, at greatly enhanced prices, have been very large. The speculators and transient residents here, with full purses, are inspired with a desire to appear aristocratic and ostentatious at any price, and so we are having an immense influx of ""shoddy"" families, who seize the beat houses, at the highest rents, though they may never have seen a kitchen range, or be able to tell the difference between a speaking-tube and a penny whistle. Hundreds of families long resident here will be crowded out of their houses this Spring by this advance in rents, which they cannot afford to pay, and be compelled to take up with fewer conveniences, or find refuge in the country. But as long as ""shoddy"" pays well, we suppose there is no help for it, the only consolation being that this state of things will last no longer than does the money of the fast-livers, and we shall see these irruptions on the face of society disappear even more rapidly than they have appeared.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOUSES AND RENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOUSES AND RENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a75a02ba-d564-5274-ae4a-607042adb11e,533,nyt://article/a75a02ba-d564-5274-ae4a-607042adb11e,

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/20/archives/from-europe.html,,"The steamship City of Manchester, from Liverpool via Queenstown, arrived yesterday afternoon, bringing three days' later news. The war between Denmark and the German States had commenced. On the 31st of January, the Prussian Field-Marshal Gen. VON WRANGLE peremptorily summoned the Danes to evacuate Schleswig, which demand was refused by Gen. DE MEZA. Thereupon the Prussians passed the frontier, and shots were exchanged without effect. The Danes retreated, blowing up the Sorg bridge, and taking up a position near Missunde, on the River Schlei. Here, on the 2d, they were attacked by the Prussians, and a battle resulted, continuing six hours, in which troops of all arms were engaged, when the German forces were repulsed with severe loss. The battle was renewed on the 3d, at which time boats were ready for the transport of the German troops over the Schlei. Two Danish war-vessels had had an engagement with Prussian land batteries at Eckenforde. One ship was struck four times in the hull. No person was injured. On the 3d an embargo was placed upon all German shipping in Danish ports, and the first vessel detained was the Prussian brig Myrtha at Elsinore. The Danish fleet is considered numerous enough to carry out the embargo. The British Parliament was opened on the 4th by a speech from the Queen, and owing to the Danish question, the event excited the greatest interest, in anticipation that the policy of England would be speedily ascertained. An impression prevailed that the Government had left the matter open, to a considerable extent, to be influenced by the opinion of Parliament. The London Post says that England is in honor bound to furnish material support to Denmark, and other reports affirm that she is resolved to intervene actively in the conflict. Her first act would doubtless be the occupation of Copenhagen. It was possitively asserted that France and Russia would stand aloof, leaving England to act in the matter with out their assistance. In the Divorce Court on the 2d a motion was made in the case of the O'KANE-PALMERSTON scandal. The Queen's counsel moved that the case be made absolute, calling upon; the petitioner, O'KANE, to show cause why the trial should not at once proceed, or the case be stricken from the court records. The petitioner, in a letter to his solicitor, decides to drop the suit, but asserts his ability to prove his allegations. The London Times has an editorial on Mr. SEWARD's instructions to Mr. ADAMS to press the claims for damages done by the Alabama and reasserts its oft-expressed argument against the liability of the British Government. It questions whether Secretary SEWARD is in earnest, but will not suspect him of a design to seek a quarrel with England. Sir JOHN LAWRENCE, the new Viceroy to India, arrived at Calcutta on the 12th. The war on the frontier had ended. On the 5th of January the pirate Alabama was reported to be on the watch for vessels fifty miles south of Rangoon, which information conflicts with the report via San Francisco, that she was blockaded at Amoy on the 2d by the gunboat Wyoming. The Emperor NAPOLEON had received the address of the Corps Legislatif, and in reply dwelt on the necessity of maintaining a stable Government.

It was not a difficult subject, perhaps, for a biographer, especially for one so well versed in the details of the art as the historian of Spanish literature. The character of Mr. PRESCOTT was a simple one in general, though it had its peculiarities; and his career, from the necessities imposed by his condition of health, and the uniform nature of his pursuits, had but little variety. Yet within these limits, the story told by his biographer has much of the picturesque, while what in the lives of other authors might be considered as ordinary incidents, in his case became extraordinary by the peculiar privation which he suffered, and by the energy of will and overmastering purpose which enabled him to overcome all defects, and achieve triumphs seldom won by those in possession of every advantage. The life of any successful man must always be of interest, for success in general implies a nice adaptation of means to ends, some happy disposition of nature, and an honest and laborious improvement of it. We care not what calling he may have pursued, if it be a worthy one and he has achieved distinction in it, it will repay us to sit down with the man, whether he be farmer, mechanic, merchant, sailor, soldier, statesman or what not, and listen to his narrative, first how he ruled his own spirit, and then came to rule or be superior to his fellows.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'LIFE OF WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT.

A gun, with calibre of 20 inches diameter, was cast on the Rodman principle, in some 22 minutes from the time of tapping the furnaces. The arrangements for casting this mammoth piece of ordnance were most perfect, and during its process everything worked like clock-work. The amount of metal used for this huge gun was 85 tons, or 170,000 pounds. The metal was melted in three furnaces, which were charged at 5 o'clock in the morning. At twenty minutes past twelve, everything being in readiness, the three furnaces were simultaneously tapped, and the molten metal was conveyed by means of three conductors to a large reservoir close to the mold. The mold was set perpendicularly in a mammoth pit, and was held in position by huge chains suspended from two large cities of a lifting capacity of forty tons each, and worked by steam. As soon as the reservoir was sufficiently charged, the metal flowed from it into the mold, and in twenty-two minutes from the time of tapping the furnaces, the mold was filled to within a few inches of the top. As the metal settled, the mold was filled by the workmen with metal from furnaces held in reserve in case of accident. The casting was perfected without the slightest confusion, the whole being done under the immediate superintendence of Mr. JOSEPH KAYE, foreman of the works.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A Twenty-Inch Gun.; CASTING AT THE FORT PITT FOUNDRY', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Twenty-Inch Gun.; CASTING AT THE FORT PITT FOUNDRY', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'From the Pittsburgh Chronicle, Feb. 12', 'person': [{'firstname': '', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': 'Feb', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': '', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/142d8796-f70c-5c68-9413-35875188d488,806,nyt://article/142d8796-f70c-5c68-9413-35875188d488,

Howell Cobb's Speech,"The speech of HOWELL COBB, which we published a day or two since, pressed upon the people of Georgia two important points. The first was the absolute necessity of sending into the rebel army every man who could be found. He appealed to his hearers, with all the force that he was master of, to throw no obstacles in the way of the most stringent means of filling up the rebel ranks. If there was a prejudice which he could excite, if there was a false impression which he could produce, if there was a fear which he could call up before them, that would tend to prevent them from resisting or impeding this general conscription, he brought them all forward. He eulogized the rebel President, as he must needs when he was compelled to tell his hearers that he alone could say ""who shall and who shall not be called into the field,"" and that"" no other tribunal can decide that question; we must leave this power to him, or all must be lost;"" and he had no words bitter enough for the men who tried to evade this call of the one man whom the necessities of the rebellion have clothed with absolute power over those deluded men who abandoned the Government of their fathers in pursuit of a ""delusive phantom.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Rebel Needs and Resources', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Rebel Needs and Resources', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Cobb, Howell', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/4650c892-5e72-518e-8680-c180d9b9161c,784,nyt://article/4650c892-5e72-518e-8680-c180d9b9161c,

It consisted of letters from all parts of the United States, and had been left at a store on Baltimore-street, with a message to deliver it to a boy. It was given to the boy tied up in a newspaper, and by him delivered to the schooner Kent, bound to Herring Bay, Anne Arundel County. The schooner was taken on the river on suspicion of having goods bound for Dixie, and upon search the mail was found in a black traveling-bay belonging to one of the hands on board. An investigation traced it to the store spoken of, where the facts were learned about it. Besides the mail, a small lot of goods was found on board for Dixie, among which was, a small package for Gen. WINDER, Provost-Marshal-General, Richmond, and a number of excellent maps of the harbor of Charleston, and other important points of military interest. Besides the above, the force of Marshal MCPHAIL discovered a large deposit of gun caps, military braid, drugs, &c, which had been left on the roadside by a blockade-runner.

Effect of War in Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/21/archives/from-europe.html,Effect of War in Europe,"By the arrival yesterday of the steamship Africa at Halifax, we have three days' later advices from Europe. The news concerning the Dano-German war is very meagre. A dispatch from Hamburg on the morning of the 6th says that severe fighting has been going on, as numbers of wounded were constantly coming into Rends-burg; but no particulars were received, and it was supposed that the Prussians had prohibited the transmission of news. A later dispatch announces the evacuation of Schleswig by the Danes, and its occupation by the Allies. Nothing is known as to the capture of Missunde. The attack on that position on the 2d was made by a force of two thousand Prussians, who were opposed by two thousand Danes. The Prussians twice attempted to carry the Danish works by assault, and were repulsed on both occasions with heavy loss. In the British Parliament the Queen's Speech had been under consideration by both Houses, and an address in reply had been adopted. In the course of the debate in the House of Lords on the foreign policy of the Government, Earl DERBY characterized the policy of Earl RUSSELL as humiliating to England, and repudiated the idea of British responsibility to the Government of the United States for the depredations of the Alabama. He trusted such a reply had been forwarded, to Wadhington as would forever put an end to such demands. In his reply Earl RUSSELL said that England had not given the slightest promise of assistance to Denmark. In the Commons, during the discussion of the speech, Mr. DISRAELI expressed himself of the opinion that the Queen should have made some allusion to American affairs, and complained of her silence. Lord PALMERSTON replied vigorously, defending the course of the Government. At a ball given on the 3d inst. by LOUIS NAPOLEON, at the Tuileries, he remarked to a knot of Field-Marshals and Generals that the war in the North did not concern France, and her course, therefore, would be non-intervention -- a sentiment which was concurred in by those to whom it was addressed.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b7df663e-8499-56c1-a9f4-44efe653aef1,347,nyt://article/b7df663e-8499-56c1-a9f4-44efe653aef1,

A wife was murdered by her husband, and so far as the investigation of the case has proceeded, it would seem that it was almost coid-blooded and diabolical act. The actors in the drama are EDWARD HUNTER and his wife ELIZABETH; the former about 47 years of age, a native of England the latter aged 44 years, and reported to have been born in Albany, this State. For some time past the two have not been living on good terms, and it appears from the testlmony which we publish below, that the wife left her husband some time ago, and has since steadily refused to cohabit with him on the ground of ill-treatment which it is alleged was practiced by him to such an extent that her life became endangered. On Friday evening some of the members of the family, who reside with the father in Seventh-avenue, wishing to go to the theatre sent for the mother, who was living by herself in Tenth-street, to go to No. 339 and take charge of an infant during the evening. The wife and mother went to the house of her husband, and while all the family, except a lad 11 years of age, were absent at the theatre, the murder was committed. The deed was performed with a hatchet, the blade of which was sunk deep into the brains of the poor woman. The deceased is said, by those who knew her best, to have been a most amiable and inoffensive woman. The husband was arrested soon after the deed was committed.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; SHOCKING TRAGEDY IN SEVENTH-AVENUE.

This could, of course, scarcely be said if the subject had possessed no importance for the outside world, except an ethnological or physical one. In that case, nothing could be more natural than that the mass of people should be content with such accounts of them as those whites who had more dealings with them chose to tell; but the question of their laziness or industry, their strength or weakness, their acquisitiveness or carelessness, their docility or indocility, have, for over half a century, been of the very greatest interest in a commercial point of view. The supply of at least two of the articles which play the most prominent part in modern trade, is both entirely due to their labor. Their quality as laborers was, therefore, a matter of great interest to merchants, even while they were all slaves; and soon as any portion of them became free, of course it became of twice as great interest as ever. Accordingly, few discussions have ever been carried on with more violence and persistence than that about the industrial value of the few negroes of the British West Indies, and yet at the end of thirty years nobody seems to know much more about it than at the outset. The planters, whose ruin emancipation has either caused or precipitated, maintained stoutly that it was impossible to secure from free negroes the regular and steady labor necessary for the successful cultivation of either cotton or sugar. One portion of the public here and in England has always accepted their testimony as conclusive; another portion refused to believe them, both on general principles of human nature, and because the witnesses were interested parties and naturally prejudiced in favor of the slave system and against the negro. As the demand for cotton and sugar, and especially cotton, continued to increase, and as land was to be had in Jamaica and elsewhere for an old song, and as both Englishmen and Americans have been ransacking the earth for the last half century for things to speculate in, it will always remain a marvel that no effort was made up to this day to test the matter practically, by offering the free negroes regular wages for regular work. Nothing seems simpler than to go to Jamaica, buy a plantation, and try, cash in hand, to get the blacks to labor. Half the ventures in which merchants risk their capital every day are twice as wild as this, and yet it was positively never done; and if this war had not broken out, it is probable it never would have been done; a singular illustration of the force of a prejudice, even among such an intensely practical class as capitalists looking out for an investment.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ordeal of Free Black Labor.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ordeal of Free Black Labor.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/d290f647-e120-5328-ac16-0794ca70c99a,1068,nyt://article/d290f647-e120-5328-ac16-0794ca70c99a,

Monarchy has, in fact, succeeded in England, because in England monarchy is no longer itself, but a nomocracy -- a government of law, a government of the representatives of the people, not that of the individual, whether man or woman, who wears the crown. Various attempts have been made, in the present century, to establish English constitutionalism on the European Continent, vat if we excent the Nehterlands which have been ever free since they threw off the Spanish yoke, and the recently formed Kingdom of Italy, those attempts have everywhere proved partial or total failures.

"Circular of Attorney-General on; Dinner and Presentation to; Williams, Austin B.",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/22/archives/benefits-of-the-amnesty-circular-of-the-attorneygeneral-washington.html,"Circular of Attorney-General on; Dinner and Presentation to; Williams, Austin B.","SIR: Many persons, against whom criminal indictments or against whom property proceedings under the confiscation laws are pending in the courts of the United States, growing out of the participation of such persons in the existing rebellion, have in good faith taken the oath prescribed by the Proclamation of the President, of the 8th of December. 1863, and have therefore entitled themselves to the full pardon and restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and where the rights of third parties have intervened, which that proclamation offers and secures. The President's pardon of a person guilty of acts of rebellion will, of course, relieve that person from the penalties incurred by his crime, and where an indictment is pending against him therefor, the production of the pardon, signed by the President, or of satisfactory evidence that he has complied with the conditions on which the pardon is offered, if he be not of the class excepted from the benefits of the proclamation, will be a sufficient reason for discontinuing such criminal proceedings and discharging him from custody therein. Nor is it less doubtful that a bona fide acceptance of the terms of the President's Proclamation by persons guilty of acts of rebellion, and not of the excepted class, will secure to such a person a restoration of all the rights of property except as to slaves, and where the rights of third parties shall have intervened; not-withstanding such property may, by reason of those acts of rebellion, have been subject to confiscation under the provisions of the Confiscation Acts of Aug. 6, 1861, chapter 60, and July 17, 1862. chapter 195. For without adverting to any other source of power in the President to restore their rights of properly, the 13th section of the Act of July 17, 1862, authorizes the President, at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion, in any State or part there of, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare. It will hardly be questioned, I suppose, that tne purpose of this section, inserted in a law mainly intended to reach the property of persons engaged in the rebellion was to vest the President with full power to relieve such persons on such conditions as he should prescribe from the penalty of loss of their property by confiscation. Although the proceedings for confiscation under the Acts of August 6, 1861, and July 17, 1862, are in rem against the property seized, ye under both acts the ground of condemnation is the personal guilt of the owner in aiding the rebellion. By the pardon and amnesty, not only is the punishment of that personal guilt remitted, but the offence itself is effaced, that being the special effect of an act of amnesty of the Government. Of course it arrests and puts to an end all penal proceedings founded thereon, whether they touch the person or the property of the offender. There is, therefore, no case of judicial proceedings to enforce the penalties of acts of rebellion which cannot be reached and cured by the constitutional or statutory powers of the President to grant pardon and amnesty, whether those proceedings be against the person of the offender by criminal indictment, or against his property under the Confiscation Acts referred to. The President has accordingly directed me to instruct you that in any case where proceedings have been commenced and are pending and undetermined in the district or Circuit Courts of the United States for your District, against a person charged with acts of rebellion, and not of the excepted class, whether they be by indictment or seizure and libel of his property for confiscation, the rights of other parties not having intervened, you will discontinue and put an end to these proceedings, whenever the person so charged shall produce evidence satisfactory to you that he has, in good faith, taken the oath and complied with the conditions prescribed by the President's Proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863. Nor is it necessary that the evidence he produces should be a deed of pardon signed by the President. It would be quite impossible for the President to furnish the multitude who are now availing themselves of the benefits of the proclamation, and who are likely to do so hereafter, with this formal evidence of pardon; it will be sufficient to justify your action if the party seeking to be relieved from further proceeding shall prove to your full satisfaction that he has in good faith taken the oath, and brought himself within the conditions of pardon and amnesty set forth in the proclamation. If in any case you have good reason to believe that the oath has been taken for the mere purpose of obtaining the possession of personal property seized under the Confiscation Acts, with intent to remove it from the subsequent reach of the officers of the law, you will make report of the facts and reasons for your belief at this office before discontinuing the proceedings or restoring such property to the possession of the owner. Fugitives under section 5 of the Act of July 13, 1861, chapter 3, are not of the class reached by the President's Proclamation; for under that act, the question whether the property seized is subject to forfeiture depends upon the predicament of the property itself, and not upon the personal guilt or innocence of its owner. In this respect forfeitures under that act have more resemblance to cases of prize of war captured at sea as enemy's property, than to proceedings under the Act of August 1861, and July 1862. Such forfeitures are provided, not so much to punish the owner for disloyal acts, as to prohibit commercial intercourse and weaken the public enemy, which are always efficient instruments and legitimate effects of public war. But although the remission of forfeitures under the Act of July, 1861, are thus not within the scope of the Proclamation of Pardon, still ample power is conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury by the 8th section of that act to mitigateor remit all forfeitures and penalties incurred under the act. And it is not to be doubted that in all proper cases under that act, where the owner of the property residing in the territory in rebellion compiles with the condition of the proclamation, the Secretary of the Treasury will exercise the power of remission of such forfeiture in the same spirit of generous forbearance and liberality which inspired and characterized the proclamation.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BENEFITS OF THE AMNESTY.; Circular of the Attorney-General.

Edinburg Review on England Preceding Waterloo,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/23/archives/the-war-and-our-prosperity.html,Edinburg Review on England Preceding Waterloo,"Almost all foreign criticisms on our war, and a very large number of the domestic ones have been based on the assumption that war is necessarily fatal to national prosperity, if protracted beyond a very short period. In other words, that the outbreak of hostilities reduces production to a point at which saving or the accumulation of capital becomes impossible. The fact of a nation being engaged in an armed struggle, however, let it be on ever so extensive a scale, is by itself no more a proof that its progress is suspended, than lavish expenditure on the part of an individual that he is ruining himself. We have in each case to ascertain the proportion borne by the outlay to the income before we can form any opinion in the matter. If the drafts made by war on the labor and capital of the country be so heavy that there is no surplus after the ordinary wants of the people and the army are satisfied, it is high time to make peace. The prolongation of the contest after this point produces much the same effect as bleeding might be expected to produce in a man who was suffering from debility.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War and our Prosperity.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War and our Prosperity.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1cf105c7-8c19-556d-9236-f5b5666cb795,1093,nyt://article/1cf105c7-8c19-556d-9236-f5b5666cb795,

Having gone forward to stay, and expecting to open up a new base on the Gulf, he cut himself entirely loose from his base on the Mississippi, abandoned his line of communications, tore up the railroad and bridges in his rear, and thus severed all communication with the world that is behind and awaits with eagerness the reports of his progress.

"Livingston, Edward, Life of, by C. H. Hunt; Dana, J. T. Text-Book of Geology",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/23/archives/new-books.html,"Livingston, Edward, Life of, by C. H. Hunt; Dana, J. T. Text-Book of Geology","The author of this handsome volume was attracted toward the subject of it from being intrusted to prepare the notice of EDWARD LIVINGSTON'S life for The New American Cyclopedia. Finding that no satisfactory record existed of the man whose career so strongly excited his sympathies, he determined to become his biographer. After the commencement of his task he was, fortunately for his purpose, intrusted with the whole mass of private papers and correspondence left by Mr. LIVINGSTON, and still in the custody of his surviving daughter and her husband. The unrestrained use of these invaluable materials has enabled him to produce a work of singular interest -- one, indeed, as important for the civil and political history of the times in which its subject was a chief actor, as it is delightful in picturing to the life, a character almost unique in his talents, virtues, and loveable qualities. LIVINGSTON, indeed, was no common man. He combined in unexampled measure with the high ability and culture that connect his name with his country's glory, the domestic virtues, the sweetness of temper, and the charm of untroubled cheerfulness, through the most wearing vicissitudes of fortune, that endeared him to his family and private friends. The circumstances that placed him in the light of a penal legislator and jurist, caused his name to be better known to the educated public than that of any other American, WASHINGTON alone excepted. How nobly he filled the functions allotted to him, the slightest acquaintance with legal literature will show. His System of Penal Law for the State of Louisiana, is never named by philosophical jurists without praise. Its publication fixed his rank among the leading reformers and philanthropists of the day, while its professional merits have secured him in the deliberate judgment of the ""most competent living authority, the title of the first legal genius of modern times."" This work, though admittedly the crowning monument of his fame, and sufficiently important to have occupied the working hours of an ordinary life, was one incident -- a mere episode in the busied and varied career of its author. The recital of this must be sought in Mr. HUNT's volume by the rising generation; but it still lives in the memory of many cotemporaries of his later years. Few men have filled with equal success the parts of so many-sided a life of public service. Repeatedly a member of Congress, United States Attorney, Mayor of New-York, Aid-de-Camp and Military Secretary to Gen. JACKSON, United States Senator from Louisiana, Secretary of State, and Minister to France -- in all capacities he was never found wanting, but secured the esteem and respect of all that were associated with him. He was, in every sense, a genuine son of New-York. Mr. HUNT commences his work with an interesting genealogical sketch of his family, the LIVINGSTONS, who have played a part of such importance in our State and colonial annals; and it should not be forgotten that his noble disregard of self, and devotion to the sufferers in the fearful prevalence of yellow fever in New-York during the term of his Mayoralty in 1803, it was that exposed him to the abuse of his confidence by a subordinate, from whence resulted the temporary ruin of his fortunes, and his removal to the Southern section of the country, with which his name became afterwards associated, even more intimately than with his native State. A vacant niche in the Pantheon of American Biography has been well filled by Mr. HUNT's labor of love. By it the man and the statesman is securely placed in the attitude that will be appreciated by posterity, when personal memories have faded out. Mr. BANCROFT's introduction is a masterly sketch of LIVINGSTON's services to his country. A word must be said about the mechanical execution of the book. It is equal in typography to the best current specimens of European bookmaking, and in paper, print, and graphic embellishment leaves nothing to be desired.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEW BOOKS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'REVIEW', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MISCELLANEOUS', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': 'LIFE OF EDWARD LIVINGSTON.

We understand that a committee has been appointed which will at once proceed to investigate these charges, which relate to alleged deficiencies in the boarding department, severity in the discipline of the institution, &c. The management of this, which is one of the oldest and most useful of our charitable institutions, is in the hands of some of our most excellent and most highly esteemed citizens, who give to it a great deal of their time and personal attentention. They allege that these complaints emanate from a few of the pupils, who have been necessarily restrained in the indulgence of vicious propensities, and who have taken this method of revenging themselves. Whatever the facts of the case may be, it is well that they are to be made the subject of prompt official inquiry; and it is to be hoped that the results may be laid with equal promptness before the public, whose judgment in the matter should not be prejudged by one-sided statements.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE ASYLUM FOR THE BLIND.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE ASYLUM FOR THE BLIND.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/acaa8755-5bf5-5985-8c40-4d6d9354b9e4,192,nyt://article/acaa8755-5bf5-5985-8c40-4d6d9354b9e4,

Their contents are interesting. The particulars of affairs in Alabama, especially at Mobile, are meagre, but show that SHERMAN's approach had inspired the authorities with great fear. The escapade of Union officers from Libby Prison had created great excitement, and the papers award the fugitives great credit for their adroitness. Fifty-eight of the one hundred and nine who escaped, are said to have been recaptured. The rebel Congress adjourned on the 18th for a vacation until May next, after passing the Tax Currency and Military Bills, and appointing a day of fasting and prayer on the 8th of April next. These measures are of the most desperate character. The present currency is compulsorily funded by a repudiation of one-third of its value on the 1st of April next; a tax of live to fifteen per cent, is levied on all real, personal, or mixed property; while the conscription sweeps all classes and conditions into the army. The habeas corpus is suspended, and tobacco and cotton are to be run through the blockade, to get food from foreign sources. The Congress issued a long address before it adjourned, intended to bolster up the hopes of the desponding rebels a few months longer. An article in the Richmond Examiner, on the prospects of the Confederacy, reviews the military situation, and thanks its stars that matters are no worse than they are -- that certain anticipated disasters have not occurred, and that a recent rebel raid actually captured a railroad train and a steamboat -- from which it draws the consolation that rebel prospects are hopeful and cheering.

"By the steamers Hecla and City of London, which arrived at this port yesterday, we have foreign advices to Feb. 11 inclusive, four days later. The news is highly interesting.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/25/archives/from-europe.html,,"By the steamers Hecla and City of London, which arrived at this port yesterday, we have foreign advices to Feb. 11 inclusive, four days later. The news is highly interesting. In Parliament, on the 9th and 10th, brief but important debates took place concerning the dispatches of Mr. SEWARD to Mr. ADAMS, in which he alludes to claims for indemnification which this Government may present for the ravages done by the Anglo-rebel privateers. The Earl of Derby demanded to know if such a dispatch had been received by the British Government, and Earl ROSSELL said not. Mr. LAYARD, in the House of. Commons, on the 10th, made a statement to the same effect. The case of the Alexandra was likely to come before the House of Lords. The war in Denmark was progressing very unfavorably for the Danes. The pressure of the Austro-Prussian forces was so great that the Danish Commander had evacuated Schleswig entirely and abandoned the great Danish fortification, the Dannewerke, leaving sixty guns to fall into the hands of the Germans. Several severe engagements had been fought, resulting against the Danes, though not without severe loss to the invaders. An engagement occurred on the 6th near Obersse, between the Austrians and Danes, in which the latter were defeated, with the loss of six guns and 200 prisoners. Col. Prince WILLIAM, of Wurtemburg, was severely wounded. A telegram from Kiel, of the 7th, says the Danes were retreating in great haste to Jutland, leaving the Germans in full occupation of Schleswig. The excitement in Copenhagen, because of the abandonment of the Dannewerke, was so great as to induce the King to recall the Danish Commander and his Chief of Staff, and a strong clamor was setting against the King. A dispatch from Flensburg, Feb. 9, says the Germans took that place after a severe fight, in which they lost 1,100 in killed and wounded. Rumors of an armistice prevailed, but they were not authentic, for the Danish Bigsraad had voted in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war. The comments of the English and French press on recent events was one of regret that Denmark should have been placed in such a humiliating position, but offering no succor. The English papers warn Austria and Prussia against pursuing their course to an extremity, and that a day of retribution will soon be at hand. The tone of the German press and official documents seemed to grow bolder and more defiant with the successful advance of the armies. The pirate Florida left Brest on the night of the 9th, and the Kearsage was supposed to be in pursuit.

It would be a little curious if YULEE should avail himself of this. He was one of the active conspirators at Washington during the closing months of Mr. BUCHANAN's Administration, forming one of that little clique of Senators and members of Congress from the South who directed the movements of the rebels in the Southern States, and pulled the wires of the secession machinery. Among the letters recently found in the houses of leading rebels at the South was one from YULEE, written from Washington early in January, 1861, saying that, upon consultation, the Secession members had decided to remain in Congress as long as possible, in order to defeat measures that might be brought forward against the rebellion -- such as raising troops, making loans, &c., &c. These men staid there just as long as they could be useful to the rebel cause and escape hanging, and then they resigned, and went to their own place. YULEE was one of them. It would be nothing remarkable to see him turning back again, and taking the oath he has already broken, for the sake of avoiding the punishment he has richly deserved.

The old but ever acceptable opera of ""Somnambula"" afforded the opportunity for the second appearance of Signor BRIGNOLI. He appeared, in the first and second acts, to have recovered a good share of the confidence which failed him, for a time, on Monday night. He was finely supported by Miss KELLOGG, who appears to peculiar advantage in this opera. The second act went off with decided eclat, and BRIGNOLI and KELLOGG were called before the curtain. But, to the disappointment of the audience, BRIGNOLI somehow found himself unequal or unwilling to go on with the third act, and that most disagreeable of all opera incidents, an apology ""from Indisposition,"" was the consequence.

In fact, there has been no characteristic of the contest so marked and so strange as the absence of vindictiveness on the part of the people of the Free States. Our offences against good taste have consisted rather in exaggerated estimates of our own strength, and undue depreciation of that of the enemy; or, to put it in plain English, in inordinate bragging, than in abuse or scolding. This calm or phlegm, whichever it may be called, has unquestionably been a source of military weakness; but it has, as unquestionably, been a proof of moral strength.

It was certainly a little remarkable that so many gentlemen, living in so remote a region, should happen to be in this City at the same time; but it is not at all singular that, being here, they should unite in paying a tribute of respect and grateful acknowledgment to one who has evinced so zealous and so enthusiastic an interest in the progress of their Territory as Gov. GILPIN, In response to a complimentary toast, the Governor made some interesting remarKs concerning the general prospects of Colorado, and the relations of the central portions of the continent to the welfare of the Union and tne grand future of the American people.

The facts as sworn to may be substantially set forth as follows: On Monday, the ???5th inst., Mrs. Kinder, and her sister, Josephine Maull, the latter living at No. 129 Cannon-street, N.Y., called by previous agreement on Benj. Martin, druggist, corner of Houston and Manhattan streets, N.Y., and the former there drank, by his advice, a quantity of the oil of tansy extract of cotton and gin; the druggist suggested to her that she better go to a person on Broadway whom he knew and where he had taken many persons situated as she was; she preferred the mixture and drank it. On leaving he desired her to call again if the desired result was not produced, when he would repeat the dose. Before reaching her home in Brooklyn, E.D., she was seized with vomiting fits, which continued until she died. This fatal termination occurred two hours after drinking the medicine. The druggist was immediately arrested, and the inquest yesterday resulted in his being held to await the action of the Grand Jury. The testimony of all the physicians agreed as to the effect of the tansy, and that a very large dose must have been taken. Eight drops were discovered by a chemical analysis to the contents of the stomach and intestines, which was considered to be an overdose. An affidavit from Mrs. Langhorn, of Seventh-street, New-York, now suffering from a similar dose administered by the same druggist, was read, and her physician was sworn. The two cases were every way similar. The sister of the deceased testified that Martin tried to prevail on her to screen him by telling a different story, and said his act was a State Prison offence. Martin is of Massachusetts birth, 46 years of age. The deceased was the wife of a Lieutenant in the One Hundred and Thirty-third New-York Volunteers, and 23 years old.

He gave a good description of the happiness felt by the negroes when they heard FARRAGUT's guns, and of their love for Gens.

He understood that the rams were detained by an order of Government in September, and that they were seized in October. From that time until Saturday last no steps were taken to Obtain a judicial decision as the legality of the seizure. On Friday last an information was issued which might have been filed In October or November, and in that way the question might have been brought to an early issue. Since that information was filed he was informed that Messrs. LAIRD had received an intimation that it was now necessary to send out a commission, four months after seizure, for the purpose of collecting evidence. He thought the production of the correspondence between this country and the United States, on the subject of these seizures, could have no sort of bearing upon the case about to be brought before the courts, that case being simply whether Messrs. LAIRD had or had not, in constructing these vessels, infringed the municipal laws of England. He reminded Lord RUSSELL that the papers he objected to produce had already been made public in America and laid before Congress. What he wanted to see now was the English as well as the American version. The noble Earl (DERBY) had copies extracted from the correspondence laid before Congress, and said the impression produced was that the Government had been compelled by the menaces and pressure placed upon them by the United States to make concessions, which they had refused to make in the first instance, in addition to the correspondence in reference to the Alabama and the steam rams. He wished also to have a copy laid before Parliament of any correspondence that may have taken place in reference to acts of violation committed by American cruisers upon English vessels. Alluding to the threat of the American Government, in a dispatch to Mr. ADAMS, to follow such vessels as the Alabama and the Florida in British waters, and seize them even If under the protection of the British flag, he said the dispatch, although not officially communicated to Her Majesty's Government, had nevertheless been laid before Congress, and it was expedient that we should come to a thorough understanding with the American Government on the subject.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'ENGLAND.; THE AMERICAN QUESTION IN PARLIAMENT.

We are daily becoming mentally richer, also, the stock of native ideas fructifies, and, above all, is constantly increasing that inalienable heritage of coming generations, the memories of our good and great men -- the home crop of heroes springing from the soil, true to its instincts and sympathies, sharers of our conflicts and leaders of our victories. As ""star after star decays"" on earth, and the National pantheon enlarges its boundaries to admit those who become immortal, the voice of the true sage proves, perhaps, even more potent than when it was heard in life, for counsel, rebuke or warning, in seasons of difficulty and danger. The smoke and stir of turmoil no longer obscure theirtrue proportions; the asperities of life are softened, and a wider audience is prepared to listen to utterances that formerly provoked to anger, or were received with indifference. Conspicuous among those ""standard-bearers of humanity"" recently departed, is the remarkable man commemorated in these goodly volumes.

The labels were loaded with all the substantials and delicacies of the season, and surrounded by one of the most merry and jolly parties Imaginable. President E.W. DODGE made the opening speech, and welcomed the guests in a manner so sincere and hearty that they all felt as much at home as if they were old members of the club. Messers. CHARLES S. SPENCER, RICHARD BUSTEED and many other gentlemen spoke, and added to the interest of the evening. The old patriot soldier, BURNS, the only man who represented the Pennsylvania militia at Gettysburgh, was present, and I received much-attention. The glee club, composed of Messrs. A. SPENCER, G.W. ABBEY, JAS MILLER, J.T. KENT and W. B, TAYLOR, all of Utica, favored the company with some excellent singing; it is probably the best amateur glee club in the State. As set forth in the President's speech, the North Woods Walton Club was organized in 1857. Among its members are some of the most prominent men of the State, and in all sections of the State can its adherents be found. Its cardinal creed is that every man should once a year break away from the cares of business, ??? to the wilds, the lakes, the forests, and enjoy the sports found thereat and therein. So annually the members seek the wilderness of the north woods, build their huts, rely on their guns and their trout tackle for their sport and subsistence; on the beauties of nature and their own good companionship and jollity for the rest of what constitutes their annual enjoyment.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9f7969fc-a124-5b89-bc7d-7e2261bde009,1187,nyt://article/9f7969fc-a124-5b89-bc7d-7e2261bde009,

Capt. TYLER produced charts showing that there were three distinct channels, varying from 1,000 to 3,000 yards in width, open to an enemy's vessels, and which channels he said could not be obstructed, yet, as the Keokuk had been sunk at a distance of 700 yards, these channels could not be entered by our iron-clads.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'English Jealousy of Our Iron-clads.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'English Jealousy of Our Iron-clads.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/1049fdda-10ca-5f3d-9464-3be9b004ab20,1681,nyt://article/1049fdda-10ca-5f3d-9464-3be9b004ab20,

DAVIS is a native of Bath, England. He has been residing in Quebec, Canada, for some time past, and about a week since came to this City, and immediately engaged himself to Mrs. MARY MCLEISH, of No. 110 Grand-street, as waiter. On Friday Mrs. MCLEISH gave DAVIS a wallet containing $500, with instructions to convey the same to Mr. MCLEISH in another part of the building. Instead of doing as required, DAVIS ran away with the money. The Detective Police and other officers were at once notified, but the thief could no be found until yesterday afternoon, when Officer STANDISH, of the Twenty-sixth Precinct, caught him at the British Steamship office, as he was in the act of purchasing tickets for Liverpool. On searching his person all the stolen money was found except what he had expended in purchasing a suit of clothes. When taken before Justice DOWLING and confronted by Mr. and Mrs. MCLEISH, he denied having ever been in their employ. Mrs. MCLEISH was confident he was the right man, and yet she said there was something about his appearance very different from what it was previously. His hair, she said, was sandy when he was in her employ -- now it was black. The man was on the point of being discharged for lack of identification, when Justice DOWLING, determined to probe the subject to the bottom, suddenly caught hold of the prisoner's hair. Then the mystery was explained. The accused for the purpose of disguising himself had put large quantities of lampblack-grease and other compounds on his hair. He was fully committed for trial.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.; THE LIQUOR DEALERS AND THE UNITED STATES.

BROWN, Confederate Senator from Misissippi, has written a letter to the Enquirer of the 13th, in reply to a communcation that appeared, charging the Federal Government with maltreating the rebel prisoners on Johnson's Island. Mr. BROWN says he has a friend there who corresponds with him regularly, and says his imprisonment was as mild as he could expect, and that he was in want of nothing but liberty. With regard to fuel, Mr. BROWN says his correspondent tells him the prisoners have a sufficiency, and (says Mr. BROWN) ""on the 12th he gives a bill of prison fare, and I undertake to say that ??? the families in Richmond do not fare so well."" Again the correspondent says: ""My life here would be very endurable were I not a prisoner."" Mr. BROWN says he does not know why this officer should be treated any better than others, and ""besides, in speaking of the treatment of the prisoners, he constantly uses the word we."" Mr. BROWN states his reasons for making this statement thus: ""First I would do justica to an enemy; next, I would not exasperate that enemy by publishing exaggerated if not false aacounts of his cruel treatment of our prisonerst and thus induce him to change mild and even kind treatment, into hursh, if not cruel treatment; and, lastly, these accounts will meet the eye of many persons in our country who have friends on Johnson's Island, and, if uncorrected, they cannot fail to inflict unnecessary pain upon such persons. With a change of commanders there may come a change of treatment; but I am perfectly satisfied that, up to the 20th of last month, the prisoners on Johnson's Island were treated as well as their friends in the Confederacy could reasonably expect.""",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""PRISONERS IN THE NORTH.; A LETTER FROM SENATOR BROWN.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/28/archives/amusements.html,,"MUSICAL. -- Mr. SPENCER B. DRIGGS, whose ingenious inventions and bold theories in connection with the piano-forte have resulted in many important improvements to that instrument, has recently complated a grand piano-forte which, by its power, quality and duration of tone, deserves to rank as an advance on anything yet accomplished. It may be seen at No. 744 Broadway, and is well worth a visit from parties interested in this truly domestic orchestra; this real condenser of polyphony; this solitary muse of the parlor -- the piano-forte. The day is not far distant when America will supply Europe with pianos -- the day already being past when Europe could supply America. The writing on the wall was seen distinctly in 1862, when an American house (STEINWAY & SONS) bore off the prize at the great London International Exhibition. It was curious then to notice how timidly the great bulk of makers clung to the oldest devices of their craft, and how positively those who had only stepped a little forward found themselves in advance of their cotemporaries. In America there has been a steady effort during the past ten years to go ahead of the times; to leave the old beaten path and strike out boldly into new regions of sound. Hence, the superiority which, in 1862 was regarded as astonishing, but which was, nevertheless, cordially and generously acknowledged. Mr. DRIGGS stands alone in his department, as a pioneer, He has literally hewn a way for himself. From the commencement, the prospects were new and delightful; but it is only now that he has, as it were settled upon his theories and cultivated them to the point of absolute productiveness. The grand piano, to which we have referred, is an achievement of which he may well feel satisfied. We cannot enter into an explanation of the technical peculiarities of its construction. They are striking to the general perception, and philosophical to the informed mind. The results are a beautiful and extraordinary quality of tone; a power and roundness of sound that we have not heard equalled. When the instrument has been supplied with a better action than the one which it now possesses, it will, we are sure, command the attention of the musical world. We learn with satisfaction that a large and wealty. Corporation has taken the patents in hand, and intend manufacturing pianos on Mr. DRIGGS' principles. Anything that adds to the charm of home is a benefit to the community, and a good piano is one of the happiest means to this end. Mr. DRIGGS has spent a fortune in maturing his plans; we hope he may amass a largor one in their consummation?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Amusements.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Amusements.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8c867a95-e0c7-52c9-9f8a-e5f5f265cc13,447,nyt://article/8c867a95-e0c7-52c9-9f8a-e5f5f265cc13,

Loochow Surrendered by the Taepings,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/02/28/archives/the-chinese-civil-warthe-imperialists-and-their-allies.html,Loochow Surrendered by the Taepings,"The Tae-pings have experienced another great disaster; They have been compelled to surrender Loochow to the Imperialists. The siege of this important stronghold promises to be a marked event in the history of this Chinese rebellion. The stockades, which impeded approach to the city walls, were strongly garrisoned, and obstinately defended, GORDON and his troops being frequenty repulsed from them -- on one occasion with very considerable loss. But at length his perseverance and skill triumphed over all difficulties, and the enemy were successively driven from their positions, and had to take refuge behind the ramparts. The city was now completely beleaguered by the Anglo-Chinese and Mandarin forces, so that it could receive neither succors nor supplies from without. This state of things, coupled with the remembrance of their repeated defeats at the stockades, had such an effect on some of the Taeping chiefs, that a council was held, and it was proposed to give up the contest as hopeless, and abandon Loochow to the besiegers. But MO-WANG, the commandant of the garrison, rejected the idea with scorn, and strenuously insisted that the place should be defended to the last extremity. His opinion and authority, however, only prevailed for a moment. In a few days after, the rebel brave was murdered, and then the chiefs, who had advocated surrender, opened communications with GORDON and the Tuctai, and agreed to give up the city, if their lives and property were guaranteed to them. This condition was assented to by the Imperialist leaders, and immediately they were put in possession of the coveted fortress. The Tuctai had now an excellent opportunity for the display of his magnanimity and good faith, and for giving an instance of Imperialist clemency which would tend to conciliate the Tae-pings. But so far has this unworthy representative of the Brother of the Sun and Moon been from manifesting any of these high qualities, that he has been guilty of a cruelty and perfidity which will inspire the rebels with the courage of despair, and which, if not promptly repudiated and punished by the Government at Pekin, may constrain all Europeans to abandon the Imperialist service, and change once more the fortunes of the war.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Chinese Civil War--The Imperialists and their Allies.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Chinese Civil War--The Imperialists and their Allies.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-02-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c6fcac08-6345-5af3-b5d6-da683985f06e,396,nyt://article/c6fcac08-6345-5af3-b5d6-da683985f06e,
