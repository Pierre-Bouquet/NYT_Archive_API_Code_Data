Metropolitan Fair for United Stated Sanitary Commission; Officers and Committees,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/01/archives/metropolitan-fair-united-states-sanitary-commission.html,Metropolitan Fair for United Stated Sanitary Commission; Officers and Committees,"A Metropolitan Fair is to be held in the Metropolitan City of New-York, commencing 28th of March, 1864, for the relief of the sick and wounded of the National Army. It is designed to be something much larger than a ""fair"" in the modern acceptation of that term. Every branch of agriculture, trade, industry and art, will be invited to contribute its choicest and costliest products for exhibition and sale. Musical and dramatic artists will be invited to aid the common cause with their talent and genius. All the material resources of the great City of New-York and of the region directly tributary to it, are to be invoked. The farmers of New-York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New-Jersey, and the adjacent States, will send in specimens of their finest stock; our factories will contribute locomotives, grand pianos, sewing machines, steam plows and all the mechanical products of Northern intelligence and industry, in aid of the great cause of National Unity.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'METROPOLITAN FAIR.; UNITED STATES SANITARY COMMISSION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'METROPOLITAN FAIR.; UNITED STATES SANITARY COMMISSION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'NEW YORK', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'WAR', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0ac45cc8-580b-5312-86e5-ceb825fb6da8,1046,nyt://article/0ac45cc8-580b-5312-86e5-ceb825fb6da8,

We can very well believe it, for there are certainly some knotty points of international law in the case. It would require some discussion probably to come to a clear and satisfactory conclusion on the question whether the vessel herself shall be given up to our authorities or to her owners, for that involves, doubtless, the question whether the pirates who captured her were acting under a regular commission from JEFF. DAVIS or not. If they were not; the case was one of pure piracy. But if they were, the question of recognizing the capture as legal, is one on which the British Government and our own would be very likely to take different views. Yet even if we accept the view which the English would be apt to take, and allow the capture to be a lawful one, according to their views of belligerency, what can they do with the vessel? She has never been condemned in any Prize Court. She has been recaptured by our vessels, although in British waters, and by us put into the hands of the British authorities. They would hardly go so far as to put the vessel into the hands of the pirates again, if they were impudent enough to make a claim for her. Probably the best way for England to settle it will be to say, ""We will not discuss any of these troublesome questions of lawful capture, &c. All we know about it is that you have put into our hands a vessel, which you say is yours, and which you want us to give back to you; and so, to avoid trouble, we will give her to you. As for the wrongful act, which you have been guilty of in seizing her within our waters, we will, under the circumstances, overlook that. That is a matter which concerns us alone, and JEFF. DAVIS has no just cause of complaint against us for avoiding a quarrel.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Troublesome Questions Between England and the United States.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Troublesome Questions Between England and the United States.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Knoxville', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-01 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/682e4abb-9876-5d3f-8a77-4cf6046d5646,1871,nyt://article/682e4abb-9876-5d3f-8a77-4cf6046d5646,

It appears that she left home about 5 1/2 o'clock, for the purpose of getting some groceries for Sunday. She staid so much longer than usual, that her daughter, about ten years of age, went after her to ascertain the cause of her detention. She met her in York-street, near Charles, led by some persons, and bleeding profusely. She managed to walk half a block farther when she fell down exhausted. She was conveyed to her residence, and as she was perfectly conscious, every effort was made to ascertain who committed the deed, but without avail. She refused to say anything to implicate any one, and soon after died. The blood was traced to an outhouse in the rear of the building in Gold-street, where large pools lay upon the floor. The deed had doubtless been perpetrated there. The neighbors saw deceased and a man dressed in the uniform of a U.S. soldier, go into the outhouse. They heard them quarreling, and she cried out. ""That's the man that did it,"" while at the same time the soldier was seen making his escape to the street. That was the last seen of him. She made her way out, and walked along until discovered by her daughter. The soldier was a tall, slim man, but no definite description could be obtained. Coroner NORRIS made a superficial examination of the body of deceased, and found an incised wound through the abdomen over the region of the stomach, about a inch in length, and which extended to some vital part. The deceased died of internal hemorrhage a few minutes after being taken to her house. A postmortem examination will be made to-day, and an inquest held. Meanwhile every effort will be made to arrest the murderer.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/321b57a5-0d29-5abd-b8ce-4dbb7a1b837c,339,nyt://article/321b57a5-0d29-5abd-b8ce-4dbb7a1b837c,

The officer stopped them to inquire the cause, when some of the gang said the Chinaman had drawn a knife on them, and they were going to pay him off. The officer said he would take the ""Celestial"" to the Station-house, and that they must go along to make a complaint against him. This all positively refused to do, and defied the officer to take them, at the same time using violent threats, and throwing stones and brickbats at him. They said they would kill both the officer and Chinaman on the spot. SWEENEY then rapped for aid, and Officer SHEA came to his assistance. The two took hold of the man who seemed to be the ringleader of the gang, with the intention of taking him to the Station-house. The latter thereupon drew a heavy navy revolver and fired at Officer SWEENEY. The ball took effect in the upper part of his right thigh extended to the bone, and thence glanced downward about eight inches, coming out just above the knee. The wound is a very dangerous one, and fears are entertained that it will be fatal. After this, the same man fired two more shots in quick succession, one of which took effect in the right shoulder of Officer SHEA, inflicting a bad, but, probably, not a dangerous wound. The ball was extracted soon after by a Police Surgeon at the Fourth Precinct Station-house. The patient was, this morning, doing well. As soon as these shots were fired the alarm was given, and a posse was sent from the Station-house, but before they arrived the offenders had all made their escape.

Blundering Report by; Emperor Napoleon's Invitation to Continental Congress and England's refusal,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/03/archives/the-new-idee-napoleonienne.html,Blundering Report by; Emperor Napoleon's Invitation to Continental Congress and England's refusal,"The brusque refusal of England, and the evident reluctance of the great Continental Powers, to accede to his proposition, have, it is said, determined the French Emperor to change his base. When he announced his scheme to the French Chambers, his tone was confident and menacing. He could not ""fail to be listened to, since"" he spoke ""in the name of France;"" and the rejection of his appeal ""would cause"" him ""to suppose the existence of secret projects which shunned the light of day."" But now his Majesty sees the propriety of descending from this high ground, and adopting a milder and less mandatory style. Unable to return satisfactory answers to the interrogatories of the Powers, and dreading a general combination against him, he no longer insists on a Congress; and ""is ready to come to an understanding with the Governments who shall think it useful to debate pacifically among themselves those questions which, if left to chance circumstances, might conduct to the most fatal complications."" Instead, then, of a great ecumenical Congress of European States to abrogate the treaties of 1815, and to reconstruct the political system of Christendom, NAPOLEON would now be content with a series of informal conferences between the Governments favorably disposed for the discussion of unsettled questions, and the promotion of general peace. Well, even the realization of this scheme, different though it is from that originally conceived, would perhaps prove agreeable to the French Emperor, as serving in some measure to render his discomfiture less galling. But, save as balm for his wounded vanity, what would be the use of it? The holding of such conferences would be a waste of time and dialectics. It would he an absurdity to expect that these cabinet coteries would be equal to the solution of problems and the arrangement of difficulties with which even a general congress could not successfully deal. The Ministers of the several Powers might meet and interchange views -- they might make more apparent how antagonistic and irreconcileable were their opinions -- they might reveal to the world how inordinate were the selfishness and ambition which lay hid beneath their assumed garb of disinterestedness -- they might irritate each other by criminations and recriminations, and sow the seeds of future strife and trouble, but for the achievement of good they would be impotent.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The New Idee Napoleonienne.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The New Idee Napoleonienne.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/843fe29f-7fbe-5728-8ab8-6c2ab5769b10,1484,nyt://article/843fe29f-7fbe-5728-8ab8-6c2ab5769b10,

La France on Cost of European Armaments,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/03/archives/the-cost-of-european-armaments.html,La France on Cost of European Armaments,"La France insists that the Congress is necessary were it only to check the immense expenditure of money for armaments each year in Europe. It founds his arguments on calculations published by M. LEGOTT, chel-de-division at the Industry of Agriculture, Commerce and Public Works and, consequently, in a position to arrive at reliable information. Our cotemporary says: ""Austria keeps up an army of 467,000 men, which costs her 336,000,000f.: France an army of 573,000, which costs 688,000,000f.[???] Prussia an army of 214,000 men which costs her 150,:000,000f.; England an army of 300,000 men, which costs her 677,000,000f.; and Russia an army of 100,000 of men, which costs 529,000,000f. That is, out of the total budget of each of those States, an expenditure of 37 per cent. in Austria, or more than a third; 33 per cent. in France, 30 la Prussia, 39 in England, and 42 in Russia. Let us also mention Italy, where 329,000,000f. are expended [???] keeping up a force of 314,000 men; Turkey, weighed down by an army of 424,000; Denmark and Sweden, the first with 50,000, and the second with 67,000 men, by which their budgets are increased to 37 and 40 per cent. respectively. The other secondary States follow in an analogous proportion. Switzerland is the only European State that neither increases her army nor her budget. M. L[???], adding together the effective of all the European armies according to estimates which he considered rather below than superior to the reality, arrives at the fearful number of 3,815,847 men, and as on[???] of 3,500,000.000f.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE COST OF EUROPEAN ARMAMENTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE COST OF EUROPEAN ARMAMENTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-03 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c06a1c80-5911-5a83-88e6-5f8b57ab4a3a,761,nyt://article/c06a1c80-5911-5a83-88e6-5f8b57ab4a3a,

They are young, ambitious and good-looking -- qualities, even the last, which is conducive to success. Of Mme. BORCHARD it is only necessary to say that she was for several seasons the principal singer of the Paris Opera Comique, and subsequently of the New-Orleans French opera. She is of English parentage, and speaks the language with perfect fluency. As an artiste, she is not inferior to LOUISA PYNE. Here, then, are three artists of acknowledged rank. The smaller parts have necessarily to be intrusted to newer hands, but the success of the experiment will not depend on the smaller parts. An orchestra of sufficient numbers, and of the highest individual excellence, has been secured by Mr. THEODORE THOMAS, who will conduct. There will be no failure there.

New-Orleans Friends of Freedom and Colored Delegates,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/04/archives/equality-of-races-in-the-south.html,New-Orleans Friends of Freedom and Colored Delegates,"-- We find by the report of the proceedings of the ""Convention of the Friends of Freedom,"" held in New-Orleans last month, that there was no little trouble caused by the admission of negroes to seats as delegates. A resolution was introduced upon the subject, but the Chair decided it to be out of order. Subsequently one of the delegations made the admission of colored men the ground of withdrawal. It is a great misfortune that at this moment there should be such causes of dissension introduced among the loyal men of the reclaimed Southern States. If the process of political reconstruction has to be delayed in all the rebel States that are successively brought within the military lines of the Union until such time as the social status of the various races is settled, we fear that the thing will not go on as rapidly as might be desired. It is true that if the settlement of this question were a necessity of reunion, no one could complain that it was brought forward and forced to a settlement. But such is not the case; and the whole Union might be reconstructed tomorrow with this question left in abeyance for such solution as might come from discussion, time and circumstance.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'EQUALITY OF RACES IN THE SOUTH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'EQUALITY OF RACES IN THE SOUTH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-04 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a12cb84c-27d9-5119-9ab0-ea3b1e86f38e,355,nyt://article/a12cb84c-27d9-5119-9ab0-ea3b1e86f38e,

There could not have been a more striking illustration of the danger of such a course than the selection of Gen. MCCLELLAN by the Democratic party for their candidate almost at the very moment when it first became evident that the struggle with the South was destined to be something very much longer and more formidable than a ninety days' campaign. The more uncertain the is sue began to appear in the eyes of the rest of the world, the more certain a class of politicians seemed to become that it was nearly over, and that Gen. MCCLELLAN'S campaign in Virginia had given it the finishing stroke. What was most curious about it all was, too, that those who fell earliest and with most ostentation into this delusion were the very men who professed to be most satisfied of Southern determination and obstinacy. It will probably never be satisfactorily explained how it was that Gen. MCCLELLAN became a great military hero for having failed in a series of important military operations against a people on whom we were told no military operations could ever make any impression. There can be no doubt, however, that this mysterious occurrence would never have taken place if it were not that the Democratic party had not been just then in serious want of a leader.

Officer GOLDEN, of the Sixth Precinct, afterward learned that various glasses, answering the description of those stolen, had been pledged at pawn shops on the east side of the City. He obtained a description of the person who thus disposed of them, and on Sunday afternoon he arrested, in the Bowery, a man who is known as THOMAS BUENS alias COMBS. The latter made great resistance when notified that he was a prisoner, and in a few moments more than twenty thieves surrounded the two, with the obvious intention of effecting a rescue of their companion. The sight of a revolver deterred them, however, and after much difficulty he was taken to the Tombs, where Justice DOWLING committed him. The accused is a well-known sneak-thief and pickpocket.

SEYMOUR's Message shows that his sympathies are still with the rebellion. He discusses national affairs at length and with earnestness; -- but all his zeal, all his rhetoric all his arguments, are aimed at the Government of the United States. His whole soul is enlisted in the effort to degrade that Government in the estimation of the world; to represent it as unpatriotic, ignorant, reckless, selfish and tyrannical; -- to alarm the country by exaggerated pictures of the ruin it is bringing upon it; -- to array public passion against its action -- and thus to cripple and paralyze its endeavors to suppress the rebellion, and conquer a just and permanent peace. In this as in his previous message Gov. SEYMOUR has nothing whatever to say in condemnation of the rebellion, nor does he take into account in a single instance those acts of the rebel authorities which have compelled our Government to persevere in the exertion of force for the restoration of peace. He charges the Government with prolonging the war for selfish, partisan and vindictive purposes -- and with refusing to avail itself of an alleged readiness, on the part of the rebels, to lay down their arms and resume their allegiance to the Constitution. It would be difficult to believe Gov. SEYMOUR serious in these allegations, if his whole official career had not proved his readiness to act upon them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Gov.

Fair and the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/06/archives/the-metropolitan-fair.html,Fair and the War,"One of the most remarkable features of the present war is the humane aspect given it by the non-combatant population of the North. Willing, as rich and poor alike have been, to give the required quota of their substance, and fathers, mothers, wives and sisters to yield up their loved ones in the national cause, they have also striven to do something, to indicate that although interested in a prodigious war, they did not abandon the cherished ideas of Christianity and civilization. Professing no special chivalric sentiment, the North has manifested the tenderest devotion to those who fought its battles and secured its salvation, and has not neglected to care for the physical wants of its stricken and conquered enemies. In this movement the United States Sanitary Commission has made itself historical. No story of the great war for the Union can ever be complete which neglects to chronicle the efforts of noble men and women throughout the land, under its auspices. What has been accomplished by its means has been again and again acknowledged by Government, by Generals at the head of armies, and better than all, by suffering and fainting soldiers in hospital and camp and field. The nation knows, the world knows much of the good wrought by this Commission; all of that good can never be known until that day when it shall be said: ""Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye have done it unto Me.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Metropolitan Fair.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Metropolitan Fair.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-06 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/e9af0c48-c66d-5284-a6cf-8c7c68918b26,758,nyt://article/e9af0c48-c66d-5284-a6cf-8c7c68918b26,

The Comptroller introduces his report, by remarking that ""the Government of this State is organizes upon principles of strict economy. Its ordinary and necessary expenses are very light. A yearly tax of less than one mill upon each dollar of the valuation would be sufficient to pay them. And yet, with a tax four times that amount, the close of the last fiscal year found the treasury overdrawn, and the General Fund revenue heavily deficient. This arose from the large appropriations made by the Legislature for objects outside of the ordinary expenses of the Government, the extent of which could not be anticipated, and for which no reliable estimates could be given.""",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE STATE FINANCES.; Abstract of the Annual Report of the Comptroller.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE STATE FINANCES.; Abstract of the Annual Report of the Comptroller.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-07 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9116f6fa-783c-5008-b214-52c4f1a5c1e0,2298,nyt://article/9116f6fa-783c-5008-b214-52c4f1a5c1e0,

The editor of the Times disclaims any intention of having attributed to either of these gentlemen the advocacy of a forcible division of landed estates; but Mr. BRIGHT's language was sufficiently equivocal to give the interpretation put upon it an air of plausibility. But no one who has paid the least attention to the political and economical theories of ""the Manchester school,"" as preached during the last twenty years by its two great apostles, can fail to know that there is nothing it deprecates so much as legal interference with the distribution of wealth. Its cardinal doctrine is, that property should be allowed to go where-ever it would naturally go, if men were permitted to follow their inclination, without let or hindrance, in dealing with it. It seeks to make real estate in England subject to the same rules of law as personal property; to make its transfer a transmission as simple and as cheap as would be consistent with security, or, in other words, to subject it to the ordinary laws of trade; and Mr. BRIGHT advocates this because he foresees that it would lead there, as it leads here, to a more equal distribution of the land of the country amongst the inhabitants, and would counteract, if not reverse, that tendency to the accumulation of large estates in the hands of single families, which, all acknowledge, is one great cause of English poverty.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Ownership of Land in England--what the Real Evil is.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Ownership of Land in England--what the Real Evil is.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-08 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/21b84174-28a7-5fa3-a5a2-faf61f9dfe13,1045,nyt://article/21b84174-28a7-5fa3-a5a2-faf61f9dfe13,

Men, women and children were collecting in knots and groups in front and rear of the church long before daylight, discussing the virtues and goodness of their late Archbishop, the character of the ceremonies of the day, and the chances of getting a view of the inside of the sacred edifice which contained the remains of the father of the Catholic Church in America. By daylight the scattering groups had consolidated and increased to thousands, requiring the unremitting attentions of 200 policemen to keep them within bounds and limits. Ropes were stretched across in Mulberry and Mott streets, and with this assistance a cordon of police kept the crowd from blocking up the entrances to the Cathedral. Those who had a right to enter, or who had received proper invitations, got in by edging through the outsiders as best they might. Those whom, owing to the limited accommodations, the Trustees were compelled to exclude, exhausted themselves in vain supplications to the guardians of the public peace for the privilege of a moment's admission, -- their appears and expostulations being made in every cadence of the Milesian brogue.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; The Funeral Rites of Archbishop Hughes.

There ought in every State to he a militia composed of all the arms-bearing population, and as well armed, and well drilled, and well officered as it is possible for a militia to be. Everybody who is fit for military duty, and either will not or cannot enlist in the army in the field, ought to be compelled to enter the militia, and to devote a certain amount of his leisure time to its duties. If this were done, we should, in the first place, enjoy perfect security against domestic violence and peril, which, in our great cities, is increasing every year; and in the second, we should possess a respectable reserve in case of great disaster to the army in the field, and be spared the pain and humiliation of witnessing such wild ""uprisings"" as followed on LEE'S invasion of Pennsylvania last summer.

On discovering he was a sailor for whom hospital money had been paid and properly chargeable to the Seamen's Fund and Retreat, the General Agent (Mr. CASSERLY), at once dispatched a messenger to the officer of the Retreat, No. 12 Olds-lip, with a note from Dr. STEELING, (the physician attached to the Emigrant Department) certifying to the condition of the sailor, who was suffering from dropsy and utterly helpless, and advising that he be sent to the City Hospital, to which the General Agent added a request to the same effect. On delivering the note at the office of the Seamen's Retreat, the messenger was told that he should go to the consignee of the vessel and find out if the man was a sailor, and that until he did so, nothing could be done. The messenger went and received a certificate showing the sailor to be entitled to the benefits of the Hospital Fund, whereupon the messenger was handed a card of admission, ""provided the case required treatment,"" to the Seamen's Retreat, Staten Island, and a ferry ticket, and told that when the sailor, whom the messenger corroborated by the medical certificate, reported as utterly helpless, got to Staten Island, he would be taken to the Retreat in a vehicle which he would find there! The unfortunate sailor being unable to help himself or to reach the ferry, and the weather being very cold, and as it would endanger the man's life if compelled to go to Staten Island without any care or protection, the General Agent, on learning that nothing more would be done for the patient, addressed a note to CHARLES CAROW, Esq., No. 76 South-street, the consignee of the vessel, who, to his credit and humanity, responded with an order for the admission of the sick man to the New-York Hospital, becoming thereby responsible for his support and medical attendance, although he had already paid to the Seaman's Fund hospital money as required by law.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Cruel Treatment of Sailors.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Cruel Treatment of Sailors.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-09 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84efe72f-0e94-5015-b400-206dbab19412,420,nyt://article/84efe72f-0e94-5015-b400-206dbab19412,

The Park Theatre has seldom looked more bright and elegant. It was full, too; full upstairs and full down. To be sure, it does not require a heavy per centage of the entire Brooklyn population to fill an establishment of such modest proportions; but it has to be remembered sadly, that, on other occasions, the levy has been made in vain, and, not long ago, it seemed as though Brooklyn, instead of being the second city of the Union, were a paltry, psalm-smiting, one-horsed village. Let us hope that the interest which Mr. HARRISON has now awakened in his fellow-citizens will abide by the theatre of which he is the manager.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/10/archives/another-napoleonic-defeat.html,,"Has the star of the Third NAPOLEON culminated, that all his latter-day schemes, devices, and enterprises have been attended with failure. During the first decade of his public career, everything he undertook prospered. He gained the Presidency and the Empire; he was victorious in the Crimea[???]and in Italy; and even the legerdemain by which he aimed to filch Savoy and Nice from King VICTOR, met with success. But, for some time, his good fortune has departed from him. In peace and in war, at home and abroad, he has been alike unlucky. His plot for the establishment of monarchy in Mexico, has already broken down; his attempt to intimidate Russia, has proved abortive; his efforts to induce the Great Powers to sanction the convocation of a Congress, have been in vain; while, within the past twelve months he has experienced three rebuffs from France, more ominous than all. A French parliamentary opposition has been formed in defiance of him, and Paris, which he has done so much to embellish, has twice cast her vote against the candidates of his choice, once in May last, at the general election, and again, the other day, in favor of M. PELLETAN. M. PELLETAN, a distinguished Liberal, had been originally returned for the Ninth District of the Seine, but the satellites of the Government, in the Second Chamber, wishing to get rid of so formidable an opponent, availed themselves of some technical irregularity in the proceedings, and pronounced M. PELLETAN's election void. That gentleman, nowise disheartened by this decision, determined to renew the contest with his antagonist, though the latter was supported by the Government, the official press, and the Parisian municpalties, who left no artifice untried that could possibly tend to prevent the reelection of the obnoxious ex-deputy. The forty mayors and sub-mayors of the metropolis entered the lists against him, and issued a manifesto in which the private and public conduct of PELLETAN was painted in the blackest colors. ""He was an unnatural father, a bad citizen, and a bad man. He had attacked and calumniated that which all true Frenchmen most love and venerate -- the glory and the grandeur of our country; the military services and renown of our Emperor; the combats and the victories of Italy have found no favor with him. Nay, he has even dared to assail and insult our national song-writer, the popular and immortal BERANGER."" Now, could it be imagined that the Parisians of the ninth district would be so stupid as to give this bad citizen, bad critic, and bad man the victory over the immaculate PICARD, who ""was bountiful to all, looked up to with affection and respect, a model of civic virtue, a liberal in politics, and devoted at once to the empire and the principles of 89?"" But, alas! when was mere merit a guarantee of success? And such was the perversity of the electors in question, that they actually re-chose the wicked M. PELLETAN, by a majority of near six thousand votes, to represent them, rather than the amiable nonentity whom the Government and the municipalities patronized. This second great defeat of the Executive in the metropolis is a much more serious disaster than the Emperor's failure to effect the convocation of a Congress. For, with France blindly devoted to him, he might defy and contemn the jealousy of European potentates, but if Frenchmen continue to grow lukewarm and indifferent, if not positively antagonistic, to his cause and rule, what security can he have for the stability of his throne, or the maintenance of his prestige? NAPOLEON has, in fact, got himself into another awkward dilemma. He has gone too far, or not far enough. It is possible to uphold a despotism, and it is possible to uphold constitutional government, but to do what he is attempting -- to reconcile things in their nature irreconcilable -- is beyond even his skill. If he did not intend fairly to carry out his scheme of reform, he should never have broached it. If he did not intend, when he promised France freedom of the press and of election, to retire himself from the position of a despot, and to give her also a responsible ministry, he should never for a moment have consented to relax the reins of authority, or involved himself in difficulties by making mention of concession. What is the use of prating about freedom of the press, or freedom of election to a people, without constitutional government, without a government responsible to, and removable at the will of, the National Parliament? To promise liberty to such a people is a mockery, since as long as the great boon of a responsible ministry is denied them, they can have no liberty -- no privileges of any kind, save that which the caprice of a tyrant may grant to-day, and take away to-morrow. The case of France is an illustration in point. France has a de jure title to freedom of the press, and freedom of election, yet de facto she is in possession of neither; but let her once obtain a government accountable to the Chambers for its acts, and depending on the Chambers for its existence, and she will no more have occasion to complain of her rights being violated. This is a concession which the Emperor must promptly make, if he would allay the increasing discontent of the French people, and secure the sceptre of the empire to the Bonaparte dynasty. When such men as M. DE LA GUEROUNIERE pronounce against him, and proclaim that the time has come for the ""crowning of the edifice,"" NAPOLEON should perceive that he can no longer safely delay putting his house in order. If he would not be the wrecker of his own fortunes, he must henceforth be content to reign, and not to govern. The white ants are gnawing at the pillars of the imperial fabric, and will presently bring it toppling down about his ears, should they be suffered to work on. Nor can he, as is too commonly supposed, venture to attempt turning the attention of the nation from home grievances by plunging into foreign war, without incurring danger of another and no less formidable character. The aggressive spirit of France is dreaded by Europe, and her Emperor could engage in no foreign war which would not lead to the formation of a coalition against him, with which even the power of the second empire would be unable to contend. There remains, then, no alternative for NAPOLEON, but to make the necesary concessions to his people, or to persist in a course that will ultimately lead to the subversion of his throne, and the downfall of his Government.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Another Napoleonic Defeat.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Another Napoleonic Defeat.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-10 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0e92267c-15d2-5c58-8086-8cdfc101bd16,1120,nyt://article/0e92267c-15d2-5c58-8086-8cdfc101bd16,

About four months since, recruiting officers for the first time made their appearance among the slave population of the State, with the avowed purpose of enlisting in the military service all colored persons of the required age and condition who would present themselves. No orders from the headquarters of the army authorizing such a proceeding had been made known and no rules seemed to exist establishing any certain course of proceeding. The recruiting officer exercised apparently an arbitrary discretion, stripping some neighborhoods and leaving others untouched; taking frequently the slaves of owners whose loyalty had been never questioned, in some cases when these owners were themselves absent in the army or navy struggling against the enemy, and leaving those of others whose want or loyalty was equally notorious. They frequently took not only such as were fit for the service, but many others who were entirely unfit, and who, when brought to the rendezvous in another part of the State, were turned adrift and in most cases lost both to the Government and their owners.",,3,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'MARYLAND.; Message of Gov.

Thence they ascended to the sleeping apartments of Mrs. NEWFELT, and during her slumbers they abstracted the property above specified, all of which was contained in a small safe. The latter was placed in their wagon and taken away. Two or three blocks from the scene of the robbery, the horse and wagon were found a few hours after by the Police. No arrests of the thieves have yet been made. Capt.

"At a late hour on Saturday night Capt. GREER, of the Third Precinct, arrested Mr. JOHN D. VERMEULE, who is a member of the firm of FRANCIS C. HALL & Co., crockery merchants, doing business at No. 282 Greenwich-street. Mr. VERMEULE is charged with having, on the night of the 12th ult., set fire to the store of the firm for the purpose of defrauding the Home, Harmony, National, New-Amsterdam, Humboldt and American Exchange Insurance Companies, in which they were insured to the amount of $16,000. The complainant in the case is Mr. HILL, one of the members of the firm, and from his affidavit, which is on file in the Tombs Police Court. It appears that the firm were very much embarrassed, pecuniarily, and that the insurance on their stock was nearly double the amount of property in the store. On the night of the fire Mr. VERMEULE was seen to go up stairs three times just previous to the closing of the store. Soon after all hands had left, a fire broke out on the third floor. The porter of the establishment testified, that on the afternoon preceding the fire, the scoused gave him a two gallon can and ordered him to have it filled with kerosene oil. The oil was procured cod used somewhere about the premises, as the can was found empty after the fire broke out. It further appeared in evidence that VERMEULE had for some time been appropriating the proceeds of sales, without making the proper entries in the books, and that immediately after the fire the latter desired Mr. HALL, the senior member of the firm to represent to the Insurance Companies that the amount of their stock was $14,000, whereas the fact was that the property of the concern did not exceed $8,000. The accused was taken before Justice DOWLIUG at the Tombs, where he was held in the sum of $5,600 to answer.

It appears that the firm were very much embarrassed, pecuniarily, and that the insurance on their stock was nearly double the amount of property in the store. On the night of the fire Mr. VERMEULE was seen to go up stairs three times just previous to the closing of the store. Soon after all hands had left, a fire broke out on the third floor. The porter of the establishment testified, that on the afternoon preceding the fire, the scoused gave him a two gallon can and ordered him to have it filled with kerosene oil. The oil was procured cod used somewhere about the premises, as the can was found empty after the fire broke out. It further appeared in evidence that VERMEULE had for some time been appropriating the proceeds of sales, without making the proper entries in the books, and that immediately after the fire the latter desired Mr. HALL, the senior member of the firm to represent to the Insurance Companies that the amount of their stock was $14,000, whereas the fact was that the property of the concern did not exceed $8,000. The accused was taken before Justice DOWLIUG at the Tombs, where he was held in the sum of $5,600 to answer. Fire-Marshal BAKER is making an investigation of the case.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Arrest of a Prominent Merchant on the Charge of Arson.

The fourth act of this work is represented with better effect by the Germans than by their predecessors, the Italians, owing perhaps to the cooperation of the Arion Society in the choruses, and the presence of a military band upon the stage. Germans, too, know how to make a show. Mr. CARL BERGMANN has conducted the orchestra, and will, we presume, continue to do so for some time. Mr. ANSCHUTZ has been in a very critical condition, but is now slowly mending. It is hardly likely, however, that he will be able to resume the baton for several weeks. To-night Mad. JOHANNSEN takes her benefit. BEETHOVEN's opera of ""Fidelio"" is the attraction -- a work which almost always attracts a fine audience.

He makes some statements well worthy of attention. He bears testimony to the excellent effect of the President's Emancipation Proclamation in weakening the rebellion and administers a very severe rebuke to the advocates of peace and Slavery in the North. He states a very striking fact in illustration of the change of sentiment in Arkansas in regard to the rebellion. One of the rebel regiments recently returned to that State from service in the field, numbering 800, among whom were some of the most respectable and influential citizens of the State. Gen. GANTT addressed them in favor of returning to the Union, and on taking a vote every man in the regiment voted in favor of it.

This startling announcement seemes to add an intenser chill to the inclemency of the season, as it strikes at the heart of so much that has delighted and refined the men of this generation, in a thousand sketches of life and character vivified by the pen of a man of consummate genius. Since SCOTT left the world, thirty-two years ago, the English reading public has not been called to mourn, such a loss; and if we would seek an earlier precedent, we must go back more than a century, to the day when prematurely worn out, at the age of forty- seven, the novelist FIELDING died en exile in search of health in Italy. FIELDING was perhaps a greater genius than THACKERAY, yet we have no impression of his being so lamented in that old England which lives to us, vital to this day in his pages as it does in no other man's writings, as doubtless THACKERAY will be sincerely mourned at this present time. The difference is in the two periods, their mind and character. We are softened now in comparison with that hard living age, when the feelings of men must have been somewhat blunted to endure the coarseness they did. There was a sense of humanity in FIELDING, but rarely such pathos of a gentle melancholy as is inwrought even in the satirical pages -- and some have thought they are all satirical -- of THACKERAY. The world has grown strangely sympathetic within this hundred years, and THACKERAY's writings represent the change.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'FOREIGN', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-11 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/f723e311-b326-587e-9bbb-604b114b7e1d,3397,nyt://article/f723e311-b326-587e-9bbb-604b114b7e1d,

Veteran Regiments in the City,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/13/archives/our-veteran-regiments-in-the-city.html,Veteran Regiments in the City,"-- We were glad to see that the two regiments of veteran volunteers which came to this City yesterday, from the Army of the Potomac, on a brief furlough, obtained a warmer welcome and a more proper recognition than had been accorded to the other veteran regiments which have been arriving during the last few weeks. One of our best City militia regiments volunteered to act as an escort; the Mayor and other of the City authorities stood on the City Hall steps, and smiled as the war-worn heroes passed by, and at the same spot an excellent brass band regaled their ears and touched their hearts with the sweet notes of ""Home again."" They received frequent welcome plaudits during their march up Broadway, and finally had the honor of a review by Gen. BURNSIDE. All this is certainly an improvement on the conduct of the City in previous similar cases. Only last week we witnessed the march through the City of the heroic fragment of a veteran regiment -- a regiment that had seen the hardest service for close upon three years -- that had fought in more battles than any regiment of troops on the globe, and every man of which had a hundred times confronted the storm of battle and the shafts of death in behalf of the beloved though tattered banner that was borne proudly at the head of their little column -- a regiment that was commanded by as noble a soldier as ever rode a horse, and of whom, it is told, the present Commander of the Army of the Potomac once remarked to one of our most famous Corps Commanders: ""W_____, treat him well! for you and I will serve under him one of these days."" We say we saw this regiment, headed by this officer, arrive in New-York, march past the City Hall, and through the streets, without receiving a sign of recognition or a cheer of welcome from the Municipal authorities, the military authorities, the militia or the patriotic citizens. It was unkind and chilling, and the returned veterans felt it. Not thus should a free country and a people who love their flag and institutions treat those who have dared everything in their defence, and who popose again to brave the dangers of the field.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'OUR VETERAN REGIMENTS IN THE CITY.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'OUR VETERAN REGIMENTS IN THE CITY.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-13 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/84d6b33a-a3f7-59e8-8c16-ef5cc273e722,462,nyt://article/84d6b33a-a3f7-59e8-8c16-ef5cc273e722,

"Yesterday afternoon, about 1 o'clock, an explosion took place in the carriage factory of W.C. & J. DUNN, corner of Eighty-seventh-street and Third avenue. For some time past, the street opposite the factory has been open for the introduction of a sewer, and it is supposed that during the progress of the work the main gas pipe must have been broken off, and the gas having no outlet except through the sewer leading under the factory, found its way through that channel and lodged under the basement floor. The smell of gas had been noticed for some time, and yesterday the workmen were unable to work in that part of the shop. A large stove was setting in the blacksmith shop, and the gas having reached it, a terrible explosion took place, tearing up the floor, breaking out the windows, lifting the brick walls inside some twelve inches, and scattering everything in the wildest confusion about the shop. Heavy anvils, weighing several hundred pounds, were lifted up several feet and dashed to the floor. Carriage bodies were thrown against the beams and destroyed, and the workmen were hurled against the wall and injured. The wildest confusion existed for some time, and until the nature of the ease was made known, men attempted to jump from the windows. The alarm of fire was given, and hundreds flocked to the scene of the disaster. The fire was soon extinguished, and the sewer stopped up to prevent the gas rushing in. The building was owned by Messrs. ARCHER & GEORGE, and we were unable to ascertain their loss. Messrs.

"NIBLO's GARDEN. -- A new sensation play -- place Ireland, period 1821 -- was produced here last evening. It is called the ""Connie Soogah, or the Jolly Peddler,"" and is from the pen of Mr. CHARLES GAYLER, a gentleman who has written better things -- and worse. The dramatist who writes for ""stars,"" has to bring his invention down to the common-place necessity of constantly keeping those ""stars"" before the audience. It is for this and for no purpose of art, that he is employed. Mystery, the great element of all fiction, is therefore denied to him. In this piece -- which is quick in its action, and good of its kind -- the public anxiety is always relieved by the Irish hero. If a secret is being told, he is in waiting -- round the corner or in a closet -- to hear it; if a danger threatens, he is there to avert it. The scoundrel of the piece is allowed a sufficient amount of rope, but we know from the beginning that Paddy is at the other end and will surely haul him up. The interest of the piece is consequently not so much in the thing which we know will be done, but in the way it is done; an interest dependent on quick action, stirring tableaux, and good scenery. These atoms of a rather cheap whole are conscientiously attended to by Mr. WHEATLEY, who, whether he is dealing with mediocrity or merit, never forgets his responsibility as a manager. The tableaux are vivid; the scenery thoroughly admirable. The ""Giant's Causeway"" scene of the second act is one of the best things ever seen even at this house. As to the statement that ""the production of this piece marks a new era in the history of the Irish drama,"" we can only express our regret that it is not so; and an additional regret that a responsible management should lend its name to such a statement. The ""Connie Soogah"" is nothing but a ""star"" piece; very good for those who are fond of seeing Mr. and Mrs. BARNEY WILLIAMS; very poor for those who are interested in broader mediums of public amusement.

We shall not be surprised at a resumption of offensive movements on the part of LONGSTREET's force, so far as may be possible. Three weeks ago, in these columns, we alluded to the great facility with which LONGSTREET could be reinforced from LEE. At that time it was announced, through rebel sources, that all the small commands which had been prowling and hovering around BURNSIDE's advance, on the Virginia and North Carolina border, had effected a junction with LONGSTREET. Once with his rear upon a line of communication with Richmond, LONGSTREET could be comparatively well supplied -- as well as LEE's army is. AVERILL's raid, though destroying immense quantities of stores, which the rebels could ill afford to lose, only interrupted railroad communication for about a week. The President of the road published a card to this effect in the Richmond papers about a week after AVERILL left Salem. There is really no reason, then, why LONGSTREET may not have received men as well as supplies. LEE, counting, as well he might, upon the inactivity of the Army of the Potomac, could safely spare him probably twenty thousand men, giving him, with his former force, an army fully fifty thousand strong.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT IS LONGSTREET ABOUT?', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT IS LONGSTREET ABOUT?', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/42192f9a-a9e2-50f7-a021-8d8e768e7490,531,nyt://article/42192f9a-a9e2-50f7-a021-8d8e768e7490,

Campaign--How a Lie Travels,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/14/archives/how-a-lie-travels.html,Campaign--How a Lie Travels,"-Not long since a clergyman named HALL, from New-Hampshire, said to be a member of the Christian Commission, visited the Army of the Potomac and had an interview with Gen. MEADE. The Rev. Mr. HALL, like many other people, was curious to know why Gen. MEADE's last campaign failed in its results. So he asked the General to tell him, which he did briefly, saying, among other things, ""One of my generals failed me."" Mr. HALL sent the particulars of this interview back to New-Hampshire, where, of course, they were printed in some country paper. To Gen. MEADE's statement in reference to the General who failed, the Rev. Mr. HALL added in his own language, ""this General was Gen. FRENCH, who was probably too drunk to know or do his duty."" But this was so inserted as to make it appear that Gen. MEADE had said it, and now we see the statement traveling over the country quoted as Gen. MEADE's own remarks. Thus, through the morbid curiosity of a citizen, who could accomplish no possible good by the publication of such a story, a lie is put into Gen. MEADE's mouth, and a probable calumny uttered against Gen. FRENCH, and both set upon their travels, with little chance of their being thoroughly contradicted. We send this after them, though feeling the truth of the old adage, that ""a lie will travel a thousand miles while truth is putting on her boots.""",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'HOW A LIE TRAVELS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'HOW A LIE TRAVELS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cac14e4d-4122-5a1d-9c61-75ae7df21a6c,242,nyt://article/cac14e4d-4122-5a1d-9c61-75ae7df21a6c,

But when there come to us from abroad complaints which attack the principles of law laid down by our Courts, misstate the facts of the cases, or attribute to the Judges views which they have never expressed, and then make these misstatements the ground of attacks upon them, the case is quite different.

on the Mission of the War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/14/archives/frederick-douglass-on-the-mission-of-the-war.html,on the Mission of the War,"Last evening Mr. FREDERICK DOUGLASS addressed a very large and brilliant assemblage in the hall of the Cooper Institute, on the ""Mission of the War."" The lecture was in behalf of the Woman's Loyal League. Mr. WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT who was announced as intending to preside, was called to the bedside of a dying relative, and Mr. OLIVER JOHNSON, Editor of the Anti-Slavery Standard, filled his place. Mr. DOUGLASS, on being introduced, remarked that men on all sides tell us that Slavery is dead; that it expired as the first shot was fired from Sumter. He was not so confident He looked facts sternly in the face, and saw in the future no miraculous abolition of Slavery. This war is a great national opportunity, which may be improved to a national salvation, or neglected to a national ruin. Vain the might of armies, vain the strength of armaments, if the Government fails to observe those principles of justice and liberty at bottom of the controversy. We are in the salutary school of affliction. If it can teach this great nation to respect those great principles toward a long neglected and cruelly crushed race, we are in a fair way for amendment, but, if this teacher is unheeded, whose lessons are burned into us by blood and fire, and thundered in our ears by the roar of a thousand battles, we shall be a warning to other nations to shun our cowardly example. We had seen in 1848 the sublimest revolution the world had yet experienced. It was regarded as the death of kingcraft. In the twinkling of an eye the powers of despotism rallied, and the hopes of democratic liberty were blasted in the moment of their bloom. Grave liabilities may also yet hang over our present struggle against the slave power of this country. The ladies of the Loyal League were to be thanked for keeping the question before the public. We are not yet out of danger. We were once informed by a hitherto sagacious political prophet, that the war would end in ninety days, yet it still rears its head in its third year, alone among rebellions, as a solitary and ghastly horror, never yet conjured among nations, drawing inspiration from a system, haggard, fiendish, and too indecent even to be mentioned in full. It has strewn our land with two hundred thousand graves, and filled it with mere stumps of men, destroyed property beyond the most exaggerated calculation, and piled up a debt heavier than a mountain of gold to be paid by our children; weakened our friends, encouraged our enemies, -- and for what? For Slavery -- that hell-black enormity that the people of this country have not even yet comprehended. Mr. DOUGLASS, after sketching the origin of the war, observed that this rebellion was enough for the lifetime of any one nation, even should it cover a thousand years, and it should be the voice of every patriot that whether the work cost much or cost little, it should be done thoroughly, [applause,] that it may be the last rebellion ever to curse American soil. The longer the war the better, if need be so, if it succeeds in abolishing the internal system of American Slavery. Say not that this comes from a negro who has no interest in the Union. I feel the deepest sympathy with it. I am an American, [applause,] and with many others participate in the deep privations of the moment. There are vacant places at my hearthstone, once filled by beloved sons, enlisted for the war, whom I live in hopes of seeing return. In this struggle we are writing in the blood of tyrants, the words of eternal justice. The war seems long, but its slow progress is essential to our salvation. The disease, being severe, the remedy must be both powerful and tardy. We were, morally, very low before it commenced, so much so that our great physician. Dr. BUCHANAN, on being called, decided there was no hope for us. We had been literally drugged to death with Pro-Slavery Compromises. There has been nothing so necessary as the slow and steady progress of this war. Why, look how we have grown! (laughing significantly at the enormous audience gathered to hear him, a colored man.) This is not acceptable, evidently, to certain Peace Democrats. The speaker urged the necessity of clearly defining the war as an Abolition war, and not shirking the question, as only in that sense can it be successful. We may admit it to be a war for the Constitution and the Union, but only in the sense that the lesser are included in the greater. Abolition includes both the Constitution and the Union of these States. Slavery was too strong for either. It came to the Constitution and broke it -- to the Union, and sundered it. It must now, itself, be crushed. The Democratic party has had no other master than Slavery for forty years. It has made war and peace precisely according to its dictation. The Florida war even was commenced in the cause of Slavery. A few slaves ran from their civilized and religious masters, men of bibles and prayer-books, and took refuge with men of tomahawks. They found more of the milk of human kindness with Seminoles than with their pious and swindling masters.",,5,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Frederick Douglass on the ""Mission of the War.""', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Frederick Douglass on the ""Mission of the War.""', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Douglass, Frederick', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-14 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/edb71362-5448-5002-829c-2f486af681ef,1818,nyt://article/edb71362-5448-5002-829c-2f486af681ef,

Senator Lane s Proposition; Proposition on Price of Gold,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/15/archives/the-market-price-of-gold-senator-lanes-proposition.html,Senator Lane s Proposition; Proposition on Price of Gold,"Senator LANE, of Kansas, proposes to make it an offence, punishable with fine and imprisonment, to sell gold at any higher price than is paid for the time being in the market for United States Bonds paying six per cent, interest in gold, except in the case of merchants buying gold for purchases abroad. It will be well for Mr. LANE to inform the Senate, before the bill is read a third time, how the law is to be enforced. It will have no moral sanction to aid it, for he will never succeed in persuading anybody of ordinary intelligence that it is morally wrong to pay the market price for one of the precious metals. And the sale of gold is a transaction which can always be carried out with sufficient secrecy to render it very difficult to procure evidence of its having been attended with any illegality. Neither of the parties to it will have any motive for informing against his confederate, except the reward, and this will hardly operate very powerfully upon anybody who is privy to many bargains of this nature. Those who have gold to sell, or seek to buy it, will not be at all likely to come before the world as common informers for the sake of two or three thousand dollars particularly, as, if they did, it would probably be the last sale of this commodity of which they would be allowed to become cognizant, by people who knew them. We shall say nothing of the inexpediency of committing offences which depend for their punishment upon the growth of a spirit of deceit, treachery and espionage among the people, though this has always been, in the eyes of all wise legislators, a consideration of the first importance. It is always highly demoralizing, and therefore highly impolitic, to seek to offer pecuniary inducements to rogues to betray others into the commission of acts which, though prohibited by law, are not condemned by the moral sense of the community; and this is precisely what Mr. LANE's bill, if it ever becomes a law, will do.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': ""The Market Price of Gold Senator Lane's Proposition."", 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': ""The Market Price of Gold Senator Lane's Proposition."", 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/8aac026d-7eab-5705-a925-330fe3046278,1062,nyt://article/8aac026d-7eab-5705-a925-330fe3046278,

"There were three arrivals from Europe yesterday, viz.: the Scotia and City of London at this port, and the Hibernia at Portland, bringing  news a week later than our precious advices.

",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/15/archives/from-europe.html,,"There were three arrivals from Europe yesterday, viz.: the Scotia and City of London at this port, and the Hibernia at Portland, bringing news a week later than our precious advices. Our files and correspondence present us with an interesting budget. The correspondence between JEFF. DAVIS and the Pope has been published, in which the rebel chief asks the mediation of His Holiness in favor of peace. The Pope replies in words of Christian counsel, but does not compromise his neutrality by uttering a political sentiment. The pirate Florida was nearly ready to sail from Brest, and, although the gunboat Kearsage was in that harbor and would do everything to prevent her escape, there was little probability of her succeeding, in view of the application of the twenty-four hours' rule by the French Government. A letter from Cape Town, referring to the recent seizure by Capt. BALDWIN, of the United States steamer Vanderbilt of the rebel bark Saxon, and the destruction of rebel coal on Penguin Island, characterizes these acts as serious infractions of international law, for which England must demand redress. The British Government has instituted a very strict investigation into the conduct of the workmen and officials at Sheerness, who assisted and connived at the escape of the Rappahannock, and all against whom the offence has been proved have been required to resign. The London Times, in referring to the enlistment of men at Cork for the United States steamer Kearsage, points to the conduct of the American Government when England was supposed to be recruiting in the United States during the Crimean war, and says it is not too much to hope that the United States should weigh themselves in the same balance in which they weighed Great Britain. At the usual reception of the Diplomatic corps at the Tuileries on New-Year's Day, the Emperor significantly observed to Mr. DAYTON that he hoped the year 1864 would be one of peace and reconciliation for the United States. The semi-official French journals were exhibiting a decidedly anti-English tone. Schleswig-Holstein affairs still continued to absorb much attention. The Prince of Augustenburg had written a letter to NAPOLEON imploring his countenance and favor, to which the latter had replied, gracefully snubbing the expectant ruler of Holstein. The Duke, under date of Dec. 31, had issued a proclamation, dated Kiel, under the title of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, in which he expresses himself as being certain that his claims will be recognized. KOSSUTH's proclamation to the people of Hungary, before given by telegraph, is published in full. It decrees a new General Committee, and hopes that the Hungarians will promptly execute every order emanating from it, in order that the detested yoke of German domination may be shaken off. GARIBALDI has resigned his seat in the Chamber of Deputies.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'FROM EUROPE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-15 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b81c8988-e808-541f-9ad8-621e193101d9,468,nyt://article/b81c8988-e808-541f-9ad8-621e193101d9,

Correspondence with the Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/15/archives/jeff-davis-on-the-pope.html,Correspondence with the Pope,"-- JEFF. DAVIS is an artful dodger. In our foreign files received yesterday we find a correspondence between himself and Pope Pius IX., published elsewhere, which is a fair specimen of the tactics employed by the rebel leader to draw forth expressions of comfort and encouragement from European potentates. Two letters from the Pope to the Archbishops of New-York and New-Orleans, written and received when the latter city was in our possession, are seized upon by JEFF. as the pretext for addressing a letter to the Pope in reply, in which he begs for a nod of recognition. Now, these letters were no more intended for the chief of the rebels than they were for the chief of evil spirits, unless as an exhortation to all evil spirits, JEFF. DAVIS included, to abandon their internal practices, and allow peace and harmony to prevail. But DAVIS says they have been ""communicated"" to him -- by whom, when or how, he does not say -- but either run through the blockade, or ""communicated"" to him through the medium of the loyal press, where, we believe, one of the letters was originally published. This is DAVIS' basis for a begging letter to His Holiness; and he gets a reply which will not only flatter his vanity, but, if JEFF. reads it with his eyes open, will certainly convey to him several very appropriate and commendatory hints, viz.: to exert himself to ""bring about the end of the fatal civil war,"" ""in order that the American people may obtain peace and concord, and dwell charitably together."" These sly digs at the chief rebel's impious doings are worthy of note; and it is to be hoped that in the pleasing contemplation of the flattering appellation of ""Illustrious and Honorable President,"" DAVIS will not overlook the pertinent and sensible advice of His Holiness, to quit his treasonable work, and then, if he can escape the halter, to abscond the country, and take refuge under the shadow of some one of the insignificant rulers whose fingers and toes he is now kissing with so much humility.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'JEFF.

The Predicament of Maximi ian,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/16/archives/the-predicament-of-maximilian.html,The Predicament of Maximi ian,"Will his Serene Highness, MAXIMILIAN, permit us to laugh? Really, we can't help it -- he cuts such a comical figure! He is in a transition state -- but it is not that. A transition state is not necessarily a laughable one. There is a time in the morning when a man has one arm in his coat-sleeve, the other out -- when his toast is midway between the plate and the lip -- when his foot, as he starts for business, is in the air. But nobody laughs at these transition acts. So, too, a callow bird, a blind puppy, a wriggling tadpole, a grub that neither flies nor creeps, though a little curious, don't disturb our gravity. The reason is, not that there is not something whimsical in these anomalous conditions, but that they don't last. All sense of the absurd is taken away by the association of progress, of development, of promise for the future. We expect, as a matter of course, that the other arm, too, will go into its sleeve; that the toast will pass to the mouth; that the foot will come to the ground; that the squab will become a fledgling, the blind pup a watch-dog, the tadpole a bullfrog, the grub a butterfly. But here, for more than a year, this rudimental Emperor has had one arm in his Imperial coat, the other out -- has poised his Mexican bonne bouche half way to his lips -- has raised his one foot towards the halls of the Montezumas, and there held it. His imperial plumes are but pin-feathers still; he don't get his eyes open; he wriggles worse than ever. He is just as much grub and just as much butterfly, just as much Hapsburg and just as much Aztec, just as much Prince and just as much Emperor, as he was fifteen months ago. The last news is that he neither moves, nor alters. Nobody knows what to call him, or what to make of him. We don't know ourselves. All that we know is that it is very preposterous. We must laugh.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Predicament of Maximilian.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Predicament of Maximilian.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Mexico', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-16 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/49985e15-762f-5122-9551-24d409a29ccf,1021,nyt://article/49985e15-762f-5122-9551-24d409a29ccf,

The composer represents the intermediate period between MOZART and the modern school of writers.

BLUNT, , The supper itself was elegant and handsomely served, and the speeches that followed, brief, terse and telling, were of a high order of social eloquence. Far the most interesting, however, were the few remarks of Gen. BURNSIDE himself; who gave some deeply interesting reminisicences of the perfect and self-sacrificing loyalty of the people of East Tennessee, of the siege of Knoxville, and of his command in Cincinnati. East Tennesseeans, for instance, when the Union armies swept their forms clean of subsistence, would say, ""It's hard, General, to be sure; but thank God, the Yankees did it!"" And during the siege of Knoxville, most seasonable and large supplies were constantly floated down to the town on the river past the besieger's pickets through the fogs, from a region actutually patrolled by rebel cavalry. The General said of the siege of Knoxville, that after all, there was no great merit in holding it, ""because we were ordered to!"" After explaining how the detention of LONGSTREET before Knoxville, enabled GRANT to complete his success at Chattanooga. Gen. BURNSIDE paid a noble tribute to the private soldiers, whom he called the real heroes of the war, ""fighting where they encounter twenty bullets for one that comes near me, and with no prospect if they fall, better than a nameless grave."" Then followed a brief allusion to his policy in arresting VALLANDIGHAM, of striking at the leaders, and a curious story of that Copperhead's arrest. It was threatened that he would be rescued; so he was put in the room immediately above Gen. BURNSIDE's in the hotel, two floors higher, a company of regulars quartered in the hotel, and a Corporal and seven men in the room opposite VALLANDIGHAM's, having express orders to do anything to prevent the prisoner from leaving that room. A serenade to VALLANDIGHAM was proposed, but given up when Gen. BURNSIDE advised the proposers that this regular corporal didn't know anything in the world, except to obey orders, and that there was danger that he might think a rescue was intended, and that VALLANDIGHAM might unhappily meet with some accident. And the General concluded with very graceful and feeling reference to the kind reception he had met at the East, and his hopes of being able to fill up the Ninth Army corps to 50,000 men.",,1,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Dinner to Gen.

The Polish Revolution still continues -- an open and bleeding wound in the side of Europe. The Italian aspirations for national unity have not been satisfied, and the historical capital of Italy is still held by foreigners. But most threatening of all, England presents a protest against the occupation of the Duchies by the Federal authorities, and, along with France, appears to guarantee the integrity of Denmark, even at the expense of a great war. The French Emperor still sustains his immense armaments, and is known to look with eager eye for the chances which a German war might bring of acquiring territory on the Rhine. Federal Germany is aroused to an intense pitch, and does not appear likely to yield a point in the Danish question. At the same time, the old revolutionary element still seethes and boils beneath the surface in every country of continental Europe.

The Comptroller sent in his estimates of City expenses for 1864. The budget foots up $8,013,263 86, or $778,313 82 more than the total appropriations of 1863. He estimates the receipts into the General Fund at $495,200, and a surplus of the Sinking Fund for the payment of interest on the City debt amounts to $750,000, applicable to general purposes, leaving the amount to be raised by tax $6,768,063 86. His estimates do not vary greatly from his predecessor's estimates for 1863. In fact, one item of $895,570, to pay the Union Defence Fund Bonds, issued in 1861, shows the difference, except that last year a half million of the Relief Fund debt was included. Mr. BRENNAN's estimates are low -- some of them too low to meet expenses legitimately incurred, and that must be paid, and the Common Council will be obliged to increase them. The item of $30,000 for Corporation advertising is an instance. The increased number of papers will require the raising of a much larger sum. However, knowing the tendency of the Common Council to inflate the budget, he probably has deemed it best not to start them with big figures. City Inspector BOOLE sent in a reply to the Mayor's message and Superintendent CARR's assertions, concerning the management of his department. The charges and the defence were ordered to be published side by side in the TIMES, and six other papers, and the whole subject was handed over to the Special Committee on Retrenchment and Reform for investigation.

Express Case,"At about 10 o'clock last night, a fire broke out in the second story of the five-story marble-front building, No. 146 Duane street, occupied by AUFFMORDT, HESSENBERG Co, importers and dealers in cloths, cassemeres &c., which, before it could be extinguished, involved the whole building and contents in destruction. The first floor and basement of the building were occupied by FAIRCHILD & FANSHAW, importers of British and other foreign silks and dry goods.

"Our Canadian friends are having another season of the celebrated case of the Commercial Bank of Canada vs. The Great Western Railway. It was before the Canadian Court of Appeals at Toronto on Tuesday and Wednesday last. It possesses no little interest, and we give a brief history thereof: The Bank claims of the Railroad Company the sum of $1,500,000, advanced to C.J. BRYDGZS, Managing Director G.W.R., and THOS. REYNOLDS, Finance Director G.W.R., on account of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad. It seems that after the Great Western Company undertook the completion of the Detroit and Milwaukee road, the large sum of money claimed in the suit was advanced by the Commercial Bank to Messrs. BRYDGES and REYNOLDS, both being officers of each Company. The Bank allege that the money was advanced to the Great Western, and on the failure of the Detroit and Milwaukee, demanded the return of their loan from that Company. The latter, however, asserted that the advances were made to the Detroit and Milwaukee, and not to the Great Western Company, and denied all the responsibility. The Bank commenced a suit, fixing the sum claimed at $1,500,000, and the case was first tried at the Kingston (C.W.) Assizes, in May, 1862, and resulted in a verdict for the Bank. In August, 1862, the Great Western obtained from the Court of Queen's Bench a rule nisi, calling upon the plaintiffs to show why a non-suit should not be entered, on account of the misdirection of the Judge, and the reception of improper evidence. The case was argued before the Court of Queen's Bench and in December a decision was given again in favor of the Bank. The Great Western took an appeal, which came before the Court of Appeals at Toronto on Tuesday and Wednesday as stated. On the bench were President M'LEAN, of the Court of Appeals; Chief Justice DRAPER, of the Queen's Bench; Chief Justice RICHARDS, of the Common Pleas; Chancellor VANKOUGHNET, Vice-Chancellor ESTON, and Hon. Justices WILSON and MORRISON, being the chief judicial dignitaries of the province. The case was argued for two days, and the Court reserved its judgment.

It was just as well known in all the clubs, and in all other places of resort for men at all interested in public affairs, as was the fact that PALMERSTON was Premier, and COBDEN the head of the Reform party.

Principles and Practice of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/18/archives/taxation-in-americaits-principles-and-practice.html,Principles and Practice of,"We published a letter yesterday on ""The Principles of Taxation,"" recommending the Government to lay the burden as far as possible on ""primary manufactures,"" or, in other words, on those manufactured articles, such as pig-iron, which furnish the raw material for other manufactures, because these taxes are easier of collection, but are less harassing and vexatious to the community at large. Now that Congress is turning its attention to the necessity, which every one sees, of raising more money by taxes and less by loans, we hope this advice will have due weight. Nothing can be plainer than that the proportion, which at present exists between these two modes of raising revenue, cannot be preserved any longer. We must pay more of our current expenses, out of our means, and less of them by borrowing, if we mean to preserve our credit. If we go on raising loans at the same rate as during the last two years, during two years more, we shall certainly bring on a crisis such as nobody would like to contemplate, and no dexterity in the management of our finances would be of the slightest use in warding it off. Every scheme that does not involve a large amount of taxation, is simply either a postponement of payment, or the conversion of one evidence of indebtedness into another evidence of indebtedness. The debt is not reduced by it in the least, or the payment of either interest or principal made one particle easier. And although it seems most probable that the war will be over within the present year, we have no right to calculate on this, either in arranging our financial or our military affairs. As long as the war is actually going on, all calculations as to the time when it will end, or the way in which it will end, are too vague and too uncertain to furnish any sound basis for a plan of finance. The only plan consistent with safety or honor, is to tax and raise men as if the struggle was to last for two or three years longer, and as if the termination of actual hostilities was sure not to bring with it complete pacification. Nearly all our mistakes and misfortunes, hitherto, have been due to our unfortunate faith in the shortness of the contest. The waste, both of blood and treasure, which has been caused by our confident expectation that the rebellion would be over in three or six months, cannot, of course, be accurately known; but we know enough to know that it has been enormous. It is high time to abandon these delusions, and to acknowledge frankly and fairly the magnitude of our task, and prepare for it. We have to conquer half a continent, and, when conquered, we shall be obliged, according to all present appearances, to reorganize its social system from the base to the apex. This is a tremendous work, but it is a glorious one, and will call for the display of as much wisdom as valor. We have shown the valor -- but the demand for wisdom will, of course, last long after that for valor has ceased.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Taxation in America--Its Principles and Practice.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Taxation in America--Its Principles and Practice.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90a4bd7d-9fdf-5a3f-a419-45d43ea087d9,1095,nyt://article/90a4bd7d-9fdf-5a3f-a419-45d43ea087d9,

They complain that the reports now published are meagre and unsatisfactory. While Senators are prosecuting this inquiry we may give them a hint or two that will be of service. The reason why our Congressional reports are so brief is that the public do not want them any longer. We have tried the experiment. Three years ago the TIMES, in connection with two of its neighbors, had special reports of both Houses of Congress made and transmitted by telegraph expressly for their columns. They were much more full than those furnished for the Associated Press. The increased expense thus incurred by the New-York papers that entered into it was not far from a thousand dollars a week; yet nobody seemed to care for the increased fullness of the reports. Indeed, the disposition on the part of the public was rather the other way; the reports were too long to be generally read, and it was on this account that they were discontinued.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'CONGRESSIONAL REPORTS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'CONGRESSIONAL REPORTS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'United States', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-18 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a6982404-9fad-5df7-8383-8e983f8ec725,369,nyt://article/a6982404-9fad-5df7-8383-8e983f8ec725,

The contents of the papers are very interesting, though there is no important news, The Winter is passing rapidly away, and the temper of the rebel journals shows that the condition of affairs is not improving. The severe weather is terribly felt by the ill-clad armies. The numbers of the rebel armies, despite the efforts of the rebel Congress at conscription, do not augment; the question of supplies is assuming a more formidable attitude than ever; the Conscription Bill will leave the States without crops, the planters going into the armies and the slaves being hired out to Corporations and manufacturers. The conscription of all the old soldiers now in the armies, whose term shortly expires, is urged in a memorial to the Rebel Congress by Gens. HARDEE, CHEATHAM, BRECKINRIDGE, and others. LONGSTREET'S position in East Tennessee is said to be satisfactory, though it is admitted that his troops are without supplies of many kinds, particularly shoes. It is reported that he will stay in East Tennessee this winter. JEFF DAVIS had issued an order conveying the joint resolution of thanks of the Rebel Congress to Gen. LEE. An account of the rebel raid into Hardy County is given, which shows it to have been an insignificant affair in its results. Gen. PICKETT, commanding the district on the North Carolina frontier, has hung a colored soldier of the Fifth Ohio Regiment, in retaliation for a guerrilla hung by Gen. WILD; also another colored man belonging to Massachusetts, for burning houses. The railroad companies of the Confederacy have become so reduced in rolling stock, that extraordinary efforts are now being made to repair and increase the efficiency of the roads, but a Richmond paper remarks that the conscription will disable the railroads, and says, in addition, ""all Virginia railroads are nearly worn out, and so are the men working them."" The reenlistment of our veterans is a source of gloom to the rebel press, which chronicles the fact with evident alarm. Flour is quoted at $150 per barrel. The cast of the whole horoscope, as seen through rebel eyes, is decidedly blue, and the prospect grows darker and darker.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE REBELLION.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE REBELLION.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-19 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/0d277e81-bcf2-5021-b6ef-11c558ebbdde,541,nyt://article/0d277e81-bcf2-5021-b6ef-11c558ebbdde,

Its main purpose is to insist upon the necessity, in order to secure the welfare and stability of the Union, of regenerating the governments and political institutions of the rebel States before restoring them to their old place in the National Union. The writer commends President LINCOLNS plan as eminently wise and just; while he objects to the seventh section of Mr. ASHLEYS bill, that it may place the State Governments again in rebel hands. That section, after providing fully for the formation of a free Constitution, and stipulating against any assumption of the Confederate debt and other abuses, enacts that when a majority of the legal voters of the State shall adopt that Constitution, it shall be received and proclaimed by the President to be the constituted government of said State.

Glinn. -- Action to recover damages against the defendant, who is a member of the Metropolitan Police, for the illegal arrest and imprisonment of the plaintiff on the 9th day of August last. The plaintiff called upon defendant to take care of a man who was, of a Sunday evening, lying intoxicated upon the sidewalk near the plaintiff's house, in East Twenty-eighth-street, which defendant refused to do; whereupon the plaintiff made complaint at the Station-house in Thirty-fifth-street; but being treated with more indignity, if possible, by those in charge at the Station-house than by the Policeman, he told them he knew the way to Headquarters, and then went home; and as he chanced to be on the street shortly after, and near his own house, without a warrant, without a charge and without even an explanation, he was arrested by the defendant and taken to the Station-house and locked up till the next morning, when he was taken to Jefferson Market and discharged by the Magistrate without even an open charge having been made against him by the defendant or any one else. Justice ALKER charged the jury that if they found from the evidence that the intoxicated man was lying on the sidewalk, that it was the plaintiff's right, it was his duty, especially on a Sunday evening, to notify the Police of the fact, that he might be taken care of, and calling on the defendant, who was on duty near by, if he refused to attend to the intoxicated man, it was the plaintiff's duty to report him; and if on plaintiff's return from the Station-house he aid or said nothing in the presence of the officer, which was or tended to a breach of the peace, then the defendant had no right to make the arrest, and the jury should find a verdict for the plaintiff; and in, finding for the plaintiff they should accord such damages as would hereafter learn policemen to do their duty.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Action for False Imprisonment Against a Policeman.; MARINE COURT TRIAL TERM.

"Supplies of the, Failure of; Government, New Attempt to Reform at Albany",https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/20/archives/reform-of-the-city-government.html,"Supplies of the, Failure of; Government, New Attempt to Reform at Albany","We are about to witness another attempt at Albany to mend the City Government, by transferring the election of the Aldermen to the City at large, and the management of the public works, including the street-cleaning, to a commission to be composed, as the Croton Board is, or as the Police Commission is to be. How this scheme will work, if carried out, we have too much regard for our reputation to venture to predict, after having witnessed the failure of so many attempts to make New-York a well-ordered, well-managed place of abode. But appearances are certainly in favor of that portion of the new plan which gives all the citizens the privilege of voting for every Alderman. This will, in the first place, secure candidates who are generally known either for good or evil, and who have some claim to prominence or distinction. The great difficulty with which municipal voters have to contend under the present system is, that men present themselves without hesitation for the suffrages of a Ward, who would not have the hardihood to ask for the votes of the whole City, and who are generally so obscure that nobody except the regular politicians knows anything either of their character or of their antecedents. When the Aldermanic ticket has, however, to be put into everybody's hands, people will not be satisfied with merely Ward busybodies or celebrities, but will insist on having candidates -- and will have those who are prominent New-Yorkers -- well known to all the inhabitants, just as the Mayor has to be, either for honesty, and capacity and public spirit, or for the reverse. We venture to predict that under this regime the Board of Aldermen at least, would undergo a great transformation -- that the pot-house oracles would disappear from it, and men of more intelligence, better character and social position take their places; though we admit that all this might happen, and the ""honorable Board"" still remain a very extraordinary and by no means creditable assemblage. By enlarging the area from which any man or body of men is elected, we always secure greater talent and higher character, and we believe the rule applies even to Aldermen. The provision of the new law which makes the Councilmen represent Assembly Districts, is, of course, a desirable change for the same reason, though in a less degree.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Reform of the City Government.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Reform of the City Government.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/29386f4c-d627-5d14-b308-280ffad7d9bb,798,nyt://article/29386f4c-d627-5d14-b308-280ffad7d9bb,

rough and tumble Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/20/archives/what-came-of-a-rebel-laugh.html,rough and tumble Fight,"-A domestic insurrection on a very small scale seems to have broken out in Richmond. The irrepressible FOOTE, formerly of Mississippi, now of Tennessee, who was always in a row of some sort while at Washington, and who does not seem to have changed his habits one whit in this respect by going to Richmond, had a rough and tumble fight on the 6th with Judge HANLEY, of Arkansas, Chairman of a committee engaged in the investigation of frauds. It seems that FOOTE laughed at some of the evidence elicited. Now, laughing may be of different kinds, and may mean very different things; and nothing is more likely to be misconstrued. Judge HANLEY did not know exactly what to think of this particular laugh of FOOTE, -- but he took the liberty of remarking to him that he needn't laugh. FOOTE did not seem obliged to him for the permission, but contented himself by defining his laugh as an ""honest laugh at least."" Judge HANLEY did not quite understand what he meant by that, but he ventured to say that he ""doubted it."" Thus arose a casus belli -- using the word in a military and not in an anatomical sense. FOOTE ""arose and struck"" Judge HANLEY -- to use the graphic phrase of the Examiner. ""Both clenched and blows were given and received by both parties."" Violent claims were mutually laid to the contending shirt-bosoms: tables were overturned: the recorded evidence was scattered, and one of the Commissaries present was knocked into a corner ""like a man of rags"" -- says the historian, ""which he is not."" The bystanders observed strict neutrality by seizing the coat-tails of the combatants with rigid impartiality. Both were torn off, and in this bobtailed condition the contest closed. It seems not at all unlikely that the Confederacy itself will ere long present the same appearance and come to a similar end.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'WHAT CAME OF A REBEL LAUGH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'WHAT CAME OF A REBEL LAUGH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-20 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/594ec37b-e0db-5b95-9fe8-e28e387f0b93,318,nyt://article/594ec37b-e0db-5b95-9fe8-e28e387f0b93,

This case, which was recently decided by Justice MULLEN, on the demurrer, in favor of the plaintiff, was called for trial yesterday on the question of the measure of damages due Hammer from the defendants. The plaintiff is the celebrated Harlem brewer, and the action is brought to recover damages for the improper disclosure of certain valuable secrets in the art of brewing. The defendants are brewers in Albany, and they purchased from the plaintiff the secret, known in this country to Hammer alone of brewing ale that would keep in hot weather without souring, and using in the manufacture 25 per cent of ma[???]t and hops. For this secret, to discover and perfect which Mr. Hammer had spent a great deal of time and money, defendants paid a large sum, and gave bonus not to impact it to any other parties than those to whom it was absolutely necessary to give it in order to carry on their business. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants broke their agreement with him, and imparted the knowledge of the process to other parties, whereby plaintiff has been damaged to the amount of $35,000. He obtained an injunction against the defendants, restricting them from imparting the secret to any others, and the question of what amount of damages he is entitled to now comes up. The case has excited considerable interest, owing to the heavy amount involved and the decision of the interesting question that a secret which cannot be patented can yet be of such value to the owner that he can recover damages from parties to whom he has imparted it for a valuable consideration upon pledge of secrecy.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Celebrated Hammer Ale Case again in Court The Value of a Scientific Secret.; SUPREME COURT TRIAL TERM.

Railroad Accidents,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/21/archives/railroad-accidents.html,Railroad Accidents,"The American railroad system, in regard to speed and safety, has been brought so near perfection, that for a long time the traveling public have enjoyed immunity from those fearful accidents which, eight and ten years ago, so frequently sent thrills of anguish and horror through the land. But recently, railroad matters seem to have got out of joint, and we have chronicled at least half a dozen serious accidents on leading lines of travel within the past ten days, most of them attended with serious loss of life. The weather may have had something to do with this -- frost, and snow and ice are sometimes barriers which reasonably account for delays and accidents -- and it may be mere chance which precipitates half a dozen of these calamities into the space of a week. But we fear the vigilance of some of our railroad managers has suffered relaxation, and that the enormous press of business and travel, and the consequent flow of money, has induced criminal indifference to the comfort, safety and accommodation of the public. And we may take this occasion to say that the management of several of the most important roads leading out of this City, particularly the management of the local accommodation trains, is attended with so much irregularity and apparent carelessness, that people dependent upon them travel back and forth with fear and trembling, feeling that their lives are risked at almost every trip.

SECOR Co., Jersey City, are about going into commission. The Tecumseh, which is nearly completed, is 235 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and 13 feet depth of hold. Her model is similar to the Weehawken, but she is of larger dimensions, having a, measurement of 1,434 tons. The forward part of the interior of the vessel is to be used as a store-room where supplies will be delivered from the upper deck by a windlas. The Commander's cabin and Captain's apartments immediately adjoining the store-room, will be elegantly furnished. In the wardroom there are seven state-rooms, all well lighted, which are to be occupied by the First Lieutenant, Chief Engineer, Ensigns, and Masters. The port gangway and turret blower engine rooms are separated by a partition of iron, and are admirably adapted for the purpose for which they are intended. The turret-room contains four engines, two for the turret, and one for each blower. Connected with them are the requisite store-rooms and the officer's round-house. The berth deck, between the turret engine room and coal bunkers, is a large and commodious apartment intended for the crew. Attached to it, on the port side, are the apothecary's room, paymaster's office, hammock and bread rooms and galley. On the starboard side of the vessel the magazine and crews' round-house are located. Adjoining them is the main entrance to the engine room, attached to which are bunkers with a space for 160 tons of coal each. The Mannahatta is similar in every respect to the Tecumseh. The 15-inch turret guns have been placed in position, and it is expected both vessels will be ready for sea as early as March next.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/23c20463-021d-5d92-a77f-8120061dda5b,843,nyt://article/23c20463-021d-5d92-a77f-8120061dda5b,

"An exempt fireman gives the following graphic account of the death of GEORGE W. BURRIDGE, of Engine Co.

The company were stationed to the rear of the building, on Reade-street. The engine was put to work, and the hose got on a twelve-inch wall, which ran parallel with the building on fire, and which wall was fifty feet in height from the area or yard below. Mr. BURRIDGE had the pipe, by which he directed a stream into one of the upper windows of the building on fire. After some time it became apparent that the rear wall would fall. Orders came for No. 42 to back down. Poor BURRIDGE at this moment, while in the act of shifting the pipe to a brother member, came in contact with the stream, which, being very powerfull, knocked him off the wall into the abyss below.

At this time the Assistant Foreman of No. 42, Mr. WILLIAM CORGAN, got upon the wall, immediately tied the drag-rope around himself, gave the end to some of the members of the Company and others on the wall, lowered himself into the abyss below, disengaged himself from the rope, tied it around poor BURRIDGE, placed the body in a perpendicular position with the back against the wall, and cried out to them above to hoist up, which they did, and got the body safely over the wall. Mr. CORGAN was now placed in a terrible position, the rear wall, five or six stories in height, about to fall on him, and no means of escape.

The difficulty, we are informed, is altogether attributable to the neglect of the regimental and company officers, who nearly always fail to bring with them from the army the evidence of the reenlistment of their men. Without these enrollment papers, duly signed by the Commissary of Musters at Washington, the County Supervisors' Committee can in no instance pay the bounty. This certificate of reenlistment forms the only voucher by which the Committee can regulate its action, and the only proof upon which the volunteer can be credited to the quota of the county. Yet we are told that it is next to impossible to make the regimental officers and the authorities at Washington understand this simple matter, by which a world of annoyance and hardship would be spared the noble fellows who have served the country faithfully through one long term of service, and are cheerfully offering themselves for another.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NON-PAYMENT OF BOUNTIES TO VETERANS; GROSS CARELESSNESS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NON-PAYMENT OF BOUNTIES TO VETERANS; GROSS CARELESSNESS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Veterans', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/7bb10616-173d-5dfb-be7c-cf8d5fff3397,534,nyt://article/7bb10616-173d-5dfb-be7c-cf8d5fff3397,

The principle which it embodies is essentially just, and if the time for bringing it forward is premature, the fault must be laid at the door of those who took the lead in the matter. The claim of Pennsylvania was the first one brought forward, -- naturally enough, as Pennsylvania is seldom behind hand in pressing claims of any kind upon the National Legislature. We concur with those members who thought it would be quite as seemly and proper for all the States to postpone their demands until the war was over. We are engaged just now in a common struggle, -- one in which all the States have a common interest and no question of separate and subordinate concern should be permitted for a moment to interfere with the devotion of the national energies to the prosecution of the war. The suggestion that a general bill should be passed, providing for the auditing and settlement of all such claims, and for their payment when the war is over, is a good one, and is far preferable to the enactment of laws for each individual case. All the States would then stand upon the same footing, and each would be sure to receive what was justly its due, without delaying or encroaching upon the claims of its sister States. But if Congress does not see fit to pass such a general law, we trust that the claims of New-York will not be postponed to those of any other city or State.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'REIMBURSEMENT OF WAR EXPENSES.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'REIMBURSEMENT OF WAR EXPENSES.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-21 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/a0268bb5-00fa-5b19-b987-dbd80f1d89e7,276,nyt://article/a0268bb5-00fa-5b19-b987-dbd80f1d89e7,

The scheme when it first made its appearance excited unmixed astonishment here as well as in Europe, as its emanation from a personage ordinarily so shrewd and so skillful in covering his weak points as JEFFERSON DAVIS, proved better than anything else could the desperation of his position. What is, however, still more astonishing is, that the rebel Congress has actually taken it up, and embodied it in a bill; and another bill which is also before them, and certain to pass, provides for the drafting of every white male in the Confederacy of the military age. So that those of the unfortunate white men of the South, who happen to be at present inside the rebel lines, will, in a few weeks, be liable to be called on for seven hundred millions of dollars, and will, at the same lime, be forced into the ranks of the army. Of course, the money cannot and will not be paid. No such sum could be raised on a similar area of the South in a time of profound peace, and with industry undisturbed; it is, therefore, hardly necessary to say that the notion that it can be raised now, after three years of bloody war, and at the moment when every man capable of firing a musket, (whether he is able to march or not,) is on the point of being dragged from his home, is simply ridiculous.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Southern Soap-Bubbles--Gigantic Schemes and their Impending Failure.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Southern Soap-Bubbles--Gigantic Schemes and their Impending Failure.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-22 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68322d67-cb85-52e4-beb6-6b18acbee524,1054,nyt://article/68322d67-cb85-52e4-beb6-6b18acbee524,

When the Emperor married, the lady was handsomely provided for and sent to England, where before long she was married. The marriage did not turn out a happy one, and Mrs. HOWARD returned to Paris. There is no doubt that this lady had the character of being very clever, und of advising Louis NAPOLEON at the desperate crisis in his fate in such a manner as, when acted on, led ultimately to his elevation to the French throne. Nor long since it was announced that the Emperor was in the habit of leaving Complegne late at night by special train, and appearing in Paris; it now appears that Mrs. HOWARD is the attraction, and that alter a lapse of years she hag resumed her sway over Louis NAPOLEON's mine, and is once more his counselor-in-chief.

During the fitting out of the iron-clads, our people were roused up to the highest pitch of excitement, and even the remotest western communities, as well as the commercial sea-border, felt that an open war could hardly be worse for us than this secret piratical warfare waged from British ports. Mr. SEWARD, in his remarkably bold and spirited dispatch of July 11, only spoke the universal popular judgment, when he said the Confederate pirates, under the British flag, should be treated as if they were public enemies, and that all damages inflicted by them must be indemnified by the British Government. The very distinct threat accompanying this expression was justified by the feelings and reason of the whole nation; that is that the pirates should be considered as British cruisers and pursued into British ports by the naval forces of the United States. Nothing was possibly left to us, consistently with our national dignity, but this summary proceeding, which would have been tantamount to a declaration of war with Great Britain. With the six fast and powerful iron-clads afloat on the ocean, receiving supplies and coal from English colonial ports, our commerce would have been almost ruined, our ports open to attack, and the blockade often interrupted. A general naval war with England could scarcely have been worse, while the opportunity for reprisals and plunder on every sea would have been incalculably greater.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Dangers Escaped Our Relations With England.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Dangers Escaped Our Relations With England.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/38936519-7b20-5816-a116-5364beb84170,716,nyt://article/38936519-7b20-5816-a116-5364beb84170,

It will be remembered that the original measure concerning confiscation, which passed Congress eighteen months ago, made a general sweep of the property of rebels, both real and personal, and for all time. The President returned the bill with objections against that clause making confiscation of real estate extend beyond the lifetime of the traitor, because of its doubtful constitutionality. The clause was modified, so as to confine the confiscation to the life interest; and in that shape became a law. A strong effort is now being made to restore the clause to its original shape, so as to make the confiscation permanent. The matter has become one of immediate practical importance. A large amount of real estate, belonging to rebels, is now in the hands of the Government, and in justice to the National Treasury, as well as to the neglected property itself, some disposition must be made of it. But if anything more than a life interest is to be transferred, new legislation is necessary before the sale.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Permanent Confiscation.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Permanent Confiscation.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-23 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/78eab825-4367-5446-9448-908afe32cb88,1070,nyt://article/78eab825-4367-5446-9448-908afe32cb88,

The room was still decorated with its Christmas greens and flags. Mr. HALLIDAY, the Superintendent, acted as chairman, and several members of his family constituted a quartette choir which, with a piano accompaniment, led the performance. The music included instrumental solos, comic songs, chorus songs, &c., which were rendered with much spirit and success. But the most interesting part of the performance was that of the children. Two of the little girls sang several duets with remarkable truth and case. The whole of them joined with most editing and vigorous enthusiasm in the choruses, and always save their laughter and applause with ready from at the right points. The little folks were under excellent di[???] their childish chat and movements instantly ceasing at the signal of the Superientendent. Perhaps the most thoroughly appreciated of all the exercises was the final one, the distribution of a great basset of New Year's cake, by the Kindness of a good friend of the institution. The musical exercises were varied with a curious callisthenic performance during which the twinkling fingers and waving arms of the children, keeping time above their heads, produced singular effect. Such an exhibition of good manners and musical feeling and attainments by the children of this locality, is a powerful testimony to the great value and good management of the House of industry, as conducted by Mr. HALLIDAY. Among the friends present was Capt. FLETORES of the fifteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, one of four brothers, all soldiers, of whom one was wounded at Ball's Bluff, one killed at Antietam and one killed at Gettysburgh; while the Captain himself was shot through both cheeks at the latter place and left for dead on the field.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/04612a81-4cb7-5b39-b84d-f12eeea6145a,1206,nyt://article/04612a81-4cb7-5b39-b84d-f12eeea6145a,

Chesapeake Case; The Delay at Halifax,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/24/archives/the-case-of-the-chesapeake.html,Chesapeake Case; The Delay at Halifax,"-We had hoped before this that the case of the steamer Chesapeake, before the Admiralty Court at Halifax, might have come to some conclusion. The case was adjourned till last Wednesday, but was then from some of the multifarious causes of the law's delay, postponed still further. There can, however, be no doubt as to what will be the ultimate result of the case. The intimation given by the Judge some time ago, that under the facts before him he should treat the case as one of piracy, was a very strong one, and it is also quite plain that the Court will not lend any countenance to that feeling which led some of the citizens of Halifax to sympathize with, and even to aid, the villains who had run away with the vessel. He referred to them as men who had ""violated the proclamation of neutrality,"" who had ""grossly and wilfully, and stealthily"" violated the rights of neutral territory, and violently resisted officers seeking to execute process, and were then fugitives from justice. No Court would speak thus, if it were not determined to pass upon the case in accordance with the rules and acquirements of justice, and without reference to any false public feeling in favor of the men -- and certainly it should be so. Where, of all[???] places, should such an outrageous act of violence be frowned upon, if not in an Admiralty Court, the Court which administers the law of the sea, and has especial guardianship of the rights and immunities of peaceful navigators?",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE CASE OF THE CHESAPEAKE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE CASE OF THE CHESAPEAKE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'PIRACY', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/3a180f82-0cf8-5404-89a6-8ba4542f8f76,259,nyt://article/3a180f82-0cf8-5404-89a6-8ba4542f8f76,

They may almost be enumerated sin a breath; but a place hardly second in public estimation and actual usefulness is always open to men of average intelligence who, with taste, leisure and research, publish the results of their investigation of any special period of its annals. To this class, by far the larger proportion of the standard histories that fill our shelves belong -- as Lord MAHON's England, TYTLER's History of Scotland, ALISON's EUROPE, MERIVALE's Roman Emperors, and others; books that the world could not well afford to lose, but which have certainly been produced without the exercise of those higher qualities of mind that go to make up the ideal historian. So voluminous have become the original authorities for every period of recent history since the growth for the modern rage for printing State papers, correspondence, and all the documentary material on which the narration of facts is founded -- so wide a range has ethnology and arch�ology given to the studies of classic times, that the entire history of a country or State becomes too serious a task to be performed by one man, and the Monograph, devoted to the illustration of a particular reign or period, will undoubtedly be the prevailing form for future writers of history.",,2,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEW BOOKS.; HISTORY OF CHARLES THE BOLD, DUKE OF BURGUNDY.

There are peculiar obstacles also in the teaching of young children, from the fact that children's minds work so much through their senses, while our common systems are so much addressed to their memory and abstract powers. Then, the English language is a dreadful undertaking in itself, for a child, there being so little analogp and so many exceptions and irregularities in its construction. Learning the letters has no connection with the sound of them; spelling has scarcely any relation with reading, and the sound of one word is very little guide to another, spelt exactly alike. When the child's mind reaches such a study as geography the whole subject of a map is a mystery to it; the relation of the points of compass on a diagram and the points in the streets about him being en exceedingly difficult subject to grasp at first. ""Definitions,"" of course, are the last conquest of even a mature mind, and as they are usually taught in primary schools, they are a perfect absurdity.

The sole condition attached to the grant of these valuable franchises is that the fares shall not be over five cents. There is not one word about the number of cars to be run, the number of seats they are to contain, the number of passengers who may be crammed into them, or, in fact, a single restriction or proviso as against the companies. The only provisos in the charters are directed against the Mayor and Common Council, with the view of giving the companies the complete and uninterrupted monopoly of the tracks. The pending attempt to assert the doctrine that the rails may be used by the public has probably suggested some of these precautions. At all events, as the matter stands, these companies bid fair to get complete possession of most of the streets on the east side of the town, driving off all other public conveyances, and rendering the use of private carriages increasingly difficult and dangerous, and upon condition that they shall carry people in any posture they please, for five cents a head.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'New City Railroads.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'New City Railroads.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/dd17a778-4478-5cca-82d2-46a603d4ef78,906,nyt://article/dd17a778-4478-5cca-82d2-46a603d4ef78,

Anglo-Maorian War,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/24/archives/the-anglomaorian-war.html,Anglo-Maorian War,"Judging from the comments of the British press on our American campaigns, one would suppose that, in war, a General had only to find out his enemy, and fight him; but it appears from the way in which the British themselves have been carrying on war in New-Zealand that this off-hand mode of conducting military operations is not at all times desirable. For months Gen. CAMERON has been encamped, with a strong force, almost within sight of the Maorian position at Mere-mere, yet he has not, until now, once ventured to assail it. On the contrary, instead of making a grand effort to crush the main body of the enemy, and to end the conflict by a single blow, he has been converting his troops into guerrilla bands and training them to combat the natives with their own weapons. This style of strategy may prove more effective against the Maorics than a more imposing system; but, though great things ate expected from it, recent occurrences rather seem to indicate that the anticipation has not hitherto been realized. The events of the Fall would, in fact, be hardly deserving of notice, did they not tend to illustrate the efficacy of the bushwhacking system alluded to. The organization of what are termed ""flying columns,"" whose duty it is to scour the country in detached bodies, and to cut off marauding parties of Maorics, has certainly not deterred the natives from ""planting ambuscades"" and surprising the troops. On the 2d of September, for instance, an outlying picket from the Queen's Redoubt -- Gen. CAMRRON's Headquarters -- consisting of sixty of the Royal Irish, under Lieut. DAWSON, were suddenly attacked in the rear by a party of Maorics, and though the soldiers charged, repulsed, and pursued them to a considerable distance, still, on returning to their original position, they were assailed by another party, and had not Capt. LE POER FRENCH, of the Fortieth, come to their assistance, they might have been compelled to retreat. On the 7th of the same month, a yet more striking illustration of the boldness of the natives, and of the supineness of the ""flying columns,"" occurred near Cameron-town. An escort, conveying provisions and military stores to the camp in canoes, was fired on by a large body of Maorics near the above-named place; three Europeans and two aboriginal loyalists were killed, and both the canoes and their cargoes fell into the hands of the victors. This, however, is not the Worst. The firing attracted the attention of the commander of a neighboring redoubt, who dispatched fifty men in the rescue. On approaching the Maorian ambuscade, they charged, but were met by so sharp a fire that they had to give ground, leaving the Captain and three privates dead, and a number wounded. Nor is it improbable that the whole detachment would have been slaughtered, had it not been for the gallantry of a Sergeant, named MCKENNA, who rallied the men, and, at their head, forced his way through the thick of their assailants with the loss of only one of his band.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Anglo-Maorian War.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-24 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ed6f7664-4406-5562-bec8-326988cd2c32,800,nyt://article/ed6f7664-4406-5562-bec8-326988cd2c32,

London Times on Federal Affairs,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/25/archives/the-london-times-and-federal-affairs.html,London Times on Federal Affairs,"In an article printed Jan. 5, the London Times sets forth, in its best style of Pro-Slavery grumbling, the alleged facts which convince it that the war is apparently interminable, and that the situation of affairs at the close of 1863 proves that no progress at all is made toward its conclusion. ""It is evident,"" remarks the seer, ""that the Fedeeral possession of Eastern Tennessee, even if it can be maintained, will not bring the war nearer to a conclusion."" The Richmond papers are of a different opinion, as is Mr. JEFFERSON DAVIS. These think East Tennessee the key to the whole military position, because they know it admits the holder into any one of their remaining States, unless they can keep the door shut by sheer superiority of force. ""The blockade of the Southern coast,"" snarls this rheumatic Giant Grim of the press, ""does not deprive the people of an ample supply of imported articles."" Here, again, the Richmond prices current tell a very different story. 'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view. Those who live inside of the celebrated Southern Confederacy are of opinion that imported articles are most awkwardly scarce. Mr. DAVIS, for instance, in his last message, intimates that Wilmington is the only port left open at all, and that that is in danger of being closed. ""Goods to the value of a million dollars arrive in Wilmington every four-and-twenty hours,"" avers the dissatisfied London giant. Of a million rebel dollars possibly. These are worth, delivered in New-York, from six to eight cents a pound avoirdupois to work over. But surely the Times is moderate. Why does it not repeat the last rebel report on this side that steamers were running into Wilmington twenty-three in one night? Why strain at a gnat? But most awful of all is the final groan of the Times over the expense at which ""abolition"" is prosecuted. These are its words:",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE LONDON TIMES AND FEDERAL AFFAIRS', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE LONDON TIMES AND FEDERAL AFFAIRS', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/2290bba1-c76b-5071-b4c0-b73f9e8d4643,590,nyt://article/2290bba1-c76b-5071-b4c0-b73f9e8d4643,

Davis Proposed; Condition of the","Toward the conclusion of every war there are indications which announce the ability of a nation to carry on hostilities with the force of positive demonstration; and no concealment of facts, or falsification of events in official documents, can hide the condition of a country thus circumstanced. Everything from the South indicates a speedy termination of the rebellion. The population is exhausted by a war that has not accomplished a single object for which it was commenced. Everywhere its armies have been driven back by the steady advance of the Federal forces. They have lost the Mississippi, and the States of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and a large portion of Virginia and Louisiana. Their armies are everywhere on the defensive. The people are suffering for the necessaries of life; their ports are blockaded, their currency worthless, and the population insufficient even for the purposes of a defensive war. Above all, the spirits of the soldiers are no longer hopeful. The people are beginning to grumble. Not long since Gen. MAGRUDER advised his men to hang every one who hinted that ""this was a poor man's war for the rich man's benefit."" The message of JEFFERSON DAVIS to his rebel Congress, and the reports of his Cabinet officers, admit by their despondency of tone, and the desperate measures they advise, the hopelessness of their situation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Condition of the South.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Condition of the South.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'SOUTH', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/5cd39b69-99ac-578b-9edb-76d3be77bfa4,1039,nyt://article/5cd39b69-99ac-578b-9edb-76d3be77bfa4,

We would premise, however, that it neither was nor is our intention to dogmatise as to the absolute value of the 15-inch smoothbore as compared with the 8-inch rifle. Each has beyond a doubt qualities that render it more effective for special work than the other. Nor do we claim that either type of gun should be used in the armament of the monitors to the exclusion of the other. In fact, what we have complained of, and still complain of, is that the bureau of ordnance and construction is doing this very thing, as in the case of several of the new monitors confining their armament to the 15-inch smooth-bore, in face of the demonstrated superiority of the heavy rifle for the kind of work which the iron-clads are intended to perform in Charleston harbor.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Armament of the Monitors.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Armament of the Monitors.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-25 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6b5e2b67-2c97-58d4-8a90-553feb449dba,678,nyt://article/6b5e2b67-2c97-58d4-8a90-553feb449dba,

This point has been repeatedly pressed by Mr. ADAMS throughout his correspondence with Earl RUSSELL, and that it was manifestly felt and found a difficult one to get over, is plain from the fact that it is not alluded to in Earl RUSSELL's letter of Dec. 19, 1862, in which the English side of the case is argued very fully. He meets the question of the furnishing the ship herself by the argument, such as it is, that there is no difference between a ship and a cannon, and that both the United States and the rebels have bought arms in England; and he argues very strenuously that the sarling of the vessel was ""in spite of earnest endeavors made to enforce the law.""

"About a week ago, an account was given in these columns of a certain Rockaway Captain, commanding a sloop, who had induced a number of South-street merchants to loads his vessel with articles contraband of war for the purpose of running the blockade into Eastern Virginia, instead of which he ran into Rockaway, and there disposed of the goods on his own account. At least, so ran the rumor. But it now appears that Surveyor Andrews had an eye upon this sloop, and detailed some special officers to watch her, who, as the vessel slipped her moorings one dark night, and set sail without a permit from Marshal Murray, gave chase, and after a tedious search, found her at Northwest Inlet, Far Rockaway, where she lay, half filled with water and sand, and completely ice-bound. Upon inquiry, the officers found that the vessel had just touched at Near Rockaway, where she had discharged her cargo; and the Captain had disposed of the most salable portion of the cargo and pocketed the proceeds. The remainder is now in the possession of the Sheriff of Queens County, but how or why he should attach it has not been made plain.

JEFF DAVIS' steward and chambermaid are reported to have arrived at that place direct from Richmond. About a year ago, when the rebel military authorities were impressing all the horses they could find in Virginia, Mr. DAVIS' coachman made his advent in Washington, perhaps because he found his occupation gone ; and the supposition is certainly reasonable that his ebony cola borers have followed his example for the same sufficient reason. The scarcity of provisions at Richmond has unquestionably reduced the larder of the head rebel to an exceedingly lean condition. What need, therefore, of a steward? And as it is authentically rumored that Richmond is even now in process of abandonment, what does JEFF DAVIS want of a chambermaid? Or, perhaps, with the proverbial sagacity of her class, this slave woman has forecast the fearful storm which is so soon to turn her former master out of his house and home, and has deserted his falling fortunes in time to achieve her own salvation.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'A DESERTED MONARCH.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A DESERTED MONARCH.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DAVIS, JEFFERSON', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ebf4d9e7-0b20-559d-a7df-45da5e523eeb,259,nyt://article/ebf4d9e7-0b20-559d-a7df-45da5e523eeb,
Report of Battle of Antietam,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/26/archives/the-battle-of-antietam.html,Report of Battle of Antietam,"-At last we have that section of Gen. McCLELLAN's report which gives the history of the battle of Antietam. It attempts an explanation of the failure to follow up LEE after the disastrous defeat which was there administered to him; but, with a whole year devoted to the task, Gen. McCLELLAN has failed to construct a defenses which the public will pronounce impregnable. He states that ""the troops were greatly overcome by the fatigue and exhaustion attendant upon the battle of Sept. 17, together with the severe marches they had previously executed. Did any army ever fight a great battle, extending through one day, without becoming fatigued and exhausted? Yet there are numerous instances on record of partial victories having been triumphantly completed after two and even after several days' fighting. Then is there any reason to believe that LEE's beaten and dispirited troops were any less fatigued and exhausted than our own victorious men ? That excuse would more than have justified ROSECRANS in abandoning the field and the victory to BRAGG after the first day's bloody repulse at Murfreesboro. It is stated, too, that on the right, HOOKER's corps and one division of SUMMER's, had been driven back with heavy loss, and in disorder, and the troops there were consequently not deemed in a proper condition to renew the attack. The heaviest fighting, however, would naturally have taken place on the left, as the first movement would have been to cut LEE off from the Potomac; and Gen. McCLELLAN virtually acknowledges that this wing of the army was in good condition, when he states that only the new troops attached to it had their morale impaired by a repulse late in the day on Sept. 17.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/ee09bf96-15b0-5c1c-9f9b-3954928b0867,582,nyt://article/ee09bf96-15b0-5c1c-9f9b-3954928b0867,

Generally we are tempted by the pictures of modern artists, and we have in the collection which hangs on the south wall excellent specimens of DE LOOSE and KOEKOK but what are more worthy of remark are the older masters, some of whom are most creditably represented in the sixty-eight pictures which we are told form the gallery of a connoisseur. Thus the ""Poisson,"" the ""Agostino-car-acci,"" a remarkably fine specimen; the ""Jouvenets,"" the ""Berghem,"" and ""Puerto de Cordova,"" stand prominently forth. The ""Sebastian Gomez,"" and ""St. Catharine,"" with the ""Rosa de Tivoli"" by its side, attracts an all who enter the room. Even for the lounger the visit is not thrown away. For many of these pictures, doubtless, there will be a sharp competition among collectors on the night of sale.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Fine Arts.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Fine Arts.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-26 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/fee6d410-dff2-5fed-88cd-911c78242fa5,189,nyt://article/fee6d410-dff2-5fed-88cd-911c78242fa5,

We are pushed to the conviction that a lesson of this kind is not entirely unneeded at this moment; and the point of the argument bears not so much on any special military task before us, as on the general aspect of the war as a whole. It should be sufficient consolation to every lover of his country that we can at last see our way to ultimate victory; that with adequate effort on our part the rebellion is doomed to destruction; and that even those foreign on-lookers who have been most sceptical as to the possibility of the conquest of the South, are at length compelled to confess that the military problem is on the fair way of solution. This high thought, we say, should be of itself a sufficient inspiration, without the need of any of the artificial stimulants derived from popular illusions and unfounded hopes. It should, in fact, rather have the effect of causing us to look coolly and dispassionately at the problem and all the elements that enter into the problem, to the end that realizing fully all that remains to be done, we may the more resolutely bend our energies to its accomplishment.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Probable Rebel Movements in the Spring Campaign.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Probable Rebel Movements in the Spring Campaign.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/90e160a3-351f-542e-9d12-6a74a828efc4,1406,nyt://article/90e160a3-351f-542e-9d12-6a74a828efc4,

As no charges have been brought against these gentlemen, and as their letters have not the slightest public interest, we see no good end to be accomplished by their publication. The fact that they are private letters, written with the freedom and confidence usually supposed to belong to such correspondence, gives them, we are aware, a certain kind of interest in the eyes of the public.

Piracy; Diplomatic Correspondence on Confederate Cruisers,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/27/archives/indemnity-from-england-for-the-rebel-depredations-on-our-commerce.html,Piracy; Diplomatic Correspondence on Confederate Cruisers,"The volume of last year's diplomatic correspondence, just published, makes it plain that the English Government has changed not simply its action, but its principle, in respect to the stoppage of Confederate cruisers built and equipped in its ports. In a dispatch of Earl RUSSELL to Mr. ADAMS, in January, he declared, with a very high tone, ""the Government of this country respect the law. They do not seize upon property to the loss and damage of its owners, without proof that they are legally entitled to do so."" He insisted that strict and perfect legal proof of the ownership and destination of the vessels was necessary to justify any detention of them. It was because, in the very nature of the case, this absolute legal proof could not be given seasonably, if at all, that the Alabama, the Florida and the other pirates escaped. In the latter part of the year this assumption was modified. Earl RUSSELL indicates his readiness to proceed on reasonable presumptions, without strictly conclusive evidence, and to look to Parliament for indemnity if damage should thereby be done the innocent. In the early part of the year he put the onus of proving the illegality of the destination upon our Government; in the latter part of the year he put the onus of proving the legality of the destination on the vessel itself. Thus writing in September concerning the iron-clads he says: ""Instructions have been issued for preventing the departure of the iron-clad vessels in question from Liverpool until satisfactory evidence can be given as to their destination, or, at all events, until the inquiries which are now being prosecuted with a view to obtain such evidence shall have been brought to a conclusion."" Had this rule been recognized at the outset, not a single rebel cruiser would have ever left a British port.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Indemnity from England for the Rebel Depredations on Our Commerce.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Indemnity from England for the Rebel Depredations on Our Commerce.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-27 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/c7fa1188-a566-5350-89a1-956a3794df9f,1000,nyt://article/c7fa1188-a566-5350-89a1-956a3794df9f,

The War in,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/28/archives/the-war-in-germany.html,The War in,"The present news from Germany has certainly an alarming appearance. A Federal army of 60,000 men on the borders of Holstein, the Federal Committee reporting adversely to the Treaties of London of 1852, the Danish Government fortifying itself in Schleswig, and an English fleet reported to be fitting out for the Baltic, all these seem natural preliminaries to war. The German people are evidently intensely aroused, and determined to support the House of Augustenburg. England seems to be gradually forced into the position of upholding Denmark. There is obviously a limit beyond which the Danes cannot yield to German pressure, and still preserve their place as a European Power. The little stream of the Eider is probably now the only separating line between two angry and opposing armies, whose collision may awake all Europe to arms. Any accident might now kindle the universal conflagration so long predicted. Yet before concluding on the certainty of a great war in Europe, we must look more carefully into the inter-play of forces beneath these imposing external movements. It should be remembered, as we have so often repeated, that this movement in behalf of the Duchies is essentially an instinctive and general uprising of the great German people for the sake of national unity. It is this that creates so profound an excitement throughout Germany. But, as a necessity, the dynastic influences of Germany -- the Princes and Kings -- are opposed to German unity. Whatever unites the people, fetters them.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The War in Germany.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The War in Germany.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Germany', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/6a18de35-7905-572a-ae49-cde95239b391,658,nyt://article/6a18de35-7905-572a-ae49-cde95239b391,

Proposed Expulsion of,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/28/archives/the-proposed-expulsion-of-senator-davis.html,Proposed Expulsion of,"-- Without wishing to be at all intrusive, we venture to express the opinion that the Senate of the United States is wasting a good deal of valuable time and zeal in discussing the proposal to expel Mr. GARRETT DAVIS, of Kentucky, for words used in certain resolutions offered by him a few days since. The proposition seems to us to smack a good deal more of personal or party passion than of zeal for the public good. The power of expulsion doubtless belongs to the Senate, as to every other deliberative body; but it should never be used except under the most stringent necessity. If any Senator were known to be disloyal in sentiment, and treasonable in conduct, the public safety would demand his expulsion, even if proof of his crime were not clear enough to warrant his punishment. But to expel a Senator, and disfranchise his State, for words spoken in debate, would be an extraordinary stretch of power, only to be justified by the most extraordinary circumstances.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE PROPOSED EXPULSION OF SENATOR DAVIS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE PROPOSED EXPULSION OF SENATOR DAVIS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-28 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9109e3e0-dccc-59a2-81d1-4ac155044968,641,nyt://article/9109e3e0-dccc-59a2-81d1-4ac155044968,

In these days of prodigal expenditure of the national finances, this, in itself, is a gratifying financial fact. But connected with it is another tact of a still more gratifying character, that has in it a sharp bearing upon the question of what will be done with the negro. All the accounts sent to us. concur in saying that the late emancipated slaves of the chivalry the Sea Islands are the largest p[???] chasers of the confiscated lands. Tho who are most intimately acquainted wi the negroe's characteristics will not be surprised at this development of his ambition become a landed proprietor. To possess a his unquestionable domain the little hut an its small garden-plot, which formed his particular share of the plantation ""quarters, was Cudjo's sole joy in the days of his se[???]itude, and for this dole of domesticity h[???]elt that attachment which the househo[???] [???]abby shows for her wonted chimney-corne[???] Now that the authorities upon whom the du[???]as devolved of parceling out the lands an[???]rranging the terms of sale have been a[???]ains, with wise forethought, to let the freed[???]en know that they could purchase, ""for themselves and their heirs forever,"" the fee sim[???]le of these homesteads, guaranteed to them upon the faith of the President of the United States, in whose authority they have learned place implicit trust, the avidity which they [???]ve shown, in purchasing the soil, among [???]ose who know them, excites no wonder, people in the world care less to move their [???]miciles. They fix their household gods, be[???]ey never so humble, as far as posble beyond the reach of the iconoclasts. who, under guise of bettering their prospects, would rudely dash them in pieces. In proof of this, witness their response to the order of Major General HUNTER, who last Spring accorded them full privilege to leave the Department, offering them transportation whithersoever they would go. Scarcely a dozen of the 15,000 blacks whom the order reached availed themselves of its provisions, and those who did, without exception returned home again, satisfied that a change of residence would in no sense be advantageous. In view of these facts, how ridiculous is the old argument, which even now is sometimes advanced by ignorant or designing people, that when free the negroes would swarm to the North and offer their labor in competition with that of the whites! Take it all in all, the result of the sale of these South Carolina lands is of the most encouraging nature, affording, as it does, the first practical proof of the ability of the freed negro to secure for himself that material prosperity which, more than anything else, will raise him to a condition of self-dependence.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'NEGROES SECURING HOMESTEADS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'NEGROES SECURING HOMESTEADS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-29 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cc2621c0-d06f-5fdc-8508-2215543e54e8,498,nyt://article/cc2621c0-d06f-5fdc-8508-2215543e54e8,

One Hundred and Second Regiment; Honors to,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/30/archives/local-intelligence-lifescenes-among-the-city-poor-honors-to-the-one.html,One Hundred and Second Regiment; Honors to,"While so much is done for the soldier upon the battle-field. more attention is demanded to their families at home. All over our City are families living in cellars and garrets who are called daily to contend sharply with adversity, and many of them fall unknown and unhonored in the arms of death. Only a few weeks since a case came to light through the efforts of the Christian Alliance. In Eight-street, in a small back room of the fourth story of a tenement house, lived the widow of a soldier who fell in the battle of Fair Oaks. For over a year she slaved almost day and night on starvation prices, with her needle, to keep Her children from want, and to maintain a decree of respectability. She was a German woman, with all the feelings and susceptibilities that characterize those who have seen better days. One of her children, the eldest, a beautiful little girl of eleven Summers, was seized with disease about the heart. For months she lingered, while the mother slaved on, battling with poverty and affliction, until her own system gave evidence of wasting energies and crushed hopes: at last the little sufferer terminated her earthly existence, amid the sobs and tears of the mother and the surviving little sisters. Hours rolled a way, and no steps were taken to place the lifeless remains in its last resting-place. The mother was without means, without friends, and like Rachel of old, weeping and mourning, and would not be comforted because her child was not. Steps were at last taken for interment by the means provided by, the City. This, however, was horrifying to the mother, and lacerating to her already wounded spirits. A coffin, some ten or twelve inches too short, rough and untrimmed on the inside, with paint to green on the outside as to cover the hands of those who rough it; and then to have the little form crammed in, nailed down and borne off by a colored man, and put on board the night boat and carried away, no one knows where, was more than that sensitive, broken hearted mother could endure. If ever the tender sensibilities of humanity should be regarded, it is under such circumstances. It is a wonder the City does not perform this last act for the poor a little more in accordance with the dictates of humanity. The case mentioned was brought to the notice of the society above named; an undertaker was employed; the ladies aided in the little necessary arrangements, and after nearly two days the little one was placed in a neat trimmed coffin and brought to hope Chapel in a hearse, where services were conducted by Rev., Mr. Goss. The Sunday school children were assembled, and the scene was very impressive. The remains were borne to the Lutheran Grave-yard, the family following in a carriage, and placed in a grave where lay a brother previously interred. The expenses of the funeral amounted to $23 30, but it greatly contributed to the comfort of a sorrowing, broken-hearted mother. The surviving children are now constant attendants of the Christian Alliance Sunday-school, and the mother of the church services. Thus was the last act of kindness shown to a soldier's child, while the family is now often made comfortable by attention and sympathy. This is only one instance of scenes that are constantly occurring among us -- scenes hidden from the gaze of the world, but which wring the heart with bitterness of those who are exercised thereby.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.; Life-Scenes Among the City Poor.

An encounter of some magnitude is reported to have taken place on the 15th between two heavy bodies of the two armies at Danbridge, forty miles East of Knoxville. On the Union side was the whole cavalry corps under Gen. STURGIS, with a portion of the infantry under Gen. PARKE; and on the side of the rebels were the divisions of HOOD and BUSHROD JOHNSON, with HAMPTON's cavalry. The fight is reported to have gone adversely to us, causing a loss of a hundred and fifty men, till a cavalry charge turned the fortunes of the day, and enabled our forces to fall back to Knoxville. On the 19th, the cavalry force, with the corps of Gen. GORDON GRANGER, moved out to intercept LONGSTREET as far as possible from Knoxville, and a battle was momentarily expected at a point which the telegraph calls Lewisville, but which we take to be Sevierville, twenty-five or thirty miles from Knoxville.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Longstreet Before Knoxville Military Prospects in East Tennessee.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Longstreet Before Knoxville Military Prospects in East Tennessee.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Knoxville', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/68ea6cbd-1266-553d-b30a-a8d9c58224e3,665,nyt://article/68ea6cbd-1266-553d-b30a-a8d9c58224e3,

And Japan; Important News from,https://www.nytimes.com/1864/01/30/archives/important-news-from-china-and-japan.html,And Japan; Important News from,"The letters from our correspondents at Pekin and Yokohama, published this morning, will be read with interest. Civilization does not seem to be making much progress in these benighted Empires. The Chinese Mandarins have summarily dismissed the entire Anglo-Chinese fleet, which was sent out with so much parade to aid in the suppression of the Taiping rebellion -- ships, officers and all to go home, and the ships to be sold to pay the expenses of the expedition. The causes of this action are not fully explained, but it is undoubtedly induced by a fear on the part of the Chinese authorities that such a strong allied force might not only crush the Taipings, but the Mandarins also -- a fear, of course, purely imaginary. So they TUB the risk of prolonging the rebellion indefinitely, rather than accept the strong aid of the British Government, and have it done with at once. The British Minister was at first disposed to regard this action as a breach of faith, but subsequent investigation by our Minister, Mr. BURLINGAME, convinced the former that the Chinese had really acted in good faith, and that their envoy to England had exceeded his instructions. Japanese matters do not promise further difficulties. The Damios evidently fear war since the fight at Kagesima, and Prince SATSUMA had promised indemnity to the extent of $100,000, and that vigorous efforts should be made to bring the murderers of Mr. RICHARDSON to justice. But these things are only promised, and our next letter may bring us news that these fickle-minded barbarians have changed their purposes and are again as perverse as ever.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'IMPORTANT NEWS FROM CHINA AND JAPAN.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'IMPORTANT NEWS FROM CHINA AND JAPAN.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'China', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-30 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/b930d6d7-988f-5aa8-bd9a-6fc611369328,271,nyt://article/b930d6d7-988f-5aa8-bd9a-6fc611369328,

He held that there could be no security of the Union without it -- that the stronger section would exercise its power over the weaker, so as to make perpetual contention. His proposed safeguard was to maintain a perfect sectional equality in the Senate by never admitting new States except by the pair, one Northern and one Southern. For a long time there was, in fact, a general recognition that this was desirable, and the balance was preserved, until the immense progress of the Northwest made it no longer practicable.

Of a more serious cast are ""Genius,"" by BROWNLEE BROWN, the opening paper; and ""The Relation of Art to Nature."" a valuable contribution to the Philosophy of Art, illustrating the proper connection of painting and sculpture with actual nature and the ideal, by a survey of their progress from the days of the Greeks to the great masters of early Christian art. The author is J. ELIOT CABOT, who will complete the subject in another article. ""The Convulsionists of St. Medard"" is a careful paper on a very disagreeable incident in the Jansenist controversy in France, It is treated by R. DALE OWEN in relation to the general question of the power of mind over the body. ""Annesley Hall and Newstead Abbey"" adds little or nothing to the usual tourist's record. ""Bryant"" is a critical estimate, executed with taste and judgment, of the poet, by GEORGE S. HILLARD. The articles bearing on present events are ""Northern Invasions."" by EDWARD EVERETT HALE, and a stirring Lyric by Dr. HOLMES, ""The Last Charge,"" arousing all to the necessity of a grand and final effort "" for country, for freedom, for honor, for life,"" that shall settle the reeling giant of rebellion with ""one blow in his forehead.""

Value of Stock Insured,"William Tucker vs. The Mechanics' Fire Insurance Company; The Same vs. The New-York Fire and Marine Insurance Company; The Same vs. The Jefferson Fire Insurance Company; The Same vs. The Clinton Fire Insurance Company; The Same vs. The Peoples' Fire Insurance Company. The plaintiff in the above cases insured the stock and fixtures of his store, No. 325 Pennsylvania-avenue, upon policies of $5,000 each in each of the above Companies, defendants in this action. The stock and fixtures were worth $27,400, and the whole amount of insurance was $25,000. On the 7th of April, 1862, the store burned down, and the entire stock was destroyed by fire. The plaintiff notified the Companies of the loss and demanded payment of the amount insured. After the receipt of this notification, Thomas Morrill, the President of the Jefferson Insurance Company, came on to Washington, and announced to plaintiff that he came to investigate the matter of the fires, that he was his friend and advised him to settle with the insurance companies and with his creditors. Plaintiff refused, stating that he intended to pay his creditors in full. Morrill went back to New-York, and the insurance companies refused to pay on the policies, alleging as a reason that the stock in the store at the time of the fire had been reduced in value and amount by sales and other causes, and that it was not worth the sum for which it was insured. The plaintiff swears that it was worth $27,400, and brings this suit against the companies upon the respective policies. The evidence of Thomas Morrill, President of the Jefferson Fire Insurance Company, showed a curious agreement between himself, on the part of the insurance companies, and a detective named Allen, whom he employed in Washington to hunt up evidence against Mr. Tucker. He swears that he arranged to give Allen $250, and agreed to give him a contingent fee of $1,000 if a settlement could be effected with plaintiff for $6,000, and another $1,000 it a verdict could be obtained against Mr. Tucker for fraud. This Allan was also sworn as a witness, but his testimony is not yet taken. The case has occupied the attention of the Court for several days, and will be on all next week, the term of the Court having been extended until the second Monday in February for the purpose of finishing it. It has attracted considerable attention from the high standing of the plaintiff and the large interest at stake.",,6,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'LAW REPORTS.; Action for Losses on Policy of Insurance Questions of Value of Stock Insured.

His diplomatic and administrative career for the last year, it will be remembered, has not been especially brilliant. The Mexican War, though it has maintained the honor of the French arms, is evidently not considered either a gain or a success in France. The French are indifferent to such distant conquests, and they dread the possible complications and expense of life and means which they may entail. On the question much nearer to their heart, the Polish, they have beheld their Emperor boldly snubbed by the Russian diplomats and the traditional position of France, as the defender of Poland, ingloriously abandoned. Still another effort to become the arbiter of Europe, by invoking a European Congress, has been quietly brought to nought by the opposition of England, and French diplomacy is again defeated. Such defeats as these are dangerous to any French ruler, and above all to one who rests, as does NAPOLEON, on the prestige of success. Still more, the Budget is presenting alarming features, and a constitutional opposition are arising who thus far confine themselves to such safe and definite subjects as the figures of the tax and the deficit, but who may become dangerous to an absolute Emperor in the future.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Policy of France to Europe.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Policy of France to Europe.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'France', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/411cfe90-3044-5c04-94bf-27731c6e0264,826,nyt://article/411cfe90-3044-5c04-94bf-27731c6e0264,

The military plans of the rebels develop themselves slowly, and thus far the engagements that have taken place have been confined to the cavalry of the two armies. Gen. FOSTER reports an encounter between our forces and the enemy's cavalry on the 27th, near Sevierville, which resulted in a complete victory to the Union side. The locality of the fight indicates that LONGSTREET is still making for Knoxville, though his approach has not been as rapid as might have been expected. Both the cavalry fights that have thus far marked the approach of LONGSTREET have been decidedly to the disadvantage of the rebels, and justify what we have already known of the superiority of our Western troopers to the rebel cavalry. We fear, however, that the fate of East Tennessee will be decided, not by cavalry fights, but by heavy battalions of infantry. The best hope we can safely indulge is that the approach of LONGSTREET will be obstructed with as much skill and energy as seems to have thus far characterized the conduct of Gen. FOSTER; and if so, there is good reason to believe that the reinforcements which have already been forwarded to Knoxville will have reached their destination. It is encouraging that the Government seems to be fully alive to the critical character of the situation in that region, and is taking active measures to add all the force that may be needed to make it secure beyond a doubt.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'THE MILITARY SITUATION IN EAST TENNESSEE.; SEE.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'THE MILITARY SITUATION IN EAST TENNESSEE.; SEE.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/76413868-11d3-58eb-b1a5-6acbba049794,268,nyt://article/76413868-11d3-58eb-b1a5-6acbba049794,

It was announced as such, and performed to crowded houses; but when the author modestly suggested payment, it was at first derided, and then refused, except as to a small sum paid on account, which the defendant pleads was in-ended to be in full.

A severe fight occurred on Friday night in a liquorstore in Water-street, which was subsequently adjourned to the street, and resulted in the death of a man named ALBERT COLEMAN. It appears that deceased was with some friends drinking in some of the saloons in Water-street, and that a man named DOYLE, an acquaintance of his, was also drinking in CHRISTY's saloon. While thus engaged, four men, named MCCLUSKEY, MEYERS, CHRISTHOFFER and one unknown came in, one of them assaulting DOYLE by striking him a powerful blow on the head. He ran into the street, followed by the assailant. In about ten minutes ALBERT COLEMAN came running back into the saloon, covered with blood, and exclaiming I am killed. An officer was called and arrested CHARLES MEYERS, but the others escaped. The wounded man was taken to the New-York Hospital, where he died. Coroner NAUMAN held an inquest upon the body, and the evidence shows that the parties had an encounter in the street, which resulted as above stated. The jury rendered a verdict that ""deceased came to his death by fracture of the skull by a blow inflicted by JOHN MCCLUSKEY, CHARLES MEYERS, or one of two others whose names are unknown to them. They further believe GEORGE CHRISTHOFFER to be an accessory after the fact."" MEYERS and CHRISTHOFFER, being the only ones in custody, were locked up. MEYERS says he is a boatman, 29 years of age, a native of Ireland and lives at No. 344 Water-street. He claims to be entirely innocent; says he was not present when deceased was clubbed, and that he never saw him until he saw him dead at the hospital. Deceased was a boatman 22 years of age, and a native of Canajoharie, Montgomery County, New-York.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'GENERAL CITY NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/89a901ef-3db4-5505-88cf-1ead2a804d32,2237,nyt://article/89a901ef-3db4-5505-88cf-1ead2a804d32,

The recent contracts for cleaning the streets of the Western District of Brooklyn were awarded to three or four men. The work in some of the wards is progressing during this fine weather; but in others the contractor appears to do little or nothing. Complaints in relation to the condition of the Tenth and Twelfth Wards have already been made to the Mayor, and special officers have been directed to ascertain the facts, from which it appears that two or three men, with a cart, are placed in locations which have not been cleaned for a year, and where the dirt is in some cases heaped up several feet high. With such a small force it will take another year to place a single Ward in decent condition. The Mayor expresses his determination to enforce the contracts, and with that view is ascertaining the condition in which the streets are in, so that he can compel the delinquents to do their duty. One of the Aldermen has already notified His Honor that if something was not done soon for his Ward he would order the work to be done, and make the expense a charge against the contractor.",,8,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'BROOKLYN NEWS.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",[],1864-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/9e2efa6a-3fd2-5a20-839f-fb029971a83f,461,nyt://article/9e2efa6a-3fd2-5a20-839f-fb029971a83f,

France, on the contrary, takes this Dano-German squabble coolly, and mindful of Earl RUSSELL's recent contumacy, evidently enjoys the alarm of England. NAPOLEON does not, indeed, absolutely refuse his assent to the conference in question, but he asks the British Government to explain the nature of the propositions to be discussed there, and has addressed a circular to the German States, in which he declares that if a conference be held, ""it must assume as its starting point the state of things now existing in Holstein, and must not be in opposition to the Federal Diet."" Hence it is plain that, though the French Emperor does not decline being a party to the project, he yet has no intention of supporting the views of England, or essaying to maintain intact the stipulations of the London Treaty. He means, beyond doubt, to espouse the cause of Germany, and to aim at harmonizing ""the duties of sovereigns bound by international conventions with the legitimate aspirations of the peoples. His Majesty cares not a cent for the pretensions of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Louderburg-Glucksburg, or the claims of King CHRISTIAN, and will propose that the problem should be solved, and peace secured by an appeal to the ballot-box. England, we know, has an inveterate objection to this mode of adjudication, and yet what more rational, humane or equitable agency could be employed? Let the people of the Duchies, who certainly have the deepest interest in the matter, decide for themselves.

We find a noticeable example of this in the answer of Earl RUSSELL to a letter of Mr. ADAMS of Nov. 20, 1862, in which he called the attention of the British Government to the depredations of the Alabama, and, after arguing the case, concluded with a request for redress of the injuries sustained by our merchants from that roving buccaneer.",,4,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'Responsibility of England for Rebel Depredations on our Commerce.', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Responsibility of England for Rebel Depredations on our Commerce.', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Great Britain', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Editorials', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",1864-01-31 05:00:00+00:00,article,,Archives,"{'original': '', 'person': [], 'organization': None}",Archives,nyt://article/cf003986-c888-5217-96cd-fe33b412fe3a,1301,nyt://article/cf003986-c888-5217-96cd-fe33b412fe3a,
